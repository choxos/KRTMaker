**Key Resource Table FAQs**

This document contains answers to common questions related to Key Resource Tables.

The [ASAP Open Science Policy](https://parkinsonsroadmap.org/open-science-policy/#) requires all datasets, code & software, protocols, and key lab materials be unambiguously identified in a manuscript. **ASAP recommends that ASAP-funded researchers complete a Key Resource Table (KRT) for every manuscript.**  

If you have additional questions, please see the [Key Resource Table FAQs](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1j0UroxoKuXaEsPzafeWJbWCp5K7FTqPcJSpNNAo8b7k/edit) or email the Open Science Team at [**openscience@parkinsonsroadmap.org**](mailto:openscience@parkinsonsroadmap.org) with the subject title: “Key Resource Table Question:...”.

# **Key Resource Table FAQ**

## **Can I use the Cell Press KRT format instead of the ASAP-recommended KRT format?** {#can-i-use-the-cell-press-krt-format-instead-of-the-asap-recommended-krt-format?}

If you are publishing in a Cell Press journal, you may use their KRT format in your publication. 

Nonetheless, when you submit your manuscript for compliance review, we ask that you send us the ASAP-formatted KRT in a .csv format. When publishing, you can edit your ASAP-formatted KRT to fit the Cell Press format. Note, [*Cell* does not require a Cell Press formatted KRT for initial submission](https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/journals/research/cell/methods/Methods_Guide_general-1678470557763.pdf).

The main difference between the ASAP and Cell KRT templates are: 

1. Our template includes columns for RESOURCE TYPE, NEW/REUSE, and ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

   2. Our template explicitly asks for protocols, re-used data, and newly-generated code.

## **I deposited multiple datasets at a single DOI. How should I present this info in my KRT?** {#i-deposited-multiple-datasets-at-a-single-doi.-how-should-i-present-this-info-in-my-krt?}

Include a row for each dataset. 

The IDENTIFIER column for all these rows would be the same DOI. By naming the dataset in the RESOURCE NAME column, and describing the dataset in the ADDITIONAL INFORMATION column (e.g., data for Figure 1A and 1B), you can differentiate the multiple datasets that were deposited at a single DOI. We also recommend you provide a thorough readme file at the DOI.

## **I deposited multiple analysis scripts / code at a single DOI. How should I present this info in my KRT?** {#i-deposited-multiple-analysis-scripts-/-code-at-a-single-doi.-how-should-i-present-this-info-in-my-krt?}

Follow the same recommendations outlined for the previous question regarding multiple datasets at a single DOI.

## **I registered a resource and am waiting for an organization to send me the identifier.  What do I enter for the RRID?** {#i-registered-a-resource-and-am-waiting-for-an-organization-to-send-me-the-identifier.-what-do-i-enter-for-the-rrid?}

In this case, enter “Identifier from *\[organization\]* pending” in the IDENTIFIER column. For example, “Identifier from Cellosaurus pending”. Ideally, you will have received the identifier by the time of publication.

## **The publisher won’t allow us to include our KRT as part of our main manuscript. Where should we deposit the KRT?** {#the-publisher-won’t-allow-us-to-include-our-krt-as-part-of-our-main-manuscript.-where-should-we-deposit-the-krt?}

In this case, deposit your KRT at Zenodo and cite the Zenodo DOI in your manuscript in the Data Availability section (or equivalent section).

## **My team already makes KRTs, but they're in a different format than the ASAP-recommended template. Do I have to change the format?** {#my-team-already-makes-krts,-but-they're-in-a-different-format-than-the-asap-recommended-template.-do-i-have-to-change-the-format?}

We recommend that you use the ASAP KRT format. We understand that there may be factors (e.g., field-specific standards) that impact KRT format. In any instance where you are unable to use the ASAP KRT format, please email [**openscience@parkinsonsroadmap.org**](mailto:openscience@parkinsonsroadmap.org) with the subject *“KRT Format”* to start a discussion. Regardless of the format, we require that both newly-generated and reused datasets, software/code, protocols, and lab materials appear in your table (If your study used that resource type).

## **Are KRTs required for compliance with ASAP’s Open Access Policy?**

As of October 1st, 2024, KRTs are required.

## **Our KRT includes RRIDs. Do RRIDs also need to appear in the manuscript text?** {#our-krt-includes-rrids.-do-rrids-also-need-to-appear-in-the-manuscript-text?}

If the KRT is included as a table in the manuscript, you may choose whether or not to also include RRIDs within the manuscript text. However, a reader must be able to unambiguously match each resource that appears in the manuscript text with the resource and RRID as they appear in the KRT.

If the KRT is not included in the manuscript (e.g., it is deposited to Zenodo), then we ask that you also include all RRIDs in the manuscript text.

We take this approach to ensure that RRIDs can serve two of their main purposes: (1)  Ensuring that each resource is unambiguously identifiable, and (2) Providing a machine-readable record of when resources are used. 

**Where to get more information?**

Please refer to the [ASAP KRT Guidance Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FCnqC3VpvLFPLcshLSkmGPtRIFfh70MR7KkrXi7IMX4/edit) for additional information. If the Guidance Document and this Key Resource Table FAQ do not answer your question, email us at [**openscience@parkinsonsroadmap.org**](mailto:openscience@parkinsonsroadmap.org) with the subject line that begins with “KRT question: ”.
