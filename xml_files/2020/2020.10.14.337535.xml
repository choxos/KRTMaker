<title>Summary</title>
<p id="P1">An effective vaccine to address the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an urgent public health priority<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Novel synthetic mRNA and vector-based vaccine technologies offer an expeditious development path alternative to traditional vaccine approaches. Here we describe the efforts to utilize an mRNA platform for rational design and evaluations of mRNA vaccine candidates based on Spike (S) glycoprotein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19. Several mRNA constructs expressing various structural conformations of S-protein, including wild type (WT), a pre-fusion stabilized mutant (2P), a furin cleavage-site mutant (GSAS) and a double mutant form (2P/GSAS), were tested in a preclinical animal model for their capacity to elicit neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). The lead 2P/GSAS candidate was further assessed in dose-ranging studies in mice and <italic>Cynomolgus</italic> macaques. The selected 2P/GSAS vaccine formulation, now designated MRT5500, elicited potent nAbs as measured in two types of neutralization assays. In addition, MRT5500 elicited T<sub>H</sub>1-biased responses in both mouse and non-human primate species, a result that helps to address a hypothetical concern regarding potential vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory diseases associated with T<sub>H</sub>2-biased responses. These data position MRT5500 as a viable vaccine candidate for clinical development against COVID-19.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">SARS-CoV-2, previously known as the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>, is a β-coronavirus with a yet-to-be defined zoonotic origin. The first cases of human infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were reported in December 2019 in China<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>, and later named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. In contrast to SARS-CoV-1 virus which caused an outbreak in 2002, SARS-CoV-2 has gained high capacity for human-to-human transmission and quickly spread worldwide. It has caused over 34 million cases of confirmed infection and more than 1,000,000 deaths in 188 countries (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus">https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus</ext-link>). An effective vaccine is urgently needed to address this global pandemic.</p>
<p id="P3">Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, and the viral spike (S) protein on the virion envelope is essential for infection and is the target for host antiviral antibodies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. The receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a metalloprotease that also serves as the receptor for SARS-CoV-1<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. Most of the COVID-19 vaccine candidates reported are focused on a pre-fusion-stabilized S protein, either as recombinant protein with adjuvant or delivered from viral vectors or as DNA or mRNA vaccines <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. The pre-fusion-stabilized version of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein contains two proline substitutions (2P), at amino acid positions 986 and 987, located near the apex of the central helix and heptad repeat 1<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. Structural studies reveal that the pre-fusion stabilized S closely resembles native S protein on the virion surface; a structure targeted by many reported effective neutralizing antibodies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. Moreover, the vaccine premises are based on the prior work of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 S proteins presented in pre-fusion conformations<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. The ability of S-2P-based vaccines to elicit neutralizing antibodies has been demonstrated <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">There is a unique feature of SARS-CoV-2 S protein which possesses a polybasic furin cleavage site at the junction of S1 and S2 subunits. This feature is believed to have emerged during viral transmission from zoonotic host to human<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>, and is key to SARS-CoV-2 high transmissibility in humans<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. Although robust SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lungs requires a multibasic cleavage site<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>, interestingly, both cleaved and uncleaved versions of S protein co-exist on virions purified from viral culture on Vero cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. Thus, it remains unclear how the cleavage provides an advantage for viral transmission. Also, from a vaccine design perspective, one may speculate that furin cleavage site may result in subtle conformational changes in the trimerized S protein, potentially favoring its interaction with ACE2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">These unanswered questions led us to design various forms of S protein constructs involving both 2P and cleavage site, referred to herein as GSAS mutations. These GSAS constructs were first evaluated for immunogenicity in mice. The 2P/GSAS S mRNA encapsulated in a cationic lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation, designated as MRT5500, was subsequently selected for further evaluation. Here we report the results of preclinical evaluation of MRT5500 in mice and non-human primates (NHPs). MRT5500 was administered twice via the intramuscular route (IM) at a three-week interval in both animal models. Results demonstrated that MRT5500 elicited potent neutralizing activity and a T<sub>H</sub>1-biased response in both species. The ability of this vaccine to induce both humoral and cell-mediated antiviral responses identifies MRT5500 as a promising clinical vaccine candidate.</p>

<title>Design and selection of mRNA constructs</title>
<p id="P6">SARS-CoV-2 S protein, a 1273 amino acid glycoprotein, is expressed and stabilized as a membrane anchored homo-trimer<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. The receptor binding domain (RBD) has been identified as the critical component to initiate virus attachment to ACE2, a cellular receptor for viral infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>. Interestingly, the RBD is present in both up and down configurations in the prefusion form of S protein, and the up position has been speculated as the prerequisite for interaction with ACE2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>. The furin cleavage at the S1/S2 boundary of SARS-CoV-2 S occurs during viral biosynthesis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. It is postulated that transition and adaptation to the human host resulted in the acquisition of a furin protease site in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is a unique feature discriminating this virus from SARS-CoV-1 and other SARS-related-CoVs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. Approximately 45% of the total S protein monomers presented within intact SARS-CoV-2 virions have been reported as cleaved at the furin cleavage site<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>; however, it is not clear which form is favored by the virus to facilitate the fusion process<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P7">The COVID-19 vaccine hypothesis has been centered around induction of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that either block the interaction of the RBD with ACE2, or that prevent the fusion process involving S protein transition from pre- to post-fusion conformation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. Although the pre-fusion conformation is known to be critical for eliciting a neutralizing response<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>, the impact of the furin cleavage site in eliciting neutralizing antibodies requires additional studies. To test the potential contribution of this site, we mutated the furin cleavage site, composed of the polybasic residues RRAR, to GSAS from amino acid position 682 to 685<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>. Four constructs were synthesized as mRNA to represent either wild type (WT), stabilized pre-fusion mutant (2P)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>, furin cleavage site mutant (GSAS) or a double mutant (2P/GSAS) of SARS-CoV-2 S gene. These constructs were transfected into a human cell line and their expression levels were verified by Western Blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). As expected, endogenous cleavage of WT and 2P constructs, but not GSAS or 2P/GSAS proteins, was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), which yielded a band of approximately 90 kDa representing S2.</p>
<p id="P8">In order to determine the potential impact of 2P and GSAS mutations on immunogenicity, we formulated each of the four mRNA constructs within a lipid nanoparticle (LNP), which has been designed for efficient delivery of mRNA vaccines<sup>39</sup>. BALB/c mice were administered two immunizations at a 0.4 µg dose of each of four formulations at a three-week interval. Binding antibody activities in the serum samples were assessed via Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). All four vaccines demonstrated similar levels of binding antibodies 14 days after the first vaccination, and the responses were further enhanced one week after the second dose at day (D) 28. On D35, the IgG geometric mean titers (GMTs) for WT, 2P, GSAS and 2P/GSAS groups were 184343, 200896, 379653 and 201080 respectively. There were no statistically significant differences among those GMT titers.</p>
<p id="P9">To understand the potential impact of these mutations on nAbs titers, we tested the ability of immune sera to neutralize the infectivity of GFP reporter pseudoviral particles (RVP) in HEK-293T cells stably over-expressing human ACE2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>. RVPs expressed antigenically correct SARS CoV-2 S protein and GFP reporter genes on lentiviral (HIV) core and were capable of a single round of infection. Pseudoviral neutralization assay (PsVNa) allowed the determination of serum dilution which can achieve 50% inhibition of RVP entry (ID50; see Materials and Methods). Contrary to binding antibodies which could be detected at D14 after the first immunization, the neutralizing antibody response could only be detected after the second immunization. Also noted, the spread of the nAb titers within each group were more pronounced when compared to binding antibody titers, with 95% confidence intervals overlapping each other. On D35, the GMTs for pseudoviral (PsV) nAb titers were 152 for WT, 195 for 2P, 1005 for GSAS and 354 for 2P/GSAS. The neutralizing potential of the GSAS variant was trending slightly higher than 2P/GSAS.</p>
<p id="P10">Another important observation is that ELISA titers were not consistently predictive of neutralizing titers by PsVNa. Some mice in the WT and 2P groups did not seroconvert in the neutralization assay but their endpoint ELISA titers were comparable to the other animals in the group which demonstrated neutralizing activity. We therefore placed greater emphasis on PsVNa titer for continuing candidate evaluation. Considering the trend towards higher PsVNa observed for the GSAS constructs as well as the expected importance of the pre-fusion conformation, we selected the double mutant 2P/GSAS/LNP formulation, referred to as MRT5500, for further preclinical evaluations.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Serological evaluations of MRT5500 in mice and NHPs</title>
<p id="P11">The selected MRT5500 formulation was evaluated in both mouse and NHP studies with a range of doses covering more than 10-fold titration. The hypothesis for this study is that S-specific antibodies blocking viral infection are key for protection, and our evaluation therefore focused on serological responses against SARS-CoV-2 S, with a particular emphasis on neutralizing titers post vaccination <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup>. Four dose levels in mice were assessed, ranging from 0.2 to 10 µg per dose. As expected, MRT5500 induced dose-dependent S-specific binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). PsVNa titers were detected in the higher dose groups (5 µg, 10 µg) after one vaccination, within the titers being more pronounced after the second vaccination at D21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The PsVNa GMTs were 534, 5232, 9370 and 7472 at D35 for the 0.2, 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 µg dose groups, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in PsV neutralization titers on D35 between 1, 5 and 10 µg groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 2</xref>), suggesting a dose-saturation effect beyond 1 µg in mice. We also demonstrated that the peak PsV titers (D35) in mice were significantly different from the titers observed in a panel of 93 convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">In NHPs, we evaluated three dose levels: 15, 45 or 135 µg per dose. After the first immunization, nearly all NHPs (10 out of 12) developed antibodies reactive to recombinant S protein in ELISA, and the titers were further enhanced after a second immunization at D35 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig.1</xref>) with all NHPs demonstrating high titers of nAbs. The neutralization potency was assessed by two methods: PsVNa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) and microneutralization (MN) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In both assays, a dose-dependent increase in neutralization titer was observed, with GMTs on D35 of 924 for 15 µg, 961 for 45 µg, and 2871 for 135 µg in PsVNa. The MN GMTs followed a similar trend, with titers of 555 for 15 µg, 719 for 45 µg and 1877 for the 135 µg group. Despite the observed trend towards higher titers with increasing dose, the differences between groups was not statistically significant for either MN or PsV neutralization titers.</p>
<p id="P13">Although we have used two assays to measure the neutralizing potency, the results from both assays were highly correlated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 1</xref>). Regardless of the dose level tested, D35 PsV and MN titers were approximately 130-fold higher than those of pre-immune animals. Furthermore, the observed PsV and MN titers were significantly higher from titers observed in a panel of 93 convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

<title>T-cell profiles of the selected mRNA formulation in NHPs</title>
<p id="P14">Vaccine associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) has been a safety concern for COVID-19 vaccines in development, although the concern at this stage is only a theoretical one<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. This phenomenon has been reported for whole-inactivated virus vaccines against measles and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which were tested in the 1960s (cit by <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>), and one of the disease hypotheses implicates the biased production of T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) by antigen-specific CD4 T cells. A similar association between a T<sub>H</sub>2 profile and disease enhancement has been reported for an inactivated SARS-CoV-1 vaccine in mice <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup>. Furthermore, less severe cases of SARS were associated with accelerated induction of T<sub>H</sub>1 cell responses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup>, whereas T<sub>H</sub>2-biased responses have been associated with enhancement of lung disease following infection in mice parenterally vaccinated with inactivated SARS-CoV viral vaccines<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup>. Similar phenomena have been observed in humans. For example, a SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular response was associated with severity of disease: recovered patients with mild COVID-19 illnesses demonstrated high levels of IFN-γ induced by SARS-Cov-2 antigens, while severe pneumonia patients showed significantly lower level of this cytokine<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
</sup>. Thus, it is important to understand the T cell profiles induced by MRT5500.</p>
<p id="P15">T cell cytokine responses were tested in NHPs three weeks after the second vaccination. Cytokines induced by restimulation with the pooled SARS CoV-2 S protein peptides were assesses in PBMCs on D42 by the IFN-γ (T<sub>H</sub>1 cytokine) and IL-13 (T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokine) ELISPOT assays. The majority of animals in three dose level groups tested (10 out of 12) demonstrated presence of IFN-γ secreting cells, ranging from two to over 100 spot-forming cells per million PBMCs. A dose-response was not observed as the animals in the lower and higher dose level groups showed comparable frequencies of IFN-γ secreting cells. In contrast, presence of IL-13 cytokine secreting cells was not detected in any of the groups tested and at any dose level, suggesting induction of a T<sub>H</sub>1-biased cellular responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). These data presented clear evidence for lack of T<sub>H</sub>2 response to S antigen following vaccination in NHPs.</p>
<p id="P16">Similar assessment of cellular immune responses was performed in immune splenocytes in BALB/C mice on D35. ELISPOT was conducted in the 5 and 10 µg dose groups in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>. Although BALB/c mice have strong tendency for T<sub>H</sub>2 biased immune responses, following restimulation with the S protein peptide pools splenocytes from the MRT5500 immunized mice secreted predominantly IFNɣ while IL-5 responses were marginal, suggesting considerable T<sub>H</sub>1 bias (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, MRT5500 vaccination elicited predominantly T<sub>H</sub>1-biased responses in both animal species.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P17">mRNA-based vaccine development provides a rapid pathway for effective evaluation of multiple vaccine construct designs which we employed for our initial evaluation of S antigen mRNA vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2. For any vaccine intended to generate antibody-mediated immunity, delivering a conformationally correct protein is critical<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Lessons have been learned from RSV F protein where the post-fusion form elicited poor neutralizing antibodies, albeit extremely immunogenic in humans<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup>, and the post-fusion form F antigen vaccine has failed to provide any protection against RSV infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
</sup>. Thus, our focus in this study was to identify mutations that could stabilize the pre-fusion form of S antigen upon expression. In contrast to the other S antigen mRNA vaccines under evaluations<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>, we have incorporated a unique mutation at cleavage site GSAS, in addition to 2P, which has enhanced features to lock the S protein in the pre-fusion form. There were two considerations for this design. First, it is not known whether 2P mutations alone, located at the apex of the central helix and heptad repeat 1, are sufficient for locking the S antigen in the pre-fusion form. Second, it has been hypothesized that cleavage of S antigen into S1 and S2 subunits is part of the transition from the pre-fusion to post-fusion form during viral entry<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. Thus, by blocking the furin cleavage site, we have added another layer for prevention of pre-fusion to post-fusion conversion.</p>
<p id="P18">The two GSAS containing mutants (GSAS and double mutant 2P/GSAS) resulted in nAb titers that trended higher than the WT and 2P analogues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). While the nAb levels from these two GSAS-containing antigens were not significantly different from one another, we believe there could be two explanations for this: first, the mutation on the furin cleavage site may alter S protein trafficking efficiency to the cell surface. Furin could be active in the trans-<italic>golgi</italic> network, cell surface or endosome in processing viral glycoproteins during viral maturation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>
</sup>. Thus, it is possible that blocking furin cleavage may have changed S protein trafficking from the ER to the cell surface. Although this hypothesis is unlikely, MERS and SARS, as well as other coronavirus S protein, have been reported to be missing a furin cleavage site, indicating that furin cleavage is not absolutely necessary for viral maturation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>. Nonetheless, additional investigation would be needed to further understand the effect of the furin cleavage site on viral morphogenesis and SARS-CoV-2 S protein trafficking. A second possibility, which is more likely, is that we tested the mRNA vaccines at a poorly differentiating dose level (0.4 µg/dose) in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Our results in a subsequent experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) confirmed that the saturation point for neutralizing antibody responses in mice was between 0.2 µg and 1 µg per dose. With these considerations, we selected the double mutant formulation, MRT5500, to favor the prefusion form. Our dose ranging studies in NHPs confirmed the potency of MRT5500 in eliciting neutralizing antibodies. Although the sample size of our experiment (4 animals per group) was not enough to discriminate between the dose regimens, it suggested the potential of MRT5500 vaccine candidate to elicit potent neutralizing antibodies in clinic.</p>
<p id="P19">The long-term durability of our vaccine candidates for COVID-19 across all modalities is still under investigation. As a novel vaccine platform, mRNA can drive efficient <italic>de novo</italic> antigen expression, which is expected to activate immune responses. However, it is unknown whether the transient nature of antigen expression is sufficient in driving adequate germinal center formation which is needed for effective expansion and maturation of antigen-specific B cells. Although an mRNA vaccine for cytomegalovirus gB has demonstrated sustained antibody responses in rabbits up to 20 weeks<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>
</sup>, the durability for S antigen mRNA remains an important focus for COVID-19 vaccine research. It should be noted that natural infection in COVID-19 patients, especially those of mild and asymptomatic cases, induce antibodies that decay rapidly in convalescent phase, with some drifting down to baseline within three months after diagnosis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>
</sup>. Additional preclinical studies are ongoing to further our understanding and characterization of MRT5500 and its immunological effects for applications towards COVID-19.</p>
<p id="P20">In summary, we have utilized mRNA technology for the rapid evaluation of vaccine candidates for COVID-19, and our results led to the selection of a double mutant candidate which has a better potential to preserve a pre-fusion conformation. The candidate MRT5500 has been shown to be immunogenic by eliciting potent neutralizing antibodies in mice and NHPs, and T<sub>H</sub>1-biased cellular immune responses. The candidate is positioned for further development in clinical studies as a vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19.</p>

(<bold>b</bold>) Serum antibodies reactive to S antigen and (<bold>c</bold>) serum neutralizing titers in mice immunized with mRNA vaccines. BALB/c female mice (n=8) were immunized at D0 and D21 with 0.4 µg of WT, 2P, GSA, 2P/GSAS mRNA vaccine formulations. Sera samples at indicated timepoints were tested for reactivity to recombinant S protein in ELISA or tested in a pseudovirus neutralization assay. The 50 % inhibitory dilution titers (ID<sub>50</sub>) were calculated as the reciprocal of the dilution that reduced the number of virus plaques in the test by 50%. Each dot represents an individual serum sample and the line represents the geometric mean with standard deviation for the group. the dotted line below for each panel represents the lower limit of assay readout.</p>
