Analyses of proteins such as primary receptors and co-receptors (co-factors), which are involved in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, will provide important clues to help control the virus. Here, we identified host cell membrane protein candidates present in proximity to the attachment sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, using proximity labeling and proteomic analysis. The identified proteins represent key candidate factors that may be required for viral entry. DPP4, Cadherin-17, and CD133 were found to co-localize with cell membrane-bound SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in Caco-2 cells and thus showed potential as candidate factors. The experimental infection with a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus indicated a 2-fold enhanced infectivity in the CD133-ACE2-coexpressing HEK293T cells compared to that in HEK293T cells expressing ACE-2 alone. The information and resources regarding these co-receptor labeling and analysis techniques could be utilized for the development of antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging viruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>Membrane protein</kwd><kwd>Virus entry</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus</kwd><kwd>Proximity proteomics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in Wuhan and now represents a global threat. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, and many of these coronaviruses have long been known to cause severe respiratory failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Therefore, it is inferred that cells within the respiratory organs are the growth sites for SARS-CoV-2 virions, and analyses of virus receptors within these host cells have been performed. In addition to its ability to infect respiratory organs, SARS-CoV-2 can also infect vascular endothelium and the intestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), which indicates the diverse nature of the viral receptors. In SARS-CoV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) and MERS-CoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), certain protease family proteins within host cells have been found to act as primary receptors or co-receptors (co-factors) for these viruses; in particular, ACE2 has been studied as a primary candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to target ACE2 and other cell surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Other membrane proteins involved in virus entry are also of importance in understanding disease pathogenesis. The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 have been reported as co-receptors involved in human immunodeficiency virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), and HLA class II receptors function as co-receptors in Epstein-Barr virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Researchers working on vaccine and antiviral agent development are interested in the role of viral co-receptors (co-factors), in addition to primary receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Host cell membrane proteins involved in SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry can be broadly considered as crucial key factors and therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, various host cell membrane proteins other than ACE2 have also been reported as factors that mediate viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>); however, the detailed mechanisms underlying their functions remain unknown. It is speculated that these factors are membrane proteins located in proximity to the viral attachment point (binding site of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) in the host cell membrane.</p><p id="P4">The proximity labeling method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) has recently been used to analyze the physiological protein interactions. We developed a simple physiological method, termed <underline>E</underline>nzyme-<underline>M</underline>ediated <underline>A</underline>ctivation of <underline>R</underline>adical <underline>S</underline>ource (EMARS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), that uses horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-induced radicals derived from arylazide or tyramide compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). The radicals produced through EMARS attack and form covalent bonds with the proteins in proximity to HRP [<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., radicals from arylazide: approximately 200–300 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>); from tyramide: approx. 20 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>)]. The labeled proteins can subsequently be analyzed using an antibody array and/or a typical proteome strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). The EMARS method has been applied for various studies on molecular complexes in the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Proximity labeling typically analyzes intracellular molecular interactions to provide a measure of the proximity between free proteins. In contrast, EMARS is a tool for analyzing proximity between molecules on the cell surface; this method facilitates the labeling of key factor proteins in proximity to the virus-binding protein on the cell membrane, at the initial stages of infection. Therefore, we speculated that this method would provide a useful tool for identifying key candidate molecules responsible for SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p id="P6">Herein, we identified protein molecules that exist in close proximity to virus spike proteins bound to host cells in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, using the EMARS method and proteomic analysis. The EMARS reaction was performed in A549 lung cancer cells and Caco-2 cells using the HRP-conjugated recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1-RBD). Caco-2 cells are a commonly used culture cell type that allow for efficient replication of SARS-CoV-2 virions. The labeled proteins identified as candidate membrane proteins were analyzed using proteomics technology. Following infection experiments using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (pSARS-CoV-2), we generated HEK293T cells coexpressing the identified candidate molecules, together with ACE2, and observed the effects of these candidate molecules on virus infection.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Preparation of a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein probe for use in the EMARS reaction</title><p id="P7">To perform an EMARS reaction, an EMARS probe with HRP conjugated to a given molecule that recognizes a target molecule is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). The HRP-conjugated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein corresponds to an EMARS probe in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">As ACE2 is listed as the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2, we examined the expression of ACE2 in Caco-2 and A549 cells. From western blot analysis, a clear band was observed at a molecular weight of approximately 100,000 Da in Caco-2 cells; however, this signal was faint in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The cells exhibited positive staining for ACE2 antibody, which demonstrated the presence of ACE2 in both cell lines; however, Caco-2 cells exhibited a higher expression of ACE2 than A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Additionally, Caco-2 cells exhibited strong staining of portions of the cell membrane, while A549 cells showed a homogeneous staining pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The spike protein used in this study was a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that is present in the S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 and possesses a mouse immunoglobulin Fc region (mFc) at the C-terminus (total 457 a. a.). We used the mFc sequence to conjugate HRP. We initially examined whether the spike protein binds to membrane receptors on Caco-2 and A549 cells. Caco-2 cells were treated with Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescent dye-conjugated monovalent spike proteins created using a commercial labeling kit, and labeling was then observed using a fluorescent microscope. We simultaneously prepared the sample that was created through incubation with intact spike protein-mFc, followed by incubation with anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 488. Both samples exhibited binding of spike protein-mFc to the cells; however, the latter two-step staining procedure was found to be more effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Based on these results, a method for EMARS in this study was adopted wherein the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was directly applied to living cells and then treated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Similar results were obtained using A549 cells; however, binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was weaker than that observed in Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>EMARS and proteomic analysis revealed numerous candidate proteins</title><p id="P10">The EMARS reaction was performed in these cells using the EMARS probe described above. Following the EMARS reaction, the labeled molecules were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels used for electrophoresis can be analyzed directly using a fluorescence image analyzer when the labeled molecules are present in large amounts; however, the bands for the EMARS sample prepared using the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could not be clearly detected. The labeled molecules were therefore observed with western blot analysis using the anti-fluorescein antibody. The EMARS reaction was first performed in Caco-2 cells using HRP-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B as the positive control, as this conjugate is known to bind to a lipid raft structure on the cell membrane and can subsequently label numerous cell surface proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We then performed the EMARS reaction, using the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in addition to negative control experiments. Although weak bands were observed in the negative control (treated with anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody alone; hereinafter referred to as spike [-] sample), the combination of both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody (hereinafter referred to as spike [+] sample) yielded significant bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). As the signal was weak, compared to that obtained using the cholera toxin probe, it was possible that certain specific cell membrane proteins were labeled in a limited manner in the samples prepared using the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein probe. For A549 cells, a number of labeled proteins were detected in the spike [+] sample; however, the band pattern was different from that obtained from Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P11">These labeled proteins were subjected to proteomic analysis. There was a possibility that identification may not be sufficiently achieved using mass spectrometry, as the number of labeled molecules was likely to be lesser than that obtained using the CTxB-HRP probe. Therefore, multiple independent experiments were performed (twice for Caco-2 cells and three times for A549 cells), and the samples were combined and used for analysis. Moreover, this experiment was performed in duplicate.</p><p id="P12">Spike [+] samples and spike [-] samples (used as the negative control) were both prepared from each cell line. For shotgun analysis using mass spectrometry, the labeled molecules were purified via immunoprecipitation with an anti-fluorescein antibody. A total of 181 (first MS analysis) and 315 (second MS analysis) proteins were detected in the spike [+] samples from Caco-2 cells, whereas 59 and 230 proteins were detected from the spike [-] samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting tables 1 and 2</xref>). A total of 184 and 263 proteins were detected in the spike [+] samples from A549 cells, and 186 and 150 proteins were detected from the spike [-] samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting tables 3 and 4</xref>). The molecules detected in the spike [-] sample may be proteins that were non-specifically adsorbed during the purification process. In particular, for unknown reasons, some spike [-] samples contained many suspected non-specific binding proteins. In this study, membrane proteins that were present in the spike [+] sample but not in the spike [-] sample, for each cell line, were preferentially categorized as the most likely candidates in this study. In Caco-2 cells, 65 types of cell surface membrane proteins, including the known SARS-CoV-2 host factors ACE2, DPP4, integrin, and CEACAM, were identified using combined data from duplicate experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting table 5</xref>). Among these candidates, we listed other less implicated proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as Cadherin 17 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In A549 cells, 18 types of membrane proteins, including known SARS-CoV-2 host factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting table 5</xref>), and less reported proteins, such as Contactin-1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), were identified.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The identified membrane proteins co-localized with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein</title><p id="P13">We next examined whether the identified membrane proteins co-localized with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bound to Caco-2 cell membrane. Caco-2 cells were treated with SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, followed by staining with antibodies against ACE2, CD133, Cadherin 17, and DPP4 candidates. Representative images of ACE2, CD133, Cadherin 17, and DPP4 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>. It was found that all these proteins (red signals) were at least expressed in Caco-2 cells and co-localized with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (green signals). Interestingly, despite the observation that these proteins were expressed abundantly, the co-localized area was limited to specific membrane sites.</p><p id="P14">These colocalizations were subsequently examined via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). DPP4, CD133, CDH17, and VAPA (instead of ACE2) were labeled with 10 nm gold particles (yellow arrowhead), and the spike protein was labelled with 20 nm gold particles (red arrow). DPP4, CD133, CDH17, and VAPA localized close to the binding site of the spike proteins, and this finding was consistent with the results of confocal microscopy analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Preparation of HEK293T transfectant cells expressing ACE2 and/or candidate proteins</title><p id="P15">To elucidate whether the candidate proteins affect the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 infection, HEK293T cells expressing ACE2 and/or candidate proteins were prepared for the infection assay of SARS-CoV-2. We first prepared two types of ACE2-expressing HEK293T cells using a PCMV3 expression vector system (P-ACE2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 1A</xref>) or a lentivirus expression system (L-ACE2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 1B</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis revealed sufficient expression levels of ACE2 in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 1C</xref>). As ACE2 is a primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2, we confirmed the binding capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and strong binding was observed in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 1D</xref>). The binding amount was slightly higher in L-ACE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 1E</xref>), demonstrating a correlation with ACE2 expression.</p><p id="P16">Furthermore, we prepared single transfectant HEK293T cells expressing candidate proteins (CD133, CDH17, and VAPA), using a lentivirus expression system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 2</xref>). Binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was not detected in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 2</xref>), indicating that these candidate proteins are not the primary receptors of SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="P17">To perform cotransfection of CD133, CDH17, and VAPA with ACE2-expressing cells, the lentivirus system used in the above-mentioned experiment was subsequently applied to P-ACE2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 3A</xref>). Glypican-3 (GPC3), which was detected in both the spike [+] and spike [-] samples in MS analysis, was also cotransfected in P-ACE2 cells as the negative control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P18">CD133-, CDH17-, and VAPA-coexpressing P-ACE2 cells (P-ACE2-CD133, -CDH17, and -VAPA) were subjected to the binding assay of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 3B</xref>). The extent of spike protein binding to an ACE2 molecule was higher than that to P-ACE2 cells; however, no statistically significant difference was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Candidate membrane proteins partially affect the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus</title><p id="P19">A lentivirus-based pSARS-CoV-2 was generated to perform the infection assay in each cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>).

For the quantification of GFP-positive cells, the treated cells were subsequently subjected to flow cytometric analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). An independent experiment revealed that in the infection assay, GFP-positive cells accounted for about 1 to 5% of the total cells. In contrast to this, when single transfectant cells expressing the candidate proteins CD133, CDH17, and VAPA were applied to the analysis, almost no GFP-positive cells were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>).</p><p id="P21">The same infection assay revealed that the P-ACE2 cells coexpressing CD133, CDH17, and VAPA had approximately 2 to 3-fold significantly more number of GFP-positive cells compared to the P-ACE2 cells, but not the P-ACE2-GPC3 negative control cells, indicating the ability of these candidate proteins to enhance pSARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E and 6F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">Proteomic-based analysis has opened up the possibility for the use of host cell proteins involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication as therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). However, as viral infection initially occurs through the host cell membrane, it is also imperative to focus on membrane proteins, such as the primary viral receptor. In particular, previous studies on viruses have suggested that lipid rafts, which are assembly structures consisting of several membrane proteins, are important for viral entry into host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Moreover, some studies have demonstrated that the EMARS reaction used in this study is effective for identifying proximity proteins, including the membrane proteins in the lipid raft structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). It was therefore speculated that EMARS is suitable for investigating crucial membrane proteins located in the proximity region of the cell membrane-bound SARS-CoV-2 spike protein involved in virus entry.</p><p id="P23">It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 expands more easily in Caco-2 cells than in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). These differences could be due to the variation in ACE2 expression levels in these cells. In the current study, ACE2 expression was more clearly observed in Caco-2 cells than in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A and 2B</xref>), thus supporting the binding capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in this study. In contrast, it has also been reported that the expression levels of ACE2 in A549 cells are relatively high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), and that virus attachment could occur even if the replication ability was low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Regardless, as the binding of the spike protein to A549 cells was observed in this study, it was concluded that the experiment could be performed in both Caco-2 and A549 cells.</p><p id="P24">For preparation of the EMARS probe, the binding capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein toward the cell membrane was assayed. We expected to observe clear spike protein staining in Caco-2 cells owing to the high ACE2 expression in this cell line. However, only a portion of the cell population could bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, whereas the other cells did not exhibit clear binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Previous studies examining SARS-CoV-2 infection observed both infected and non-infected cells even in homogeneous cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). In HeLa cells that overexpress ACE2, not all cells were infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Moreover, the cytological images of spike protein used in this study were similar to those of SARS-CoV-2 infection reported by other studies. The distinction of the binding among cultured cells is presumed to be due to the condition of each cell population (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., the cell cycle and expression levels of co-receptor [co-factors] membrane proteins); however, the actual cause remains unknown.</p><p id="P25">The staining experiments implied that the amount of membrane proteins labeled by the EMARS reaction may be small. The labeling of molecules by EMARS was confirmed in both Caco-2 cells and A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A and 3B</xref>); however, the number of labeled molecules was less than expected and could only be detected using the Western blot analysis. Considering the loss of the labeled protein in the purification process and the sensitivity of shotgun analysis via mass spectrometry, it was necessary to combine multiple samples obtained from multiple independent experiments despite the non-specific adsorption that occurs during the purification process. In A549 cells, a number of proteins that were expected to be non-specific adsorbed proteins were detected in the negative control sample and were not subjected to the EMARS reaction (spike [-]). We therefore decided to select the candidate membrane proteins using a subtraction method that incorporated the membrane proteins present in the EMARS reaction samples (spike [+]) in both cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Table 1 to 5</xref>). Although there was a difference in the expression of candidate proteins between Caco-2 cells and A549 cells, it was speculated that the membrane proteins that act as co-factors for SARS-CoV-2 entry were dependent on cell origin. As SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect multiple cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), these differences appear to be events that must be considered in future SARS-CoV-2 research. In contrast, some identical proteins between Caco-2 and A549 cells, including the transferrin receptor protein and others, were detected. These are ubiquitous proteins; however, they may still play an important role by acting as a common target against SARS-CoV-2 infection. It should also be noted that ubiquitous and highly expressed cell membrane proteins are more likely to be detected in proteomic analysis. Another factor is that ACE2, which is the primary receptor of SARS-CoV-2, was detected in Caco-2 cell as a candidate protein in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Table 5</xref>), indicating that our strategy can capture molecules in proximity to the spike protein. To narrow down the candidate proteins, the molecules that have never been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection were listed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Cadherin 17, which exhibited the highest score in Caco-2 cells, is a member of the cadherin superfamily that mediates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cell–cell adhesion without any connection to a cytoskeleton molecule. Cadherin 17 acts as a regulator of B cell development in knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Cadherin 17 can also influence the progression of certain cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). However, there is a paucity of studies on the relationship between Cadherin 17 and viral infection.

Transferrin has been reported as a co-receptor for hepatitis C virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), but its relationship to SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been reported. In contrast, it has been found that DPP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>) plays a role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-1 and/or SARS-CoV-2 infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). In A549 cells, CD44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), Contactin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), Cadherin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), and Reticulon-4 receptor-like 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) have not yet been reported to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, it has been reported that integrin families act as co-receptors for other viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>), and it has subsequently been noted that these proteins exhibit a relationship with SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Interestingly, while carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>) has been speculated to act as a primary receptor of mouse coronavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>), a recent network perturbation analysis suggested a very specific influence of this molecule on SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). Our findings, including those regarding CEACAM, and the observed concordance of our study results with those of previous studies indicate that potent candidate proteins can be obtained using the method described in this study.</p><p id="P27">The results of confocal microscopy experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) revealed that the candidate proteins co-localized with the spike protein. However, the co-localization was not identical. This could be attributed to the contribution of multiple factors (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., influence of the plasma membrane environment) other than the identified candidate proteins. It is unclear whether the extent of spike protein binding is directly associated with the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p id="P28">A simple <italic>in vitro</italic> infection assay system was developed to elucidate whether the identified candidate molecules contribute to SARS-CoV-2 infection. VeroE6 or Caco-2 cells expressing TMPRSS2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>) and others were considered for use as host cells in this study, but in order to observe the direct effect of the candidate molecule, we used stable transfectant HEK293T cells coexpressing ACE2 and candidate molecules. It was found that the proportion of the infected cells was approximately 1 to 5% of the total cells, and our finding was similar to the results reported in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). In the infection assays using cells expressing each candidate molecule alone, almost no infection was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>), which indicated that CD133, CDH17, and VAPA were not the primary receptors for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In contrast to this, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein showed an increased binding capacity in coexpressing cells compared to that in cells expressing ACE2 alone. The number of infected cells with pSARS-CoV-2 also increased by 2-3 folds. CD133 expression showed a greater increase in this infection assay. Therefore, the results of this assay suggest that CD133, CDH17, and VAPA partially contribute to infection in ACE2 expressing cells. Although there was no statistically significant difference, there was an increase in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to each candidate molecule-expressing P-ACE2, suggesting the role of the candidate molecules in assisting adhesion and/or entry of pSARS-CoV-2 virion into the host cell.</p><p id="P29">In conclusion, the candidate target proteins identified in this study were partially consistent with the results obtained from previous studies on SARS-CoV-2. Our method can therefore be considered an effective tool for identifying the host cell membrane proteins involved in viral infection. This strategy is likely to be applicable not only to SARS-CoV-2 but also to other viruses. This means that it can be used not only for known viruses but also for novel viruses that will emerge in the future. The results of this study will aid in the elucidation of entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, resulting in the development of novel therapeutic anti-viral agents in the future.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P30">A549 human caucasian lung carcinoma and HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells (RIKEN CELL BANK, Saitama, Japan) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Wako Chemicals, Miyazaki, Japan), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; GIBCO bland, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA), at 37°C under humidified air containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
