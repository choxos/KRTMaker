<abstract>
<p id="P1">The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes COVID-19, a pandemic that seriously threatens global health. SARS-CoV-2 propagates by packaging its RNA genome into membrane enclosures in host cells. The packaging of the viral genome into the nascent virion is mediated by the nucleocapsid (N) protein, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that the N protein forms biomolecular condensates with viral genomic RNA both in vitro and in mammalian cells. Phase separation is driven, in part, by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. While the N protein forms spherical assemblies with unstructured RNA, it forms asymmetric condensates with viral RNA strands that contain secondary structure elements. Cross-linking mass spectrometry identified a region that forms interactions between N proteins in condensates, and truncation of this region disrupts phase separation. We also identified small molecules that alter the formation of N protein condensates. These results suggest that the N protein may utilize biomolecular condensation to package the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome into a viral particle.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The SARS-CoV-2 virus consists of a 30 kb single-stranded RNA genome packaged into a 100 nm diameter membrane enveloped virion. SARS-CoV-2 encodes for multiple proteins involved in viral assembly and propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) and infects human cells by binding its spike (S) protein to the ACE2 receptor on host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). While the majority of current efforts to treat COVID-19 have focused on targeting this interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), not much work has been done to stop the proliferation of the virus in host cells following infection. Condensation of the viral genome into a virion is primarily driven by the nucleocapsid (N) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), which is the most abundant viral protein in infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). A large pool of free N protein is expressed early in infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) and only a small fraction is transferred into mature virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). The N protein accumulates at the replication transcription complex (RTC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) where it enhances replication and the transcription of viral RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The N protein also restructures viral genomic RNA into shell-shaped structures (~15 nm in diameter), which contain approximately 12 N proteins and 800 nucleotides of viral RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). These viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) form asymmetric “beads on a string” structures which then bind to the viral membrane (M) protein on the surface of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) to trigger the budding of the vRNP complex.</p>
<p id="P3">The mechanism by which N remodels the viral RNA and packages it into a viral particle is not well understood. Recent studies proposed that the replication and packaging of viruses involve liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Biomolecular condensation drives the formation of membrane-less organelles such as the nucleolus, centrosome, stress granules, and P granules through a network of weak and multivalent interactions. Nucleic acids are highly involved in the formation of biomolecular condensates because they can scaffold multivalent interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Coronaviruses are involved with phase-separated structures such as stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) and replicate at dynamic clusters associated with the ERGIC, suggesting that phase separation may play a critical role in the replication and packaging of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="P4">Previous studies in HIV-1, negative-sense RNA viruses, and SARS-CoV showed that nucleocapsid proteins drive the formation of phase-separated condensates in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). The N protein of SARS-CoV-2 also contains many of the characteristic domain features common in phase separating proteins. It contains a well-conserved N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), and 40% of its primary sequence is predicted to be part of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The NTD (aa: 44-174) interacts nonspecifically with RNA and recognizes a nucleotide sequence in the 3' end of the viral genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). The CTD (aa: 257-366) mediates dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), but the N protein can also self-associate into tetramers and higher oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). The NTD and CTD are separated by an IDR that contains a serine/arginine-rich (SR) motif, which has been associated with phase separation in other ribonucleoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). The N and C-terminal IDRs are less conserved but contain arginine- and lysine-rich disordered regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), which may facilitate additional interactions with the negatively-charged RNA backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) and drive biomolecular condensation of RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). The N-terminal IDR contains a predicted prion-like domain (PLD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) that can potentially trigger protein demixing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). The C-terminal IDR of SARS-CoV N mediates binding to the M protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). The N protein is highly positively-charged (+24 in pH 7.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), and the CTD and disordered regions also interact with negatively-charged RNA and promote vRNP packaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). The precise roles of these domains in the phase separation of N protein remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p id="P5">In this study, we purified the SARS-CoV-2 N protein from human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and observed that N protein forms biomolecular condensates with both homopolymorphic and viral genomic RNA under physiological salt conditions in vitro. The length and structure of the RNA determined the material properties of the N/RNA condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). We also showed that the N protein forms liquid condensates in mammalian cells. Cross-linking mass spectrometry (CLMS) identified two regions flanking CTD with interactions enriched within the condensed phase, and the deletion of one of these regions fully abrogated condensate formation in vitro. Together, our results indicate that the N protein phase separates with genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2, which may play an important role in the packaging of new viral particles in host cells.</p>

<title>The N protein phase separates with RNA</title>
<p id="P6">We first asked whether the N protein forms bimolecular condensates in the presence or absence of viral RNA in vitro. To address this, we expressed wild-type (WT) N protein in HEK293 cells and purified it in a high salt buffer (1 M NaCl) to eliminate the retention of RNA from human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1_figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with recent studies, purified N protein eluted from gel filtration as an oligomer in 300 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) and had high affinity for binding to various RNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1_figure supplement 1</xref>). The protein was labeled with a fluorescent dye (LD655) at the C-terminal ybbR tag and introduced to a flow chamber in the presence or absence of RNA. Phase separation was monitored by the settling of N or N-RNA condensates on to the coverslip within 25 minutes under highly inclined and laminated optical sheet (HiLO) excitation (see Methods for details). In the absence of RNA, N protein did not form condensates in physiological salt (150 mM NaCl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similarly, 2-kb long polyC RNA homopolymer did not form any condensates in the absence of N protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1_figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). Mixing of 50 ng/μL polyC RNA and the N protein resulted in the formation of condensates in 150 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). LD655-N and Cy3-polyC colocalized well in the droplets, suggesting that phase separation of N protein is driven by RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1_figure supplement 2C</xref>). The analysis of the condensates settled on the coverslip revealed a saturation concentration (c<sub>sat</sub>) of 3.3 ± 1.3 μM for N protein in the presence of 50 ng/μL polyC RNA (± s.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), consistent with the abundance of N protein in infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). The partition coefficient of N protein into condensates was 13 ± 2 (±s.d.).</p>
<p id="P7">Although N protein is unable to phase separate without RNA in 150 mM salt, 24 μM N protein efficiently formed condensates at lower salt with a half-maximal inhibition constant (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 90 ± 1 μM NaCl (±s.e.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). The addition of 50 ng/μL polyC RNA increased IC<sub>50</sub> to 152 ± 6 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). The ability of N protein to phase separate without RNA and sensitivity of these condensates to salt shows that they are dynamic structures driven, in part, by electrostatic and pi interactions among N proteins, as observed for other proteins that phase separate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">Condensate formation of N protein and RNA was dependent on protein-RNA stoichiometry. At 18 μM N protein, condensate formation was not observed in the presence of 0-5 ng/μL polyC RNA. Increasing the RNA concentration promoted phase separation with an optimal RNA concentration of 100-500 ng/μL, in which charge neutralization occurs with the positively-charged N protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). A further increase in RNA concentration dissolved these condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). This reentrant phase separation behavior is characteristic of heterotypic RNA and protein interactions in phase separating systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">We also showed that N-polyC condensates exhibit liquid-like, rather than solid-like, material properties. First, these condensates were nearly spherical with an aspect ratio of 1.3 ± 0.6 (mean ± s.d.). Second, we observed the fusion of condensates with a mean fusion time of 90 ± 30 s (mean ± s.d.) after they come into contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Finally, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments showed that 90 ± 10% of N protein in condensates can slowly exchange with the solvent with the half recovery time of 80 ± 30 s (mean ± s.d.). In comparison, polyC RNA exhibited slower recovery and a lower mobile fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G-H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1_figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that the RNA may be stabilized by a network of interactions with multiple N proteins in the condensates.</p>
<p id="P10">Similar to polyC RNA, polyA and polyU RNA substrates produced spherical condensates at micromolar concentrations of the N protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, combining N protein with polyG that forms G-quadruplexes or polyAU that forms base-pair interactions led to the formation of non-spherical condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). These results indicate that the N protein forms liquid condensates with nonspecific RNA that do not contain RNA sequence-specific secondary structures, whereas RNA substrates that form internal base-pairing interactions result in asymmetric condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">Next, we sought to characterize how the N protein interacts with SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome was reverse transcribed and assembled into a DNA plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). Using this plasmid, we generated six 5 kb and two 1 kb fragments of the viral RNA genome via in vitro transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Unlike polyC, in silico methods predict that these RNA fragments can form intra- and inter-molecular base-pairing interactions and contain extensive secondary structure elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 2_figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Similar to synthetic RNA substrates that form base-pair interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), the N protein formed non-spherical condensates with viral RNA fragments in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 2_figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). The aspect ratio of condensates formed with viral RNA was higher than unstructured polymorphic RNA but lower than those formed with polyG and polyAU fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 2_figure supplement 1C</xref>). This could be due to the presence of both structured and unstructured segments within the viral RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). These asymmetric structures formed across a wide range of protein and viral RNA concentrations and were dissolved by increasing the salt concentration, but they did not change shape over time or fuse with each other and were not strongly affected by raising the temperature from 20 °C to 37 °C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 2_figure supplement 2</xref>). We also did not detect fluorescence recovery of either the LD655-labeled N protein or Cy3-labeled viral RNA in FRAP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 2_figure supplement 3</xref>). We concluded that N protein forms solid-like condensates with viral RNA in vitro and that intramolecular interaction of the RNA influences the material properties of the condensate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Cross-linking mass spectrometry identifies N protein interaction sites</title>
<p id="P12">To understand the mechanism of phase separation of the N protein, we performed CLMS to identify interactions between different domains of the full-length N protein in the absence of RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). CLMS detects protein-protein contacts by covalently capturing nearby residues with bifunctional reagents. We first crosslinked the soluble (not phase separated) N protein in 300 mM KAc using a bifunctional crosslinker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 3_figure supplement 1A</xref>). We detected that the N-terminal half of the protein, including NTD, makes diverse contacts throughout the entire protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 3_figure supplement 1A</xref>). There was also an abundance of contacts between the regions immediately flanking CTD on either side, referred to as R1 (aa: 235-256) and R2 (aa: 369-390).</p>
<p id="P13">Next, we performed quantitative CLMS measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>) comparing the soluble N protein in 300 mM KAc with phase-separated N protein in 100 mM KAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The soluble N protein was crosslinked with heavy (D12) BS3 whereas the phase-separated protein was crosslinked with light (H12) BS3. As a result, the crosslinked precursor ions from high and low salt conditions were spaced by 12 Da (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interactions between specific regions that promote condensate formation are implicated by the ratio of the crosslinked precursor ion signal and its corresponding isotopic doublet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). This experiment was repeated by reversing the labels, such that (H12) BS3 was used to crosslink the soluble N protein and (D12) BS3 was used for the phase-separated N protein. Across two independent experiments, 29 unique crosslinks were enriched and 30 crosslinks were depleted upon phase separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 3_figure supplement 1B</xref>). Remarkably, the analysis of the crosslink fold change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) revealed that nearly all of the enriched interactions are concentrated in regions R1 and R2, whereas depleted crosslinks more uniformly spanned the entire primary sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results suggest that the interactions involving the amino acids in regions R1 and R2 may be important in driving phase separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 3_figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">Our mass spectrometry (MS) analysis also found phosphorylation sites on the N protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). While some of these sites have been identified in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>), we also identified several novel sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Although one of the phosphorylation sites (S176) is involved in a crosslink, the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides were both strongly depleted in condensates, suggesting that S176 phosphorylation does not play a major role in phase separation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 3_figure supplement 1B</xref>). Additionally, MS identified native proteins that co-purified with the N protein in 1 M salt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). Consistent with the recruitment of N to stress granules in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>), two of the most frequently identified proteins were stress granule proteins G3BP1 and G3BP2, with R2 of the N protein interacting with G3BP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 3_figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>The C-terminal region and phosphorylation modulate phase separation</title>
<p id="P15">The quantitative CLMS experiments show that interactions between R1 and R2 are correlated with the formation of condensates. However, we could not exclude the possibility that some of the changes in pairwise interactions are due to differences in protein structure or electrostatic interactions induced by differences in salt concentrations used for the soluble and condensate phase. To directly test the predictions of the CLMS results, we determined how different domain deletions affected phase separation of the N protein with polyC RNA under the same salt concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4_figure supplement 1</xref>). Phase separation was only moderately reduced in the △SR, △PLD, and △R1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4_figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that these regions are not essential for phase separation. In comparison, deletion of the R2 sequence fully abolished the formation of condensates with polyC RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4_figure supplement 2A-D</xref>). Similarly, △R2 was unable to form condensates with viral RNA, whereas other deletion mutants phase separated with the same RNA fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4_figure supplement 2E</xref>). △R2 maintained a high affinity to bind polyC and viral RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4_figure supplement 1C</xref>), excluding the possibility that the disruption of phase separation is due to the lack of protein-RNA interactions. These results show that R2 primarily drives phase separation of N protein with RNA, consistent with the proposed role of this sequence in the oligomerization of N protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">Recent studies proposed that the N protein is phosphorylated early in infection, and this results in localization of N protein with the RTC, where it enhances transcription of subgenomic RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). However, nucleocapsid formation does not require phosphorylation and N protein in SARS-CoV viruses are hypophosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). The underlying molecular mechanism and kinases and phosphatases responsible for post-translational modification of N protein remain poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). To understand how phosphorylation affects phase separation, we treated the full-length N protein with casein kinase 2 and γ protein phosphatase (see Methods). While kinase treatment did not alter the migration of N protein on a denaturing gel, phosphatase treatment resulted in a reduction in molecular weight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4_figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that the N protein expressed in human cells is phosphorylated. Phosphatase treatment resulted in phase separation at slightly lower concentrations in comparison to kinase-treated N protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-D</xref>). Similar to WT, dephosphorylated △SR or △R1 had only a moderate increase in phase separation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4_figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">3</xref>). Unlike untreated △R2, dephosphorylated △R2 exhibited robust phase separation with polyC RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). These results suggest that phosphorylation negatively regulates phase separation of the N protein, but interactions formed by R2 supersede this inhibition.</p>

<title>Targeting phase separation of the N protein with small molecules</title>
<p id="P17">We next sought to identify small molecules that could interfere with the phase separation of the N protein. The condensates formed by the N protein in the absence or presence of polyC or viral RNA dissolve with the addition of 10% 1,6 hexanediol, indicating that phase separation is driven, at least partially, by hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). In comparison, lipoic acid that increases the liquidity of stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>) did not affect phase separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Using a high-throughput microscopy platform, we also tested whether any of the 1200 compounds in the FDA-approved library alters phase separation of the N protein with polyC RNA in vitro. While none of the compounds fully dissolved the condensates, we identified several compounds that affected their number, size, and shape (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). Nelfinavir mesylate and LDK378 produced larger but fewer condensates, whereas crystal violet, tolcapone, and chlorhexidine enhanced phase separation by increasing the number and size of the condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 5_figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). Nilotinib resulted in a 50% increase in condensate volume and altered the shape of the condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), which may be due to changes in condensate fusion or maturation. While most drugs did not have a substantial effect on condensates formed by N and viral genomic RNA in vitro, nilotinib addition resulted in the formation of thread-like filaments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 5_figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). Morphologically, these filaments were similar to those formed during the liquid-to-solid transition of FUS condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>), suggesting that nilotinib increases the viscosity of the condensates.</p>
<p id="P18">We also tested these drugs in the human pulmonary epithelial (Calu-3) and the African Green Monkey kidney (Vero-E6) cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (see Methods), as these cell lines supported high levels of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>). The cells were treated with different concentrations of drugs 1 hour before infection and the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-mediated cell death under drug treatment was quantified using the cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>). The toxicity of the drugs was quantified by measuring the viability of uninfected cells under drug treatment.

<title>The N protein phase separates in mammalian cells</title>
<p id="P19">To test whether N protein also phase separates in mammalian cells, we expressed WT-GFP in HEK293T cells. We observed the formation of distinct puncta in the cytoplasm in WT-GFP expressing cells, which were not observed in control cells expressing GFP only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). FRAP imaging of these puncta revealed a recovery signal with 60% mobile fraction and 6.3 ± 0.1 s recovery lifetime, suggesting that N protein is capable of forming liquid condensates in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 6_figure supplement 1</xref>). The recovery of WT-GFP was substantially slower than GFP only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C-E</xref>), but an order of magnitude faster than that of N-polyC condensates in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), suggesting that phase separation of N protein may be regulated inside cells. This difference is not due to the absence or low stoichiometry of RNA in N-GFP puncta in live cells, because N condensates formed in the absence of RNA in vitro also exhibited an order of magnitude slower recovery than N-GFP puncta in live cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 6_figure supplement 2</xref>). We next tested whether deletion of the R2 region disrupts phase separation of N protein in cells. Surprisingly, cells expressing the R2 deletion mutant (△R2-GFP) still formed puncta and did not display significantly different FRAP dynamics than WT-GFP in live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). This may be due to macromolecular crowding of the cellular environment because the addition of 10% PEG triggered phase separation of △R2 without RNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 6_figure supplement 3</xref>). Collectively, these results show the N protein is capable of liquid-liquid phase separation in cells. Differences between in vitro and in vivo phase separation might be attributed to macromolecular crowding of the cytosol or the interaction of the N protein with other cellular proteins, such as G3BP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 3_figure supplement 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P20">In this study, we showed that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein phase separates with nonspecific RNA sequences in vitro and the viscosity and shape of these condensates depend on the structure of the RNA substrate. Concurrent studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein expressed in bacteria forms biomolecular condensates with RNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). We purified N protein from mammalian cells to recapitulate the post-translational modifications that occur in infected human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Consistent with Carlson et al. and Chen et al., we observed that the N protein requires unstructured RNA to form liquid condensates in physiological salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). Condensates of N with unstructured RNA recovered from photobleaching and relaxed to a spherical shape, suggesting that they are dynamic, liquid-like compartments. In agreement with Iserman et al., we found that RNA structure affects the material properties of the condensate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>); base-paired or G-quadruplex-containing RNA produces irregularly-shaped condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). N protein also formed solidlike condensates with long fragments of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA. These condensates had asymmetric shapes and did not relax over time or with increased temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Viral RNA may drive the formation of abnormal condensate shapes by forming networks of intermolecular interactions, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>).</p>
<p id="P21">We also investigated the mechanisms underlying condensate formation using CLMS and protein engineering. Previous studies reported that prion-like and SR motifs are common features of phase separating proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), and the linker sequence outside the SR motif (amino acids 210-247) is essential for phase separation of N expressed in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). The SR motif was required for N/N interactions in SARS-CoV and for forming puncta in SARS-CoV infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>). In addition, the SR motif is highly phosphorylated in human cells, and phosphorylation has been shown to promote interactions with host proteins, nuclear targeting, and transcription of the viral genome, and either enhances or inhibits oligomerization in SARS-CoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). In SARS-CoV-2, SR phosphorylation is reported to make N condensates more liquid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). However, we observed that the SR region is not necessary for the condensate formation of full-length N protein expressed in human cells. Although the deletion of the entire C-terminal IDR enhances phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), we found that deletion of the R2 motif in this region fully disrupts phase separation of N protein with both polymorphic and viral RNA in vitro. The C-terminal region interacts with the M protein, which was shown to drive phase separation of the N protein in the absence of RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Because the C-terminal region plays an important role in phase separation, binding of the N protein to the membrane-associated M protein through this region can alter the material properties of the N-RNA condensates and initiate virion assembly.</p>
<p id="P22">It remains to be demonstrated whether condensate formation of N protein and the viral genome is essential for the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells. Phase separation has been implicated as a possible mechanism in the viral life cycle. For example, several viruses have been shown to replicate in viral inclusion bodies that are characterized as phase-separated condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). A recent in vitro work has shown that nucleoproteins and phosphoproteins of the measles virus form liquid-like membraneless organelles and triggered nucleocapsid formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), suggesting that phase separation could be a general mechanism for viral replication. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, phase separation of N protein can form membrane-less compartments and function as a selectivity barrier to control the entry of certain agents into these compartments to enhance the efficiency of replication, while sequestering the viral assemblies from the immune response of the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). For example, N protein interacts with stress granule proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>) and inhibits stress granule formation in uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>). It remains to be determined whether N protein suppresses stress granule formation in infected cells and whether this plays a role in the efficiency of viral replication. Similarly, recent in vitro studies have shown that N-RNA condensates recruit the components of the SARS-CoV-2 replication machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). This mechanism may increase the efficiency of replication of the viral genomic RNA by increasing the local concentration of the replication machinery at the RTC complex.</p>
<p id="P23">The phase separation of N protein with viral RNA may also facilitate the compaction and packaging of the genome into the nascent viral particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). Consistent with this possibility, recent studies have shown that phase separation plays an essential role in the formation of heterochromatin regions in the nucleus of mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>). However, this model raises several challenges. Because N protein can phase separate with nonspecific RNA substrates, it remains unclear how these condensates may exclude subgenomic viral RNA and other RNA from the host cell. Recent in vitro work has shown that N protein has a higher affinity to bind 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the genomic RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>), which may serve as a mechanism to exclude other RNA from the condensates. In addition, condensates observed in vitro and in vivo are large structures that can potentially contain thousands of N proteins and RNAs, and it is not clear how a virion with a single genomic RNA can bud from these structures. A recent modeling study proposed that the presence of high-affinity sites in genomic RNA can trigger the formation of single-genome condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Alternatively, interaction with the M protein or dephosphorylation of N protein, which has been proposed to trigger the liquid-to-solid transition of N-RNA condensates, at the viral assembly sites may trigger budding of a single genomic copy in virions. Testing of these models requires in-depth studies of N protein and genomic RNA in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.</p>
<p id="P24">Phase separation could also provide a macroscopic readout to study N protein and RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>) and suggest novel strategies to disrupt genome packaging and viral propagation in infected cells. We performed a screen of an FDA-approved library and identified several compounds that altered the size, number, and shape of N/RNA condensates in vitro. In particular, nelfinavir mesylate binds the SARS-CoV-2 protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>) and blocks SARS-CoV viral production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>). We showed that nelfinavir mesylate inhibits the proliferation of the virus in the host cell, which may be related to changes it induces on N condensates. Future work in infected cells is needed to address whether nelfinavir mesylate reduces virus-mediated cell death by interfering with the functions of N-RNA condensates.</p>

The x-intercept of the linear regression represents csat, the minimum protein concentration that results in condensate formation. The aspect ratio was calculated for individual condensates in Fiji using the Phansalkar function with a 30-pixel radius and a minimum condensate size of 10 pixels. To measure fusion times, condensates were visualized as they settled on the imaging surface from 5 to 25 min after mixing. Movies were recorded at 5 frames per second.

The diluted protein formed condensates in 100 mM NaCl in the final buffer, but not in the labeling buffer that contains 300 mM NaCl. Isotopically coded light (H12) and heavy (D12) BS3 (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate) crosslinkers (Creative Molecules Inc.) were immediately added to the diluted solution. Final concentration of BS3 was 0.8 mM for 100 mM NaCl dilution and 2.5 mM for 300 mM NaCl dilution. Crosslinking was performed for 30 min at room temperature and then quenched with 1 M Tris pH 8.0 buffer. This experiment was performed in duplicate, once with D12-BS3 crosslinking N protein in condensates and H12-BS3 crosslinking soluble N protein and once with the labels reversed. The crosslinked proteins from both channels were pooled before acetone precipitation. Protein was precipitated with acetone overnight at -20 °C. Protein was pelleted, the supernatant was removed, and the samples were air-dried for 10 min. The pellets were brought up in 8 M urea, reduced with TCEP, alkylated with iodoacetamide, diluted 4-fold, and digested with two rounds of trypsin. Peptides were desalted on a C18 MacroTrap column (Michrom Bioresources) and fractionated on a Superdex Peptide (GE Life Sciences) size-exclusion column. Fractions enriched in crosslinked peptides were dried and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid for mass spectrometry. Later eluting fractions were used for phosphorylation analysis. Each of the replicates was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and each fraction was injected twice, generating 16 mass spectrometry files for analysis.</p>

The corresponding light and heavy dead-end modifications, incorrect monoisotopic peak assignment (+1Da neutral loss), N-terminal pyroglutamate formation, methionine oxidation, and acetylation and loss of the protein N-terminal methionine were set as variable modifications with three variable modifications per peptide allowed. Trypsin with two missed cleavages was the digestion enzyme and the mass tolerances were 20 and 30 ppm for precursor and product ions. The search database comprised the 14 most abundant proteins (sorted by Spectral Abundance Factor) found in the linear peptide SEC fractions, alongside a decoy database that was ten times longer.

<p id="P35">Protein Prospector was used to search for phosphopeptides of the linear peptide fractions using the following parameters: tryptic specificity with 2 missed cleavages, 7 and 15 ppm precursor and product ion tolerances, and carbamidomethyl (C) fixed modification. Variable modifications were as above except that Phospho (STY) was included and only dead-end crosslink modifications were included. Peptides were reported with a maximum expectation value of 0.001, and a minimum prospector score of 15. A site localization in peptide (SLIP) score threshold of 6 was used to determine site-localization. All phosphopeptide spectra reported were manually inspected for evidence of correct site assignment. Where S or T residues are adjacent, the location of the phosphosite is ambiguous (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). All phosphorylation data can be accessed here (or on the MS-Viewer website with search key “jyovxenjny”).</p>
<p id="P36">A supplemental search of the crosslinked peak lists was made for crosslinks that also contained a phosphorylation site. This search was identical to the previous crosslinking searches except that Phospho (ST) was included as a variable modification, and the search was limited to the N protein sequence. Search results containing a phosphorylation site were manually assessed. Only phosphorylation sites that had been discovered in the phospho search of the linear peptides were considered.</p>
<p id="P37">For quantitating the isotopically labeled crosslinks, peak areas were measured from the extracted precursor ion chromatograms (XICs) using the small molecule interface of Skyline (v20.1.0.155). A Skyline transition list was generated containing the elemental composition of each distinct peptide pair with both light and heavy BS3 modification and in each charge state detected in the Prospector search. Retention times were present in the transition list to help with peak detection. Peptide level measurements were imported into R and summarized at the level of unique residue pairs (“crosslinks”). For each precursor ion, the log2 ratios of heavy to light</p>
<p id="P38">peptides were calculated and mean normalized to 0 for each of the two biological replicates and then transformed into log2 (water/salt) ratios. Weighted t-tests were performed in R.</p>

<title>Drug Screening and Image Processing</title>
<p id="P39">For the FDA-approved drug screen, 75 mL of N protein at 16 μM was purified from HEK293S GNTI- cells. polyC RNA was obtained from Sigma. The FDA-Approved Drug Library (TargetMol) has 1,200 compounds of well-characterized biological activity. 10 mM compounds were stored in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in 384 well plates. For screening plates, 20 jL imaging buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1% pluronic) was aliquoted into 384 well, glass-bottomed plates (Greiner Bio-One) and incubated for 5 min. Buffer was removed, and 0.5 jL of 2 mM compounds were stamped into 384 well plates with an Analytik-Jena Cybio Well Vario liquid handler. The final concentration of 7.8 μM N protein and 50 ng/μL polyC RNA were added to each plate. Each well contained a 25 μL mixture and 40 μM compound in the primary screen.</p>
<p id="P40">Wells were homogenized with a Bioshake 3000 ELM orbital shaker at 2,400 rpm for 45 s and condensates were allowed to settle for 1 h before imaging. 4 images (each 224 x 167 μM) were taken at 40x with a Molecular Devices ImageXpress Micro High Content Imaging System. Images were analyzed with Metamorph Imaging software calculating condensate count and area. The volume of the condensates was calculated as described above. Data was then uploaded to CCDvault for normalization to DMSO vehicle control wells. Wells that exhibit 3 standard deviations from the untreated sample and as well as others that produced qualitative morphological changes in N condensates were selected for dose-response screening. The same N protein and RNA were tested against candidate drugs using a 10-point serial dilution starting at 40 μM using the same procedure. Dose-response curves were generated by fitting to the equation: <disp-formula id="FD1">

<title>Dose-Response with SARS-CoV-2 Infected Cells</title>
<p id="P41">Vero-E6 (ATCC, CRL-1586) and Calu-3 cells (ATCC HTB-55) were cultured in high glucose DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (R&amp;D Systems), 1X GlutaMAX (Gibco), and 1X PenStrep (Gibco) at 37°C and 5% CO2. For screening selected drugs against infected cells, 2500 Vero-E6 (12 Ml/well) or 10000 Calu-3 (12 |jl/well) were seeded in 384-well white optical-bottom tissue culture plates (Nunc) with the Multidrop Combi liquid handling instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h for Vero-E6 and 48 h for Calu-3 at 37°C and 5% CO2. Dose responses were generated by diluting the compounds using a Cybio Well Vario liquid handler (Analytik Jena), leading to a final concentration of DMSO at 0.4% in the assay plate (v/v). Cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 1 h before infection. The viral inoculum was prepared such that the final MOI = 0.05 upon addition of 6 jl/well viral inoculum. After complete CPE was observed in DMSO-treated, infected wells (72 h post-infection (hpi) for Vero-E6 and 96 hpi for Calu 3), the plates were developed with the CellTiter-Glo 2.0 reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Vero-E6, the reagent was diluted 1:1 (v/v) in PBS. Luminescence of developed plates was read on a Spectramax L (Molecular Devices). Each plate contained 24 wells uninfected/DMSO treated cells (100% CPE inhibition) and 24 wells infected/DMSO treated cells (0% CPE inhibition). Average values from those wells were used to normalize data and determine % CPE inhibition for each compound well. To determine the cytotoxicity of the compounds, the same protocol was used but with 6 jL growth media added instead of viral inoculum. The data were plotted and analyzed in Origin and fit to the dose-response function above.</p>

<title>HEK293T Cell Culture and Transfection</title>
<p id="P42">HEK293T (RRID: CVCL_0063) cells were cultured in phenol-negative DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PS at 37° with 5% CO2. Prior to imaging, cells were transferred to glass-bottomed plates (Nunc Lab-Tek, 0.4 mL working volume) at ~25% confluence and allowed to recover for 24 hours. Media was exchanged into phenol-negative DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, and cells were transfected with N-GFP, N△R2-GFP, or GFP only constructs. For each well, 400 ng of DNA was added to 20 jL DMEM media. 1.2 uL FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega) was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes before being added to the cell culture. Cells were allowed to express the constructs for 4 days. 1 hour prior to imaging, DRAQ5 stain at 1:1000 was added to the media.</p>

<title>In Vivo Imaging and FRAP Assays</title>
<p id="P43">In vivo imaging and FRAP measurements were performed with a Zeiss 880 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope equipped with a 63x, 1.4 NA oil immersion objective. Samples were prepared as described above. All in vivo FRAP experiments used the 405, 488, 561, and 633 nm lasers at 100% for bleaching conditions. Cells expressing N-GFP, △R2-GFP, or GFP-only were bleached with 30 iterations, and images were collected continuously at 6.7 Hz for 30 s. All data were acquired using Zeiss Zen 2.3 SP1 FP3. Data were converted to the normalized intensity and fit to an exponential decay function in Origin.</p>
