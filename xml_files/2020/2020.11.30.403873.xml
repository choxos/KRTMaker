<abstract>
<p id="P2">Vaccines are on the front line-of-defense against infectious diseases, ranging from threats we are familiar with, including polio, tuberculosis, or HIV, to novel and emerging threats such as SARS-CoV-2. Successful development of new protein-based vaccines requires sophisticated and efficient development of storage and formulation conditions. Here we demonstrate the combined power of 2bind’s sophisticated buffer matrix FORMOscreen® and NanoTemper Technologies’ novel Prometheus Panta high-throughput Dynamic Light Scattering/Nano Differential Scanning Fluorimetry instrument. We show that this combination can comprehensively improve critical biophysical parameters for the HIV-1 vaccine BG505-SOSIP and find the optimal formulation condition with unmatched efficiency.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">Vaccines are among the greatest biomedical achievements of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, improving quality of life for billions around the world. Due to standard vaccination protocols, in the United States of America alone, the death toll from nine common infectious diseases (e.g. smallpox, diphteria, and measles) dropped from &gt;1.1 million per year in the 1900s to just a bit over 7000 per year at the turn of the 21st century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. As of 2020, 97 FDA-licensed vaccines are available, targeting all sorts of bacterial and viral pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. However, the need for the development of new and safe vaccines is higher than ever, as many threats are still looming out there: challenging but known pathogens like <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, emerging pathogens like the <italic>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2</italic> (SARS-CoV-2), like <italic>human immunodeficiency virus type-1</italic> (HIV-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].</p>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Vaccine development and formulation</title>
<p id="P4">One of the key steps in vaccine development is the generation of an efficacious vaccine that is also stable enough to be stored and administered all over the world. To do so, successful vaccine formulation strategies must address many interrelated topics such as antigen stabilization, selection of appropriate adjuvants as well as the development of analytical methods for testing antigen stability and interaction with immune system components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Ideally these topics are tackled in the initial stages of vaccine development in order to reduce late stage development attrition and failure rates.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Prometheus Panta</title>
<p id="P5">A vaccine must be able to withstand the range of stresses it will encounter during production and long-term storage. Accelerated stability testing and biophysical characterization of candidate molecules is crucial to identifying and sorting out those prone to failure as early as possible. Many of the central questions in formulation development - thermal- and colloidal stability, solution homogeneity, aggregation propensity - can be addressed on a single instrument platform. Prometheus Panta automatically reports a thorough profile of the candidate molecule’s stability with a complete set of parameters for thermal unfolding, particle sizing, and self-interaction analysis. The instrument uses nanoDSF, DLS, and back-reflection technologies to provide results on thermal unfolding (melting temperature <italic>T<sub>m</sub>
</italic>; onset of unfolding <italic>T<sub>onset</sub>
</italic>; onset of heavy aggregation <italic>T<sub>turbidity</sub>
</italic>; temperature at which average particle size begins to increase <italic>T<sub>size</sub>
</italic>; reversibility of unfolding), isothermal particle analysis (hydrodynamic radius <italic>r<sub>h</sub>
</italic>; polydispersity index <italic>PDI</italic>;), and self-interaction analysis (diffusion interaction parameter <italic>k<sub>D</sub>
</italic>).</p>

<title>Formulation development for an HIV-1 vaccine</title>
<p id="P6">A promising HIV-1 vaccine candidate is the HIV-1 envelope (<italic>Env</italic>) protein BG505 SOSIP.664 (BG505-SOSIP), which is currently being investigated in a phase-1 clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. BG505-SOSIP is a soluble, engineered version of the trimeric viral surface receptor gp140 and was developed to overcome failures of wild-type <italic>Env</italic> protein-vaccines to induce protective antibody responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. In this white paper, we demonstrate the extensive capabilities of combining Prometheus Panta with the 2bind FORMOscreen® buffer screen for finding the ideal formulation buffer for BG505-SOSIP. In this white paper, we show how to combine Prometheus Panta with the 2bind FORMOscreen® to find a buffer that results in high thermal stability, a well-defined protein radius, excellent solution homogeneity and high stress-tolerance, while maintaining interaction with neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies.</p>

<title>FORMOscreen® buffer analysis</title>
<p id="P7">A key step in vaccine formulation development is finding a buffer composition that ensures optimal stability and activity of the protein vaccine and that serves as the basis for subsequent formulation refinement and storage testing. For this, combinatorial approaches are often performed in which many different buffer components are tested in varying combinations and subsequent experimental rounds. A similarly comprehensive but much quicker alternative is the 2bind FORMOscreen® [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]: A collection of 96 ready-to-use buffers from patented formulations of developed antibodies that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA).</p>
<p id="P8">One of the most routinely assessed stability parameters of therapeutic proteins and vaccines is their thermal stability, which can easily be monitored with thermal unfolding experiments. Higher thermal unfolding temperatures (<italic>T<sub>m</sub>
</italic>) usually indicate a favorable stability equilibrium at ambient or storage temperatures. A nano-scale differential fluorimetry (nanoDSF) unfolding analysis of BG505-SOSIP in the 96 FORMOscreen® buffers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) revealed a large <italic>T<sub>m</sub>
</italic> variation of 17.3°C. Some buffers enhanced BG505-SOSIP <italic>T<sub>m</sub>
</italic> by up to +6.8°C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, compared to the base <italic>T<sub>m</sub>
</italic> of 65.7°C in the 1 x PBS, pH 7.4 stock buffer; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref> for full buffer compositions).</p>
<p id="P9">Thus, in a single experiment, the top candidate buffers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, top 10) can be differentiated from the buffers that result in sub-optimal vaccine stability (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, bottom 10). Importantly, the full FORMOscreen® analysis of BG5050-SOSIP (duplicate experiments) required only 80 <italic>µ</italic>g protein and was completed within a single day (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>DLS-characterization of BG505-SOSIP</title>
<p id="P10">The ten buffers with the highest and lowest BG505-SOSIP <italic>T<sub>m</sub>
</italic> were selected for Prometheus Panta Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) characterization with respect to BG5050-SOSIP hydrodynamic radius and polydispersity index (PDI) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, no clear correlations were observed between <italic>T<sub>m</sub>
</italic> on the one hand and the hydrodynamic radius and PDI on the other hand. This suggests that while <italic>T<sub>m</sub>
</italic> is a suitable parameter for judging the thermal stability of a protein and, to a first approximation, the equilibrium between folded and unfolded state at lower temperatures, it should not be taken as a measure of protein homogeneity at ambient temperatures.</p>
<p id="P11">Two buffers illustrate this observation very well: Buffer 9 resulted in the highest overall <italic>T<sub>m</sub>
</italic> of BG505-SOSIP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). However, the hydrodynamic radius of BG505-SOSIP in buffer 9 was also among the largest radii observed, second highest standard deviation and the PDI of 0.28 indicated a polydisperse sample quality. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows the DLS and nanoDSF data in detail. The relative frequency plot makes clear that in addition to the main BG505-SOSIP species with <italic>r<sub>h</sub>
</italic> of 7-8 nm, additional, larger species (<italic>r<sub>h</sub>
</italic> around 100 nm) are present. These larger species lead to a higher mean cumulant <italic>r<sub>H</sub>
</italic> and a higher PDI, as the sample is present in a more heterogenous state. The very high sensitivity of Prometheus Panta even allows for the detection of sugar species in the sample. Buffer 9 contains 80 mg/ml sucrose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) and the sugar shows up as an additional peak with <italic>r<sub>h</sub>
</italic> &lt; 1 nm. Small <italic>r<sub>h</sub>
</italic> values &lt;1.5 nm were not included in the calculation of the mean <italic>r<sub>h</sub>
</italic> and PDI, but are shown in the size distribution analysis.</p>
<p id="P12">In contrast to buffer 9, buffer 57 resulted in a 2.25°C lower melting temperature but excellent DLS parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The hydrodynamic radius of BG505-SOSIP was very well defined at 7.18 nm and the PDI of only 0.09 indicated a very homogeneous solution. Consequently, the DLS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) only show one well defined protein species in the relative frequency plot of the size distribution analysis.</p>
<p id="P13">To complete the picture, the detailed DLS analysis confirmed that in some cases there is a clear correlation between low melting temperature and sub-optimal solution properties. For example, buffer 70 resulted in a very large cumulant protein radius (12.0 nm, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), which is also evident from the relative frequency plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) and also significantly destabilized BG505-SOSIP.</p>
<p id="P14">A unique feature of Prometheus Panta is the ability to collect all revelant DLS data (<italic>r<sub>h</sub>
</italic> and PDI) not only isothermally, but across a temperature gradient between 25 and 95°C. In general, the temperature at which the average particle size begins to increase (<italic>T<sub>size</sub>
</italic>) correlates well with the onset of thermal unfolding (<italic>T<sub>onset</sub>
</italic>). For example, <italic>T<sub>size</sub>
</italic> is higher for buffers 9 and 57 than for buffer 70, which also had the lowest <italic>T<sub>m</sub>
</italic> of those three buffers. Another significant advantage over other DLS instruments is the ultra-low sample consumption of Prometheus Panta. The full DLS-characterization of BG505-SOSIP in the 20 selected FORMOscreen® buffers was done with just 60 <italic>µ</italic>g of protein and within a 2 hour measurement time.</p>

<title>Accelerated-stress matrix analysis</title>
<p id="P15">Up to this point, a promising candidate for a BG505-SOSIP formulation buffer has been identified in FORMO-screen<sup>®</sup> buffer 57. But for a successful application of buffer 57, more knowledge about long-term effects on BG505-SOSIP are required. For this, accelerated-stress studies are usually done to test the stress-response of the vaccine candidate. As there are no clearly defined regulatory guidelines for accelerated-stress analysis of vaccine proteins, we selected certain prevalent testing conditions from the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]: (i) Thermal stress at 25, 40, and 60°C for up to 14 days, (ii) oxidative stress in presence of hydrogen peroxide and 25, 40, and 60°C for up to 14 days, (iii) mechanical stress by shaking and vortexing, and (iv) freeze-thaw stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">The FORMOscreen<sup>®</sup> buffer 57 is very well suited for long-term storage of BG505-SOSIP. At 25°C and 40°C storage temperature, the hydrodynamic radius of BG505-SOSIP and the solution PDI do not significantly change over the course of two weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Only after prolonged storage at 60°C the hydrodynamic radius roughly doubles, which indicates conformational changes or partial protein unfolding and the PDI increases to &gt;0.3, indicating an inhomogeneous solution quality. Even under oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">C</xref>), radius and PDI are not affected at all at 25°C and only slightly affected at 40°C. The observed radius increase at 60°C is more pronounced under additional oxidative stress. Buffer 57 also enables BG505-SOSIP to tolerate severe mechanical stress at ambient temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">E</xref>; vortexing for 20 minutes) and five freeze-thaw cycles; both hydro-dynamic radius and PDI are practically identical to their pre-stress values.</p>
<p id="P17">Importantly, the full accelerated-stress study of BG505-SOSIP in buffer 57 could be done with only 280 <italic>µ</italic>g of protein due to the exceptional sensitivity and ultra-low samples consumption of Prometheus Panta. Moreover, not considering incubation and storage times, the analysis took only two working days <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<sec id="S9">
<title>DLS-based interaction analysis of BG505-SOSIP - antibody complexes</title>
<p id="P18">A successful vaccine formulation must also ensure induction of proper immune response. A critical quality control criterion in modern reverse vaccinology is high affinity binding of the vaccine to well characterized protecting antibodies. While many different assay formats and technologies can be used to test vaccine-antibody binding, the same instrument platform, herein used for optimizing formulation conditions, can also be applied for direct validation of BG505-SOSIP epitope binding integrity. This rather uncommon approach does not require any labeling, immobilization or any other treatment of vaccine or antibody. Moreover, this method can be performed directly on the same Prometheus Panta instrument that was used for formulation development.</p>
<p id="P19">The method of choice is “continuous variation” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], in which the total molar concentration of both interaction partners (BG505-SOSIP and neutralizing IgG1<italic>
<sub>κ</sub>
</italic> antibodies) is kept constant but the molar ratio between them is continuously varied from 100% BG505-SOSIP to 100% antibody over a large number of samples (typically &gt;20). For each sample, the cumulant <italic>r<sub>h</sub>
</italic> was determined via Prometheus Panta DLS size analysis and plotted against the molar ratio of antibody:total protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p id="P20">First, we tested binding of the broadly-neutralizing antibody PGT145, which is known to bind exclusively to BG505-SOSIP trimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. The continuous variation plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) has a maximum at a molar ratio of 0.5, indicating a 1:1 interaction stoichiometry between the BG505-SOSIP trimers and PGT145. The average hydrodynamic radius at this molar ratio was 9.0±0.1 nm. The samples with only BG505-SOSIP or only PGT145 antibody resulted in the expected radii; e.g. 7.0±0.1 nm for BG505-SOSIP and 5.7±0.1 nm for the antibody.</p>
<p id="P21">Next, a different antibody, 2G12, was tested, which binds each BG505-SOSIP protomer individually via an epitope on the outer domain of the gp120 subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. As expected, the average radius increases with increasing molar ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) and seems to approach a maximum around a molar ratio of 0.75, congruent with the described 1:3 binding stoichiometry. Above the molar ratio of 0.75, however, the average radius strongly increases to around 40 nm. A possible explanation for this observation is the ability of 2G12 to bind BG505-SOSIP with a second, much weaker affinity interaction. This may lead to inter-molecular cross-linking of two or more BG505-SOSIP trimers by 2G12. Even at low, absolute concentrations of the 2G12 (i.e. high molar ratios), this behavior was observed. This is not surprising, because larger particles scatter light much more intensely (according to Rayleigh approximation, the scattering intensity is proportional to d<sup>6</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] and thus just a few cross-linked, large protein-antibody complexes can mask all other scattering signals in the average radius analysis. Consequently, without any BG505-SOSIP, the cumulant <italic>r<sub>h</sub>
</italic> for 2G12 drops to 5.76 nm. This showcases one limitation of such a continuous variation binding assay: The hydrodynamic radii of the involved species must not deviate from each other with a factor &gt;2 (or in other words, the molecular weights of the involved species should not be more different than 5-fold) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. A control with a non-related antibody (The NIST monoclonal antibody (NISTmAb) reference material, RM 8671) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] did not show signs of an interaction and the average hydrodynamic radius continuously changed from the BG505-SOSIP radius to that of the antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="P22">For improving the thermal stability, solution homogeneity, stress-tolerance, aggregation propensity and epitope accessibility of HIV spike-like vaccine candidate BG505-SOSIP, we tested the sophisticated buffer matrix FORMOscreen<sup>®</sup> on a Prometheus Panta instrument. FORMOscreen<sup>®</sup> buffer 57 has been shown comprehensively to be a perfect candidate for formulating the BG505-SOSIP HIV-1 vaccine candidate: The protein is highly stable in this buffer, has a very well-defined hydrodynamic radius, is very homogeneous, and keeps these properties even under stress. The results of this showcase study impressively demonstrate the accelerated process of finding optimal formulation conditions at unmatched efficiency. We successfully improved critical biophysical parameters of the antiviral vaccine candidate with minimal sample consumption and extremely shortened experimental measurement time. Ultimately, optimal formulation conditions improve the likeliness of an antiviral vaccine candidate to be successfully developed and ensure that its beneficial, protective effect can be safely delivered to patients.</p>
