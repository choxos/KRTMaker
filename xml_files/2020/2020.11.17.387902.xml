<abstract>
<p id="P1">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have resulted in a number of severe cases of COVID-19 and deaths worldwide. However, knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection, diseases and therapy remains limited, underlining the urgency of fundamental studies and drug development. Studies have shown that induction of autophagy and hijacking of autophagic machinery are essential for infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2; however, the mechanism of this manipulation and function of autophagy during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unclear. In the present study, we identified ORF3 as an inducer of autophagy and revealed that ORF3 localizes to the ER and induces FAM134B-related ERphagy through the HMGB1-Beclin1 pathway. As a consequence, ORF3 induces ER stress and inflammatory responses through ERphagy and sensitizes cells to ER stress-induced cell death, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3 hijacks ERphagy and then harms ER homeostasis to induce inflammatory responses through excessive ER stress. These findings reveal a sequential induction of ERphagy, ER stress and acute inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide therapeutic potential for ERphagy and ER stress-related drugs for COVID-19 treatment and prevention.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The pandemic COVID-19 outbreak has infected more than fifty million people and killed more than one million people worldwide, and the number of patients and deaths are still rapidly increasing. Effective treatments and therapy are still far from satisfactory; the development of specific drugs, therapy and vaccines is quite urgent. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of COVID-19. As an emerging severe coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is highly homologous to two other severe coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, which have caused two pandemic outbreaks in the past twenty years<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 infection in high-risk populations, such as older persons and persons with underlying diseases, often causes severe respiratory failure, sepsis and even multiple organ failure, accompanied by severe acute inflammation and excessive cytokine release known as a “cytokine storm”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. To date, knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease remains very limited.</p>
<p id="P3">Autophagy is a conserved physiological process in eukaryotic cells that separates and wraps intracellular waste, damaged organelles and invasive microorganisms into double-membrane vacuoles and eventually degrades them through lysosomes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. It is finely regulated through many core autophagy-related genes and several upstream signal cascades that are primarily initiated from amino acid and glucose deprivation, extracellular stimuli, intracellular damage and so on<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. Autophagy plays essential roles in cell activities and behaviors, mainly maintaining intracellular homeostasis, removing intracellular threats, repairing organelle damage and protecting cells from death<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. However, excessive autophagy also hastens cell death<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. While autophagy has exhibited great therapeutic potential in many diseases<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>, safe and effective approaches in clinical applications still require prolonged development.</p>
<p id="P4">Autophagy usually eliminates invading viral infection and promotes antiviral responses; however, autophagy can also be hijacked by viruses to facilitate infection, replication and pathogenesis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. Many enveloped viruses often enter, replicate, mature and transport through autophagy-related vesicles<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. Thus, autophagy inhibition by genetic approaches or inhibitors effectively suppresses viral infection and diseases<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, autophagy has become a promising therapeutic target for viral infectious diseases.</p>
<p id="P5">Coronaviruses differentially regulate autophagy through distinct mechanisms. For example, several viral proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and MHV induce autophagy for viral infection and replication<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>, whereas MERS-CoV Nsp6 inhibits autophagy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. However, autophagy inhibition by different drugs and inhibitors effectively blocks their infection and replication, and coronaviruses likely require low levels of basic autophagy for viral entry and incomplete autophagy for virion assembly and maturation.</p>
<p id="P6">Previous studies have shown that the autophagy inhibitors CQ and HCQ significantly suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>, leading to hopes that COVID-19 might be defeated by modulating autophagy. However, ineffectiveness or no observed benefit of CQ and its derivatives has been confirmed in clinical trials of COVID-19 therapies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>, indicating that autophagy-related therapeutic strategies are still far from clinical application. Importantly, the infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 requires activation of autophagy, and autophagy-like double-membrane vesicles are employed for viral RNA export and viral replication<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, elucidating the fine regulation of autophagy by SARS-CoV-2 and its function during infection and replication is quite urgent for understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis and for developing autophagy-related therapies and drugs for COVID-19 treatment. In the present study, we performed systemic screening and found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3 induces ERphagy through the HMGB1-Beclin1 axis, consequently activating ER stress and inflammatory responses through ERphagy and sensitizing cells to ER stress-related cell death. Our findings reveal a novel induction of autophagy, ER stress and inflammatory responses by SARS-CoV-2 and provide a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 treatment and drug development.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="S3">
<title>A systemic screening identified that ORF3 induces autophagy</title>
<p id="P7">To investigate how SARS-CoV-2 regulates autophagy, systemic screening of a viral protein-expressing library was performed using the Gaussia luciferase-based autophagy reporter actin-LC3-DN, which detects the cleavage of pro-LC3, a key precursor of the autophagic protein LC3/ATG8<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. After two rounds of screening, we identified several viral proteins that may decrease autophagy-dependent pro-LC3 cleavage; comparatively, ORF3 increases autophagy-dependent pro-LC3 cleavage in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). To confirm that ORF3 serves as an inducer of autophagy, an ORF3-expressing plasmid was transfected into cells without or followed by HBSS starvation. The shift of LC3-I to LC3-II was obviously enhanced, while the p62 level was decreased by ORF3 expression; both were augmented under HBSS starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, we detected the activation of one key kinase, Akt, which negatively regulates autophagy, and found that Akt phosphorylation was greatly decreased by ORF3 expression, similar to HBSS starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). To further visualize the autophagosome in the absence or presence of ORF3 expression, the ORF3-expressing plasmid was cotransfected with GFP-LC3- or ptfLC3-expressing plasmid. Increased GFP-LC3 puncta were observed in the presence of ORF3 expression compared with empty vector transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), and the formation of LC3-positive autophagosomes (yellow puncta) and the maturation of autolysosomes (red puncta) were similarly enhanced by ORF3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Similarly, by electron microscopy, increased doublemembrane vacuoles of autophagy were observed in ORF3-expressing cells compared with few autophagic vacuoles in empty vector-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results suggest that ORF3 overexpression significantly induced autophagy.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>ORF3 localizes to the ER and induces FAM134B-mediated ERphagy</title>
<p id="P8">To investigate the type of autophagy induced by ORF3, the subcellular location of ORF3 was determined by immunofluorescence. We found that OFR3 colocalized with ER membrane protein reticulon 3 (RTN3) around the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) and low colocalization levels with the autophagosome marker LC3 was observed, suggesting that ORF3 localizes to the ER but not in autophagic vacuoles. Alternatively, low colocalization levels of ORF3 with lysosomal red dye LysoTracker was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Then, we presumed that ORF3 regulates ER-related autophagy, and the receptor of ERphagy FAM134B was determined in the absence or presence of ORF3 overexpression. The expression of FAM134B was not affected by ORF3 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>), while colocalization of ORF3 and FAM134B was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, FAM134B puncta were induced in the presence of ORF3 expression compared with the few FAM134B puncta observed in cells in the absence of ORF3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results suggest that ORF3 promotes FAM134B-related ERphagy.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>ORF3 interacts with HMGB1 and induces Beclin-1-dependent autophagy</title>
<p id="P9">To investigate how ORF3 induces autophagy, we investigated public SARS-CoV-2 viral protein-binding protein network resources and found that several ORF3-binding proteins are involved in autophagy regulation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>. Five proteins were depleted by shRNA, and the effect on ORF3-induced autophagy was carefully detected. Depletion of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) greatly suppressed the ability of ORF3 to induce autophagy, whereas VPS11 and VPS39 depletion only weakly affected autophagy induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). As expected, the level of LC3-I-to-LC3-II shift induced by ORF3 was greatly decreased by HMGB1 shRNA in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 3B</xref>), confirming that HMGB1 is required for ORF3-induced autophagy. Furthermore, the interaction between ORF3 and HMGB1 was observed when both were transiently overexpressed in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). HMGB1 is associated with Beclin1 to enhance autophagy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>, and the increased interaction of ORF3 with HMGB1 enhanced the association of Beclin1 with HMGB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that ORF3 interacts with HMGB1 to enhance the HMGB1-Beclin1 association and subsequently induce autophagy.</p>
<p id="P10">In addition, ORF3 interacts with HMOX1, and depletion of HMOX1 moderately attenuates the LC3-I to LC3-II shift in the presence of ORF3 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B and S3C</xref>), indicating that HMOX1 may be involved in ORF3 induction in autophagy. Given that HMOX1 contributes to oxidative stress and HMGB1 acts as a key regulator of autophagy under oxidative stress, HMOX1 and HMGB1 may cooperate in the regulation of autophagy under oxidative stress in the presence of ORF3 expression.</p>
<p id="P11">To further detect the role of Beclin1 in ORF3 regulation in autophagy, wild-type or Beclin1-deficient cells (Beclin1-KO) were transfected with ORF3-expressing plasmid, ORF3-induced increase of LC3-II/LC3-I shift and decrease of p62 level was completely attenuated in Beclin1-KO cells compared with that in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results suggest that ORF3 induces Beclin1-dependent autophagy through the HMGB1-Beclin1 pathway.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>ORF3 induces ER stress and inflammatory responses through ERphagy</title>
<p id="P12">To further investigate the function of ORF3-induced autophagy, the transcriptome of ORF3-expressing A549 cells was analyzed by RNA-sequencing analysis. The differentially expressed gene (DEG) clusters were enriched by GSEA analysis. ORF3-induced enriched DEGs shared high similarity to the DEGs in SARS-COV-2- and MERS-CoV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). Interestingly, ER stress-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, top) and innate immune and inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, middle and bottom) were enriched in the presence of ORF3 expression, indicating that ORF3 activates both ER stress and inflammatory responses. Alternatively, 97 DEGs were upregulated in both SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and ORF3-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>), and a cluster of genes involved in ER stress and immune and inflammatory responses were highly upregulated by both ORF3 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>), suggesting that ORF3 plays a critical role in the induction of ER stress and inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P13">To confirm that ER stress was induced by ORF3 expression, ER stress-related gene expression was detected in ORF3-expressing cells. The expression of BIP/Grp78 and CHOP gradually increased following increasing ORF3 expression, and the phosphorylation of eIF2α was similarly increased by ORF3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Notably, the induction of ER stress by ORF3 expression requires autophagy, and the increased BIP/Grp78 and CHOP expression and eIF2α phosphorylation were completely abolished in Beclin1-KO cells compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, depletion of the ER stress-related gene CHOP barely affected autophagy induction by ORF3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating that ORF3 induces autophagy independent of ER stress. These results suggest that ORF3 induces ER stress through autophagy induction, probably because ORF3-induced excessive ERphagy reprograms or disrupts ER homeostasis.</p>
<p id="P14">ER dysfunction often triggers innate immune and inflammatory responses; thus, the expression of key cytokines and the proinflammatory factors IFNβ, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα were induced by ORF3 expression. The induction of these factors was dependent on autophagy because Beclin1 deficiency in Beclin1-KO cells abolished the increased expression of these cytokines compared with that in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Similarly, depletion of CHOP expression also greatly attenuated their increased expression in the presence of ORF3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). These results suggest that ORF3 induces ER stress and subsequent inflammatory responses through ERphagy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>ORF3-induced ERphagy and ER stress sensitize cells to ER apoptotic cell death</title>
<p id="P15">Considering that ORF3 induces ER stress, we presumed that ORF3 disrupts ER function and promotes cell death under ER dysfunction. ORF3-expressing A549 cells were treated with tunicamycin, an inducer of ER stress that causes an unfolded protein response and induces ER stress by inhibiting the N-linked glycosylation of GlcNAc phosphotransferase. Under tunicamycin treatment, the phosphorylation of the stress-related kinases p38-MAPK and SAPK/JNK was increased in the presence of ORF3 expression as well as c-Jun phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, top). Importantly, the cleavage of ER-specific caspase-12 was increased by ORF3 expression under tunicamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, bottom). These results suggest that ORF3 enhances ER apoptotic cell death under ER stress.</p>
<p id="P16">To confirm that the increased cell death is responsible for ERphagy and ER stress, ER apoptotic cell death was further investigated under deficiency of autophagy or ER stress in Beclin1-KO or CHOP depleted cells, respectively. ORF3-induced phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK and cleavage of caspase-12 were greatly eliminated when ERphagy was blocked in Beclin1-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that ERphagy was required for ORF3-induced ER-related apoptosis. Similarly, the blockade of ER stress by CHOP depletion also eliminated ER-related apoptosis in ORF3-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Altogether, our results suggest that ORF3 overexpression triggers ER stress and ER abnormalities through ERphagy and consequently enhances the sensitivity of apoptosis to ER stress-related drugs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P17">Studies have confirmed that autophagy plays essential roles in the infection and replication of coronaviruses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>; inhibition by genetic approaches and chemical inhibitors effectively suppresses their infection and might offer a promising therapeutic strategy for treating these infectious diseases. As an emerging severe coronavirus, the modulation and function of autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection and diseases remain unclear. By systemic screening, we revealed that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3 localizes to the ER compartment and induces FAM134B-mediated ERphagy through the HMGB1-Beclin1 pathway, subsequently contributing to ER stress and activating proinflammatory responses through ERphagy and ER functional reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). As a consequence, sensitivity to ER stress-related drugs and ER apoptotic cell death are greatly enhanced in ORF3-expressing cells. This improves the therapeutic potential of autophagy- and ER stress-related drugs in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease for suppressing severe inflammatory responses and inducing cell death in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.</p>
<p id="P18">The autophagy inhibitor chloroquine and its derivative suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>, raising important hopes in therapeutic COVID-19 treatment and prevention. Although poor effectiveness and benefit have been concluded in clinical trials<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>, autophagy is confirmed to play essential roles in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. First, coronaviruses enter cells through endocytosis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup> and egress through lysosomes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>, which require a fine control of autophagy and lysosomal degradation. Second, a recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication require autophagosome-like double-membrane vacuoles for RNA export and replication<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>, indicating the essential requirement of autophagy and autophagic machinery for viral replication and assembly. Finally, the maturation and transport of virions of SARS-CoV-2 might also require autophagy or autophagic vacuoles like other RNA viruses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. However, excessive autophagy is not beneficial to either cells or viruses because killing infected cells or clearing intracellular viral infection by strong autophagy induction is an effective antiviral defense. Therefore, autophagic processes are finely regulated to limit the appropriate strength and duration for facilitating cell survival and viral replication. Inhibitory viral proteins or other products of autophagy must exist during SARS-CoV-2 infection, as indicated in our preliminary screening; i.e., several viral proteins can suppress autophagy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). In fact, several viral proteins of coronaviruses induce incomplete autophagy, and replication of coronaviruses utilizes the autophagic machinery while not requiring the complete genes and pathways of autophagy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. Thus, more viral regulation of autophagy and its function in SARS-CoV-2 infection require further investigation.</p>
<p id="P19">Our findings reveal that ORF3-induced ERphagy reprograms ER homeostasis and activates ER stress, probably to tolerate and adapt to the accumulation of viral proteins and recover ER function under virus-induced stresses. Many viral proteins of coronavirus rush to the ER<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup> and form double-membrane vacuoles from the ER for viral replication<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. We confirmed that ORF3 localizes to the ER and induces FAM134B-mediated ERphagy. Consequently, ORF3 induces ER stress through Beclin1-dependent autophagy, and Beclin1 deficiency abolishes the activation of ER stress in the presence of ORF3 expression, representing a novel induction of adaptive ER stress through ERphagy during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, ERphagy and ER stress are activated by SARS-CoV-2 through ORF3 to restrict the appropriate overload of viral proteins in the ER membrane and lumen, recycle overloaded viral proteins or repair ER damage.</p>
<p id="P20">As a consequence, ERphagy and ER stress induced by ORF3 reprogram ER function and activate inflammatory responses. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection in diverse cells induces ER stress and activates proinflammatory responses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup>. Our studies confirmed that inflammatory responses are mainly induced by ORF3 through ERphagy-mediated ER stress, and blockade of ERphagy by Beclin1 KO or ER stress by CHOP depletion greatly eliminates the induction of key cytokines and inflammatory factors. This provides evidence that ERphagy and ER stress are the key upstream modulators of inflammatory responses during SARV-CoV-2 infection and may act as first-line precipitating factors of cytokine storms in COVID-19 patients, offering a novel target and approach to alleviating acute inflammatory responses during early SARS-CoV-2 infection through suppression of autophagy and ER stress.</p>
<p id="P21">Finally, considering that ER stress is activated and ER function is reprogrammed by ORF3 expression, we presumed that ORF3 may enhance the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells to ER stress-related drugs. Indeed, ORF3-expressing cells are sensitive to ER stress-drug tunicamycin treatment. The stress-related kinases p38-MAPK and SAPK/JNK were activated and ER apoptotic caspase-12 cleavage was enhanced by ORF3 in the presence of tunicamycin treatment. Correspondingly, they were abolished in Beclin1-deficient cells or CHOP-depleted cells separately, indicating that ORF3 enhances ER apoptotic cell death through excessive ERphagy and ER stress. These findings also support the therapeutic potential of ERphagy and ER stress in COVID-19 treatment, consistent with a hypothesis that ER stress is increased in COVID-19 patients and may benefit treatment<sup>

<p id="P22">In summary, our studies identified a novel viral inducer of autophagy during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that ORF3 localizes to the ER and triggers ERphagy through the HMGB1-Beclin1 pathway, consequently inducing ER stress and inflammatory responses. Our findings revealed a sequential induction of ERphagy, ER stress and inflammatory responses by SARS-CoV-2 ORF3 expression, facilitate insight into the hijacking of autophagy, reprogramming of ER function and activation of acute inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis, and offer a novel therapeutic target for COVID-19 treatment by suppressing autophagy and modulating ER stress.</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analysis</title>
<p id="P26">In brief, one 10-cm dish of cells was transfected with 10-15 μg plasmid for 48 h. The cells were then collected and lysed in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors. For immunoprecipitation, the same amounts of cell lysates were precleaned and incubated with antibodies at 4°C overnight, and then protein complexes were precipitated with protein G-agarose, or the precleaned cell lysates were incubated with GST affinity beads at 4°C overnight. After washing five times, the immunoprecipitated complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. For Western blotting, 40-60 μg protein of whole cell extracts per lane was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% dry milk, incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight, and subsequently incubated with species-matched IRDye680- or IRDye800-labeled secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. After 5 washes, images were visualized using a LI-COR Odyssey system.</p>

<p id="P29">A Gaussia luciferase-based reporter to detect pre-LC3 cleavage was used for the detection of autophagy activation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. Briefly, the Actin-LC3-DN reporter was transfected into HEK293T cells with either empty vector or Flag-ORF3-expressing plasmid in a 96-well plate. Twenty-four hours later, the cell supernatants were collected, and the secretion of Gaussia luciferase was measured using the reagent for the measurement of Renilla luciferase activity in a TriStar multimode reader. For each analysis, three independent experiments were performed in triplicate, and the mean ± SD was calculated.</p>

The medium was removed, and the cell pellets were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde overnight at 4°C. The pellets were gently collected and placed in a specimen bottle containing 3% glutaraldehyde for fixation for another 24 h. After the fixed solution was discarded, the cells were rinsed with 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 1 h, washed 3-4 times, and fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. This was followed by another 3×10 min washes in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 1 h. After dehydration through a series of ethanol washes from 30% to 2 washes in 100%, the cells were incubated in a mixture of Epon and propylene oxide (3:1 in v/v) for 90 min, embedded in a mold of 100% plastic, placed in a 70°C oven and allowed to harden overnight (Epon 812). The cells were cut using a diamond knife to obtain ultrathin slices; the slices were placed on a hexadecimal copper grid (Electron Microscopy Science, H200-Cu). After drying for 2 h, transmission electron microscopy was performed on these grids using an FEI Tecnai G<sup>2</sup> Spirit Twin electron microscope (13500×).</p>

<title>Importance</title>

<p>SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication require autophagosome-like double-membrane vacuoles. Inhibition of autophagy suppresses viral replication, indicating the essential role of autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, how SARS-CoV-2 hijacks autophagy and the function of autophagy in the disease progression remain unknown. Here, we reveal that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3 induces ERphagy and consequently induces ER stress to trigger acute inflammatory responses and enhance sensitivity to ER stress-induced apoptosis. Our studies uncover ERphagy-induced inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a promising therapeutic approach for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection and inflammatory responses in COVID-19 by manipulating autophagy and ER stress.</p>

<p>During SARS-CoV-2 infection, ORF3 interacts with HMGB1 and enhances the association between HMGB1 and Beclin1 to initiate FAM134B-mediated ERphagy. Consequently, ER stress is induced by ORF3 through ERphagy to trigger proinflammatory responses and enhance the sensitivity of cells to caspase-12-mediated ER apoptotic cell death.</p>
