In addition, this type of interferon theoretically has therapeutic advantages, in comparison with type I interferons, due to its ability to activate a narrower group of genes in a relatively small group of target cells. Hence, it can elicit more targeted antiviral or immunomodulatory responses. Obtaining biologically-active interferon lambda (hIFN-λ<sub>1</sub>) is fraught with difficulties at the stage of expression in soluble form or, in the case of expression in the form of inclusion bodies, at the stage of refolding. In this work, hIFN-λ1 was expressed in the form of inclusion bodies, and a simple, effective refolding method was developed. Efficient and scalable methods for chromatographic purification of recombinant hIFN-λ1 were also developed. High-yield, high-purity product was obtained through optimization of several processes including: recombinant protein expression; metal affinity chromatography; cation exchange chromatography; and an intermediate protein refolding stage. The obtained protein was shown to have expected, specific biological activity in line with published effects: induction of MxA gene expression in A549 cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Interferon-lambda</kwd><kwd>immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography</kwd><kwd>cation exchange chromatography</kwd><kwd>refolding</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Interferons play a critical role in the immune response by suppressing viral spread in the early stages of infection and form the first line of defense against viral infection in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].

Type III interferons (lambda interferons, IFN-λ) are related to type I interferons (interferon-α and interferon-β) and demonstrate a similar antiviral effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Type III interferons are promising therapeutic agents that can induce a more targeted antiviral or immunomodulatory response than other interferon types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Such interferons primarily affect viruses that target cells of the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, or liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Thus, type III interferons exhibit antiviral activity against a number of respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses: influenza virus; metapneumovirus; respiratory syncytial virus; coronavirus; and rotavirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Availability of a simple, effective method for producing type III interferons is a necessary prerequisite for further research of its potential as an antiviral or immunomodulatory agent. In previously published work, methods for production of recombinant hIFN-λ1 in soluble form with the proteolytically cleaved S-tag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], and in the form of inclusion bodies with 6His-tag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], have been proposed. In this work, we cloned and expressed recombinant human interferon-λ1 (hIFN-λ1). Along with the 6His-tag, inclusion body approach, we propose: a simple and effective refolding method; and an efficient, potentially-scalable chromatographic purification method. The hIFN-λ1 produced features specific activity suitable for research and, potentially, future diagnostic or therapeutic application.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Materials</title><p id="P3">Reagents obtained from Sigma included: tris base; Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>; NaCl; EDTA; PMSF; Tween 20; glycerol; acetonitrile; TFA; trehalose; L-arginine; sodium acetate; acetic acid; HCl; and urea.

Therefore, it was decided to perform the first purification step under denaturing conditions, followed by refolding of the partially purified protein. Ni-Sepharose 6FF resin (prepacked HisTrap FF Crude columns) was chosen because of its high dynamic binding capacity (about 35 mg of hIFN-λ<sub>1</sub> per 1 ml of sorbent) and the possibility of further scale-up.

Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation for 1 hour at 20,000 g. Supernatants were collected and dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline for 24 hours, followed by filtration through a PES syringe filter (0.2 μm pore size).

Conductivity of the protein solution after refolding was about 5 mS/cm; therefore, it does not interfere with subsequent ion-exchange chromatography. There is thus no need for dialysis or diafiltration of the refolded protein solution.

With comparison of different cation exchange resins, the best results (maximum protein yield, minimal impurities) were noted (data not shown) with resins featuring particle size of 15 μm or less, such as Source 15S (GE Healthcare) and ENrich S (Bio-Rad). Source 15S was selected because of higher flow rates and availability for purchase in bulk (for potential process scale-up later). The chromatogram of the final protein purification step is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>. The target protein eluted in the conductivity range from 45 to 65 mS/cm.

In the area marked with an arrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), the 6xHis-hIFN-λ<sub>1</sub> recombinant protein was reliably identified (Score/threshold was 156/76, sequence coverage 70%). Additional hydrolysis with chymotrypsin extends the sequence coverage to 85%. Protein sequences found in mass spectra are highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>.

Concentrations of hIFN-λ<sub>1</sub> were determined by the Lowry method. These results show that a constant +4°C temperature is the preferred storage condition for recombinant hIFN-λ<sub>1</sub> protein, not <sup>-</sup> 80°C followed by thawing. Increasing the stability of the protein product is a priority goal for further improvement of this method. Ideally, this would minimize changes associated with one or more ‘freeze-thaw’ cycles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23"><label>3.5</label><title>Confirmation of biological activity</title><sec id="S24"><label>3.5.1</label><title>Limulus amebocyte lysate testing</title><p id="P33">In order to exclude the possibility of stimulation of A549 cells by bacterial lipopolysaccharides, the endotoxin level was determined by LAL test. The results show that recombinant hIFN-λ<sub>1</sub> solution contains endotoxin at a concentration of about 25 EU/ml, which corresponds to no more than 5 ng/ml of endotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. The concentration of the analyzed sample was 620 μg/ml. Consequently, there was less than 0.05 EU endotoxin per μg of protein, which is in line with commercial analogues on the market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Thus, endotoxins present in the solution should not significantly affect the immune response of cells. Moreover, it has been shown that lipopolysaccharides do not induce the production of either IFN-α/β or IFN-λ in respiratory epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].

The level of MxA expression increased by more than 20-fold. Since MxA is an interferon-stimulated gene, increased expression can be considered reliable evidence of the biological activity of the obtained hIFN-λ<sub>1</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P35">In this work, we developed an efficient and potentially-scalable method for refolding and purification of recombinant human hIFN-λ<sub>1</sub>. The purified protein was confirmed to feature the expected biological activity. The developed method provides a high yield of protein with low impurity content, such as lipopolysaccharide. It is therefore potentially suitable for isolation of type III interferons not only for research and diagnostic applications, but also for therapeutic use.</p></sec></body><back><ack
