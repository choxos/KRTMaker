<abstract>
<p id="P3">Combating the COVID-19 pandemic requires potent and low-cost therapeutics. We identified a novel series of single-domain antibodies (i.e., nanobody), <italic>Nanosota-1</italic>, from a camelid nanobody phage display library. Structural data showed that <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> bound to the oft-hidden receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, blocking out viral receptor ACE2. The lead drug possessing an Fc tag (<italic>Nanosota-lC-Fc</italic>) bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with a K<sub>d</sub> of 15.7picomolar (~3000 times more tightly than ACE2 did) and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection with an ND<sub>50</sub> of 0.16microgram/milliliter (~6000 times more potently than ACE2 did). Administered at a single dose, <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> demonstrated preventive and therapeutic efficacy in hamsters subjected to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike conventional antibody drugs, <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> was produced at high yields in bacteria and had exceptional thermostability. Pharmacokinetic analysis of <italic>Nanosota-1C-F</italic>c documented a greater than 10-day <italic>in vivo</italic> half-life efficacy and high tissue bioavailability. <italic>Nanosota-lC-Fc</italic> is a potentially effective and realistic solution to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P4">The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to the COVID-19 pandemic, devastating human health and the global economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs are urgently needed to treat patients, save lives, and revive economies. Yet daunting challenges confront the development of such drugs. Though small molecule drugs could theoretically target SARS-CoV-2, they can take years to develop and their use is often limited by poor specificity and off-target effects. Repurposed drugs, developed against other viruses, also have low specificity against SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic antibodies can be identified and generally have high specificity; however, their expression in mammalian cells often leads to low yields and high production costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). A realistic therapeutic solution to COVID-19 must be potent and specific, yet easy to produce.</p>
<p id="P5">Nanobodies are unique antibodies derived from heavy chain-only antibodies found in members of the camelidae family (llamas, alpacas, camels, etc.) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Because of their small size (2.5 nm by 4 nm; 12-15 kDa) and unique binding domains, nanobodies offer many advantages over conventional antibodies including the ability to bind cryptic epitopes on their antigen, high tissue permeability, ease of production and thermostability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Although small, nanobodies bind their targets with high affinity and specificity due to an extended antigen-binding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Furthermore, it has been documented that they have low toxicity and immunogenicity in humans, if any (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). One drawback of nanobodies is their quick clearance by kidneys due to their small size; this can be overcome by adding tags to increase the molecular weight to a desired level. Underscoring the potency and safety of nanobodies as human therapeutics, a nanobody drug was recently approved for clinical use in treating a blood clotting disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">Additionally, due to their superior stability, nanobodies can be inhaled to treat lung diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) or ingested to treat intestine diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Nanobodies are currently being developed against SARS-CoV-2 to combat COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). However, to date, none of the reported nanobodies have been evaluated for therapeutic efficacy <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p id="P7">The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a prime target for therapeutic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The spike protein guides coronavirus entry into host cells by first binding to a receptor on the host cell surface and then fusing the viral and host membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). The RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and a closely related SARS-CoV-1 both recognize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Previously, we showed that SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs both contain a core structure and a receptor-binding motif (RBM), and that SARS-CoV-2 RBD has significantly higher ACE2-binding affinity than SARS-CoV-1 RBD due to several structural changes in the RBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). We further showed that SARS-CoV-2 RBD is more hidden than SARS-CoV-1 RBD in the entire spike protein as a possible viral strategy for immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Hence, to block SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2, a nanobody drug would need to bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD more tightly than ACE2.</p>
<p id="P8">Here, we report the development of a novel series of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobody therapeutics, <italic>Nanosota-1</italic>. Identified by screening a camelid nanobody phage display library against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> series bound potently to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and were effective at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection <italic>in vitro</italic>. The best performing drug, <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic>, demonstrated preventative and therapeutic efficacy in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> was produced at high yields easily scalable for mass production and was also found to have a pharmacologically relevant <italic>in vivo</italic> half-life and excellent bioavailability. Our data suggest that <italic>Nanosota-lc-Fc</italic> may provide an effective solution to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<italic>Nanosota-1</italic> was identified by phage display</title>
<p id="P9">For the rapid identification of virus-targeting nanobodies, we constructed a naïve nanobody phage display library using B cells isolated from the spleen, bone marrow, and blood of nearly a dozen non-immunized llamas and alpacas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD, expressed and purified from mammalian cells, was screened against the library to identify RBD-targeting nanobodies. Select nanobody clones were tested in a preliminary screen for their ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry into target cells (see below for more details about the assay). The nanobody that demonstrated the highest preliminary neutralization potency was named <italic>Nanosota-1A</italic> and then subjected to two rounds of affinity maturation. For each round of affinity maturation, random mutations were introduced to the whole gene of <italic>Nanosota-1A</italic> through error-prone PCR, and mutant phages were selected for enhanced binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Nanobodies contain four framework regions (FRs) as structural scaffolds and three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) for antigen binding. The nanobody after the first round of affinity maturation, named <italic>Nanosota-1B,</italic> possessed one mutation in CDR3 and two other mutations in FR3 (near CDR3). Affinity maturation of <italic>Nanosota-1B</italic> resulted in <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic>, which possessed one mutation in CDR2 and another mutation in FR2. We next made an Fc-tagged version of <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic>, termed <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic>, to create a bivalent construct with increased molecular weight.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>
<italic>Nanosota-1</italic> tightly bound to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and completely blocked out ACE2</title>
<p id="P10">To understand the structural basis for the binding of <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> drugs to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, we determined the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexed with <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic>. The structure showed that <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> binds close to the center of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). When the structures of the <italic>RBD/Nanosota-1C</italic> complex and the RBD/ACE2 complex were superimposed together, significant clashes occurred between ACE2 and <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> binding to the RBD blocks ACE2 binding to the RBD. Moreover, trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is present in two different conformations: the RBD stands up in the open conformation but lies down in the closed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). When the structures of the RBD/<italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> complex and the closed spike were superimposed together, no clash was found between RBD-bound <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> and the rest of the spike protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>). In contrast, severe clashes were identified between RBD-bound ACE2 and the rest of the spike protein in the closed conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>). Additionally, neither RBD-bound <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> nor RBD-bound ACE2 had clashes with the rest of the spike protein in the open conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2D</xref>). Thus, <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> can access the spike protein in both its open and closed conformations, whereas ACE2 can only access the spike protein in its closed conformation. Overall, our structural data reveal that <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> is an ideal RBD-targeting drug that not only blocks virus binding to its receptor, but also accesses its target in the spike protein in different conformations.</p>
<p id="P11">To corroborate our structural data on the <italic>Nanosota-1</italic>/ACE2 interactions, we performed binding experiments between <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> drugs and SARS-CoV-2 RBD using recombinant ACE2 for comparison. The binding affinity between the nanobodies and the RBD were measured by surface plasmon resonance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). <italic>Nanosota-1A</italic>,-<italic>1B</italic>, and -<italic>1C</italic> bound to the RBD with increasing affinity (K<sub>d</sub> -from 228 nM to 14 nM), confirming success of the stepwise affinity maturation. <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> had the highest RBD-binding affinity (K<sub>d</sub> -15.7 pM), which was ~3,000 times tighter than the RBD-binding affinity of ACE2. Moreover, compared with ACE2, <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> bound to the RBD with a higher <italic>k<sub>on</sub>
</italic> and a lower <italic>k<sub>off</sub>
</italic>, demonstrating significantly faster binding and slower dissociation. Next, we investigated the competitive binding among <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic>, ACE2, and RBD using protein pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>). ACE2 and <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> were mixed together in different ratios in solution, with the concentration of ACE2 kept constant; RBD-Fc was added to pull down ACE2 and <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> from solution. The result showed that as the concentration of <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> increased, less ACE2 was pulled down by the RBD. Thus, ACE2 and <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> bound competitively to the RBD. We then analyzed the competitive binding using gel filtration chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>). ACE2, <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic>, and RBD were mixed, with both ACE2 and <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> in molar excess over the RBD. Analysis by gel filtration chromatography documented that no ternary complex of ACE2, <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic>, and RBD formed; instead, only binary complexes of RBD/ACE2 and <italic>RBD/Nanosota-1C</italic> were detected. Hence, the bindings of ACE2 and <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> to the RBD are mutually exclusive.</p>

<italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>
</title>
<p id="P12">The ability of the <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> drugs to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection <italic>in vitro</italic> was investigated nex. Both a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry assay and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection assay were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). For the pseudovirus entry assay, retroviruses pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (i.e., SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses) were used to enter human ACE2-expressing HEK293T cells in the presence of an inhibitor. The efficacy of the inhibitor was expressed as the concentration capable of neutralizing 50% of the entry efficiency (i.e., 50% Neutralizing Dose or ND<sub>50</sub>). <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> had an ND<sub>50</sub> for the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus of 0.27 μg/ml, which was ~10 times more potent than monovalent <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> (2.52 μg/ml) and over 100 times more potent than ACE2 (44.8 μg/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> drugs potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus bearing the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>), which has become prevalent in many strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). For the authentic virus infection assay, live SARS-CoV-2 was used to infect Vero cells in the presence of an inhibitor. Efficacy of the inhibitor was described as the concentration capable of reducing the number of virus plaques by 50% (i.e., ND<sub>50</sub>). <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic>had an ND<sub>50</sub> of 0.16 μg/ml, which was ~20 times more potent than monovalent <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> (3.23 μg/ml) and ~6000 times more potent than ACE2 (980 μg/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). Overall, both <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> and <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> are potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P13">After the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, we next evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of the lead drug <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> in a hamster model challenged with SARS-CoV-2 via intranasal inoculation. In addition to an untreated control group, three groups of animals were injected with a single dose of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic>: (i) 24 hours pre-challenge at 20 mg/kg body weight, (ii) 4 hours post-challenge at 20 mg/kg, and (iii) 4 hours post-challenge at 10 mg/kg. As previously validated in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), body weight, tissue pathology and virus titers in nasal swabs were used as metrics of therapeutic efficacy. In the untreated control group, weight loss was precipitously starting on day 1 post-challenge with the lowest weight recorded on day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Nasal virus titers were high on day 1 and remained high on day 5 before a decline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). Pathology analysis on tissues collected on day 10 revealed moderate hyperplasia in the bronchial tubes (i.e., bronchioloalveolar hyperplasia) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>), with little hyperplasia in the lungs. These data are consistent with previous reports showing that SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects the nasal mucosa and bronchial epithelial cells of this hamster model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). In contrast, hamsters that received <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> 24-hours pre-challenge were protected from SARS-CoV-2, as evidenced by the metrics of no weight loss, no bronchioloalveolar hyperplasia, and significantly reduced nasal virus titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). When administered 4 hours post-challenge, <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> also effectively protected hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infections at either dosage (20 or 10 mg/kg), as evidenced by the favorable therapeutic metrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). Overall, <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> was effective at combating SARS-CoV-2 infections both preventively and therapeutically.</p>

<italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> is stable <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> with excellent bioavailability</title>
<p id="P14">With the lead drug <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> demonstrating therapeutic efficacy <italic>in vivo</italic>, we characterized other parameters important to its clinical translation. First, we expressed <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> in bacteria for all the experiments carried out in the current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). After purification on protein A column and gel filtration, the purity of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> was nearly 100%.

Second, we investigated the <italic>in vitro</italic> stability of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic>incubated at four temperatures (−80°C, 4°C, 25°C or 37°C) for one week and then measured the remaining SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding capacity by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). With −80°C as a baseline, <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> retained nearly all of its RBD-binding capacity at the temperatures surveyed. Third, we measured the <italic>in vivo</italic> stability of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> was injected into mice via tail vein.

Tissues were collected at various time points and biodistribution of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> was quantified by scintillation counter. After three days, <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> remained at high levels in the blood, lung, heart, kidney, liver and spleen, all of which are targets for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>); moreover, it remained at low levels in the intestine, muscle and bones. In contrast, <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> had poor biodistribution documenting high renal clearance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P15">Nanobody therapeutics derived from camelid antibodies potentially offer a realistic solution to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to conventional antibodies. Currently, there have only been a few reports of nanobody drugs that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Those reported were developed against SARS-CoV-2 RBD, either blocking out ACE2 or locking the RBD in the closed inactive state on the spike protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). None of the nanobodies have been evaluated in animal models for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic efficacy. From our novel library, we developed a series of nanobody drugs, named <italic>Nanosota-1</italic>, that specifically target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Two rounds of affinity maturation yielded <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> which bound to the RBD with high affinity. Addition of an Fc tag to make a bivalent construct with increased molecular weight and picomolar RBD-binding affinity resulted in the best performing drug <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc.</italic> Our structural and biochemical data showed that binding of <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> to the RBD blocked virus binding to viral receptor ACE2. A unique feature of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is that it is present in two different conformations, an RBD-up open conformation for receptor binding and an RBD-down closed conformation for immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Due to its small size as well as its ideal binding site on the RBD, <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> can bind to the spike protein in both conformations. In contrast, ACE2 can only bind to the spike protein in its open conformation. Thus, <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> drugs are ideal RBD-targeting therapeutics-they can chase down and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral particles whether they are infecting cells or hiding from immune surveillance. As a result of this unique property, both <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> and <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> exhibited a profound therapeutic effect <italic>in vitro</italic> against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2. <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> was also found to be the first anti-SARS-CoV-2 camelid nanobody-based therapeutic reported in the literature to demonstrate efficacy in an animal model. Additionally, <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> was the first anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobody to have been characterized for ease of production and purification, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> stabilities, and biodistribution. These features are critical for the implementation of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> as a COVID-19 therapeutic.</p>
<p id="P16">When evaluating the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency of the nanobody therapeutics, we used recombinant ACE2 as a comparison. Recombinant ACE2 was selected because <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> series directly compete with cell-surface ACE2 for the same binding site on the RBD. Our study showed that compared with ACE2, the best performing drug <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> bound to the RBD ~3000 fold more strongly, blocking out ACE2 binding to the RBD. Furthermore, compared with ACE2, <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry ~100 fold more effectively and inhibited authentic SARS-CoV-2 infections ~6000 fold more effectively. Note that recombinant ACE2 has been shown to be a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) and is currently undergoing clinical trials in Europe as an anti-COVID-19 drug. Compared with ACE2, the much higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> was due to both its much higher RBD-binding affinity and its better access to the oft-hidden RBD in the spike protein. As a result, <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> was a potent therapeutic <italic>in vivo</italic>. Remarkably, a single dose of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> effectively prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters and also effectively treated SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same model. The hamster model is one of the best non-primate models available for studying anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic efficacy, but it is limited by a short virus infection window; hence, repeated dosing was not evaluated. As a result, we were only able to dose the mice once via intraperitoneal injection. Because SARS-CoV-2 is fast acting in hamsters, the time points and dosages for drug administration in hamsters are difficult to directly translate to humans. Our supporting data document that <italic>Nanosota-1c-Fc</italic> is easy to produce in bacteria and has excellent bioavailability and pharmacokinetics when administered intravenously in mice. This suggests that <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> may have therapeutic potential when administered intraperitoneal, intravenous or even intramuscular. These parameters will need to be determined in future studies in anticipation of clinical trials. Overall, <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> has proven to be an effective therapeutic in the model that we currently have available.</p>
<p id="P17">How can the novel nanobody therapeutics help to end the COVID-19 pandemic? First, as evidence by our animal study,<italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> can be used to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because of its long <italic>in vivo</italic> half-life (&gt;10 days), a single injected dose of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> can theoretically protect a person from SARS-CoV-2 infection for days or weeks in the outpatient setting, reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in human populations. Second, we also learned from our <italic>in vivo</italic> study that <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> can potentially be used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections, thus, saving lives and alleviating symptoms in infected patients in the clinical setting. Third, though ephemeral in nature given its short half-life and rapid clearance from the blood, <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> could be used as an inhaler to treat infections in the respiratory tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) or as an oral drug to treat infections in the intestines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Overall, the novel series of <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> therapeutics can help minimize the mortality and morbidity of SARS-CoV-2 infections and help restore the economy and daily human activities. Given the wide distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the world, large quantities of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics would need to be manufactured to provide for the world’s populations. This is only feasible with easy to produce and scalable molecules, such as <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> drugs, that are produced at high yields and have long <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> half-life. Therefore, if further validated in clinical trials, <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> therapeutics can provide a realistic and effective solution to help end the COVID-19 global pandemic.</p>

<title>Construction of camelid nanobody phage display library</title>
<p id="P21">The camelid nanobody phage display library was constructed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Briefly, total mRNA was isolated from B cells from the spleen, bone marrow and blood of over a dozen non-immunized llamas and alpacas. cDNA was prepared from the mRNA. The cDNA was then used in nested PCR reactions to construct the DNA for the library. The first PCR reaction was to amplify the gene fragments encoding the variable domain of the nanobody. The second PCR reaction (PCR2) was used to add restriction sites (SFI-I), a PelB leader sequence, a His<sub>6</sub> tag, and a HA tag. The PCR2 product was digested with SFI-I (New England Biolabs) and then was ligated with SFI-I-digested PADL22c vector.

<title>Construction of a camelid nanobody phage display library and use of this library for screening of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies.</title>
<p>A large-sized (diversity 7.5 × 10<sup>10</sup>), naïve nanobody phage display library was constructed using B cells of over a dozen llamas and alpacas. Phages were screened for their high binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Nanobodies expressed from the selected phages were further screened for their potency in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry. The best performing nanobody was subjected to two rounds of affinity maturation.</p>

<title>Efficacy of <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> drugs in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infections <italic>in vitro</italic>.</title>
<p>(A) Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry into target cells by one of three inhibitors: <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic>, <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic>, and recombinant human ACE2. Retroviruses pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (i.e., SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses) were used to enter HEK293T cells expressing human ACE2 in the presence of the inhibitor at various concentrations. Entry efficiency was characterized via a luciferase signal indicating successful cell entry. Data are the mean ±SEM (n = 4). Nonlinear regression was performed using a log (inhibitor) versus normalized response curve and a variable slope model (R<sup>2</sup>&gt; 0.95 for all curves). The efficacy of each inhibitor was expressed as the 50% Neutralizing Dose or ND<sub>50</sub>. The assay was repeated three times (biological replication: new aliquots of pseudoviruses and cells were used for each repeat). (B) Neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection of target cells by one of two inhibitors: <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> and <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic>. The potency of <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> drugs in neutralizing authentic SARS-CoV-2 infections was evaluated using a SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) assay. 80 pfu infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles were used to infect Vero E6 cells in the presence of the inhibitor at various concentrations. Infection was characterized as the number of virus plaques formed in overlaid cells. Images of virus plaques for each inhibitor at the indicated concentrations are shown. Each image represents data from triplications. The efficacy of each inhibitor was calculated and expressed as the concentration capable of reducing the number of virus plaques by 50% (i.e., ND<sub>50</sub>). The assay was repeated twice (biological replication: new aliquots of virus particles and cells were used for each repeat).</p>

<title>Efficacy of <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> drugs in protecting hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infections.</title>
<p>Hamsters (6 per group) were injected with a single dose of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> at the indicated time point and the indicated dosage. At day 0 all groups (experimental and control) were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 (at a titer of 10<sup>6</sup> Median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose or TCID50). (A) Body weights of hamsters were monitored on each day and percent change in body weight relative to day 0 was calculated for each hamster.</p>
<p>Data are the mean ±SEM (n = 6). ANOVA on group as a between-group factor and day (1-10) as a within-group factor revealed significant differences between the control group and each of the following groups: 24 hour pre-challenge (20 mg/kg) group (<italic>F</italic>(1, 10) = 17.80, <italic>p</italic>= .002; effect size <italic>η</italic>

(B) Tissues of bronchial tubes from each of the hamsters were collected on day 10 and scored for the severity of bronchioloalveolar hyperplasia: 3-moderate; 2-mild; 1-minimum; 0-none. Data are the mean ±SEM (n = 6). A comparison between the control group and each of other groups was performed using one-tailed Student’s t-test for directional tests. ***<italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.001; *<italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.05.</p>

<title>Analysis of expression, purification and pharmacokinetics of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic>.</title>
<p>(A) Purification of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> from bacteria. The protein was nearly 100% pure after gel filtration chromatography, as demonstrated by its elution profile and SDS-PAGE (stained by Coomassie blue). The yield of the protein was 40 mg/L of bacterial culture, without any optimization of the expression. (B) <italic>In vitro</italic> stability of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic>. The protein was stored at indicated temperatures for a week, and then a dilution ELISA was performed to evaluate its SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding capability. Data are the mean ±SEM (n = 4). (C) <italic>In vivo</italic> stability of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic>. <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> was injected into mice, mouse sera were collected at different time points, and <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> remaining in the sera was detected for its SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding capability as displayed in a dilution ELISA. Data are the mean ±SEM (n = 3). (D) Biodistribution of [<sup>89</sup>Zr]Zr-<italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic>. <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> was radioactively labeled with <sup>89</sup>Zr and injected into mice via tail vein injection. Different tissues or organs were collected at various time points (n=3 mice per time point). The amount of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> present in each tissue or organ was measured through examining the radioactive count of each tissue or organ. Data are the mean ±SEM (n = 3).</p>
