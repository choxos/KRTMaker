<abstract>
<p id="P2">Effective therapeutics aimed at mitigating COVID-19 symptoms are urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 induced hypercytokinemia and systemic inflammation are associated with disease severity. Baricitinib, a clinically approved JAK1/2 inhibitor with potent anti-inflammatory properties is currently being investigated in COVID-19 human clinical trials. Recent reports suggest that baricitinib may also have antiviral activity in limiting viral endocytosis. Here, we investigated the immunologic and virologic efficacy of baricitinib in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral shedding measured from nasal and throat swabs, bronchoalveolar lavages and tissues was not reduced with baricitinib. Type I IFN antiviral responses and SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses remained similar between the two groups. Importantly, however, animals treated with baricitinib showed reduced immune activation, decreased infiltration of neutrophils into the lung, reduced NETosis activity, and more limited lung pathology. Moreover, baricitinib treated animals had a rapid and remarkably potent suppression of alveolar macrophage derived production of cytokines and chemokines responsible for inflammation and neutrophil recruitment. These data support a beneficial role for, and elucidate the immunological mechanisms underlying, the use of baricitinib as a frontline treatment for severe inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

<p id="P3">The rapid emergence and dissemination of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and subsequent COVID-19 pandemic has placed an excessive burden on public and private healthcare systems with over 800,000 deaths worldwide. Thus, therapeutic approaches aimed at mitigating disease severity are of utmost global priority (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/">https://www.who.int/</ext-link>). SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible and results in a wide spectrum of disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic individuals to critically-ill patients leading to death. Severe COVID-19 disease presents with high-grade fever, dry cough, pneumonia, bilateral opacities seen in radiographs, inflammation of the lungs and infiltration of immune cells. It has been noted that individuals with co-morbidities and compromised immune systems are at higher risk for severe clinical manifestations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Guan et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">Immunological features of COVID-19 progression includes a robust pro-inflammatory response driven by innate and adaptive immune cells. Severe cases of COVID-19 have been shown to have elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including: IFNγ, TNFα, IP-10, G-CSF, IL-2, IL-6 IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the use of therapeutics targeted at Janus Kinases have the potential to ameliorate disease severity by limiting the hypercytokinemia and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) seen in COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Huang et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">Non-human primate (NHP) models have been used extensively to study pathogenesis and potential vaccine and antiviral candidates for numerous viral diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Estes et al., 2018</xref>). We and others have recently used rhesus macaques (RMs) to model SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis; SARS-CoV-2 infected RMs develop transient respiratory disease and exhibit viral shedding similar to humans, recapitulating mild to moderate infection, and in rare cases severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chandrashekar et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Munster et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Rockx et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Williamson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). Here we use RMs to assess baricitinib monotherapy as a candidate therapeutic for the treatment of COVID-19. Baricitinib is an oral, selective inhibitor of Janus Kinases (JAK1/2) with potent anti-inflammatory activity approved for treatment of patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Keystone et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, machine learning algorithms and <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggested that baricitinib could also inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cantini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Richardson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Stebbing et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Titanji et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, baricitinib could provide a dual effect of dampening inflammation and reducing viral replication. In this study, leveraging the ability to perform longitudinal collections, including bronchoalveolar lavages, and the availability of lung tissue for pathology, we tested the immunologic and virologic effects of baricitinib treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infected RMs.</p>
<sec id="S1" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Baricitinib was well-tolerated and detectable in plasma and tissues, but did not limit viral replication in SARS-CoV-2 infected RMs</title>
<p id="P6">We inoculated 8 adult RMs (11-17 years old, mean = 14 years, supplementary table 1) with a total of 1.1x10<sup>6</sup> PFU SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020), administered by intranasal (IN) and intratracheal (IT) routes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). Two days post viral inoculation, 8 RMs were randomized to receive 4 mg of oral baricitinib, daily for 8-9 days or observed without treatment until day 10-11 post infection (DPI) when all RMs were euthanized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1a</xref>). We first determined the concentration and biodistribution of baricitinib in the treated group. At 24 hours post dose, baricitinib was readily detected in plasma of all treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1b</xref>; measures performed at 6 DPI closed symbol; and 8 DPI open symbol), achieving an average level of 2.13 ng/mL. At necropsy, baricitinib was detectable at approximately 2 hours after the last dose in left/right upper and lower lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1c</xref>; n = 4 RMs; average of 4.41 and 4.43 ng/g, respectively), brain (n = 3 RMs; 2.09 ng/g tissue) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 2 RMs; 0.29 ng/ml) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>); we also detected baricitinib in CSF from 3 out of the 4 treated animals at 24 hours post dosing on 8-9 days after the final dose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">In terms of potential side effects, a slight reduction of peripheral monocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes, which could be due to trafficking to the lung, as well as decreased red blood cell counts (RBC), hematocrit (HCT) and hemoglobin (HGB) were observed starting at 2 DPI in all RMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2 a-f</xref>). Blood chemistries showed elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in one untreated animal starting at 2 DPI, and all other values were within the normal range (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2 g</xref>). Thus, treatment with baricitinib was well-tolerated without direct evidence of treatment-induced clinical pathology, abnormal blood counts, nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity when compared to untreated SARS-CoV-2 infected animals.</p>
<p id="P8">To further monitor response to infection and baricitinib treatment, the health status of all animals was assessed daily by veterinarians, with cage-side assessment and physical examination scored based on a standardized scoring system (modified from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chertow et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Huang et al., 2020</xref>); main parameters included in the scoring are listed on Supplementary Table 2 and 3). On 1 DPI, all animals exhibited changes to alertness and respiratory pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1d</xref>). Additional early signs of disease included: changes to pulse oximetry readings, reduction in appetite, hunched posture, shivering, pale appearance and agitation. Signs of disease persisted during the 10/11-day course of the study, without differences between treated and untreated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1d</xref>). Weight loss was observed in 4/4 untreated and 3/4 baricitinib treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1e</xref>), although we cannot discriminate if this is a result of the infection or related to frequent access for sample collection.</p>
<p id="P9">We next assessed viral RNA levels by qRT-PCR in multiple anatomic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chandrashekar et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Munster et al., 2020</xref>). We observed high levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasal and throat swabs, and bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL), with a peak between days 2-4 post-infection of <bold>1.4x10<sup>7</sup>, 1.2x10<sup>6</sup>, and 1.9x10<sup>5</sup> copies/mL</bold> respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1f-h</xref>); viral RNA then steadily decreased until 10-11 DPI. SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels remained similar in nasal, throat, or BAL between the baricitinib treated and the untreated group. Virus was not detected in blood. At necropsy (10-11 DPI), viral RNA was detected for all animals in nasopharynx, lower and upper lungs, and hilar lymph nodes. Viral loads (cycle threshold value) in tissue for treated and untreated animals were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1i</xref>). Additionally, <italic>in situ</italic> RNA hybridization (RNAscope) targeting both positive and negative-sense (data not shown) viral RNA strands identified multifocal clusters of infected cells within the lung parenchyma in both treated and untreated animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3</xref>). Thus, baricitinib treatment starting at 2 DPI was safe and well tolerated, but did not impact the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 replication.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Baricitinib reduced lung pathology and inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques</title>
<p id="P10">We then performed multiple analyses to determine the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in RMs and the effectiveness of baricitinib to ameliorate the pathophysiologic response. First, x-ray radiographs (RM6 x-ray; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2a</xref>) were longitudinally (-5, 2, 4, 7 and 10 DPI) performed (blinded scoring by a radiologist as previously reported(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Munster et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Williamson et al., 2020</xref>)). Pulmonary infiltration and ground glass opacity were observed at multiple experimental timepoints PI in 2/4 untreated and 0/4 treated RMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2b and c</xref>), with one of the untreated animals showing severe pneumonia at all PI time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b and c</xref>). Second, we measured serum levels of several systemic inflammatory markers. Among these, ferritin (4 DPI, p=0.0286; and 10 DPI, p=0.0286) and C-reactive protein (CRP; 4 DPI) levels were found to be elevated in the untreated RMs when compared with the baricitinib treated RMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d and e</xref>). Previous reports have indicated that heightened ferritin and CRP levels are indicative of COVID-19 severity in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Qin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, to assess lung damage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all RMs were euthanized at 10 or 11 DPI. At necropsy, multiple regions of upper, middle and lower lung lobes were taken for immunologic, virologic and pathologic analyses. Lung pathologic analyses and scoring were performed by two pathologists independently in a blinded fashion. Treated animals showed decreased type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, peribronchiolar hyperplasia, syncytia formation, alveolar septal thickening and inflammatory cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2f-k</xref>). Consistent with the pathology scoring, neutrophil (myeloperoxidase, MPO<sup>+</sup>, cells) and macrophage (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule, Iba-1<sup>+</sup>, cells) infiltration appeared to be decreased in the lungs in baricitinib treated animals as measured by quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4</xref>). Of note, some of the SARS-CoV-2 infected animals, in both groups showed cell infiltration levels similar to uninfected RMs, indicating a resolution of the infiltration at 10 DPI, consistent with an earlier peak of pathogenesis in RMs, as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chandrashekar et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Munster et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Rockx et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Williamson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). The average pathology score per lobe (measuring the average severity of abnormalities per lobe, independently of how many lobes had been effected, p=0.0286) and the total pathology score (considering severity and number of effected lobes, p=0.0857) were lower in the baricitinib treated group (0.99 and 22, respectively) as compared to untreated RMs (1.66 and 38.5, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2l and n</xref>). Overall, these data support a therapeutic role of baricitinib in reducing lung pathology, infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lung, and soluble markers of inflammation associated with disease progression in humans.</p>

<title>Baricitinib treatment dampens gene signatures of inflammation and neutrophil degranulation in the BAL of SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques</title>
<p id="P11">To investigate the impact of baricitinib on the lower airway, we performed bulk RNA-Seq profiling of cells isolated from BAL prior to SARS-CoV-2 inoculation (-5 DPI); 2 days after virus inoculation, prior to baricitinib treatment (2 DPI); and 4 days after infection, and 48 hours after beginning baricitinib (4 DPI). Relative to pre-infection, we observed a robust upregulation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 2 DPI in both the treated and untreated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3a</xref>), however at 4 DPI only a handful of DEGs were detected in the baricitinib treated animals, whereas a robust transcriptional response persisted in the untreated group. To identify immunological pathways perturbed by (i) SARS-CoV-2 infection, and (ii) baricitinib treatment, we performed gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). To determine pathways that changed after drug administration, we directly compared gene expression profiles at 2 DPI to 4 DPI. Comparison of GSEA data from 2 DPI to 4 DPI in untreated animals show robust, highly significant positive enrichment in pathways comprised of genes for inflammatory responses, TNFα and IL6 signaling, neutrophil and granulocyte function – indicating that, in the absence of baricitinib, expression of these genes, continues to increase, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3b</xref>). In stark contrast, when a similar comparison of 2 DPI vs 4 DPI was tested for enrichment in animals receiving baricitinib, we observed negative enrichment, indicating that inflammatory genes were expressed at lower levels already after only 2 days of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3b</xref>). To confirm the robustness of our enrichment analysis in detecting downregulation of inflammatory pathways with treatment, we also conducted GSEA analyses using direct cross-sectional comparisons (i.e. 4 DPI untreated vs 4 DPI treated); these data demonstrated that inflammatory signatures were significantly lower in animals receiving baricitinib (4 DPI), although equivalent when comparing 2 DPI samples in which neither group had received the drug (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">To explore the impact of baricitinib on the inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection at the gene level, we examined several pathways in greater detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3c-j</xref>). One of the highest scoring pathways, neutrophil degranulation, was significantly enriched at 4 DPI relative to 2 DPI in the untreated group (p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3c</xref>). Strikingly, however, enrichment of this pathway was completely abrogated in the treated group (p=0.979). When we examined individual genes that were (i) elevated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and (ii) influenced by baricitinib treatment, we observed that several genes were those encoding degradative and bactericidal enzymes present in neutrophil granules (MMP9, MMP25, BPI, MPO), or highly expressed on polymorphonuclear neutrophils (CXCR1 and CXCR2), the alarmin S100A12, and genes for proteins that act to degrade the extracellular matrix during neutrophil extravasation: SERPINB10, ADAM8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3g</xref>). These genes were highly upregulated in BAL samples of untreated animals, but substantially attenuated in treated animals, many at levels equivalent to pre-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3g</xref>). Collectively, these gene signatures suggest that baricitinib treatment may dampen neutrophil recruitment and activity in the lower airway during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also examined the enrichment of neutrophil pathway genes in cross-sectional GSEA comparisons, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S5</xref>; this analysis largely mirrored our D2 vs D4 observations; as many of the enriched genes were similar. Additionally, we observed several alarmin proteins (S100A8, S100A9) had lost their induction at 4 DPI in animals receiving baricitinib, as did the MPO gene. These genes have been recently demonstrated to be highly expressed in the myeloid compartment of peripheral blood of patients exhibiting severe COVID-19 disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Silvin et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">Baricitinib treatment also rapidly induced near complete abrogation of inflammation mediators downstream of TNFα signaling and IL6 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3 d and e h and i</xref>). Within these pathways, amongst the molecules suppressed by baricitinib were chemotactic factors critical for recruitment of neutrophils (CXCL6, CXCL3) and macrophages (CCL2), inflammatory serine protease factors (SERPINB2, TNFAIP6) and cytokines regulating inflammation and immune responses (IL12B). Of note, genes identified as upregulated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were found to be significantly enriched (p=0.0448) in untreated as compared to treated animals at 4 DPI, despite similar gene expression at 2 DPI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig. S6</xref>). In the leading-edge analysis of the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathway we noted lower expression of several inflammatory mediators such as CXCL8, IL1B, CCL5, CCL3, CCL20, IL18, IL6 and CXCL12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig. S6</xref>). As baricitinib was developed to ameliorate inflammation in RA by inhibiting JAK1/2 signaling, and consistently with the reduction in the IL- 6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>), these data confirm the effectiveness of baricitinib in the lower airway of SARS-CoV-2 infected RMs.</p>
<p id="P14">Several of the genesets comprised of genes in Type I interferon signaling and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) presented an elevated expression relative to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3j</xref>). In both treated and untreated groups, we observed a slight reduction in expression at 4 DPI relative to 2 DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b and f</xref>) However, unlike genesets associated with inflammation, genes associated with Type I IFN signaling and innate antiviral responses were unperturbed by baricitinib treatment. Collectively, these data demonstrated that baricitinib treatment potently suppressed inflammatory pathways in the lower airway of RMs infected with SARS-CoV-2, but left innate antiviral signaling largely intact.</p>

<title>Baricitinib treatment abolishes inflammatory cytokine and neutrophil chemoattractant expression in bronchoalveolar macrophages of SAR-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques</title>
<p id="P15">The bulk RNA-Seq data indicated that gene signatures consistent with neutrophil infiltration and cytokine driven inflammation were evident as early as 2 DPI, and that baricitinib was capable of abrogation of these pathways in as quickly as 48 hours. To identify the cellular component orchestrating airway inflammation, we performed single-cell RNA-Seq (sc-RNA-Seq) profiling using 10X Genomics-based droplet sequencing. Single cell suspensions of BAL samples from three untreated and two baricitinib treated animals prior to infection, and at 4 DPI were subjected to 10X droplet capture within 3 hours of collection. After processing to remove erythrocytes and low-quality cells, the captures yielded a cumulative 45,583 cells across all samples for analysis. The cellular distribution is summarized in the UMAP shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4a</xref>. Similar to observations reported in sc-RNA-Seq data in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bost et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chua et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Liao et al., 2020</xref>), the vast majority of cells in BALs were predominantly macrophage/myeloid origin (80.7%), followed by lymphocytes (CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells/NK cells) (9.8%) and approximately 3.2% were identified as epithelial. Allocation of cells from the cumulative data by treatment variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4b</xref>) demonstrated that the cellular distribution was distributed equivalently amongst the experimental groups and no population was enriched due to batch or technical variation associated with individual captures. We probed the macrophage population for upstream regulators associated with the inflammatory pathways identified in the bulk RNA-Seq analyses, and observed elevated expression of several inflammatory mediators at 4 DPI: IL6, TNFα, IL1β and IL10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">S8</xref>). IFNβ was also highly expressed in the macrophage cluster, however, IFNa transcripts were detected in a virtually negligible fraction of cells <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Fig. S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">S8</xref>; <bold>and data not shown</bold>). Strikingly, and consistent with the bulk RNA-Seq data, we observed that baricitinib treatment virtually abrogated expression of TNFα, IL10, IFNβ and IL6 in pulmonary macrophages, and significantly reduced expression of IL1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4c</xref>). We also observed a robust induction of chemokines driving neutrophil recruitment (CXCL3/MIP2β, CXCL8/IL8), macrophage trafficking (CCL4L1/MIP1β), and CXCL10/IP10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4d and e</xref>), a pleiotropic chemokine upregulated in several viral infections, and long hypothesized to be associated with pathogenesis in SARS-CoV viral infection and observed in SARS-CoV-1 infection of NHPs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">de Lang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Laing et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Tang et al., 2005</xref>). Notably, after 48 hours of baricitinib treatment, expression of these proinflammatory cytokines was reduced to negligible levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4d and e</xref>). Examination of the expression levels of antiviral ISGs in pulmonary macrophages yielded a much different pattern than those observed for inflammatory genes – although widespread induction of ISGs were observed after SARS-CoV-2 infection, baricitinib treatment had only a very modest impact on these pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4f</xref>). Collectively, these data support a model in which baricitinib administration strongly reduces airway inflammation and neutrophil accumulation, but has a minimal effect on innate antiviral immunity.</p>

<title>Baricitinib leads to reduced BAL levels of neutrophils and neutrophil NETosis activity</title>
<p id="P16">To gain insight into the immunologic effects of baricitinib treatment on cellular distribution within BAL, we applied global high-dimensional mapping of 23-parameter flow cytometry data. As shown in the UMAP representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5a</xref>), untreated and baricitinib treated RMs had different BAL cellular distribution starting from 4 DPI, including in neutrophils. This was of particular interest considering the higher expression of neutrophil-attracting chemokines in untreated RMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4d and e</xref>), thus we focused our flow cytometry immunologic analyses in determining longitudinal levels of neutrophils (CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>-</sup>CD20<sup>-</sup>CD66<sup>+</sup> live granulocytes; representative staining in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Fig. S9a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5b</xref>). Analyses of BAL showed a rapid recruitment of neutrophils in the lung at 4 DPI during the peak of viremia. All untreated animals showed sustained, higher frequencies of neutrophils at later stages of infection (10-11 DPI) as compared to baricitinib treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5c and d</xref>; p=0.0286). In blood, neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5e</xref>) remained relatively stable post infection as compared to pre-infection and at lower levels in untreated as compared to treated animals at the latest experimental points (p=0.0571), consistently with a higher migration to lung in untreated RMs. Since the flow cytometry data of BAL shows a reduced migration of neutrophils to lung in baricitinib-treated animals, we next measured neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) activity by quantification of extracellular DNA via Sytox staining, a functional readout of NETosis activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5f and g</xref>). NETs have been reported as an important mechanism of inflammation and microvascular thrombosis in patients with COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Skendros et al., 2020</xref>). Baricitinib treated RMs showed decreased NET formation by blood neutrophils at 4 and particularly 10 DPI when compared to untreated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5g</xref>; p=0.0571).</p>

<title>Baricitinib reduced T cell immune activation in SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques</title>
<p id="P18">Our transcriptomic data indicated that baricitinib reduced the expression of multiple cytokines that can induce T cell immune activation. As such, we then analyzed levels of T cells, and their frequency of activation and proliferation by flow cytometry (gating strategy shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Fig. S9b</xref>). CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell levels in blood remained similar between treated and untreated animals, with 1/4 baricitinib treated and 2/4 untreated RMs exhibiting a pronounced reduction in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell frequencies at 10 DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6a</xref>). When analyzing different CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, we observed an expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> TRegs at 4 (p=0.0571) and 6 DPI in the untreated, but not in the baricitinib treated RMs, both as frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6b and c</xref>) and absolute numbers (not shown). Specifically, the mean fold change in CD4<sup>+</sup> TRegs frequency at 4 and 6 DPI, as compared to pre-treatment baseline (2 DPI), was of 7.43 and 4.36 in untreated and of 1.22 and 1.13 in baricitinib treated RMs, respectively, suggesting higher levels of inflammation in the untreated group resulting in greater expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> TRegs. Peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were reduced at 10 DPI in 2/4 baricitinib treated and 2/4 untreated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6d</xref>). Differences in immune activation and proliferation were evident among treated and untreated animals for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as well. Specifically, the frequency of proliferating (Ki-67<sup>+</sup>) memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in blood progressively and significantly increased in all 4 untreated animals at 7 and 10 DPI, while significantly decreasing in all baricitinib treated RMs already at 4 DPI. As a result, at 10 DPI the mean frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup>Ki-67<sup>+</sup> was significantly higher in untreated animals (24.38% vs 7.38%; p = 0.0286, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the BAL remained relatively constant until 7 DPI, when the majority of animals started experiencing a reduction in their frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6f</xref>). CD4<sup>+</sup> TRegs expanded more at 4 and 7 DPI in the untreated group, again hinting at higher levels of inflammation and trafficking of expanded TRegs from blood to lung (data not shown). Consistently, untreated RMs showed an early (present at 4 DPI), large (mean fold change of 3.31 at 7 DPI vs 2 DPI compared to 1.14 in the treated RMs) and prolonged (up to 10 DPI) increase in the frequency of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing CD38 (CD38<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>-</sup>; 4 DPI, p=0.0286, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6g</xref>); similar results were found for memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing CD38 and HLA-DR (CD38<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>; not shown). Remarkably, different from untreated RMs, the frequency of those activated memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells decreased in baricitinib treated animals starting at 4 DPI and remained lower than pre-treatment until 10 DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6g</xref>). Consistent with a reduced pro-inflammatory state of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, baricitinib treated RMs showed a lower frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that spontaneously (without stimulation) produced pro-inflammatory, Th17 related cytokines (IL-17<sup>+</sup>; IL-17<sup>+</sup>IL-21<sup>+</sup>; IL-17<sup>+</sup>IL-22<sup>+</sup>) when compared to untreated RMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig. S10</xref>).</p>
<p id="P20">As with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, the reduction in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was more pronounced in BAL, starting at 7 DPI and maintained until necropsy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6h</xref>). Similarly, also in BAL the frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup>Ki-67<sup>+</sup>T cells increased more extensively in untreated than baricitinib-treated RMs (30.53% vs 11.53% at 7 DPI; 39.95% vs 24.65% at 10 DPI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6i</xref>); as a result, the fold change (as compared to 2 DPI, pre-treatment) in the frequency of memory CD8<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup> T cells was higher in untreated then baricitinib treated animals both at 7 (8.22 vs 1.02) and 10 (6.28 vs 2.48) DPI. A similar trend was measured for activated memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, with higher frequency and fold change in untreated than baricitinib treated animals at 7 (FC CD38<sup>+</sup>DR<sup>-</sup>: 23.67 vs 1.62; CD38<sup>+</sup>DR<sup>+:</sup> 4.55 vs 0.90) and 10 (FC CD38<sup>+</sup>DR<sup>-</sup>: 9.81 vs 1.43; CD38<sup>+</sup>DR<sup>+</sup>: 16.66 vs 2.90) DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6j</xref>, and data not shown).

<p id="P21">Finally, we assessed the ability of peripheral T cells to respond to <italic>ex vivo</italic> SARS-CoV-2 specific stimulation (with a SARS-CoV-2 S peptide pool characterized in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Grifoni et al., 2020</xref>)) and to nonantigen specific stimulation (with PMA/ionomycin). Importantly, the levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IFNγ, TNFα, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-17a in response to S peptide pool stimulation were similar in both groups of animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Fig. S11a-c</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P23">In this study, we tested baricitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor clinically approved for rheumatoid arthritis, as a therapeutic candidate to reduce systemic inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in RMs. Notably, baricitinib treated RMs displayed reduced (i) lung pathology, from moderate in untreated animals to mild; (ii) levels of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and signaling pathways associated with inflammation, neutrophil recruitment, and disease progression in SARS-CoV-2 infected humans; and (iii) levels of systemic inflammation that are associated with COVID-19 severity in humans while not having an impact on Type 1 IFN responses. This beneficial anti-inflammatory effect of baricitinib was confirmed by a reduced infiltration of neutrophils into the lungs, and a highly reduced T cell activation in both blood and BAL as compared to untreated animals. Furthermore, in this study we were able to observe an increased NETosis activity of neutrophils upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, previously described in serum from COVID19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Skendros et al., 2020</xref>), which was reduced in baricitinib treated animals. Remarkably, single-cell RNA sequencing showed reduced immune activation, neutrophil recruitment, and macrophage trafficking signatures in pulmonary macrophages from treated RMs already after two doses of baricitinib, at 4 DPI. IL-6, TNFα, IL-10, IL-1B, CXCL3/MIP-2β, CXCL8/IL8, CCL4L1/MIP-1β, and CXCL10/IP-10 were all expressed at higher levels in pulmonary macrophages from untreated animals compared to baricitinib treated animals. These data confirm very recent studies that demonstrated by RNA-Seq analysis that higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in lung macrophages are associated with patients presenting with severe/critical COVID-19 cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Liao et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, baricitinib could have clinical benefits in reducing the inflammatory response typically seen in moderate to severe cases of COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Of note, one of the advantages of baricitinib when compared with other cytokine-specific anti-inflammatory therapies is that it can be more effective by inhibiting several cytokines involved in the cytokine storm described in severe cases of COVID-19.</p>
<p id="P24">Clinical pathology and laboratory parameters of toxicity remained similar in the treated animals for the 8-9-day treatment course at a dose equivalent to humans (4 mg daily; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bronte et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cantini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Titanji et al., 2020</xref>)). Baricitinib was found distributed in lungs, a key tissue for SARS-CoV-2 replication, as well as in the central nervous system (CNS). Although several <italic>in silico</italic> modeling and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies suggested baricitinib as a possible treatment candidate to COVID-19 due to its potential antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cantini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Richardson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Stebbing et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Titanji et al., 2020</xref>), we did not observe changes in viral replication dynamics in the treated animals. One of the main concerns in using a JAK inhibitor such as baricitinib, is that its downstream anti-immune activation effects could limit immune responses necessary to combat SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, we did not identify reduction of SARS-CoV-2 specific and unspecific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in treated animals, indicating that baricitinib reduces systemic inflammation without any detrimental effects to the adaptive antiviral immune responses. Baricitinib did not inhibit genes associated with Type I Interferon antiviral responses, indicating its mode of action in this context is primarily to dampen inflammatory responses and neutrophil recruitment while maintaining innate and adaptive antiviral pathways.</p>
<p id="P25">Several ongoing clinical trials are studying the effects of baricitinib in SARS-CoV-2 infected humans. Currently, the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-2; NCT04401579) is evaluating the effects of baricitinib in combination with remdesivir and the COV-BARRIER trial (NCT04421027) is studying baricitinib as a monotherapy. Participants are treated with placebo, remdesivir alone or a combination of remdesivir and baricitinib. In a retrospective cohort study, 15 patients with severe COVID-19 were administered a short-course of baricitinib in combination with hydroxychloroquine and this was associated with a complete recovery in 11/15 subjects(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Titanji et al., 2020</xref>). In a separate pilot study, baricitinib was combined with lopinavir-ritonavir in 12 patients starting treatment 6 days post-symptom onset, with all individuals showing significantly improved clinical and laboratory parameters with no treated individuals requiring ICU care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cantini et al., 2020</xref>). Being performed in an animal model, this study has some key advantages and some important limitations. Advantages include the ability to correct for parameters that may impact clinical outcome and treatment readout, including using the same virus inoculum, dose, and route of infection, and starting baricitinib at the same phase of infection in all subjects. Furthermore, the NHP model permits longitudinal collection of BAL and lung at necropsy, which in turn allows the in-depth characterization of the impact of baricitinib on immune activation and immunologic responses, including single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of macrophages, at the foci of infection. The main limitation of the study is the small group size, with a total of eight RMs; furthermore, being that SARS-CoV-2 infected RMs is a model of moderate COVID-19 (at least in animals between 11-17 years old as in our study) and with treatment initiated early after infection, we cannot determine if the therapeutic impact of baricitinib will be the same in severe COVID-19 patients and when started later than 2 days post-infection. Mitigating that concern, in our study, treatment started at peak viremia, including in BAL, and once inflammatory signatures were already highly up-regulated, mimicking the conditions in which baricitinib would be administered clinically. Indeed, a recent small clinical trial in 20 severe COVID-19 patients indicated that baricitinib mitigated immune dysregulation by reducing plasma levels of IL6, IL1b and TNFa and lowered time to recovery(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bronte et al., 2020</xref>). Our data provides rationale for baricitinib treatment in COVID-19 to be given in a window where blocking immune inflammation would prevent the formation of a cytokine storm without interfering in the initial responses necessary for preventing viral dissemination and persistence.</p>

<p id="P28">Back titration of viral stocks via plaque assay was used to determine the infectious dose delivered to the RMs. The virus stock was also directly sequenced via metagenomic methods prior to inoculation to confirm the presence of the furin cleavage motif, which has been shown to be lost upon sequential passage of SARS-CoV-2 in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Davidson et al., 2020</xref>). Our stock contained fewer than 6% of viral genomes with a mutation that could potentially abrogate furin-mediated cleavage of S (data not shown).</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p id="P29">Eight specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Indian-origin rhesus macaques (RM; <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>; Supplementary table 1) were housed at Yerkes National Primate Research Center (YNPRC) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">McGary et al., 2017</xref>). Animals for study assignment were requested to be greater than 11 years old without preference for gender or MHC haplotype. RMs were infected with 1.1x10<sup>6</sup> plaque forming units (PFU) SARS-CoV-2 via both the intranasal (1 mL) and intratracheal (1 mL) routes concurrently. Absent further stratification criteria, four RMs were administered 4 mg Baricitinib (Olumiantâ, Eli Lilly) starting at day 2 post-infection (DPI) for 8-9 consecutive days. Baricitinib was supplied as a powder that was folded into food items (i.e. honey, yogurt, etc.) or distilled water, which was delivered either orally or as a gavage when animals were being anesthetically accessed, respectively. At each anesthetic access pulse oximetry was recorded and RMs were clinically scored for responsiveness and recumbency; discharges; skin condition; respiration, dyspnea, and cough; food consumption; and fecal consistency (Supplementary Tables 2 <bold>and</bold> 3). At 10-11 DPI, RMs were administered Baricitinib and subjected to necropsy after 2 hours with blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected perimortem to assess pharmacokinetics of baricitinib. Longitudinal tissue collections of peripheral blood (PB); axillary or inguinal lymph node (LN) biopsies; bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL); and nasal, and pharyngeal mucosal swabs in addition to thoracic X-rays (ventrodorsal and right lateral views) were performed immediately prior to Baricitinib administration as annotated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1a</xref>). In addition to the tissues listed above, at necropsy the following tissues were processed for mononuclear cells: hilar LN, lower lung, and upper lung. Additional necropsy tissues harvested for histology included nasopharynx.</p>

<title>Determination of viral load RNA</title>
<p id="P31">SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA was quantified in nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, throat swabs, plasma, and bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL). Swabs were placed in 1mL of Viral Transport Medium (VTM- 1L, Labscoop, LLC). Viral RNA was extracted from NP swabs, throat swabs, and BAL on fresh specimens, while plasma was frozen for future analysis. Viral RNA was extracted manually using the QiaAmp Viral RNA mini kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed on viral RNA samples using the N2 primer and probe set designed by the CDC for their diagnostic algorithm: CoV2-N2-F: 5’-TTACAAACATTGGCCGCAAA-3’, CoV2-N2-R: 5’- GCGCGACATTCCGAAGAA-3’, and CoV2-N2-Pr: 5’-FAM-ACAATTTGCCCCCAGCGCTTCAG-BHQ-3’. qPCR reactions were performed in duplicate with the Thermo-Fisher 1-Step Fast virus mastermix using the manufacturer’s cycling conditions, 200nM of each primer, and 125nM of the probe. The limit of detection in this assay was 257 copies per mL of VTM/plasma/BAL. To verify sample quality the CDC RNase P p30 subunit qPCR was modified to account for rhesus macaque specific polymorphisms. The primer and probe sequences are RM-RPP30-F 5’- AGACTTGGACGTGCGAGCG-3’, RM-RPP30-R 5’-GAGCCGCTGTCTCCACAAGT-3’, and RPP30-Pr 5’-FAM-TTCTGACCTGAAGGCTCTGCGCG-BHQ1-3’. A single well from each extraction was run as above to verify RNA integrity and sample quality via detectable and consistent cycle threshold values.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 quantification from necropsy samples</title>
<p id="P32">An approximately 0.5 cm<sup>3</sup> sample of each tissue was collected at necropsy, placed in 500μL Nuclisens lysis buffer (Biomerieux), and stored at -80°C. Thawed samples were homogenized with a sterile pestle, treated with 50μL proteinase K (Qiagen) for 30 minutes at 55°C, and pelleted. Total nucleic acid was extracted from 250μL of supernatant using eMAG (Biomerieux) and eluted into 50μL. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 N2 was performed as previously described, and singleplex RT-PCR for RNase P was performed using primers and probes optimized for quantitation, each using 5μL of eluate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Waggoner et al., 2020</xref>). To allow for comparison of SARS-CoV-2 levels between samples that may have had subtle differences in starting material, the SARS-CoV-2 N2 Ct was normalized to the RNase P control by: 1) calculating the difference between N2 Ct and RNase P Ct for each sample, and 2) adding this to the median RNase P Ct value for the sample type. For the purposes of data visualization, samples in which SARS-CoV-2 N2 was undetected were assigned a Ct value of 40 (the assay limit of detection).</p>

<title>Quantification of baricitinib by LC-MS/MS in plasma, CSF and tissue</title>
<p id="P33">One hundred μL of plasma or CSF samples were extracted with 500 μL of methanol. For tissues like brain and lung, 0.2 to 0.5 g of tissue were homogenized and extracted with 2 mL of methanol. [<sup>2</sup>H9]-ruxolitinib dissolved in 50% methanol at 500 nM was spiked in plasma/CSF (10 μL) or tissue samples (40 μL) as internal standard before extraction. The supernatant of each extraction (50 μL) was mixed with equal amount of 0.1% formic acid and then subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis after filtration through 0.22 μm membrane with Costar Spin-X centrifuge tube filters (Corning, NY). A Vanquish Flex HPLC system (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) coupled with a TSQ Quantiva triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) with an ESI interface was used for LC-MS analysis. Analytes were separated by a Kinetex EVO-C18 column (100 x 2.1 mm, 2.6 μm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) at a flow rate of 300 μL/min, 35°C. Gradient elution was used for the separation with mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid) and mobile phase B (acetonitrile). The LC gradient started with 10% of mobile phase B for 0.5 min, then increased from 10% to 90% in 4 min and kept at 90% for 0.5 min before returning to the initial condition. Selected reaction monitoring in positive mode (spray voltage: 3,200 V; sheath gas: 40 Arb; auxiliary gas: 20 Arb; ion transfer tube temperature: 350°C; vaporizer temperature: 350°C) was used to detect baricitinib (372.1 ® 251.1) and the internal standard [<sup>2</sup>H9]-ruxolitinib (316.2 ® 186.1). Data were collected and processed by Thermo Xcalibur 3.0 software. Calibration curves were generated from standard baricitinib by serial dilutions in blank biometric samples using the same extraction method described above. For CSF, 0.5% plasma was used as surrogate to make calibration curve. The calibration curves had r<sup>2</sup> value greater than 0.99.</p>
<p id="P34">All the chemicals are analytical grade or higher and were obtained commercially from Sigma- Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). [<sup>2</sup>H9]-ruxolitinib was purchased from ALSACHIM (lllkirch, Alsace, France) with purity greater than 98%.</p>

<title>Histopathology and immunohistochemistry</title>
<p id="P35">Due to study end point, the animals were euthanized, and a complete necropsy was performed. For histopathologic examination, various tissue samples including lung, nasal turbinates, trachea, or brain, were fixed in 4% neutral-buffered paraformaldehyde for 24h at room temperature, routinely processed, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 4μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp; E). The H&amp;E slides from all tissues were examined by two board certified veterinary pathologists. For each animal, all the lung lobes were used for analysis and affected microscopic fields were scored semi-quantitatively as Grade 0 (None); Grade 1 (Mild); Grade 2 (Moderate) and Grade 3 (Severe). Scoring was performed based on these criteria: number of lung lobes affected, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, alveolar septal thickening, fibrosis, perivascular cuffing, peribronchiolar hyperplasia, inflammatory infiltrates, hyaline membrane formation. An average lung lobe score was calculated by combining scores from each criterion. Digital images of H&amp;E stained slides were captured at 40× and 200× magnification with an Olympus BX43 microscope equipped with a digital camera (DP27, Olympus) using Cellsens® Standard 2.3 digital imaging software (Olympus).</p>
<p id="P36">Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of sections of lung was performed using a biotin-free polymer system.

<p>Bulk RNA-Seq profiles of BAL cell suspensions from NHPs obtained at Day -5 prior to SARS-CoV-2 inoculation (Baseline), at 2 days post-inoculation, prior to baricitinib administration (2 DPI) treatment, and at 4 days postinoculation, 2 days after initiation of baricitinib treatment (4 DPI). Both the untreated arm and baricitinib arm were comprised of n = 4 animals. (<bold>a</bold>) Venn diagrams indicating the number of DEGs detected at 2 DPI or 4 DPI relative to -5dpi in the untreated (blue) and baricitinib treated (red) experimental groups. The total DEGs for each comparison are shown in parentheses.

The x-axis depicts the normalized enrichment score (NES); a positive enrichment score indicated higher expression at 4 DPI relative to 3 DPI, conversely, negative scores of a pathway indicate cumulatively higher expression in 2 DPI samples relative to 4 DPI. Nominal p-values are indicated; negative enrichment (2 DPI &gt; 4 DPI) is indicated by bars facing left, positive enrichment (4 DPI &gt; 2 DPI) denoted by bars facing right.

The top-scoring (i.e. leading edge) genes are indicated by solid dots. The hash plot under GSEA curves indicate individual genes and their rank in the dataset. Left-leaning curves (i.e. positive enrichment scores) indicate enrichment, or higher expression, of pathways at 4 DPI, right-leaning curves (negative enrichment scores) indicate higher expression at 2 DPI. Sigmoidal curves indicate a lack of enrichment, i.e. equivalent expression between the groups being compared.

<p>(<bold>a</bold>) UMAP analysis of BAL in baricitinib treated (n= 4) and untreated (n= 4) SARS-CoV-2 infected RMs before infection (D -5 PI; baseline), and at 4, and 10 DPI. (<bold>b</bold>) Representative flow cytometry staining of neutrophil infiltration in BAL at baseline, and 4 and 10 DPI. Longitudinal levels of neutrophils within BAL samples depicted as a % of CD45+ cells (<bold>c</bold>) and fold change to 2 DPI (<bold>d</bold>) in treated (blue) and untreated (red) RMs. (<bold>e</bold>) Fold change to 2 DPI of neutrophils in blood of baricitinib treated and untreated SARS-CoV-2 infected RMs. (<bold>f</bold>) Representative microscopy images of NETS by Sytox green assay in baricitinib treated and untreated SARS-CoV-2 infected RMs. Scale bar: 200 μm. (<bold>g</bold>) Quantification of NETosis activity upon staining extracellular DNA with Sytox in isolated stimulated neutrophils from blood. Fold change of Sytox levels to -5 DPI. In c, d, e, and g each symbol represents individual animals. Thick lines represent the average of the baricitinib treated (blue line), and untreated groups (red line). Bars in d, e, and g represent the average of the treated and untreated groups. Statistical analysis was performed using a non-parametric Mann-Whitney Test.</p>

<caption>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) SARS-Cov-2 infection in rhesus macaques results in an accumulation of inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils in the lower airway. These airway macrophages produce high amounts of inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil-attracting chemokines and show upregulated Type I interferon signaling. Neutrophil NETs and the inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection both contribute to lung pathology. (<bold>b</bold>) Baricitinib treatment reduced the levels of macrophages producing inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil-attracting chemokines, decreased the infiltration of neutrophils into the lung and reduced T cell activation. The Netosis activity of neutrophils was also reduced. In treated animals, the antiviral interferon response was maintained, viral replication was not impacted, and lung pathology was mild.</p>
