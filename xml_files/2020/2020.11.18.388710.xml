Despite the availability of vaccines, cost-effective acute treatment options preventing morbidity and mortality are urgently needed. To identify affordable, ubiquitously available, and effective treatments, we tested herbs consumed worldwide as herbal teas regarding their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Aqueous infusions prepared by boiling leaves of the <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> perilla and sage elicit potent and sustained antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in therapeutic as well as prophylactic regimens. The herbal infusions exerted antiviral effects comparable to interferon-β and remdesivir but outperformed convalescent sera and interferon-α2 upon short-term treatment early after infection. Based on protein fractionation analyses, we identified caffeic acid, perilla aldehyde, and perillyl alcohol as antiviral compounds. Global mass spectrometry (MS) analyses performed comparatively in two different cell culture infection models revealed changes of the proteome upon treatment with herbal infusions and provided insights into the mode of action. As inferred by the MS data, induction of heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX-1) was confirmed as effector mechanism by the antiviral activity of the HMOX-1-inducing compounds sulforaphane and fraxetin. In conclusion, herbal teas based on perilla and sage exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 including variants of concern such as Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>Antiviral</kwd><kwd>Herbal</kwd><kwd>Treatment</kwd><kwd>Perilla</kwd><kwd>Sage</kwd><kwd>HMOX-1</kwd><kwd>Proteome</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Fossil records suggest that humans may have applied plants as medicine at least from the Middle Palaeolithic age some 60,000 years ago <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Across cultures and spanning thousands of years, humans consumed aqueous plant infusions as teas. The first textual reference to tea consumption dates back to 59 years before the current era (BCE) and physical evidence even dates back to 255±80 years BCE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In addition to reasons of enjoyment and taste, teas are frequently applied for disease prophylaxis, therapy, or symptom alleviation. A major distinction is made between genuine teas based on <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> infusions versus various types of herbal teas. For the latter, parts of other plants are boiled in water generating complex aqueous infusions. Especially members of the <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> family comprising sage <italic>(Salvia officinalis)</italic> and perilla (<italic>Perilla frutescens)</italic> are ubiquitously used to prepare herbal teas. Additionally, important spices such as thyme, basil, mint, rosemary, marjoram, oregano, and lavender also belong to the <italic>Lamiaceae</italic>. Across the world, the edible plant perilla and its variations have a variety of names such as <italic>Tía tô</italic> (Vietnam), <italic>rattlesnake weed</italic> (US), <italic>silam</italic> (India and Nepal), <italic>shiso</italic> and <italic>egoma</italic> (Japan), <italic>deulkkae</italic> (Korea), <italic>zĭsū</italic> and <italic>sūzĭ</italic> (China) highlighting its broad distribution. In parts of Japan, it is referred to as <italic>jūnen</italic> (“ten years”) since it is believed to be able to add ten years to a person’s lifespan. Members of the <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> family are well described for their medicinal effects against various diseases including pneumonia and cough <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. While perilla is very popular in Asia, the related plant sage is more common in Europe and America. The name <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> already indicates its medicinal potential since the <italic>officinal</italic> was a room in a monastery dedicated to herbs and medicine. Intriguingly, perilla and sage extracts indeed possess antimicrobial activities (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>). In the era of modern medicine, some people have reservations concerning the use of traditional and herbal medicines. However, a highly relevant fraction of recently approved modern therapeutics directly or indirectly originate from natural products <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> - some of which known to and applied by our ancestors. In this respect, the antimalarial lactone artemisinin derived from the sweet wormwood (<italic>Artemisia annua</italic>) is amongst the best-known examples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Humans have been exposed to coronaviruses (CoV) for ages, given their broad prevalence in mammals (e.g., bats) and birds. At least seven CoVs are capable of autochthonous propagation in the human population: human CoV (HCoV)-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-SARS, HCoV-MERS, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The latter causes the current global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 was first recognized and genetically defined in Wuhan, China <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In various aspects, it shows similarities to SARS-CoV-1, however, it also exhibits certain specialties <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> such as the capacity of very efficient replication in the upper respiratory tract and the corresponding efficacy of human-to-human transmission. Given the broad coverage of this topic, we refer the reader to review articles concerning SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>). At the time of writing, more than 475 million individuals experienced laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and over 6 million people succumbed in the context of COVID-19. According to the Johns Hopkins dashboard <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, all relevant countries and regions are affected by SARS-CoV-2 cases - several of which are developing nations with very limited resources for the medical sector, especially when faced with overwhelming numbers of infected individuals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has continuously evolved, with numerous variants emerging across the world. Depending on prevalence and clinical and epidemiological characteristics, these variants are classified as “variant of interest” (VOI), “variant under monitoring” (VUM), and “variant of concern” (VOC). As of March 2022, there are five SARS-CoV-2 lineages designated as VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants). Delta was the most prevalent variant in 2021, but in 2022, Omicron has overtaken Delta as the predominant variant (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/global">https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/global</ext-link>). Certain VOCs exhibit increased transmissibility compared to the original virus and others the potential to increase disease severity. Moreover, some VOCs show decreased susceptibility to vaccine- and infection-induced immune responses, and thus possess an elevated ability to re-infect previously infected and recovered as well as vaccinated individuals.</p><p id="P5">A variety of SARS-CoV-like viruses can be found in bats, indicating an alarming reservoir of coronaviruses that could cause zoonotic animal-to-human spill over transmissions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Beyond the alpha- and beta-coronaviruses, which are known to comprise human coronaviruses, recent data indicate that humans can also acquire other coronaviruses such as porcine delta-coronaviruses from farm animals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Based on the facts that CoVs are present in animals such as rodents, bats, pigs, and cats residing in utmost proximity of human settlements and civilization and seem to have caused human epidemics in the past <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, we speculated that human culture might provide certain behavioral adaptations to coronavirus infections. Such knowledge may be applicable to alleviate some of the hardship and suffering caused by SARS-CoV-2 in a process of “cultural repurposing”. People with respiratory diseases often consume herbal products and teas in attempts of self-medication. Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, people reported that they have changed their behavior accordingly. In two studies comprising thousands of people, up to 57.6% of individuals reported having used nutritional supplements or herbal products, usually as teas, in attempts to protect themselves from COVID-19 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, we wondered how effective herbal teas actually are against SARS-CoV-2 including VOCs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Perilla and sage contain water-soluble heat-stable components active against SARS-CoV-2 replication</title><p id="P6">Since efficient and affordable treatment options for COVID-19 patients are still not sufficiently available, we aimed to determine the therapeutic potential of herbal teas. To evaluate two universally available <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> commonly used in traditional medicine, perilla and sage, in terms of their ability to elicit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, we applied an experimental setup that reflects short-term incubation of infected cells with herbal teas. We infected highly SARS-CoV-2-permissive Vero E6 cells for 1 h before the virus suspension was removed and different dilutions of aqueous infusions of perilla and sage were added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). As control, we included coriander, a herb that does not belong to the family of <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> and that is to our knowledge not commonly used as medicinal herb. We applied aqueous infusions that were prepared by boiling up the coriander, perilla, and sage leaves and subsequent simmering at 60°C for 2 h to ensure efficient extraction of water-soluble components. Intriguingly, the short-term treatment with perilla and sage infusions was sufficient to significantly inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, upper panel; for details concerning the calculation of the infectivity see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref> section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). This effect did not appear to constitute a general antiviral activity of the infusions, since inhibition of HSV-1 replication in treated Vero E6 cells was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, lower panel). To visualize the impact of the herbal teas on the SARS-CoV-2 replication, we repeated the experiment with two different doses of virus and stained the infected cells for immunofluorescence microscopy. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, the number of infected cells (green) was clearly diminished after treatment with perilla and sage infusions. The antiviral activity was still evident even when a high amount of virus was used for infection (0.5 PFU/cell). When we evaluated different members of the family of <italic>Perilla frutescens</italic> (red perilla, green perilla, and bi-color perilla), we observed antiviral activity in all three cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). No comparable antiviral activity was observed under the aforementioned conditions when ginger, fennel, chamomile flower, and Greek mountain teas were tested (data not shown). To confirm, that the experimental setup allows reporting of antiviral activity affecting post-entry steps, we included a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum sample with shown neutralizing capacity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> in our analysis. We observed that the perilla and sage infusions outperformed the effect of the convalescent serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>; NAbs, neutralizing antibodies) under these experimental conditions, showing that the herbs perilla and sage contain components active against SARS-CoV-2 replication by interfering with a post-entry step. Since the components were extracted by boiling the herbs in water, we concluded that the antiviral activity is elicited by water-soluble heat-stable compound(s). When we used a second clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate to test the susceptibility towards the herbal components, we observed almost identical dose responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The combined results of several independent experiments (using two distinct SARS-CoV-2 isolates, B.1 and B.1.1.232, for the infection of Vero E6 and α-S or α-N antibodies for staining) revealed highly significant antiviral activity of all tested dilutions of the perilla infusion as well as of the 1/10 and 1/20 dilutions of the sage infusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Cell viability was determined to exclude cytotoxicity as reason for diminished viral replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). In conclusion, the <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> perilla and sage contain water-soluble heat-stable components that exhibit potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Preserved sage and perilla leaves retain bioactive compounds</title><p id="P7">Considering that the herbal infusions were prepared from 150 g of fresh herbal material per liter, which correspond to 15-30 g of dried herbal material per liter (assuming a water content of 80-90% of fresh herbs), a 1/10 dilution of these infusions already meets the concentration of herbal teas prepared from standard tea bags (1.5-2.25 g per cup). This indicates that herbal teas prepared from commercially available tea bags or dried herb leaves might contain a sufficient concentration of the antiviral compound(s). To further adapt the experimental setup to realistic conditions of tea consumption, we shortened the treatment time from 1 h to 30 min. Even under this condition, significant reduction of viral replication was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Next, we compared the antiviral activity of infusions prepared from fresh or dried herb leaves. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>, dried sage leaves retained most of the antiviral component(s) whereas dried perilla was less effective as compared to fresh perilla leaves although significant inhibition of viral replication was still observed for the 1/10 dilutions. To assess whether conservation of perilla by freezing could be superior to drying in terms of preserving the antiviral component(s), we first tested if the antiviral activity of perilla infusions is reduced by freeze-thaw cycles. Since this did not seem to be the case (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>), infusions prepared from fresh and frozen perilla leaves were compared. The comparison revealed that the preservation of the herbs by freezing was preferable to drying (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>). Since the herbal infusions were prepared by boiling, simmering, and over-night incubation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref> section), we also tested if the standard procedure of herbal tea preparation using dried sage leaves is sufficient to extract the antiviral component(s). To this end, dried sage leaves were boiled up in water and incubated for 10 min before the herb leaves were removed. When this 10-min infusion of dried sage was compared to the over-night infusion, very similar dose response curves were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Perilla and sage elicit prophylactic antiviral activity <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p id="P8">Having observed the potent antiviral activity of perilla and sage after only 1 h of treatment, we wondered whether the herbs might also elicit prophylactic effects. Therefore, Vero E6 cells were treated 1 h prior to infection with different dilutions of the herbal infusions before the supernatant including the herbal components was removed. Subsequently, SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed and the virus suspension was replaced by fresh medium at 1 h p.i. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). By removing the herbal infusions before infection, we aimed to primarily assess antiviral effects based on cellular responses and not on direct virucidal elimination of infectious virus particles. The analysis of combined results of 6 independent experiments using two distinct SARS-CoV-2 isolates and α-S or α-N antibodies for staining showed highly significant decrease of infectivity, especially upon pre-treatment with the perilla infusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). To compare the extent of prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral capacity, we conducted an experiment in which we treated and pre-treated the infected cells in parallel. As already indicated by the results of the independent experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2 a, b and Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>), therapeutic treatment elicited stronger antiviral activity for both perilla and sage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4 c, d</xref>). Nonetheless, perilla and sage teas might not only be suitable for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections but also for prevention of infections.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Perilla and sage confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cells</title><p id="P9">Since cells differ concerning the mode of entry of SARS-CoV-2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, a second independent cell line was tested. Caco-2 cells were used to analyze the antiviral activity elicited by perilla and sage infusions in human cells. We have observed that SARS-CoV-2 replication is more protracted in Caco-2 cells compared to Vero E6 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Therefore, the experimental setup was adapted by increasing the time of treatment as well as the time of infection before analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). We observed a strong decrease in infectivity in perilla- and sage-treated Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). Encouraged by this result, we applied the same treatment regimen of 1 h as was used for Vero E6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). This early short-term treatment was sufficient to potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, even in cells with a protracted viral replication cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). To visualize the antiviral activity, Caco-2 cells were infected with and without treatment (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) and were fixed for fluorescence microscopic analysis. This analysis showed clearly visible differences in the number of Spike-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). To corroborate the data obtained so far, we analyzed the antiviral activity of herbal infusions by staining the intracellular spike protein by in-cell-ELISA (icELISA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>) as well as quantifying the viral genomes in the supernatant by qRT-PCR. The results showed that the icELISA data reflected the decrease in viral replication and the resulting decline in viral progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The herbal infusions exert antiviral effects comparable to IFNβ and remdesivir and outperform IFNα2 upon short-term treatment</title><p id="P10">Interferons mediate innate protection against viruses and are considered a treatment option for COVID-19 disease and provide certain benchmark for relevant antiviral activity. Another antiviral drug authorized for emergency use in COVID-19 patients is remdesivir, an adenosine nucleotide analog prodrug inhibiting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. To assess the potency of the herbal infusions, we compared treatment with perilla and sage infusions with treatment with remdesivir, IFN±2, and IFN². We infected Vero E6 or Caco-2 cells with SARS-CoV-2 and treated the infected cells at 1 h post-infection for 1 h before the treatment was removed. The antiviral activity was determined by quantification of viral proteins by icELISA. Under herein used experimental condition, perilla and sage infusions showed higher antiviral potency than remdesivir in Vero E6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and comparable antiviral activity in infected Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). When the herbal infusions were compared to IFNs, we observed similar effects to short-term IFNβ treatment but higher potency than short-term treatment with IFNα2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Consistent with the notion that the herbal infusions act in a different manner than the IFNs, treatment with the Janus kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib abrogated the antiviral activity of IFNβ but not perilla and sage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Identification of antiviral components following size exclusion and protein fractionation analyses</title><p id="P11">Since the herbal infusions contain a large number of different components, it appeared difficult to determine the active substances without obtaining additional information about the nature of these active components. To narrow down candidate substances, we fractionated the components of the herbal infusions according to their molecular size and tested the antiviral activity of these fractions. When we tested the fractions obtained by use of Amicon 100K, 30K, and 10K filters, we were able to assign the active component(s) to substances less than 10 kDa in size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). To further restrict the number of substances to be analyzed, we used Amicon 10K and 3K filters for fractionation. Additionally, we prepared by dialysis the fraction of substances larger than 1 kDa. The analysis of these fractions revealed that the dialyzed herbal infusions exhibited decreased antiviral activity indicating that components less than 1 kDa in size contribute to the antiviral activity of perilla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>) and sage infusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In light of these findings, we reviewed the literature for candidate substances. Based on published lists of perilla components (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>), we tested various compounds present in <italic>Lamiaceae.</italic> We did not detect antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 when we tested apigenin, luteolin, rosmarinic acid, and tormentic acid (data not shown). Interestingly, when we analyzed cinnamic acid, hydroxy-cinnamic acid, and dihydroxy-cinnamic acid, only the treatment with dihydroxy-cinnamic acid diminished SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 (data not shown) and Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). This finding is remarkable, since hydroxy-cinnamic acid and dihydroxy-cinnamic acid (that is more familiar under the name caffeic acid) differ only by a single hydroxyl group. In addition, we found that, besides caffeic acid, perilla aldehyde and perillyl alcohol also exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). These results suggest that the effect of the herbal infusions is based on multiple components that presumably act through additive mechanisms. To evaluate whether knowledge of the active components could help predict additional antiviral herbs, we searched for herbs containing high amounts of caffeic acid. Thyme is a herb with a high content of caffeic acid (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://phenol-explorer.eu/contents/polyphenol/457">http://phenol-explorer.eu/contents/polyphenol/457</ext-link>). Therefore, we analyzed aqueous infusions of thyme. We observed potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>). Thus, the identification of antiviral herbal components enabled the prediction of further antiviral herbs and may pave the way to novel therapeutics for COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Global mass spectrometry (MS) analyses proposed induction of HMOX-1 as anti-SARS-CoV-2 effector mechanism of herbal infusions</title><p id="P12">Next, we sought to determine proteomic changes in cells treated with perilla and sage infusions to advance our understanding of effector mechanisms that lead to the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 replication. To this end, SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells as well as mock controls were treated at 1 h p.i. with perilla and sage infusion for 1 h. At different time points after infection (2, 6, 20 h p.i. in the case of Vero E6 and 2, 6, 30 h p.i. in the case of Caco-2), cells were lysed and subjected to global MS analysis. To be able to detect the mutual interplay between viral and host proteins, we increased the virus amount used for infection to MOI 0.3 and MOI 0.5 for Vero E6 and Caco-2, respectively. This experimental setting might result in overwhelming expression of viral gene products at late times post-infection, but it presumably allows sufficient viral gene expression early after infection to unravel the impact of viral proteins on cellular processes. Overall, we detected and quantified 19 viral proteins and protein forms as well as 3733 cellular proteins in Vero E6 and 4646 cellular proteins in Caco-2 samples by MS. To our knowledge, this is the first reported proteomic dataset investigating effects of herbal extracts such as perilla and sage in cell culture models. To support broad access to the dataset and to allow facile data visualization, we included a ready-to-use Microsoft Excel-based plotting option as supplement (Supplementary File 1 and 2 for quantified Vero E6 and Caco-2 proteins, respectively). Using these tables, relative abundances of all individual proteins detected by at least two unique peptides can be visualized. Next, we examined the MS data to evaluate whether proteomic changes in host proteins, which have been suggested as host restriction factors (HRFs) and host dependency factors (HDFs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, could explain the observed antiviral activity. For this purpose, we analyzed all proposed HRFs and HDFs that could be consistently quantified across all investigated conditions. These analyses revealed no significant and consistent upregulation of HRFs and downregulation of HDFs upon treatment with perilla or sage infusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8 and 9</xref>). Therefore, we searched for proteins significantly regulated at least 1.5-fold upon treatment with perilla or sage infusions in infected cells at 6 h p. i. because this condition most likely includes the relevant changes. For the differential comparisons, the proteins were filtered by the coefficient of variation (CV): all proteins with a CV &lt;20% over all measurements (also across treatments) were not considered. When comparing the changes induced by treatment with perilla or sage infusions in infected cells at 6 h p.i., Heme Oxygenase 1 (HMOX-1) was the only protein found to be significantly altered under all 4 conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). HMOX-1 is an enzyme involved in the response to oxidative stress. It catalyzes the oxidative degradation of heme to biliverdin, a precursor of bilirubin, thereby detoxifying free heme <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. When we examined in detail the individual proteins regulated by perilla and sage infusions, we found additional proteins involved in the oxidative stress response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). As example, Sulfiredoxin 1 (SRXN1), an endogenous antioxidant protein that prevents cell oxidative stress damage, was also upregulated in Caco-2 cells after treatment. Interestingly, levels of CYP1A1, that was recently shown to inhibit HMOX-1-mediated bilirubin formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, were decreased in infected Caco-2 cells after treatment with perilla or sage infusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). This finding confirmed that activity of HMOX-1 was elevated in infected cells treated with perilla or sage infusions. Noteworthy, viral N as well as membrane (M) and ORF7a (7a) proteins were the most strongly downregulated proteins in Caco-2 and Vero E6 cells, respectively, when treated with herbal infusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>), which further corroborates the observed antiviral activity.</p><p id="P13">To test whether the increase in HMOX-1 protein levels and activity may represent one of the effector mechanisms of herbal infusions to restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication, we examined the antiviral activity of HMOX-1-inducing substances such as sulforaphane and fraxetin. Indeed, we observed antiviral activity after short-term treatment with sulforaphane or fraxetin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). This result raised the question of whether this information could be applied to improve the efficacy of the herbal treatments. HMOX-1 was found to be upregulated about 2-fold in infected Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Therefore, we wondered whether increased HMOX-1 induction could boost the antiviral activity of perilla and sage. To test this option, we combined the herbal infusions with a dose of fraxetin that was in itself not active against SARS-CoV-2 to treat infected cells. In fact, the combination of low-dose fraxetin with perilla or sage infusions strongly enhanced the antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Herbal infusions exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern</title><p id="P14">Since the beginning of the pandemic, several SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged. In particular, the variants of concern (VOCs) exhibit strong impact on the course of the pandemic. Therefore, we tested whether the antiviral principle induced by treatment with perilla and sage infusions also counteracts infections with the VOCs Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (BA.1). The E484K mutation present in the S protein of the Beta variant was shown to be an escape mutation impairing the neutralizing capacity of antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. This finding was confirmed with our Beta virus isolate. We were not able to stain Beta by icELISA when we used two different monoclonal antibodies both binding to the RBD of S (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11a</xref>). When using a polyclonal α-RBD antibody, the signal was reduced but not completely lost (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11a</xref>). In contrast, the recognition by α-N antibodies was not affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11a</xref>). Based on these observations, we used α-N for icELISA detection and quantification of Beta infections. We analyzed the antiviral activity of perilla and sage infusions by icELISA as well as qRT-PCR quantification of viral progeny in the supernatant and observed similar antiviral effects against wild-type, Alpha, and Beta (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). We also detected strong antiviral activity of perilla and sage infusions against the Delta variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>), but not when coriander infusion was used (data not shown). Delta could only be tested in human cells because the P681R mutation in the S protein of Delta almost completely prevents infection of Vero E6 cells (unpublished observation). Similarly, the currently most widespread Omicron variant was assessed in human cells. In our hands, Omicron hardly replicated in Vero E6 cells, and even in human cells, Omicron replicated only to low titers (unpublished observation). For this reason, we used lower input virus doses and did not apply the icELISA readout but used the more sensitive quantification of viral progeny by qRT-PCR. This analysis revealed that perilla and sage infusions also elicited antiviral activity against Omicron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Taken together, aqueous infusions based on perilla and sage exhibit strong <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 including VOCs such as Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">The WHO SOLIDARITY trial comprising more than 400 hospitals and 11,000 patients in 30 countries showed that <italic>“Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir and Interferon regimens appeared to have little or no effect on hospitalized COVID-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay”</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. To a certain extent, this finding may be attributed to the practice of reserving such drugs for critically ill patients for whom they may be applied too late in terms of disease progression. Recently, Merck and Pfizer applied for an emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the drugs Molnupiravir and Paxlovid, respectively. Clinical trials showed promising results in reducing the risk of hospitalization or death when given early in the infection, but definitive clinical data are still needed to prove the efficacy of the antiviral treatment candidates. A widely discussed potential solution to the limited efficacy of single therapies is the combination of substances that have a marginal effect on their own. Such “shotgun” treatment regimens have already shown some success <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Since herbal teas are ubiquitously available, almost free of charge, and exhibit excellent safety profiles given their consumption as spices, we propose to add perilla, sage, and thyme teas to combinatorial treatment regimens.

A typical cup of tea corresponds to approx. 250 ml of volume and commercial tea bags usually contain 1.5-2.25 g of plant material. Our herbal extracts were produced using 15 g of fresh herb leaves boiled in 100 ml of water. Assuming a water content of 80-90% of fresh herbs, a 1/10 dilution of these infusions already corresponds to herbal teas prepared from standard tea bags (1.5-2.25 g per cup). In human cells, perilla and sage infusions elicited significant antiviral effects at dilutions of 1/40 (3.75 g per liter or ca. 0.94 g per cup) and 1/30 (5 g per liter or ca. 1.25 g per cup) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), indicating efficacy at concentrations usually consumed in such herbal teas.</p><p id="P18">Given that Vero cells are incapable to express type I interferons due to genetic aberrations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, the antiviral activity observed in Vero E6 cells indicate that perilla and sage extracts elicit their effect independent of interferon induction. The result that the Janus kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib did not revert the antiviral activity elicited by perilla and sage infusions in Caco-2 cells supports this conclusion.

This conclusion is further supported by our observation that sage and perilla teas diminished viral replication, especially when they were applied after infection at a time point at which neutralizing antibodies present in convalescent serum had lost most of their antiviral activity.

Then, tryptic digestion was stopped by reducing the pH &lt;2 through the addition of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, Biosolve, Valkenswaard, Netherlands) to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). Aliquots were transferred to 700 μl glass-vial plates (Waters, Eschborn, Germany) for injection on a monolithic column HPLC (for tryptic digestion quality control) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. Based on the results, 4-5 replicates per condition were further analyzed by LC-MS.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>LC-MS in data-dependent acquisition-mode (DDA)</title><p id="P34">LC-MS was conducted using an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano ProFlow UPLC system operated by Chromeleon Client 6.80 and online-coupled to a Q Exactive HF MS operated by Tune application 2.8 SP1 and Thermo Scientific Xcalibur 3.0.63 (both Thermo Scientific, Dreieich, Germany, including HPLC columns). Employed solvents were LC-MS grade or higher (Biosolve, Valkenswaard, Netherlands). 825 ng of tryptic peptides per LC-MS injection were analyzed. Samples were loaded on a trapping column (Acclaim PepMap C18, 0.1 x 20 mm, 5 μm, 100 Å) for 3 min in 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Then, the trapping column was switched in line with the analytical column (Acclaim PepMap C18; 0.075 x 500 mm, 2 μm, 100 Å) and peptides were separated at a flow rate of 250 nl/min using a 102 min linear gradient of buffer B (84% v/v acetonitrile [ACN], 0.1% v/v formic acid [FA]) in buffer A (0.1% v/v FA) ranging from 3 to 25% B, followed by a 10 min linear gradient ranging from 25 to 35% B, washing steps and reconditioning of the analytical column to 3% B. Both columns were kept at 60°C temperature.</p><p id="P35">The UPLC system was coupled to the Q Exactive HF MS via a NSI Source (Thermo). Coated emitters (Silica Tip, 20 μm inner diameter, 10 μm tip inner diameter, New Objectives, Woburn, MA) and a static voltage of 1.8 kV were applied for electrospray ionization, ion transfer tube temperature was set to 250°C. The MS was operated in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode at positive polarity; all spectra were acquired in profile mode with survey scans acquired at a resolution of 60,000 followed by 15 MS/MS scans at a resolution of 15,000 (top15). Precursor ions were selected for MS/MS by intensity, isolated in a 1.6 m/z window and subjected to fragmentation by higher energy collision induced dissociation using a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 27. Automatic gain control target values were set to 10<sup>6</sup> and 5x10<sup>4</sup> and the maximum ion injection was set to 120 ms and 50 ms for MS and MS/MS, respectively.
