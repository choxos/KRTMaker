Experimentally infected camelids clear infectious virus within one week and mount an effective adaptive immune response. Here, transcription of immune response genes was monitored in the respiratory tract of MERS-CoV infected alpacas. Concomitant to the peak of infection, occurring at 2 days post inoculation (dpi), type I and III interferons (IFNs) were maximally transcribed only in the nasal mucosa of alpacas, provoking the induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) along the whole respiratory tract. Simultaneous to mild focal infiltration of leukocytes in nasal mucosa and submucosa, upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 and dampened transcription of pro-inflammatory genes under NF-κB control were observed. In the lung, early (1 dpi) transcription of chemokines (CCL2 and CCL3) correlated with a transient accumulation of mainly mononuclear leukocytes. A tight regulation of IFNs in lungs with expression of ISGs and controlled inflammatory responses, might contribute to virus clearance without causing tissue damage. Thus, the nasal mucosa, the main target of MERS-CoV in camelids, is central in driving an efficient innate immune response based on triggering ISGs as well as the dual anti-inflammatory effects of type III IFNs and IL10.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a disease caused by a zoonotic Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that emerged in 2012 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] raising a toll of 2,562 confirmed human cases in 27 countries, with 881 deaths until the November 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. In humans, MERS-CoV infection ranges from asymptomatic to severe or even fatal respiratory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Dromedary camels are the main viral reservoir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], and all camelids are susceptible to the virus, under both natural and experimental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. However, despite consequent tissue viral loads and high viral shedding at the upper respiratory tract (URT) level, infection in camelids is asymptomatic, leading to a rapid clearance of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] and the establishment of a solid acquired immunity. Indeed, field studies revealed a high proportion of serum neutralizing antibodies in dromedary camels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Innate immune responses are essential as they link adaptive immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] and are key players in the pathology of diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, the severity of MERS lesions in humans has been attributed to aberrant innate and adaptive immune responses based essentially on data obtained from macrophages isolated from healthy donors or infected patients, as well as dosage of cytokines/chemokines from bronchoalveolar lavages. The outcome of these studies reveals an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines due to the activation of C-type lectin receptors, RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) and an impaired production of type I interferons (IFN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. High production and persistent high levels of these cytokines in macrophages are likely to exacerbate disease severity. Despite that macrophages can be infected, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>, MERS-CoV has a preferable tropism for respiratory epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. To date, no data is available on innate immune responses affecting the human respiratory mucosa <italic>in vivo</italic> and most information was mainly obtained from <italic>ex vivo</italic> pseudostratified primary bronchial airway epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], immortalized epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] or respiratory explants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Although some contradictory results have been reported, MERS-CoV infections in these cells or tissues led to the conclusion that type I and III IFN are inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] or, when delayed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], weakly expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Nonetheless, some MERS-CoV African strains isolated from dromedary camels, as opposed to the Arabian human isolated EMC/2012 strain, can induce higher levels of IFNβ, IFNλ1, IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) and proinflammatory cytokines mRNA in Calu-3 cells after 48 h of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Indeed, the prototypic strain EMC/2012 and MERS-CoV African strains belong to different clades (A and C respectively) displaying deletions particularly in the ORF4b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. In that respect, several viral factors, including MERS-CoV accessory proteins 4a and 4b, have been shown in respiratory epithelial cell lines to antagonize the production of IFNs, to interfere with the NF-κB signaling pathway by avoiding production of proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] and inhibiting the protein kinase R-mediated stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. In addition, in epithelial cell lines, the structural viral protein N interacts with the host E3 ligase tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25) impeding ubiquitination of RIG-I and further expression of type I interferons and IFN-λ1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Therefore, in contrast to the cytokine storm provoked by macrophages, epithelial innate immune responses seem to be profoundly paralyzed. This is of major consequence for the progression of the disease, since the respiratory mucosa is the primary barrier for MERS-CoV. Recent findings indicate that type III IFNs confer initial protection, restricting tissue damage at the mucosa level by limiting inflammatory responses and potentiating adaptive immunity. Furthermore, it is postulated that when the viral burden is high and the mucosal fitness is broken, type I IFNs take over, leading to enhanced immune responses provoking also uncontrolled pro-inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Owing that bats, the primary reservoir for coronaviruses, are tolerant to MERS-CoV (and other viruses) due to a dampened Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], it was of major interest to gain insights into innate immune responses induced by MERS-CoV in camelids. Therefore, by understanding how reservoir/intermediary hosts control MERS-CoV and by extension other coronaviruses, a wealth of information could be translated to other species experimenting severe disease for the improvement of prevention, treatments and vaccines.</p><p id="P4">In the present study, alpacas were experimentally infected and monitored at the transcriptional level for a set of innate immune response genes along the upper and lower respiratory tract (LRT) during four consecutive days. Special attention was given to the nasal epithelium as it is the primary site of MERS-CoV replication. Regulation of IFNs, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), IFN regulatory transcription factors (IRFs) and enzymes constituting the NLRP3 inflammasome or the NF-κB pathway was analyzed providing insights on signaling mechanisms important for MERS-CoV replication and disease progression, elucidating key regulatory host factors to counteract MERS-CoV infection.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Clinical signs of alpacas following MERS-CoV infection</title><p id="P5">The objective of this study was to evaluate early innate immune responses upon MERS-CoV infection in camelids. The MERS-CoV Qatar15/2015 strain was selected because clade B strains are nowadays exclusively circulating in the Arabian Peninsula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Three alpacas (AP13-AP15) were euthanized before virus inoculation and served as controls, while groups of three animals (AP1-AP3, AP4-AP6, AP7-AP9, AP10-AP12) were sacrificed sequentially during four consecutive days after MERS-CoV inoculation. nasal swabs (NS) and respiratory tissue samples were collected at the day of euthanasia. Following virus inoculation, only one alpaca (AP6) secreted a mild amount of nasal mucus on 2 days post inoculation (dpi). None of the remaining animals showed clinical signs and basal body temperatures remained constant (below 39.5ºC) throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Nasal viral shedding and MERS-CoV loads in respiratory tracts during infection in alpacas</title><p id="P6">On the day of euthanasia (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 dpi), NS were collected. Viral detection and loads were assessed by RT-qPCR. All MERS-CoV inoculated alpacas (AP1-AP12) shed viral RNA, but no major differences were detected between the different time points. Also, viral titration in NS showed that all inoculated animals excreted infectious MERS-CoV. Maximal viral loads in the nasal cavity were reached at 2 dpi. Of note, animal AP6 shed the highest loads of infectious virus (4.8 TCID50/ml). None of the alpacas, including negative controls (AP13-AP15), had viral RNA or infectious virus on 0 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). MERS-CoV RNA was detected in all homogenized respiratory tissues during infection. The higher viral loads were found on 2 dpi in nasal turbinates and bronchus with a significant increase compared to those detected on 1 dpi. Trachea and lung displayed the lowest viral RNA loads. In all cases, at 4 dpi, infectious virus was still excreted, and viral RNA was present in the respiratory tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>MERS-CoV establishes early infections in URTs and LRTs of alpacas</title><p id="P7">Histopathology of URTs and LRTs was assessed in a blinded manner independently by veterinary pathologists. On 2 and 3 dpi, histological lesions in MERS-CoV infected alpacas were limited to the respiratory tract, being of multifocal distribution and mild. Lesions in nasal turbinates were characterized by mild rhinitis, segmental hyperplasia of the nasal epithelium, lymphocytic exocytosis, loss of epithelial polarity and tight junction integrity. Additionally, small numbers of lymphocytes with fewer macrophages infiltrated the underlying submucosa. No microscopic lesions were observed in nasal turbinates on 0, 1 and 4 dpi in any of the animals, which displayed a multifocal localization of the MERS-CoV antigen detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). While only a few pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells in the nose contained MERS-CoV antigen on 1 dpi, the number of positive epithelial cells was remarkably high on 2 dpi; such number steadily decreased in the alpacas necropsied on the following days. On 4 dpi, the MERS-CoV antigen was scarcely detected with no evidence of microscopic lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Trachea and bronchus showed multifocal, mild tracheitis/bronchitis, with the presence of few lymphocytes in the epithelium and mild infiltration of the submucosa by lymphocytes and macrophages on 2 dpi. In line with these observations, MERS-CoV infected cells were rarely detected within the epithelium on 2 dpi by IHC, mostly in areas displaying these minimal lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). Remarkably, the trachea of AP6 harbored the highest viral load as detected by IHC. Few labeled cells were observed on 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Table</xref>) with no evidence of lesions. Additionally, lung lobes showed mild multifocal perivascular and peribronchiolar infiltration by lymphocytes and the presence of monocyte/macrophages within the alveoli, being more evident on 2dpi. MERS-CoV antigen was occasionally observed in bronchiolar epithelial cells on 2 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>), and rarely on 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Table</xref>). Of note, pneumocytes were not labeled by MERS-CoV IHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Viral loads in micro-dissected nasal tissues and whole tracheal and lung sections</title><p id="P9">Viral loads and viral transcription/replication were also assessed on methacarn-fixed paraffin-embedded (MFPE) tissue sections which were further used for cytokine quantification. Special attention was given to the nasal epithelium as it is the privileged tissue for viral replication. Thus, laser capture microdissection (LCM) was used to obtain, when possible and for each animal, nasal epithelial areas positive or negative for MERS-CoV, as assessed by IHC, in different but consecutive (parallel) MFPE tissue sections. Their respective underlying submucosa were also collected at 1 and 3 dpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig</xref>). Moreover, MFPE sections of tracheas and lungs were directly scrapped from the slide. On 1 dpi only a few isolated nasal epithelial cells were IHC positive. These were micro-dissected, as described above, with the surrounding IHC negative cells to get enough RNA for the microfluidic PCR quantitative assay. To the contrary, due to the massive infection in nasal tissues at 2 dpi, only IHC negative nasal epithelial areas from AP4 could be collected. Viral loads in micro-dissected nasal tissues and MFPE tracheal and lung scrapped samples were quantified with UpE primers using the microfluidic quantitative PCR assay. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">A in S2 Fig</xref>, micro-dissected MERS-CoV infected epithelial areas, as assessed by their parallel IHC stained sections, showed higher viral loads than non-labelled epithelial areas, confirming the validity of the technique. In agreement with immunohistochemical observations, MERS-CoV RNA was of lower abundance in submucosal layers. As expected, and according to results obtained with tissue macerates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>), microfluidic quantification of MERS-CoV viral RNA revealed a much lower degree of virus replication in trachea and lung than in nasal tissues. These results were confirmed with the M mRNA microfluidic PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">B in S2 Fig and A in S3 Table</xref>) and, as expected, showed a greater extension of MERS-CoV infection in tissues, in particular in the nasal epithelia, than that revealed by IHC.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>High induction of type I and III IFNs in the nasal mucosa occurs at the peak of infection in alpacas</title><p id="P10">In order to investigate the antiviral pathways induced upon MERS-CoV infection, relative mRNA expression levels for 37 innate immune response genes were assessed along the respiratory tract with the same cDNA samples as those used for viral UpE and M mRNA quantifications in a Fluidigm BioMark microfluidic assay. In all nasal mucosa of non-infected animals, IFNβ mRNA was undetectable and comparisons for this gene were performed against levels of expression found in animals infected on 1 dpi. For IFNλ3 very low basal levels, at the limit of detection (Cq=25), were found in 2 out of 3 animals on 0 dpi.

Only three genes involved in inflammation, TNFα, IL6 and IRF5 (mean of 2.5-3 Fc for each of them), were found slightly upregulated at 2 dpi, while the levels of expression of other critical pro-inflammatory factors, such as the cytokines IL8, IL1β, the adaptor PYCARD and the PRRs NLRP3, were marginally or not affected by the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">A in S3 Fig and C in S3 Table</xref>).

Invariably, all the above-mentioned genes had a significant decreased expression from 2 dpi onwards.

Micro-dissected areas from the submucosa of control and infected animals (1 and 3 dpi) were analyzed for relative mRNA expression of innate immune genes. Except for IFNλ3 which was not detected in any inoculated or control animals, all other IFNs were expressed at basal levels in control non-infected alpacas. IFNβ was undetected at 1 dpi in two inoculated animals (AP2 and AP3) and below basal levels in alpaca AP1 while IFNα and IFNλ1 were marginally fluctuating. Most of the major transcriptional modifications occurred at 3 dpi. In submucosa underlying the most infected epithelia areas, IFNλ1 was expressed at basal levels while IFNα and IFNβ were not induced. On the contrary, ISGs, IRFs and PRRs, like ISG15 (mean of 77 Fc), OAS1 (mean of 6 Fc), MX1 (mean of 46 Fc), CXCL10 (mean of 14 Fc), RIG1 (mean of 12 Fc), MDA5 (mean of 16 Fc), IRF7 (mean of 9 Fc) and TLR7 (mean of 5 Fc) were highly to moderately upregulated. Expression of genes constituting the inflammasome was mostly not altered for NLRP3 or moderately increased for CASP1 (mean of 5 Fc) and PYCARD (mean of 3 Fc); but remarkably, IL1β was significantly downregulated (mean of 3 Fc; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A and B</xref>). Also, except for a non-significant increase of TNFα (mean of 5 Fc) and a slight upregulation of IRF5 (mean of 3 Fc; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), no other pro-inflammatory factors were upregulated. Indeed, IL8 was downregulated (mean of -40 Fc). According to these findings, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 (mean of 3.5 Fc) was moderately upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">B and D in S3 Table</xref>).

Overall, results obtained in the submucosa are indicative of a potential IFN paracrine signaling from the epithelium for the occurrence of ISGs induction in the absence of significant IFN mRNA synthesis. Moreover, despite mild focal infiltrations(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>), genes involved in the inflammatory process were either suppressed, unaltered or mildly activated.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>ISGs are upregulated in the trachea of infected alpacas without increased endogenous IFNs mRNA</title><p id="P17">Innate immune response genes were further monitored along the URT.

This also provides indirect proof that the chemokines CCL2 and CCL3 were produced at the protein level and exerted chemoattraction.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Early induction of CCL2 and CCL3 correlates with infiltration of macrophages and lymphocyte like cells in the lungs of infected alpacas</title><p id="P18">Despite low infectivity of MERS-CoV in the LRT, infiltration of leukocytes was observed suggesting that cytokines and chemokines are at play. At the lung level, IFNα and IFNλ1 were expressed on 0 dpi in non-infected controls.

IFNλ3 and IFNβ mRNAs were not detected in any of the animals including controls. Upregulation of ISGs (ISG15, MX1 and OAS1) and IRF7 started at 1 dpi, reached a peak at 2 dpi and weaned at 4 dpi. RIG1 and MDA5 were unevenly upregulated with a lower intensity than for other tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">C in S3 Fig and F in S3 Table</xref>). Remarkably, NLRP3 was moderately but significantly upregulated at 1, 2 and 4 dpi concomitant with increased levels of TNFα and IL1β at 1 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A and B</xref>).

IL15, a natural killer cell activator cytokine, was significantly upregulated at 1 and 2 dpi while expression patterns of other proinflammatory cytokines varied between animals and days of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">C in S3 Fig and F in S3 Table</xref>).</p><p id="P19">In addition, CCL2 and CCL3 were moderately to highly upregulated at most of the time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">C in S3 Fig and B in S5 Fig</xref>).

Remarkably, AP6 showed accumulation of leukocytes without a notable induction of CCL2 and CCL3 mRNAs. Moreover, this animal was the highest producer of these chemoattractant chemokines in trachea. Nonetheless, the number of infiltrating leukocytes correlated with the induction of CCL2 (r = 0.62, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0236) and CCL3 (r = 0.59, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0323) as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">D and E in S5 Fig</xref>. When considering AP6 as an out layer, correlations became stronger for both CCL2 (r = 0.72, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0077) and CCL3 (r = 0.87, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0002) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7A</xref>. Overall, ISGs were induced in the absence of IFN gene expression suggesting an endocrine effect of IFNs produced in the nasal epithelia. In addition, despite transient accumulation of leukocytes correlating with induction of CCL2 and CCL3 in the lung, exacerbation of inflammatory responses did not occur.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Genes of the NF-κ B pathway and IRF5 are transcriptionally unaltered in respiratory tissues during MERS-CoV infection</title><p id="P20">Transcription of the NF-κB p50 subunit (NFKB1) and some important regulators of the NF-κB pathway were checked along URTs and LRTs. These regulators included two enzymes, AZI2 and TBK1, downstream of the RLRs and TLR signaling pathways, essential for the phosphorylation of NF-κB, the NF-κB inhibitor NFKBIA and an adaptor CARD9 that mediates signals from C-type lectins to regulate the NF-κB pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6 Fig</xref>). All these genes were expressed at basal levels in the nasal mucosa, submucosa, trachea and lung of control non-infected alpacas. NFKB1, AZI2 and TBK1 were only marginally induced or remained unaltered in the nasal epithelia; however, NFKBIA and CARD9 were expressed at basal levels or even slightly downregulated in all the tissues. All the above mentioned genes were fluctuating around basal transcriptional levels across alpaca respiratory tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">C-F in S3 Table</xref>) indicating that the NF-κB mediated signaling pathway was not exacerbated or downregulated in response to MERS-CoV. Moreover, IRF5, an inducer of TNFα and IL6 as well as an important factor for the polarization of M1 macrophages, was only slightly but significantly upregulated in the nasal epithelium (2 dpi) and submucosa (3 dpi). In all other tissues and, in particular lung, the majority of animals did not reach the threshold of 2 Fc for IRF5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">C in S3 Fig and F in S3 Table</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P21">The present study exposes an integrated investigation at the respiratory tract level performed <italic>in vivo</italic> in a natural reservoir/intermediate host upon MERS-CoV infection. As camelids are the primary zoonotic reservoirs for human infection, it is essential to gain insight into the potential mechanisms of asymptomatic manifestation since they can unravel targets for prophylactic treatments in susceptible hosts. In the present study, all experimentally inoculated alpacas were successfully infected, as genomic viral UpE, subgenomic M mRNA and the N protein could be detected in most of the tissues examined by IHC, RT-qPCR or micro fluidic PCR assays from the URT and LRT at 1 to 4 dpi. This proved that the MERS-CoV Qatar15/2015 strain had spread and in some instance replicated throughout the whole respiratory tracts, although mainly at the URT where the virus receptor DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) is most abundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Acknowledging that respiratory mucosal epithelial cells are the main primary target for MERS-CoV and the paucity of data on the effect <italic>in vivo</italic> of the virus to the mucosal barrier on humans and other laboratory species (mainly human DPP4 transgenic or transduced mice and non-human primates) a special attention was given here to monitor innate immune responses occurring during the first 4 days of infection in the nasal epithelium of alpacas and the possible repercussions of these responses in the respiratory tract.</p><p id="P22">In mucosa, pathogens are sensed by PRRs leading to the production of type I and III IFNs via IRFs. In turn, IFNs can activate through the JAK-STAT pathway, in an autocrine, paracrine or endocrine manner, transcription of various antiviral and regulatory ISGs including also PRRs and IRFs. Fine tuning of these responses is paramount in determining the outcome of viral infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. In MERS-CoV infected alpacas, during the first 24h, apart from IFNβ which started to be induced, type I and III IFNs were not altered in the nasal mucosa when compared to control animals. This short period seems to be crucial for the virus to establish a productive infection in alpacas for at least 5 to 6 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] by delaying host protective mechanisms such as activation of PRR pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Nonetheless, and only in the nasal epithelium, transcription of all type I and III IFNs peaked simultaneously at 2 dpi and weaned progressively. This wave of IFNs was concomitant with the induction of ISGs, PRRs and IRF7 not only at the nasal epithelial barrier and its underlying submucosa but also in trachea and lungs where IFN mRNAs were never detected or induced. Therefore, the effect of the IFN response at the nasal mucosa may extend to distant respiratory tissues in a paracrine or endocrine manner. In that respect, in mice, IFNλ produced in the URT prevents dissemination of influenza virus to the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>].</p><p id="P23">The use of IHC and microfluidic PCR assays combined with LCM permitted to compare, in the same and different animals, areas of the nasal epithelium with high and low viral loads. Heavily infected mucosal areas were responsible for the highest induction of type III IFNs. Although markedly induced, type I IFNs did not significantly correlated with tissue viral loads. Consistent with this IFN production, the number of MERS-CoV infected cells detected by IHC was maximal on 2 dpi and decreased over time. However, all infected alpacas shed infectious viral particles in the nasal cavity from 1 dpi onwards according to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. This might be due to a high accumulation of virus in the nasal cavity which may take a few days to clear. Remarkably, results obtained herein contrast with those found in human epithelial cells and respiratory explants since the induction of type I and III IFNs was limited or inhibited in response to MERS-CoV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. The dampened IFN priming in humans is likely due to the role of IFN antagonism by MERS-CoV accessory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], through which virus replication is facilitated. It is important to note that the MERS-CoV strain (Qatar15/2015) used herein is from human origin and, unlike some dromedary isolated African strains, it does not display any deletions in the above-mentioned non-structural proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Therefore, alpacas are able to overcome IFN inhibitory mechanisms in a relative short time with the induction of antiviral or IFN positive regulatory ISGs. Nonetheless, the prominent manifestation of MERS in humans occurs in lungs with a massive inflammation provoked by infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. To the contrary, and although AP6 experienced discrete nasal discharges and displayed large numbers of infected nasal epithelial cells, alpacas only exhibited transient mild and focal infiltration of lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils in response to MERS-CoV. Such infiltrations were mainly observed on 2 dpi and gradually resolved afterwards. These findings suggested a rapid fine tuning of specific mechanisms to control inflammation mediated essentially by the mucosal barrier, leading to an efficient innate immune response. Indeed, type III IFNs are known to induce milder inflammatory responses than IFNβ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>] and IL10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Furthermore, recent studies in mice indicate intricate mechanisms between IFNλ and IL10 via dendritic cells (DC) conditioning protective mucosal immunity against influenza virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. In this view, it is noteworthy to mention that plasmacytoid DC are seemingly the only cell-type that produce <italic>in vitro</italic> type I and III IFNs after MERS-CoV infection in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. By contrast, <italic>in vivo</italic>, pDCs which predominantly localize in the submucosa are not the main IFN producers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Due to the lack of specific cell markers for DC in alpacas, detection of these cells in tissues and their contribution to innate immunity could not be performed. Nonetheless, a strong positive correlation between IFNλ1,3 and IL10 mRNA levels was observed in the nasal epithelium of alpacas and this could reflect a physiological cross-regulation between these structurally related cytokines upon MERS-CoV infection. By contrast, the weak correlation between IFNβ and IL10 mRNA induction suggests that only type III IFNs are directly or indirectly mediating anti-inflammatory action. Furthermore, IL10 was significantly up regulated, although at moderate levels, in the nasal submucosa underlying heavily infected epithelial cells. Moreover, IRF5 known to be a pro-inflammatory transcription factor and a key element in the M1 polarization of macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>] was only slightly induced in the nasal mucosa and submucosa on 2 and 3 dpi. However, no IRF5 mRNA increased in the lung despite infiltration of mainly macrophages and lymphocytes as early as 1 dpi. Accordingly, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL10 and TNFα were induced in the lung in the absence of type I IFNs, as found for MERS-CoV infected human monocyte-derived macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. With the observation that other pro-inflammatory cytokines are either weakly or not induced, it is suspected that inflammatory M1 macrophages are not abundant in the lung of infected alpacas. Also, IL15, an activator and attractor of NK cells and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>], was only induced in lung as soon as 1 dpi, suggesting a role for clearance of the virus by these cells. Strikingly, NLRP3 mRNA was more abundant in the lung (with the exception of AP6 in trachea), maybe due to the presence of infiltrating macrophages where NLRP3 is mostly produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. However, CASP1 and PYCARD, the two other components of inflammasome, were not induced. This scenario, combined with a discrete upregulation of IL1β and IL6 in some animals, will not probably result in a cytokine storm in the lung. Accordingly, in other respiratory tissues, the major proinflammatory cytokines were occasionally mildly induced, suggesting also a functional but attenuated NF-κB signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Moreover, during infection, genes involved in the regulation of the NF-κB cascade (AZI2, TBK1 and NFKBIA) and NFKB1were transcriptionally unaltered in all the respiratory tract of alpacas preventing acute inflammation in response to MERS-CoV.</p><p id="P24">In a mice model of MERS-CoV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], IFNs production and MERS-CoV replication peaked simultaneously in lungs at 2 dpi resulting in a sublethal infection. While early induction or treatment with IFNβ were crucial for virus clearance and induction of protective immunity, late administration of IFNs led in lungs to enhanced infiltrations of monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, expression of proinflammatory cytokines and increased mortality. Also, indirect proof was given that IFNs synthesis was under sensing of TLR7 but not MAVS in airway epithelial cells. However, this study did not report the effect of MERS-CoV infection in the URT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Benefits of early type I IFN treatment were also shown for non-human primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>] but IFN therapy on humans has failed so far certainly because it was applied essentially on critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. Thus, some differences are noticed between a MERS-CoV sublethal infection in mice and that occurring in a natural host. Here, we highlighted the essential role of the nasal mucosa as a main producer of IFNs upon MERS-CoV infection driving in combination with IL10 a mild inflammatory response along the respiratory tract. The observation in alpacas of a dimmed NLRP3 inflammasome is consistent with that found in bat primary immune cells infected in vitro with MERS-CoV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], suggesting a primary role in the control of inflammation in reservoir/intermediary hosts despite high viral loads. Further, this study provides mechanistic insights on how innate immunity overcomes a MERS-CoV infection. A proposed model of cytokine and signaling pathways interactions resuming innate immune responses upon MERS-CoV infection in the respiratory tract of alpacas is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8</xref>. Inherent to any study performed with large outbred animals under BSL3 containment, the present study suffers some limitations. First, the number of animals used was kept to minimal to avoid prolonged exposure of personnel during sampling and necropsies hindering some statistical significances with variations between animals. Second, the LCM and microfluidic PCR allowed determination of gene expression at the tissue but not the single cell level. This combined with the lack of antibodies defining cell types in alpaca and working in IHC impeded further characterization of DCs and leukocytes in tissues.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="P25">All animal experiments were approved by the Ethical and Animal Welfare Committee of IRTA (CEEA-IRTA) and by the Ethical Commission of Animal Experimentation of the Autonomous Government of Catalonia (file Nº FUE-2018-00884575 – Project Nº10370).

In camelids, the main MERS-CoV reservoir host, viral infection leads to subclinical disease. Our study describes transcriptional regulations of innate immunological pathways underlying asymptomatic clinical manifestations of alpacas in response to MERS-CoV. Concomitant to the peak of infection, these animals elicited a strong transient interferon response and induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 in the nasal mucosa. This was associated to a dimmed regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induction of interferon stimulated genes along the whole respiratory mucosa, leading to the rapid clearance of the virus. Thus, innate immune responses occurring in the nasal mucosa appear to be the key in controlling MERS-CoV disease by avoiding a cytokine storm. Understanding on how asymptomatic host reservoirs counteract MERS-CoV infection will aid in the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Viral loads in nasal swabs and respiratory tissues of MERS-CoV-infected alpacas.</title><p>(A) Viral RNA (left) and infectious MERS-CoV (right) loads from nasal swab samples collected at the day of euthanasia.

Upregulation of IL10 combined with the action of type III IFNs will result in a dimmed synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines under NF-κB control. Induced chemokines lead to focal, mild infiltration of leukocytes. The paracrine effect of IFNs is evidenced in the nasal submucosa where ISGs are upregulated without endogenous induction of IFNs. IL10 and type III IFNs will act on the NF-κB pathway preventing production of IL8 and IL1β mRNAs depriving the NLRP3 inflammasome of its substrate. Slight increased levels of IRF5 mRNAs will indicate the presence of few M1 macrophages in the submucosa. Blue, red and white arrows indicate upregulation, downregulation and unaltered gene transcription respectively. (B) Concomitant to decreased viral loads, transcription of ISGs is lowered in trachea and lungs where IFNs are not induced. Infiltration of mainly mononuclear leukocytes occurs in the lungs as a result of chemokine synthesis in the absence of IRF5 induction but upregulation of IL15. Thus, reduced number of M1 macrophages and activation of NK cells will contribute to a controlled inflammation and clearance of the virus.
