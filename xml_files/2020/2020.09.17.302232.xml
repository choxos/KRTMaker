<abstract>
<p id="P1">Single-cell transcriptomic studies that require intracellular protein staining, rare cell sorting, or inactivation of infectious pathogens are severely limited because current high-throughput RNA sequencing methods are incompatible with paraformaldehyde treatment, a common tissue and cell fixation and preservation technique. Here we present FD-seq, a high-throughput method for droplet-based RNA sequencing of paraformaldehyde-fixed, stained and sorted single-cells. We show that FD-seq preserves the mRNA integrity and relative abundances during fixation and subsequent cell retrieval. Furthermore, FD-seq detects a higher number of genes and transcripts than methanol fixation. We applied FD-seq to investigate two important questions in Virology. First, by analyzing a rare population of cells supporting lytic reactivation of the human tumor virus KSHV, we identified <italic>TMEM119</italic> as a host factor that mediates viral reactivation. Second, we found that upon infection with the betacoronavirus OC43, which causes the common cold and is a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, pro-inflammatory pathways are primarily upregulated in lowly-infected cells that are exposed to the virus but fail to express high levels of viral genes. FD-seq thus enables integrating phenotypic with transcriptomic information in rare cell populations, and preserving and inactivating pathogenic samples that cannot be handled under regular biosafety measures.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has found important biological applications, from discovery of new cell types<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup> to mapping the transcriptional landscape of human embryonic stem cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. Droplet-based scRNA-seq technologies, such as Drop-seq<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup> and 10X Chromium<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>, are particularly powerful due to their high throughput: thousands of single cells can be analyzed in a single experiment. However, even with these high-throughput techniques, analyzing rare cell populations remains a challenging task, often requiring protein-based enrichment for the cell population of interest before scRNA-seq<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">Many cell types require intracellular protein staining to be enriched. For example, Foxp3 is an intracellular marker of regulatory T cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>, and Oct4 and Nanog are intracellular reprogramming markers of induced pluripotent stem cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. Intracellular protein staining requires cell fixation, which is most commonly achieved with paraformaldehyde (PFA) or methanol fixation. Drop-seq and 10X Chromium have been shown to be compatible with methanol-fixed cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>, but not with PFA fixation. In many applications, PFA fixation is preferred over methanol fixation due to its better signal-to-noise ratio for intracellular staining<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>, and the improved preservation of fluorescent protein activity. scRNA-seq of PFA-fixed cells has only been achieved with a low throughput plate-based method<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>, severely limiting the applicability of this method to a wide range of problems that search for rare phenotypes in broad cellular populations. A high-throughput scRNA-seq method of PFA-fixed cells would enable the application of single cell analysis for many problems in signaling, immunity, development, stem cells, and infectious diseases.</p>
<p id="P4">Here we describe FD-seq (Fixed Droplet RNA sequencing), a droplet-based high-throughput RNA sequencing of PFA-fixed, stained and sorted single cells. We show that FD-seq preserves the RNA integrity and relative transcripts abundances compared to standard Drop-seq for live cells. We also show that FD-seq is superior to the methanol fixation protocol, yielding a higher number of detected genes and transcripts.</p>
<p id="P5">As a proof-of-concept, we applied FD-seq to study two important problems in Virology. First, we studied the low-level reactivation of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) in tumor cells. KSHV, also known as human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8), is a human gammaherpesvirus that causes a number of malignancies such as Kaposi’s sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman’s disease<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. There is a considerable interest in unraveling the molecular details of the host factors that modulate KSHV latency and reactivation, because both latency and low-level reactivation are known to contribute to viral tumorigenesis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>, and therapeutic induction of reactivation could sensitize latently-infected cells to currently available anti-herpesvirus drugs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. Detailed analysis of KSHV reactivation, however, is currently limited by this restricted reactivation: only a small proportion of latently-infected cells typically undergoes reactivation, even when treated with known chemical inducing agents such as sodium butyrate (NaBut) and tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. We hypothesized that the differences in the abundance of specific host factors between individual cells contribute to the propensity of latently KSHV-infected cells to enter lytic reactivation. Using FD-seq, we present the first singlecell transcriptomic analysis of human primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells undergoing reactivation. We found that in reactivated cells, the expression levels of viral genes were extremely heterogeneous, with some cells expressing moderate levels of viral transcripts (below 50% of all detected transcripts) and other cells up to 95%. Additionally, we identified four host genes, <italic>CDH1, CORO1C, ISCU</italic> and <italic>TMEM119,</italic> whose expression levels strongly correlated with the extent of viral reactivation. Through overexpression and silencing studies, we show that <italic>TMEM119,</italic> a gene with unknown functions, plays an important direct role in promoting KSHV reactivation.</p>
<p id="P6">Second, the ability to fixate infected cells or patient-derived materials greatly facilitates the study of virus infected cells outside high-containment BSL-3 facilities that are often not readily available. To demonstrate a potential application of FD-seq in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we applied it to study the infection of OC43, a human betacoronavirus and a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, at the single-cell level. OC43 is a human pathogen that causes the common cold, and we have successfully used to it discover drugs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication <italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup> Using FD-seq, we show that instead of the infected cells, bystander cells that express a low level of viral genes are the actual drivers of pro-inflammatory gene expression during coronavirus infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P7">Thus, FD-seq is a valuable tool for studying rare cell populations, and provides flexibility in choosing the cell fixation or pathogen inactivation method for researchers.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Development of FD-seq for sequencing of PFA fixed single cells</title>
<p id="P8">In the standard Drop-seq protocol, single cells are partitioned with uniquely barcoded ceramic beads inside nanoliter droplets in oil, using a microfluidic device<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. The cells are individually lysed inside the droplets, and their mRNAs are captured by the oligonucleotides on the beads. Next, the droplets are broken to recover the beads, and the beads are extensively washed to remove uncaptured mRNAs. After pooling the beads, the captured mRNAs undergo reverse transcription, exonuclease I digestion of free oligonucleotides on the beads, and whole transcriptome amplification. Finally, the barcoded and amplified cDNAs are tagmented and sequenced.</p>
<p id="P9">PFA fixation of cells induces crosslinking between nucleic acids and proteins. To extract RNA from PFA-fixed cells, a cross-link reversal step is therefore required. First, we tested different heating conditions for the cross-link reversal step at bulk level, followed by lysing the uncross-linked cells with Drop-seq lysis buffer, and total RNA extraction using a commercial kit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). We found that a 1-hour incubation at 56°C in the standard Drop-seq lysis buffer efficiently reversed PFA cross-linking, in agreement with previous literature<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. The RNA yield was further improved by the addition of proteinase K to the lysis buffer at an optimal concentration of 40 units/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a</xref>). Whereas proteinase K treatment did not significantly affect the RNA quality at any of the tested concentrations, consistently resulting in high quality total RNA demonstrated by high (above 8.0) RNA integrity numbers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1b,c</xref>), we observed that increasing the proteinase K concentration above 40 units/mL resulted in a reduction in the overall RNA yield (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">Next, we compared the extent of inter-droplet RNA contamination between the standard Drop-seq protocol on live cells and the FD-seq method on PFA-fixed cells by performing ‘species-mixing’ experiments. We either used the standard Drop-seq protocol to analyze a 1-to-1 mixture of live BC3 cells, a human PEL cell line, and mouse 3T3 cells, or used FD-seq to analyze BC3 and 3T3 cells that were fixed with 4% PFA and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X separately before combining them at a 1-to-1 ratio. The RNA-seq results were aligned to a combined human-mouse reference genome, and the number of human and mouse transcripts per single cell barcode was then calculated. The rate of cell barcodes having both mouse and human transcripts, which indicates cross-droplet contamination and/or multiple cells captured in the same droplet, were very similar and only minimally observed in both live and fixed cell experiments (~0.5% and ~1% for live and fixed cells, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). This indicates that the modifications of FD-seq did not affect the single-cell capture efficiency of Drop-seq.</p>
<p id="P11">These experiments also showed that the number of genes detected in fixed cells using was comparable to that of live cells across species (median of 640 genes in fixed cells compared to 675 genes in live cells for human cells, and median of 734 genes compared to 724 genes for mouse cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The relative expression levels of the detected genes were well correlated between live and fixed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), even though fewer transcripts were detected in fixed cells than in live cells on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2a</xref>). Finally, live and fixed cells showed a similar percentage of reads mapped to introns and exons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">Taken together, these results demonstrate that FD-seq is a reliable method for whole transcriptome analysis of PFA-fixed single cells. The performance of single-cell sequencing is maintained with fixed cells when FD-Seq is utilized, and FD-seq shows comparable performance to the standard Drop-seq protocol used for live (unfixed) cells. Reliable sequencing of PFA fixed cells with high transcript recovery can be very useful for single cell studies.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>PFA fixation detects a higher number of genes and transcripts compared to methanol fixation in single cells</title>
<p id="P13">We next investigated how the effects of PFA fixation in FD-seq compare to methanol (MeOH) fixation. Methanol fixation has recently been shown to be compatible with Drop-seq<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup> by introducing a suitable rehydration step before droplet generation. Here we fixed A549 cells, a human lung epithelial cell line, with either PFA or methanol, and then analyzed the single-cell transcriptomes by RNA-seq using the FD-seq or Drop-seq protocol, respectively (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">We found that PFA fixation resulted in a higher number of detected transcripts, or UMIs, (median 8,083 compared to 6,194 transcripts) and genes (median 3,049 compared to 2,856 genes), and a lower percentage of mitochondrial genes (median 6.2% compared to 11.9%) than methanol fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). To determine the effect of sequencing depth on the number of UMIs and genes, we randomly sub-sampled the sequencing reads and found that PFA fixation still returned a higher number of UMIs and genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The effect of sequencing depth on the number of transcripts is much more pronounced: the difference between the two fixation techniques could reach almost 2,000 UMIs. This could be because a higher proportion of reads in methanol-fixed cells mapped to the intronic and intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Despite this, the average gene expression levels were well correlated between the two fixation methods (Pearson’s correlation coefficient was approximately 0.90, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Lastly, we estimated the technical variance of each method by calculating the gene-level coefficient of variation (CV)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. As expected, for both fixation methods, low- and high-abundance genes had higher and lower variance, respectively. In addition, both methods exhibited very similar technical variance. In summary, FD-seq was able to recover more genes and transcripts than methanol fixation, and both PFA- and methanol-fixed cells showed similar average gene expression levels and technical variance.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>FD-seq reveals heterogeneity in KSHV reactivated single tumor cells</title>
<p id="P15">Having established the validity of FD-seq for the single-cell transcriptome analysis of PFA-fixed cells, we applied FD-seq to test the hypothesis that the heterogeneity in specific host genes contributed to the restricted KSHV reactivation, and to identify those genes.</p>
<p id="P16">To identify lytically reactivated cells, we measured expression of the intracellular viral glycoprotein K8.1 that is expressed during lytic reactivation by flow cytometry. As expected, we did not observe any appreciable K8.1 expression in untreated BC3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3a</xref>). However, treatment with NaBut or TPA to induce KSHV reactivation resulted in a small fraction of cells expressing K8.1 (~8% vs ~2.1%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3b</xref>). To enrich for reactivated cells, TPA-treated BC3 cells were fixed and sorted by FACS based on the expression level of the K8.1 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>), followed by single-cell transcriptome analysis with FD-seq. We obtained high-quality transcriptome information for 1,035 K8.1+ (reactivated) single cells and 286 K8.1- (latent, nonreactivated) cells. High dimensional clustering and visualization showed clear separation between reactivated and non-reactivated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), and analysis of the <italic>K8.1</italic> mRNA level confirmed the enrichment of the K8.1+ cell population of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Moreover, the high proportion of viral transcripts in the K8.1+ population, 69% on average, compared to only 4% viral transcript in the K8.1-population confirmed that the sorted population was indeed composed of reactivated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">Herpesvirus reactivation involves the highly regulated, sequential expression of immediate-early, early, and late viral genes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup> that was recapitulated in our FD-seq results. By ordering the cells by the percentage of viral genes relative to the total transcript content, we found that the relative abundance of immediate-early viral genes increased with total viral gene content, then plateaued after the total viral transcript abundance reached 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e-g</xref>). Early viral transcripts also increased early and monotonically with the abundance of total viral transcripts, without plateauing like the immediate-early genes. On the other hand, late viral transcripts were only detected in cells with more than 25% total viral transcripts, and increased strongly with higher total viral transcript abundance. Thus, FD-seq’s results are in agreement with the expected kinetics of viral gene expression obtained from population-averaged measurements, and suggest that the percentage of viral transcript content is a good indicator of the stage of KSHV reactivation.</p>
<p id="P18">Interestingly, we found that the K8.1+ population was highly heterogeneous in viral transcript expression: the relative abundance of viral transcripts varied from below 50% to over 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), and the correlation between the expression levels of viral genes was very low, even between viral genes that have the same kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5a</xref>). This agrees with two recent studies that showed heterogeneity in host cell factor abundance at the single-cell level in herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>, and low correlation in expression of viral genes in a murine gammaherpesvirus infection model<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. This may partially be caused by the fact that the K8.1+ cells were at different stages of reactivation. Indeed, flow cytometry analysis showed that K8.1 protein abundance within the positive population varied over one order of magnitude (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). However, this alone could not sufficiently explain the poor correlation between viral genes, because we also observed low correlation coefficients among cells with similar viral transcript abundance that are thought to be in the same stages of reactivation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">In short, we used FD-seq to successfully characterize KSHV-infected cells undergoing reactivation from latency, revealing the highly heterogeneous nature of this process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>
<italic>TMEM119</italic> facilitates KSHV reactivation</title>
<p id="P20">Next, we sought to identify host genes that facilitate KSHV reactivation by looking for differentially expressed host genes that are positively correlated with viral transcript abundance. We only looked for passively correlated host genes in our analysis because the majority of differentially expressed genes were negatively correlated with the relative abundance of viral transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6a</xref>). While this could suggest that their expression inhibits KSHV reactivation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup> (and therefore cells with lower expression are more prone to reactivate), this type of analysis may be confounded by the high proportion of viral transcripts in the K8.1+ population (up to 96%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>) that prevents reliable determination of host transcript levels in these cells.</p>
<p id="P21">We found four host genes whose expression positively correlated with the abundance of KSHV transcripts: <italic>ISCU, CDH1, CORO1C</italic> and <italic>TMEM119</italic> (q-value &lt; 10<sup>-100</sup> for all four genes). We observed that the expression of <italic>ISCU</italic> was relatively low in non-reactivated cells, and increased significantly with the abundance of viral transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>CDH1, CORO1C</italic> and <italic>TMEM119</italic> were mostly undetectable in non-reactivated cells, and increased by 1-2 orders of magnitude in cells expressing high levels of KSHV. We also confirmed the upregulation of <italic>ISCU, CORO1C</italic> and <italic>TMEM119</italic> following KSHV reactivation in bulk cell samples by qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6b,c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P22">To determine whether the strong correlation between these host transcripts and KSHV gene expression means that these genes modulate KSHV reactivation induction and/or efficiency, we next tested the effect of their overexpression on KSHV reactivation. To this end, we used live-cell imaging to monitor KSHV reactivation in HEK293T.rKSHV219 cells (which are HEK293T cells latently infected with the recombinant KSHV.219 virus strain that constitutively expresses GFP and further encodes RFP under control of the viral lytic PAN promoter<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>) following exogenous expression of <italic>CDH1, CORO1C, ISCU,</italic> or <italic>TMEM119.</italic> Whereas overexpression of <italic>CDH1, CORO1C,</italic> or <italic>ISCU</italic> had no significant effect on KSHV reactivation efficiency, we observed a clear increase in RFP expression, which is indicative of viral reactivation, upon ectopic expression of <italic>TMEM119</italic> relative to a GFP-encoding control vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7a-c</xref>). Conversely, silencing of endogenous <italic>TMEM119</italic> significantly reduced the level of TPA-induced KSHV reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S7b, c</xref>). These results were corroborated by qRT-qPCR analysis of KSHV lytic gene expression, which showed that <italic>TMEM119</italic> overexpression enhanced KSHV <italic>Orf74</italic> expression compared to the <italic>GFP</italic> control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>), while <italic>TMEM119</italic> silencing led to a reduction in KSHV <italic>0rf50, Orf57, and Orf74</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Together, these results show that <italic>TMEM119</italic> positively modulates KSHV reactivation efficiency.</p>
<p id="P23">Not much is known about the function of <italic>TMEM119,</italic> which has been previously characterized as a marker for microglia in the human brain<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. To determine the potential mechanism by which <italic>TMEM119</italic> enhances KSHV reactivation, we performed bulk transcriptome analysis of HEK293T cells with and without ectopic expression of <italic>TMEM119.</italic> We found that in HEK293T cells, 202 genes were significantly upregulated upon <italic>TMEM119</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary File 1</xref>). KEGG pathway analysis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup> showed that these genes were highly enriched for the MAPK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8b</xref>). This finding is interesting, as previous works have implicated the MAPK pathway in KSHV reactivation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. Together with this, our data suggests that <italic>TMEM119</italic> promotes viral reactivation via activation of the MAPK signaling pathway.</p>

OC43 is a human pathogen that causes the common cold, and is a close relative of SARS-CoV-2. We have recently shown that many drugs that inhibit the replication of OC43 also inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication <italic>in vitro<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>
</italic>, suggesting that OC43 is a good model system for SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P25">First, we infected A549 cells with OC43 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, fixed the cells with PFA, and performed FD-seq on mock- and OC43-infected cells. We obtained 1,167 and 1,924 high-quality single cells from mock-infected and OC43-infected cells, respectively. After regressing out the effects of cell cycle variations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9a, b</xref>), high dimensional clustering yielded three main clusters of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Cluster 0 mainly contained the mock-infected cell, while clusters 1 and 2 mainly contained OC43-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). At an MOI of 1, more than 70% of the cells showed some level of viral gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Interestingly, this infected population consisted of two subpopulations based, clearly separated by the number of viral transcripts detected: a larger subpopulation containing a low number of viral transcripts (below 100 UMIs, median 2 UMIs) and a smaller subpopulation containing a much higher number of viral transcripts (above 100 UMIs, median 428 UMIs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). This small subpopulation of highly infected cells corresponded to cluster 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9c, d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P26">Next, we sought to investigate the expression profile of OC43 viral genes as a function of total viral gene level within cluster 2’s cells. Gene <italic>N</italic> (which encodes the viral nucleocapsid protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>) was uniformly highly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). The expression of the remaining viral genes was more heterogeneous, with <italic>ORF1ab, M</italic> (membrane gene) and <italic>S</italic> (spike gene) being more highly expressed overall. These patterns of viral gene expression level were also true when looking at all infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>).</p>
<p id="P27">Cluster 1 consisted of cells that were exposed to the virus but failed to express high levels of viral genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8c, d</xref>), and were thus either abortively-infected or uninfected bystander cells. We found that these bystander cells were enriched in pro-inflammatory genes, such as <italic>CXCL1, CXCL5, CCL2</italic> and <italic>NFKBIA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary File 2</xref>). <italic>CXCL1</italic> and <italic>CXCL5</italic> encode the protein ligands of the CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), and are crucial to neutrophil recruitment<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. <italic>CCL2</italic> encodes a different chemokine that is responsible for monocyte recruitment from the bone marrow<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>. <italic>NFKBIA</italic> encodes the inhibitor IĸBa to the transcription factor NF-ĸB, which is an important regulator of the immune response<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. KEGG pathway analysis showed that cluster 1 was enriched for three main pro-inflammatory pathways: TNF, IL-17 and NF-ĸB signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>). On the other hand, the ribosome biogenesis pathway is enriched in the upregulated genes of cluster 2, suggesting an increased need for protein biogenesis during OC43 replication.</p>
<p id="P28">In short, FD-seq revealed that the majority of cells did not express a high level of viral genes after exposure to OC43, and that these cells upregulated pro-inflammatory genes. These findings are in agreement with our previous characterization of HSV-1 infection at the single-cell level<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>, which showed that most HSV-1 infected cells did not express high levels of viral genes, and that these abortively-infected cells were the main producers of antiviral gene transcripts and the initiators of the type I interferon signaling.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P29">Here we present FD-seq, a novel method for high-throughput droplet-based RNA sequencing of PFA-fixed single cells. FD-seq is particularly useful for sequencing rare subpopulations of cells that require intracellular staining and FACS-enrichment, and for rendering infectious samples safe for handling. Drop-seq has only been shown to work with methanol fixation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>, and we demonstrated that FD-seq performed better than methanol fixation, with the former detecting more genes and transcripts. FD-seq will increase the flexibility for researchers in using high throughput scRNA-seq, because PFA fixation has also shown to provide a better signal-to-background ratio for certain intracellular staining targets<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>, and because PFA is a very commonly used alternative to methanol fixation.</p>
<p id="P30">We applied FD-seq to study the process of KSHV lytic reactivation at the single-cell level, and found that reactivation is very heterogeneous, and that the expression levels of viral genes correlated poorly with one another. We found four host factors, namely <italic>CDH1, CORO1C, ISCU</italic> and <italic>TMEM119,</italic> to be significantly positively correlated with viral reactivation. Using live-cell imaging and time-course study, we found <italic>TMEM119</italic> to have the most pronounced effect among the four genes in enhancing the degree of viral reactivation. Bulk RNA-seq suggested that this effect of <italic>TMEM119</italic> could be mediated through the MAPK signaling pathway, in agreement with previous studies <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. More studies are required to investigate in details the mechanisms by which <italic>TMEM119</italic> affects the MAPK signaling pathway and modulates the increase in KSHV reactivation.</p>
<p id="P31">Furthermore, we demonstrated a potential application of FD-seq in the COVID-19 pandemic, by using FD-seq to study the host response of human lung cells to OC43, a betacoronavirus, infection, and the subsequent expression of viral genes at the single-cell level. First, we infected the cells with the virus, then fixed with PFA, thereby inactivating the virus for safer sample handling, before analyzing the cells with FD-seq. We showed that most OC43-infected cells were unable to support high level of viral gene expression, and instead upregulated pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Therefore, these lowly-infected cells are the main producers of pro-inflammatory gene products, such as cytokines, during OC43 infection <italic>in vitro.</italic> It would be very interesting to examine whether a similar phenomenon is observed for SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in patient samples. FD-seq would allow researchers to inactivate this infectious virus with PFA so that they can safely study it in BSL-2 facilities.</p>
<p id="P32">Taken together, these biological application of FD-seq show that this method is a valuable tool for integrating protein activity with transcriptome information. Transcription factor expression levels and phosphorylation can be integrated with whole transcriptome analysis by combining intracellular protein staining with FD-seq. Furthermore, FD-seq is compatible with RNA velocity analysis, which relies on detection of unspliced mRNA molecules<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12</xref>). In future studies, FD-seq could serve as a basis for developing a method for sequencing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, due to the similarity between PFA fixation and FFPE. Such an achievement of which would enable high-throughput single-cell sequencing of readily available samples in tissue banks.</p>

In summary, there are only two significant differences: 40 units/ml proteinase K was added to the Drop-seq lysis, and a heating step was added between the droplet generation and droplet breakage steps. First, the barcoded beads were suspended at 120,000 beads/ml in a modified Drop-seq lysis buffer: 200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 6% Ficoll type 400, 0.2% Sarkosyl, 20 mM EDTA, 50 mM DTT and 40 units/ml proteinase K (NEB). Cells were suspended in PBS with 0.01% BSA at 100,000 cells/ml.</p>
<p id="P41">For droplet generation, the cells, beads and oil were injected at flow rates of 3, 3 and 12 ml/h, respectively, using syringe pumps.

<title>Benchmarking and validation of FD-seq.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Bar plots showing RNA yield from bulk live cells, and fixed cells that underwent cross-link heat reversal (1 h at 56°C) with or without 40 units/ml of proteinase K. Data is presented as mean ± s.e.m. (<bold>b</bold>) Species-mixing plot of Drop-seq and FD-seq. The multiplet rate for live cells and fixed cells were ~0.5% and ~1%, respectively. For Drop-seq experiment, live human BC3 cells were combined with live mouse 3T3 cells and processed with the standard Drop-seq protocol. For FD-seq experiment, the human and mouse cells were fixed separately, then pooled and processed with the modified FD-seq protocol. (<bold>c</bold>) Violin plots and box plots showing the number of detected genes in live and fixed cells for each species. For this analysis, only cells with at least 1,500 transcripts were considered, and 1,000 transcripts were randomly sampled from each single cell. The white dots inside the violin plots represent the median of the data, the black boxes represent the first and third quartiles, and the black lines represent the values 1.5× the interquartile range beyond the first and third quartiles. (<bold>d</bold>) Comparison of the normalized expression level of each gene between live and fixed cells for each species. Each dot represents a gene, and the red line indicate the line y = x. The plot also shows the Pearson’s correlation p of the log-normalized expression level between live and fixed cells.</p>

<title>Comparison between PFA and methanol fixation shows higher gene and transcript recovery with FD-seq.</title>
<p>(a) Violin and box plots of the number of UMIs, the number of genes and the percentage of mitochondrial genes detected in single A549 cells for each fixation method. The numbers by the violin plot indicate the median values. The middle line inside the box indicates the median, the upper and lower edges of the box indicate the first and third quartiles, and the whiskers extend to 1.5× the interquartile range beyond first and third quartiles. (b) The effects of sequencing depth on the number of detected UMIs and genes per cell. (c) The distribution of mapped reads to different genomic regions. (d) Correlation of the log-normalized average expression level of each gene between the two fixation methods. The plot also shows the Pearson’s correlation coefficient p. The red line indicates the y=x line. (e) Technical variance of each gene estimated by the gene’s mean and squared coefficient of variation (CV<sup>2</sup>).</p>
