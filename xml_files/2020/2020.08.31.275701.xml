<abstract>
<p id="P1">There is dire need for an effective and affordable vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 to tackle the ongoing pandemic. In this study, we describe a modular virus-like particle vaccine candidate displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) using SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology (RBD-SpyVLP). Low doses of RBD-SpyVLP in a prime-boost regimen induced a strong neutralising antibody response in mice and pigs that was superior to convalescent human sera. We evaluated antibody quality using ACE2 blocking and neutralisation of cell infection by pseudovirus or wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Using competition assays with a monoclonal antibody panel, we showed that RBD-SpyVLP induced a polyclonal antibody response that recognised all key epitopes on the RBD, reducing the likelihood of selecting neutralisation-escape mutants. The induction of potent and polyclonal antibody responses by RBD-SpyVLP provides strong potential to address clinical and logistic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, RBD-SpyVLP is highly resilient, thermostable and can be lyophilised without losing immunogenicity, to facilitate global distribution and reduce cold-chain dependence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Since then COVID-19 has spread across the world and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in March 2020. As of August 2020, there have been over 20 million confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide and around 800,000 deaths <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. There are no vaccines or effective treatments for COVID-19 to date; however, as of August 2020, there are 25 vaccine candidates in clinical evaluation and around 140 are in pre-clinical testing <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. Vaccine candidates in current clinical evaluation include inactivated, viral vector (replicating and non-replicating), protein subunit, nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines with the majority of them focusing on using the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) as an immunogen.</p>
<p id="P3">SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus carrying a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome (~30 kb), belonging to the genus <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> from the <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. The virus RNA encodes four structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, 16 non-structural proteins, and nine accessory proteins <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. The S glycoprotein consists of an ectodomain (that can be processed into S1 and S2 subunits), a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. Similar to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 binds the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the receptor-binding domain (RBD) within the S1 subunit to facilitate entry into host cells, followed by membrane fusion mediated by the S2 subunit <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p id="P4">Of the many vaccine platforms, protein subunit vaccines generally have good safety profiles and their production is rapid and easily scalable <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. Recombinant RBD proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been shown to be immunogenic and induce protective neutralising antibodies in animal models and are therefore considered promising vaccine candidates (reviewed <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>). RBD from SARS-CoV- has recently been confirmed to be inducing neutralising antibodies <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. Recently published studies, including one from our group, found that the majority of the potent neutralising antibodies isolated from SARS-CoV-2- infected patients bound to the RBD <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. We therefore chose to study the immunogenicity of RBD. To improve immunogenicity, we conjugated the RBD onto a virus-like particle (VLP). VLP display of protein antigen has been shown to further enhance immunogenicity by facilitating antigen drainage to lymph nodes, enhancing uptake by antigen-presenting cells and increasing B cell receptor crosslinking <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. Moreover, we recently showed that influenza antigens (haemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA)) displayed on the VLPs (same VLP used in this study) were highly immunogenic at a low dose (0.1 μg) in mice <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">In the present study, we used the SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology for assembly of SARS-CoV-2 RBD on the mi3 VLP, via the formation of an intermolecular isopeptide bond between the RBD and the VLP, as a potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). SpyTag-mediated VLP decoration has been successfully used for the display of diverse antigens from, e.g. <italic>Plasmodium spp</italic>., influenza A virus, HIV and cancer cells (PD-1L) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. The RBD-SpyVLP vaccine candidate is highly immunogenic in mice and pigs, inducing robust SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody responses. The results of our study demonstrate the potential of the RBD-SpyVLPs as an effective and affordable vaccine for COVID-19 with RBD-SpyVLP being resilient, retaining stability and immunogenicity post-lyophilisation, which will greatly facilitate distribution for vaccination by eliminating cold-chain dependence.</p>

<title>RBD can be efficiently displayed on the mi3 VLP via SpyTag/SpyCatcher</title>
<p id="P6">To create the RBD-SpyVLP vaccine candidate, the SpyTag (AHIVMVDAYKPTK) coding sequence was fused between the signal sequence from influenza H7 HA and the N-terminus of the RBD (amino acid 340-538, NITN...GPKK) (A/HongKong/125/2017) (SpyTag-RBD) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref> for the full sequence) and the glycoprotein was expressed in mammalian cells (Expi293) prior to purification using Spy&amp;Go affinity chromatography <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. The purified SpyTag-RBD was then conjugated to the SpyCatcher003-mi3 VLP <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup> to generate the SpyTag-RBD:SpyCatcher003-mi3 (RBD-SpyVLP) immunogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). SpyCatcher003 is a variant of SpyCatcher which was engineered for accelerated reaction with SpyTag <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. mi3 is a computationally engineered dodecahedron based on an aldolase from a thermophilic bacterium <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. The SpyTag-RBD can be efficiently conjugated to the SpyCatcher-mi3 VLP, with 93% display efficiency reached after 16 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). This corresponds to an average of 56 RBDs per VLP. We saw no sign of VLP aggregation following coupling and the RBD-SpyVLP is homogeneous, as shown by a uniform peak of the hydrodynamic radius (R<sub>H</sub>) at 20.7 ± 4.2 nm in dynamic light scattering (DLS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). For immunisation, we chose a conjugation ratio that leaves minimal free RBD (1:1 molar ratio), which corresponds to ~64% display efficiency or around 38 RBD per VLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>RBD-SpyVLP is reactive to monoclonal antibodies isolated from recovered patients and is resilient</title>
<p id="P7">To confirm the antigenicity of RBD-SpyVLP, we performed a series of binding assays. Binding to RBD-SpyVLP was tested using a panel of novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) some of which are strongly neutralising, from COVID-19-infected donors <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>, that bind to at least three independent epitopes on the RBD. We included the published conformation-specific mAb (CR3022) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>, a nanobody-Fc fusion VHH72-Fc <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>, and a dimeric human ACE2-Fc <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>, for which there are published structures. All tested mAbs and ACE2-Fc bound strongly to the RBD-SpyVLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), showing that a broad range of epitopes on the RBD-SpyVLP are exposed and correctly folded. An anti-influenza neuraminidase mAb (Flu mAb), used as a negative control, showed no binding to RBD-SpyVLP, confirming the specificity of the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

</sup>. For conjugated RBD-SpyVLP, we tested its solubility following storage for two weeks at -80, -20, 4 or 25 °C in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS). We then centrifuged out any aggregates and analysed soluble protein by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining. We found no significant change in the soluble fraction following storage at 4 °C (n=3, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s post-hoc test, p&gt;0.05), with only a 12% decrease after storage for two weeks at 25 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) and no degradation was observed at 25 °C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). We further analysed the integrity of the sample with ELISA against the conformation-dependent CR3022 mAb and observed no loss of antigenicity under these storage conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). We next assessed the resilience of RBD-SpyVLP to freezing, challenging RBD-SpyVLP with multiple rounds of freeze-thaw. Even after five rounds of freeze-thaw, there was no significant loss of soluble RBD-SpyVLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) or CR3022 recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) (n=3, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s post-hoc test, p&gt;0.05) and no degradation was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). After reconstitution following lyophilisation, we saw a minimal change in soluble protein for RBD-SpyVLP (91.5±3.8% of the initial value (mean±SD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>), which was not statistically significant (n=3, Mann-Whitney U test, p&gt;0.05). There was also no difference in terms of binding of RBD-SpyVLP to a panel of mAbs or ACE2-Fc recognising non-overlapping footprints on the RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>).

<title>RBD-SpyVLP induces a strong ACE2-blocking and neutralising antibody response in mouse models</title>
<p id="P9">We first evaluated the immunogenicity of RBD-SpyVLP in mouse models. C57BL/6 mice (n=6) were immunised intramuscularly (IM) with purified RBD alone (0.1 μg or 0.5 μg), RBD-SpyVLP (0.1 μg or 0.5 μg equivalents of the RBD component) or VLP alone, all adjuvanted with AddaVax. AddaVax is a squalene-based oil-in-water nano-emulsion adjuvant, a pre-clinical equivalent to the licensed MF59 adjuvant <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>. Mice were then boosted with the same dose of immunogen two weeks later and sera were collected at three weeks post-boost. Both the 0.1 μg and 0.5 μg RBD-only groups showed levels of antibody against RBD or spike glycoprotein only slightly above background, detected using ELISA (serum reciprocal endpoint titre (EPT): 1:94 and 1:68, respectively), and showed no difference compared to the VLP-only group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Mice immunised with 0.1 μg and 0.5 μg RBD-SpyVLP groups showed high levels of antibody to RBD (EPT: 0.1 μg: 1:16,117, p&lt;0.001 and 0.5 μg: 1:7,300, p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) and to spike (EPT: 0.1 μg: 1:1,647, p&lt;0.05 and 0.5 μg: 1:1,212) compared to the VLP group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">We then tested RBD-SpyVLP in a second mouse strain (BALB/c) with the same dosage regimen to confirm the immunogenicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). In BALB/c, the 0.1 μg and 0.5 μg RBD-SpyVLP groups showed higher levels of RBD-specific antibody (EPT: 0.1 μg: 1:8,406, p&lt;0.01 and 0.5 μg: 1:16,636, p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) and spike-glycoprotein specific antibody (EPT: 0.1 μg: 1:9,574, p&lt;0.001 and 0.5 μg: 1:18,556, p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) compared to the VLP group.</p>
<p id="P11">The ability of immunised mouse sera to block recombinant soluble ACE2 binding to immobilised RBD was then assessed. Sera from the 0.1 μg and 0.5 μg RBD-SpyVLP immunised C57BL/6 mice had significantly higher ACE2 blocking (IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.1 μg: 1:132, p&lt;0.05 and 0.5 μg: 1:253; p&lt;0.05) activity compared to the VLP-immunised mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). C57BL/6 mice immunised with RBD-only showed no detectable ACE2 blocking activity, consistent with the ELISA results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A &amp; B</xref>). Similarly, both 0.1 μg and 0.5 μg RBD-SpyVLP-immunised BALB/c mice had significantly higher ACE2 blocking (IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.1 μg:1:200, p&lt;0.001 and 0.5 μg: 1:560, respectively) compared to the VLP immunised group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In both mouse strains, 0.1 μg and 0.5 μg RBD-SpyVLP immunised groups had higher antibody titres against RBD (around 5-10-fold; C57BL/6, p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.0001; BALB/c, p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.0001) and ACE2 blocking (around 10-50-fold; C57BL/6, p&lt;0.0001 and p&lt;0.0001; BALB/c, p&lt;0.0001 and p&lt;0.0001) compared to plasma donated by patients convalescing from COVID-19 disease (n=28) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Sera from BALB/c mice immunised with 0.1 μg and 0.5 μg RBD-SpyVLP had comparable spike glycoprotein-specific antibody responses compared to convalescent humans whereas sera from C57BL/6 mice immunised with either dose had higher spike gluycoprotein-specific antibody responses compared to convalescent humans (around 2-fold, 0.1 μg, p&lt;0.05 and 0.5 μg, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">The antibody response in mice was assessed for neutralisation potency using a live SARS-CoV-2 virus (hCoV-19/England/02/2020, EPI_ISL407073) neutralisation assay (VNT) based on virus plaque reduction. Sera from C57BL/6 mice immunised with either dose of unconjugated RBD showed low level neutralising titres (ND<sub>50</sub> 1:59 and 1:32) compared to the RBD-SpyVLP group, again consistent with ELISA and ACE2 blocking activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Both 0.1 μg and 0.5 μg RBD-SpyVLP immunised groups exhibited neutralising titres in both C57BL/6 (ND<sub>50</sub>: 1:450 to 1: 2,095) and BALB/c mice (ND<sub>50</sub>: 1:230 to 1:1,405) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Consistent neutralising activity in sera from C57BL/6 mice was found using a VNT in an independent laboratory with the hCoV-19/VIC01/2020 isolate (GenBank MT007544) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">We tested the immunogenicity of RBD-SpyVLP post-lyophilisation and after five freeze-thaw cycles.

There was no difference between the immune responses in all three groups tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>) (Kruskal-Wallis, followed by Dunn’s post-hoc test, p&gt;0.05), showing that lyophilisation and freeze-thaw had not compromised the immunogenicity of the RBD-SpyVLP.</p>

<title>RBD-SpyVLP is highly immunogenic and induces strong neutralising antibody response in pigs</title>
<p id="P14">We tested RBD-SpyVLP for its immunogenicity in pigs as a large, genetically outbred animal model. Pigs have previously been reported to be a reliable model to study vaccines for use in humans because of their highly similar physiologies and immune systems <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>. The pig model has been used recently to test an adenovirus vector vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 (ChAdOx1 nCoV19) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. We immunised pigs (n=3) with a dose of RBD-SpyVLP that we intend to use in humans (5 μg) or with a 10-fold higher dose (50 μg) to study dose-response. A third group (n=3) receiving 100 μg of purified trimeric spike glycoprotein (spike) was included as a control. Pigs were immunised IM twice, 28-days apart, with 5 μg or 50 μg RBD-SpyVLP or spike, all adjuvanted with AddaVax.</p>
<p id="P15">As early as day 7, pigs immunised with 50 μg RBD-SpyVLP showed a detectable anti-RBD antibody response, whereas no antibody response was detected at day 7 for 5 μg RBD-SpyVLP or 100 μg spike groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) (p&lt;0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). The antibody response in all three groups increased gradually to day 14 when the response reached a plateau. The group receiving 50 μg RBD-SpyVLP group showed a trend of slightly higher antibody response than the other two groups until the day of boost (day 28) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The antibody response in all three groups increased by around 100-fold one week after boosting and remained high until at least day 56. There was no dose-response difference between the 5 μg and 50 μg RBD-SpyVLP groups (p&gt;0.5, Kruskal-Wallis test) for day 56 data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">ACE2 blocking activity in the pig serum was measured at day 21, day 35 and day 56. No ACE2 blocking was detected at day 21, prior to the booster dose. ACE2 blocking was detected post-boost at day 35 (IC<sub>50</sub> 1:10 to 1:50) and reduced at day 56 (IC<sub>50</sub> 1:5 to 1:25) in all three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). ACE2 blocking activities in all three groups were significantly higher than for sera from convalescent humans (5 μg RBD-SpyVLP, p&lt;0.01; 50 μg RBD-SpyVLP, p&lt;0.001; 100 μg, p&lt;0.05), by around ~3-6-fold (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.001, respectively, Kruskal-Wallis test on day 56 data).</p>
<p id="P17">Neutralising antibody responses in the pigs were assessed against both SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus and live SARS-CoV-2 virus. All three groups exhibited similar neutralisation titres against pseudovirus (ND<sub>50</sub>: ~1:500 to 1:4,000) after boost which remained until at least day 56, with no difference between the three groups (p&gt;0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test on day 56) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Similarly, no difference in neutralising activity was detected in all three groups against live virus at day 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Neutralisation was detected on both day 35 and 56 in all groups, with ND<sub>50</sub> levels between 1:6,000 to 1:11,000 on day 56 and no significant difference between the three groups (p&gt;0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test on day 56 data) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Nasal and oral secretions were also tested for the presence of neutralising antibodies: here RBD-specific IgG, but notably not IgA, was detected in all three groups with no significant difference between groups post-boost for both nasal and oral secretions (p&gt;0.05, Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn’s Post-hoc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E &amp; F</xref>).</p>
<p id="P18">We assessed the level of RBD-specific B cells in peripheral blood.

In each case, RBD-specific IgG B cells peaked in peripheral blood shortly after the boost (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). We also performed longitudinal analysis of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses following immunisation.

<title>RBD-SpyVLP induces polyclonal antibody responses against the RBD in mice and pigs</title>
<p id="P19">A concern regarding RBD-based vaccines is whether the immune response will be focussed to a single site on the antigen, because of the relatively small size of the RBD, potentially leading to a narrow response that would be sensitive to immune escape <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. A recent report showed that passive immunisation with a single mAb led to escape mutants of SARS-CoV-2, whereas a cocktail of two neutralising antibodies to independent epitopes prevented emergence of neutralisation-escape mutations, demonstrating the importance of a polyclonal antibody response <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>. We assessed sera from mice and pigs immunised with RBD-SpyVLP for antibody responses that target multiple RBD epitopes using a competition ELISA against four different mAbs: FI-3A, FD-11A, EY6A and S309, that target three non-overlapping epitopes on the RBD with FD-11A and S309 showing overlap as defined by competition ELISA (see diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>,. BALB/c mice immunised with RBD-SpyVLP showed competition against all four mAbs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). BALB/c mice immunised with VLP-only showed no competition (p&lt;0.05, Mann Whitney U-Test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). A similar pattern was observed in the C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). Comparison of preimmune and day 42 post- RBD-SpyVLP-immunisation sera from pigs showed a trend of partial competition against all four mAb, but this was not statistically significant because of inter-animal variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). When responses of individual pigs were compared to their pre-immune sera 2 out of 3 animals in each dosing group showed significant competition for the antibodies FI-3A and S309 that defined independent neutralising epitopes compared to their preimmune sera (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). These results show that RBD-SpyVLP does not have an immunodominant epitope and does not induce a highly focussed antibody response, making it a vaccine candidate that is likely to resist the generation of neutralisation-escape mutants.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P20">In the current study we investigated an RBD-based VLP vaccine candidate for COVID-19 based on SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology which was used to assemble RBDs into the mi3 VLP via the formation of an irreversible isopeptide bond <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. We showed RBD-SpyVLPs to be strongly immunogenic in mice and pigs, inducing high titre neutralising antibody responses against wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study confirms that the RBD is the key immunogenic domain for eliciting neutralising monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, in line with studies showing that highly neutralising antibodies isolated from convalescent patients bind to the RBD <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup>. We showed that RBD-SpyVLPs are recognised by a panel of mAbs isolated from convalescent patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup> binding to various epitopes on the RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This distributed reactivity shows that all of the epitopes that could potentially induce protective antibodies to RBD are present in RBD-SpyVLPs.</p>
<p id="P21">We detected negligible antibody responses in mice vaccinated with equivalent doses (0.1 μg or 0.5 μg) of purified RBD alone, but strong responses to the RBD when displayed on the VLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Previous studies showed that RBD from SARS-CoV and SARS-COV-2 can induce neutralising antibodies in animal models but typically after administration of much higher doses (e.g. ~50 to 100 μg) and with frequent dosing <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
</sup>. On the other hand, we showed that high titre neutralising antibody responses can be detected in two strains of mice immunised with relatively low doses of RBD-SpyVLP (to ND<sub>50</sub> ~500 to 2,000). These results confirm the enhanced immunogenicity of RBD when displayed on SpyVLPs. Sera from mice immunised with both 0.1 μg or 0.5 μg of RBD-SpyVLP exhibited high levels of antibody against SARS-CoV-2 RBD and full-length spike glycoprotein and ACE2 blocking activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B, C and D</xref>). All of these responses were higher than the levels found in plasma from convalescent humans. Together, these observations suggest that RBD-SpyVLP vaccination could potentially elicit protective antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in humans.</p>
<p id="P22">RBD-SpyVLP vaccination also induces high titre neutralising antibody responses in pigs (ND<sub>50</sub> ~1:11,000) with a dose that we aim to use for subsequent human trials (5 μg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). At a dose around 2-fold less (based on molar ratio), 5 μg of RBD-SpyVLP induced similar neutralisation titres compared to 100 μg of spike glycoprotein, showing the excellent immunogenicity of RBD-SpyVLP vaccination. Transudate RBD-specific IgG from serum can be detected in the oral and nasal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E &amp; F</xref>). Surprisingly, no increase in antibody titre was observed in pigs that received a higher dose of antigen (50 μg RBD-SpyVLP). There was a trend that the 50 μg RBD-SpyVLP group generated a more rapid and higher response post-prime but the antibody response between the 5 μg and 50 μg RBD-SpyVLP groups were identical post-boost. This suggests a threshold effect.</p>
<p id="P23">Since RBD-SpyVLPs induce antibody responses that target multiple epitopes on the RBD the chance of selecting neutralisation-escape mutants should be greatly reduced. Circulating SARS-CoV-2 stains are constantly mutating and the likelihood of persistence of the virus in the human population is high <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P24">We observed differences in the levels of ACE2 blocking in sera from immunised mice and pigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Sera taken from mice immunised with RBD-SpyVLP had at least one order of magnitude higher ACE2 blocking activity compared to serum from pigs, despite neutralisation titres being comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). This suggests that mice and pigs may produce distinct antibody responses against the vaccine candidate, although they were equally potent in neutralising live viruses. Surprisingly, ACE2 blocking in both mild and critical/severe convalescent humans who had natural infection were also low compared to the sera from immunised mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Nevertheless, the RBD-SpyVLP induces strong neutralising antibody responses in both mice and pigs. The potential for a vaccine based on the RBD is further emphasised by the sterile immunity induced in non-human primates (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) by two doses of 20 to 40 μg of unconjugated RBD in Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> adjuvant <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup> , and the successful induction of high titre neutralising antibody responses with an elegant self-assembling RBD-virus like nanoparticle <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P25">A recently published report on an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate showed that vaccinated non-human primates (NHP) with a serum neutralising titre (ND<sub>50</sub>) of &lt;1:100 were still protected against wild type SARS-CoV-2 challenge with no weight loss and no detectable lung pathology <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>
</sup>. In our study, RBD-SpyVLP-vaccinated mice and pigs had ND<sub>50</sub> at least an order of magnitude higher than 1:100, which would be expected to provide protection. Sera from pigs immunised with RBD-SpyVLP had similar, if not higher, neutralisation titres against wild type SARS-CoV-2 compared to pigs immunised by adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; both vaccines given as 2 doses in the same timeframe) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. A single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 has been shown to be protective against viral pneumonia and lung pathology following SARS-CoV-2 challenge (ND<sub>50</sub> ~1:20) in NHP but not virus shedding in the nasal cavity <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup>. The seemingly similar ND<sub>50</sub> of the RBD-SpyVLP compared to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in pigs suggests that the RBD-SpyVLP will be as protective as the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in NHP and most likely in humans if similar neutralisation titres are achieved. A prestabilised spike glycoprotein vaccine candidate, NXV-CoV2273 developed by Novavax, showed neutralising antibody responses in humans that were 4-fold higher than convalescent human sera, when given two doses of 5 μg with Matrix M1 adjuvant <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>. In light of the higher efficacy of RBD-SpyVLP compared to spike glycoprotein in pigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), we are hopeful that at least similar efficacy of RBD-SpyVLP could be achieved in humans.</p>
<p id="P26">Recently published studies reveal the relatively short-lived antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>
</sup>. Further work is required to define the significance of these results for the longevity of protective immunity. It is possible that re-infection with the virus would lead to a strong protective secondary antibody response from memory B cells. Here, we have shown that the antibody response in pigs immunised with RBD-SpyVLP persisted for at least 2 months and remained neutralising. Studies on the longevity of the immune responses are to be undertaken in the near future.</p>
<p id="P27">Apart from being highly immunogenic, SpyVLPs provide a versatile modular vaccine platform to facilitate conjugation with other antigens. Should a mutation in the RBD arise in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>, a matched RBD-SpyVLP could be manufactured rapidly. In addition, more than one RBD variant can be co-displayed on the VLP, to provide broader protection against various SARS-CoV-2 strains <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>
</sup>. The RBD-SpyVLP can also be co-displayed with antigens from other pathogens such as the HA and NA from influenza virus. We have recently shown HA and NA to be highly immunogenic in mice after formulation as a SpyVLP <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. This assembly could potentially provide protection against both SARS-Cov-2 and influenza viruses. Testing resilience of the vaccine candidate, we found that RBD-SpyVLP is stable at ambient temperature, resistant to freeze-thaw, and can be lyophilised and reconstituted with minimal loss in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-G</xref>) or immunogenicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). This resilience may not only simplify vaccine distribution worldwide, especially to countries where cold-chain resources are incomplete, but also reduce the overall vaccine cost by removing cold-chain dependence. We are currently investigating cheaper and more scalable alternatives to produce RBD-SpyVLP to cope with the global demand for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Collectively, our results show that the RBD-SpyVLP is a potent and adaptable vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2.</p>

Plates were washed with TBS (pH 7.4) with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 and blocked with 100 μL of PBS containing 3% skimmed milk for 1 h at RT. Pig sera samples were diluted in PBS with 1% (w/v) skimmed milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 in a 2-fold serial dilution starting at 1:10 dilution and 100 μL of the diluted sera was added to the coated plates for 1 h at RT. A conjugated secondary goat anti-pig IgG HRP (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 1:10,000 dilution in PBS with 1% (w/v) skimmed milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 was added for 1 h at RT. Plates were washed and 100 μL TMB (One Component Horse Radish Peroxidase Microwell Substrate, BioFX, Cambridge Bioscience) was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 7 min at RT. 100 μL BioFX 450nmStop Reagent (Cambridge Bioscience) was then added and absorbance was determined using a microplate reader. End-point antibody titres (mean of duplicates) were defined as following: the log<sub>10</sub> OD was plotted against the log<sub>10</sub> sample dilution and a regression analysis of the linear part of this curve allowed calculation of the endpoint titre with an absorbance of twice the mean absorbance of pre-immunised sera. RBD-specific antibody titres in oral and nasal swab fluids were determined by ELISA as detailed above except that the conjugated secondary antibody was replaced with either goat anti-porcine IgG HRP (Bio-Rad Antibodies) at 1:20,000 dilution in PBS with 1% (w/v) skimmed milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 or goat anti-porcine IgA HRP (Bio-Rad Antibodies) at 1:20,000 dilution in the same diluent.</p>

<title>RBD-SpyVLPs are reactive to SARS-CoV-2 binders and thermostable and resilient.</title>
<p>(A) Binding of RBD-SpyVLP to a panel of monoclonal antibodies isolated from COVID-19 recovered patients that target independent epitopes on the RBD determined using competitive ELISA (Huang et al., 2020). The boxed antibodies form groups that compete with each other and with antibodies or nanobodies with structurally defined footprints: CR3022 (PDB 6W41) (footprint 1), H11-D4-Fc (footprint 2) (PDB 6YZ5), S309 (footprint 3) (PDB 6WPT) and the ACE2 binding site (PDB 6M0J). Each point represents the mean of duplicate readings and error bars represent ± 1 SD. The diagram of the RBD, created in PyMOL, shows the ACE2 binding site and the three binding footprints highlighted. (B) Solubility and (C) immunoreactivity of RBD-SpyVLP after storage for two weeks at various temperatures, determined using SDS-PAGE and densitometry or ELISA (10 μg/mL CR3022 mAb). (D) Solubility and (E) immunoreactivity of RBD-VLP after freeze–thaw determined using SDS-PAGE and ELISA (10 μg/mL CR3022 mAb) after one to five cycles of freeze-thawing. (F) RBD-SpyVLP soluble fraction, before and after lyophilisation reconstituted in the same buffer volume and (G) immunoreactivity determined using ELISA with ACE2-Fc and mAbs that target non-overlapping epitopes on the RBD. Error bars in B, E &amp; F represent group mean (n=3). Error bars in C, E &amp; G represent mean ± 1 SD (n= 3). Statistical difference in B to E was determined using Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test. Statistical difference in F &amp; G was determined using Mann-Whitney U test. n.s. = not significant.</p>

<title>RBD-SpyVLPs induce strong antibody responses in mice that are comparable to the responses in recovered patients.</title>
<p>C57BL/6 (red) or BALB/c (blue) mice (n=6 in each group) were dosed twice IM, two weeks apart with 0.1 μg or 0.5 μg purified RBD, RBD-SpyVLP or VLP alone with AddaVax adjuvant added to all. Sera were harvested at two weeks after the first dose (open circles) and at three weeks after the second dose (closed circles). Sera were analysed in (A) ELISA against RBD (B) ELISA against full-length spike glycoprotein, (C) in an ACE2 competition assay, and (D) in virus neutralisation assays (VNT) against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus. (E) Antibody response analysed by RBD ELISA for mice dosed twice with 0.5 μg RBD-SpyVLP (pre-lyophilised, post-lyophilised or freeze-thawed 5 times (5x FT). Data are presented as the group geometric means ± 95% confidence intervals.
