<title>Summary</title>
<p id="P4">Flaviviruses pose a constant threat to human health. These RNA viruses are transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes and ticks and regularly cause outbreaks. To identify host factors required for flavivirus infection we performed full-genome loss of function CRISPR-Cas9 screens. Based on these results we focused our efforts on characterizing the roles that TMEM41B and VMP1 play in the virus replication cycle. Our mechanistic studies on TMEM41B revealed that all members of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family that we tested require TMEM41B. We tested 12 additional virus families and found that SARS-CoV-2 of the <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> also required TMEM41B for infection. Remarkably, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present at nearly twenty percent in East Asian populations reduce flavivirus infection. Based on our mechanistic studies we hypothesize that TMEM41B is recruited to flavivirus RNA replication complexes to facilitate membrane curvature, which creates a protected environment for viral genome replication.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P5">Virus outbreaks are a regular, yet unpredictable feature of an interconnected world. Viruses of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family are known to cause outbreaks worldwide and are transmitted primarily by the bite of infected mosquitoes and ticks.</p>
<p id="P6">Flaviviruses, members of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, are positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses that have caused several notable outbreaks in recent history. For example, West Nile virus (WNV) emerged in New York City in 1999, spread across the continent, and is now endemic in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kramer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Roehrig et al., 2002</xref>). Also noteworthy are the recurring yellow fever virus (YFV) outbreaks that occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South America despite the availability of a highly effective vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ahmed and Memish, 2017</xref>). Most recently, the 2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic swept through South and Central America wreaking havoc on a generation of unborn children by causing microcephaly <italic>in utero</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hills et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lee and Ng, 2018</xref>). In addition to these outbreaks, <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, the natural vector for ZIKV, dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), has been found consistently in recent years in Central Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Muller et al., 2020</xref>), and the prevalence of tick-borne diseases is at a record high. These alarming trends correlate with warming temperatures due to climate change, which expand the range of mosquitoes and ticks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brady and Hay, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brugueras et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dobler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">McPherson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Medlock et al., 2013</xref>). These recent flavivirus outbreaks underscore the devastating impacts viral outbreaks have on human health and the constant need for preparedness.</p>
<p id="P7">For many viruses with the potential to cause outbreaks there are no specific treatments. In instances where antiviral therapies do exist, they are often virus specific. One strategy to prepare for and respond to viral outbreaks is to develop drugs that target host factors viruses require to complete their replication cycles. CRISPR-Cas9 gene disruption has been used to identify host factors required for virus infection and nominate candidate drug targets. We, like others, set out to identify factors required for Zika virus as well as other flaviviruses. Here we present our screen results and detailed studies focused on two autophagy related genes, transmembrane protein 41B (<italic>TMEM41B</italic>) and vacuole membrane protein 1 (<italic>VMP1</italic>), that were enriched in our screens.</p>
<p id="P8">Autophagy, or “self-eating”, is a conserved multistep process in which cytoplasmic and intracellular components are engulfed in double membrane structures called autophagosomes. Following a series of maturation steps, autophagosomes ultimately fuse with lysosomes where their contents are degraded and recycled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dikic and Elazar, 2018</xref>). We found that the full autophagy pathway is not required for flavivirus infection; however, TMEM41B and VMP1 are essential. In comparison to VMP1, little is known about the cellular role of TMEM41B, and no data have been reported about the role of TMEM41B in flavivirus infection. Here we show that TMEM41B is a pan-flavivirus host factor that is required for all flaviviruses we tested which included both mosquito-borne and tick-borne flaviviruses. Beyond the classical flaviviruses, we also found that TMEM41B is required by additional members within the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> including hepatitis C virus (HCV) from the hepacivirus genus and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) from the pestivirus genus. We further tested a broad panel of viruses representing 12 virus families including negative- and positive-sense RNA viruses, retroviruses and DNA viruses, and found that of these, the only other virus that required TMEM41B was SARS-CoV-2 of the <italic>Coronaviridae.</italic> Indeed, we recently identified <italic>TMEM41B</italic> as a top scoring hit in multiple coronavirus genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss of function screens, including screens with SARS-CoV-2 (see accompanying manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Schneider et al., 2020</xref>)). It is possible that coronaviruses and flaviviruses require TMEM41B for a similar step in their replication cycles. The mechanistic studies we present here demonstrates that TMEM41B relocalizes upon flavivirus infection and associates with viral proteins, nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A) and NS4B, which are known to form membrane-bound viral RNA replication complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Neufeldt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Paul and Bartenschlager, 2015</xref>). These and other data we present suggest that TMEM41B is likely hijacked during the flavivirus replication cycle to facilitate the membrane remodeling necessary for replication of viral RNA.</p>

<title>Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens for Zika and yellow fever viruses identify TMEM41B and VMP1 as required host factors</title>
<p id="P9">To identify host factors required for ZIKV and YFV, we performed pooled genome-wide CRISPR knockout (KO) screens in B3GALT6-deficient human haploid (HAP1) cells. We used B3GALT6 KO cells to potentially decrease cellular heparan sulfate (HS) protein glycosylation which has been shown to nonspecifically facilitate virus binding and subsequent entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cagno et al., 2019</xref>). We hypothesized that this alteration in surface protein glycosylation would decrease the enrichment and overabundance of hits related to HS protein glycosylation and nonspecific virus binding. Nevertheless, consistent with a wide range of virus-selected genome-wide loss of function screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hoffmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Jae et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Realegeno et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Riblett et al., 2016</xref>), we identified host factors involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis.</p>
<p id="P10">Like other flavivirus host factor screens, we identified genes that are involved in oligosaccharide transfer, and genes involved in protein translocation and folding into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Marceau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Savidis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Outside of these categories, <italic>TMEM41B</italic> was among the top scoring genes. Little is known about the cellular function of TMEM41B; however, three independent genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss of function screens identified <italic>TMEM41B</italic> as a gene that plays an important role in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Moretti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Morita et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Shoemaker et al., 2019</xref>). These groups went on to show that TMEM41B is functionally similar to VMP1, which is known to have a role in lipid mobilization and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Morishita et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Ropolo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">There are numerous, sometimes conflicting reports, which indicate that autophagy-related genes can promote or restrict <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> infection. This literature has been recently reviewed by Po-Yuan Ke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Ke, 2018</xref>). Our identification of TMEM41B prompted us to interrogate our screen data further for genes involved in autophagy. Of a list of genes with an established role in autophagy, only <italic>TMEM41B</italic> and <italic>VMP1</italic>, which act at the early stage of autophagy, scored positively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). This list, however, is not comprehensive, and therefore we next compared our ZIKV screen results to those from a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen that was designed to identify novel genes required for autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Moretti et al., 2018</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, these two screens showed no overlap with the exception of two genes: <italic>TMEM41B</italic> and <italic>VMP1</italic>.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>The VTT domain proteins TMEM41B and VMP1 are required for flavivirus infection</title>
<p id="P12">TMEM41B and VMP1 are multipass transmembrane proteins that share a stretch of amino acids recently named the VTT domain based on homology among <underline>V</underline>MP1, <underline>T</underline>MEM41A/B, and <underline>T</underline>MEM64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Morita et al., 2019</xref>). Given this homology and the fact that both TMEM41B and VMP1 were top scoring hits in our flavivirus screens, we sought to test all four members of the VTT domain family for their requirement in flavivirus infection. Further, in addition to ZIKV and YFV (strain: Asibi) used in our screens, we expanded our collection of flaviviruses for these experiments to include three additional flaviviruses: the YFV 17D (vaccine strain), DENV-2, and WNV.</p>
<p id="P13">To test which of the four VTT domain-containing proteins are required for flavivirus infection, we used CRISPR-Cas9 gene disruption to generate clonal HAP1 cell lines individually lacking VMP1, TMEM41A, TMEM41B, and TMEM64 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). We then infected three to five independent knockout (KO) clones for each of these candidate host factors with each of the five flaviviruses listed above or with human parainfluenza virus 3 (hPIV-3) as a non-flavivirus control. Consistent with our screening results, we found that of these four VTT domain-containing proteins, only TMEM41B and VMP1 are required for flavivirus infection as cells deficient for these two proteins do not support virus replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B, D, F</xref>). While TMEM41B was not required for hPIV-3 infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1H</xref>), decreased growth of hPIV-3 was observed in the VMP1 KO clones. VMP1 KO clones appear less viable and grow slower compared to WT cells, which likely accounts for the slight decrease in replication seen for the control virus, hPIV-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1H</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">We next expressed each of the four VTT domain-containing proteins individually in TMEM41B KO and VMP1 KO cells to test their ability to restore virus infection. As expected, TMEM41B overexpression completely restored infection in TMEM41B KO cells. Interestingly, we found that VMP1 and TMEM41A overexpression could also partially compensate for the lack of TMEM41B during flavivirus infection; however TMEM41A was less efficient at restoring infection compared to VMP1. In contrast, only VMP1 was able to rescue infection in VMP1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E, F, I, J</xref>). Furthermore, VMP1 expression restored the aforementioned observed decrease in cell viability in VMP1 KO cells and also rescued hPIV-3 replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1J, K</xref>). The capacity of VMP1 to rescue a TMEM41B defect but not vice versa is consistent with what has been shown for TMEM41B and VMP1 in the context of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Morita et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Classical autophagy proteins BECN1, ATG5, and ATG7 are not required for flavivirus infection in HAP1 cells</title>
<p id="P15">Since both TMEM41B and VMP1 have been shown to be involved in autophagy, we hypothesized that other canonical autophagy related genes could be essential for flavivirus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Moretti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Morita et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Ropolo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Shoemaker et al., 2019</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we generated clones lacking BECN1, ATG5, and ATG7, which are known to play a critical role in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Mizushima et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Tanida et al., 1999</xref>). We confirmed KO in these clones by genome sequencing as well as by western blot (for ATG5 and ATG7) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1L</xref>). While ATG5 and ATG7 KO clones already lack lipidated LC3 II at baseline levels (indicative of defective autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Tanida et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Tanida and Waguri, 2010</xref>)), we sought to test ATG7 KO clones in addition for their ability to respond to classical autophagy stimuli (e.g., starvation and treatment with Torin 1 in the presence of chloroquine). As expected, ATG7-deficient cells are unable to mount an autophagy response. This is shown by western blot in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1M</xref>, where autophagy results in LC3 I lipidation and conversion to LC3 II in WT cells but not in ATG7 KO HAP1 clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Tanida et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Tanida and Waguri, 2010</xref>). We then tested these autophagy-deficient cells for their ability to support flavivirus infection and found that cells lacking BECN1, ATG5, or ATG7 retained their ability to support flavivirus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G, K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1C, E, G, I</xref>). These data suggest that autophagy alone is not necessarily required for flavivirus infection. This does not, however, rule out the possibility that noncanonical autophagy mechanisms are required for flavivirus infection nor does it suggest TMEM41B and VMP1 are the only autophagy factors required for flavivirus infection. In fact, two other non-classical autophagy genes were highly enriched in our YFV screen (TBC1D5 and TBC1D20) and in our ZIKV screen (TBC1D20) underscoring the complex interplay between flavivirus replication and the autophagy pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Popovic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Popovic and Dikic, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Sidjanin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Sklan et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>).</p>

<title>TMEM41B is a pan-flavivirus host factor</title>
<p id="P16">We have shown that mosquito-borne flaviviruses require TMEM41B for infection. To gain additional insight into the requirement of this host factor for viral infection, we extended our studies to include tick-borne flaviviruses, viruses from additional genera within the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, and a diverse panel of unrelated viruses.</p>
<p id="P17">The tick-borne flaviviruses we tested include Powassan virus (POWV), a BSL3 pathogen currently expanding in North America in <italic>Ixodes</italic> ticks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dennis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Ebel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Eisen et al., 2016</xref>), and five BSL4 pathogens: two strains of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) representing the European and Far Eastern clade, and three hemorrhagic fever viruses, Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV), Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV), and Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV). In addition, we generated TMEM41B KO clones in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Huh-7.5) and bovine MBDK cells to test additional members in the <italic>Flaviviridae:</italic> HCV in the hepacivirus genus and BVDV in pestivirus genus. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A–D</xref>, all of these viruses require TMEM41B for infection. This demonstrates that TMEM41B is a pan-flavivirus host factor.</p>
<p id="P18">Flaviviruses replicate in a variety of tissue types. Therefore, we generated TMEM41B KO and reconstituted cell clones in additional mammalian cell lines representing different tissue types including lung carcinoma (A549) and placenta carcinoma (JEG3) epithelial cells. In addition, we knocked out and reconstituted the mosquito TMEM41B homologue in C6/36 cells (<italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>) and Aag2 cells (<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>) to determine if TMEM41B was necessary for flavivirus infection in the mosquito vector. We found that TMEM41B was required in nearly all virus-cell combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">L</xref>). However, we observed several virus-cell combinations where TMEM41B appears to be less critical. For example, whereas TMEM41B is critical for YFV infection in HAP1, JEG3, and A549 cells, it is not required in Huh-7.5 cells. Notably we even observed differences in the requirement for TMEM41B among two strains of the same virus: the wildtype Asibi strain of YFV and the 17D vaccine strain that differ by only 31 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B and S2A, D, F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">dos Santos et al., 1995</xref>). Given that VMP1 can compensate for TMEM41B deficiency, we hypothesized that differences in TMEM41B and VMP1 expression among cell types could potentially explain this variability. We therefore performed western blots on HAP1, JEG3, A549, and Huh-7.5 cell lysates to compare VMP1 and TMEM41B abundance. We found that full-length TMEM41B is highly expressed in HAP1 and JEG3 cells, but present at much lower abundance in A549 and Huh-7.5 cells. Further, the TMEM41B antibody detects several abundant lower molecular weight bands in A549 cells that may or may not be TMEM41B isoforms. VMP1, in contrast, is expressed at much lower levels in HAP1 cells compared to JEG3, A549, and Huh-7.5 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2M</xref>). While speculative, we posit that the differential requirement for TMEM41B that we observe in some virus-cell combinations is due to differences in TMEM41B and VMP1 abundance among cell types and the extent to which VMP1 can compensate for TMEM41B deficiency.</p>
<p id="P19">Given that TMEM41B is broadly required among members of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, we posited that other more distantly related viruses or unrelated viruses may share a similar requirement for TMEM41B. Using the TMEM41B KO and reconstituted HAP1 cells, we queried the TMEM41B requirement for a diverse panel of viruses including negative- and positive-sense RNA viruses, retroviruses and DNA viruses. Interestingly, we found that Coxsackievirus 3B (CVB3) infection is <italic>enhanced</italic> in the absence of TMEM41B, whereas infection with SARS-CoV-2, a member of the <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, is impaired similar to the viruses in the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, suggesting that it also requires TMEM41B for infection. Aside from these two viruses, none of the other viruses tested were affected by the lack of TMEM41B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F–I</xref>). Our observation that SARS-CoV-2 requires TMEM41B for infection is supported by our recent coronavirus genome-wide CRISPR screening and validation results (see accompanying manuscript: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Schneider et al., 2020</xref>)).</p>

<title>Functional TMEM41B is conserved across mammalian and vector species</title>
<p id="P20">There are four reported TMEM41B isoforms in humans, however, only isoform 1 encodes a fully intact VTT domain. To determine if any of the other three isoforms can support flavivirus infection, we cloned and expressed each isoform in TMEM41B KO cells. Secondary structure predictions indicate that the first ~47 amino acids of TMEM41B are unstructured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we also generated a deletion mutant of isoform 1 lacking the first 47 amino acids. A diagram of these TMEM41B constructs is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>. We found that only the full length and N terminal truncated isoform 1 proteins were able to fully support YFV and ZIKV infection in TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells; however, isoform 4, which contains half of the VTT domain, partially supported YFV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). From this we conclude that the TMEM41B VTT domain is required to support flavivirus infection whereas the N terminus is dispensable.</p>
<p id="P21">It was previously reported that TMEM41B physically interacts with VMP1, raising the possibility that this interaction may be important for membrane remodeling in the early stages of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Morita et al., 2019</xref>). Based on this observation we hypothesized that evolutionarily divergent TMEM41B homologues may not support flavivirus infection in mammalian cells, given that there are extensive amino acid differences among the mosquito, tick, and human TMEM41B homologues that may prohibit their interaction with human VMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ishii and Akira, 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). To test if mosquito or tick TMEM41B homologues could support flavivirus infection, we expressed TMEM41B homologues from <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes, and <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> ticks in TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells and challenged them with YFV and ZIKV. To our surprise, we found that all three TMEM41B homologues supported virus infection in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). This suggests that despite amino acid differences, evolutionarily divergent TMEM41B homologues can either functionally interact with human VMP1, or that a direct protein-protein interaction between TMEM41B and VMP1 is not required to support flavivirus infection. As expected, neither TMEM41B KO nor expression of any of these TMEM41B constructs affected hPIV-3 infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A, B</xref>).</p>

<title>Naturally occurring TMEM41B SNPs negatively impact flavivirus infection</title>
<p id="P22">Viruses and other pathogens have shaped human genetics over millennia. In the face of strong evolutionary pressure, naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be enriched or purged from human populations. We investigated if any missense variants existed in human <italic>TMEM41B</italic> and found a SNP (rs78813996) at amino acid position 266 that results in an Ile266Val/Leu substitution with Val being the most prevalent variant. This SNP is nearly absent in European and African populations but is present at ~3.5% frequency in the Latin American population and at a striking ~20% frequency in the East and South East Asian population (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs78813996">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs78813996</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>
<p id="P23">We engineered these amino acid variants into a TMEM41B expression construct with a red fluorescent protein (tagRFP) fused to the N terminus. Western blot confirmed that both the tagRFP-TMEM41B wildtype and SNP I266L and I266V variants were expressed to similar levels in TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A, B</xref>). We then challenged these cells with YFV and found that at 48 h post infection, the percent infection in cells expressing the I266L and I266V variants was reduced by 50% and that these cells produced 10-fold less virus as compared to cells expressing wild type TMEM41B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Consistent with these results, we then tested ZIKV, DENV, and WNV and found similar results to that of YFV, whereas the hPIV-3 control was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). These results suggest that naturally occurring variants in <italic>TMEM41B</italic> reduce infection in cell culture and could potentially affect flavivirus pathogenesis in human populations.</p>

<title>TMEM41B SNP constructs are able to maintain normal lipid distribution in cells</title>
<p id="P24">While culturing TMEM41B KO Huh-7.5 cells, we observed a striking visual accumulation of lipids. To confirm these were indeed lipid droplets, we stained wildtype and six independent TMEM41B KO Huh-7.5 clones with Nile red and found that in all clones lipid droplets are considerably larger as compared to wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). We then quantified this observation by measuring the area of individual droplets from a single imaging plane in at least 23 cells per clone and found that the average size of individual lipid droplets was up to 10 times larger among TMEM41B KO clones relative to wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Moretti et al. reported a similar observation in TMEM41B KO H4 neuroglioma cells and it was later shown that these droplets contain neutral and sterol lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Moretti et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p id="P25">Having found that two naturally occurring TMEM41B variants, I266L and I266V, have a reduced capacity to support flavivirus infection, we next tested if these variants were able to rescue the enlarged lipid droplet phenotype. In addition to the two human variants, we also included the <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> TMEM41B homologue. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>, we found that expression of wildtype human and mosquito TMEM41B as well as the two human TMEM41B SNP variants all reduced lipid droplets back to baseline. These results suggest that while these two SNPs negatively impact flavivirus infection, they appear to be fully functional in their ability to maintain normal lipid distribution as measured in this assay.</p>

<title>TMEM41B colocalizes with flavivirus NS4A and NS4B proteins</title>
<p id="P26">Next, we assayed whether the cellular localization of TMEM41B changed upon virus infection. We utilized the tagRFP-TMEM41B expression construct to monitor TMEM41B cellular localization prior to and during flavivirus infection. Previous imaging and proteomics experiments have shown that TMEM41B localizes to ER membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Moretti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Morita et al., 2019</xref>). Our observations in TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells expressing tagRFP-TMEM41B are consistent with ER localization. Interestingly, however, upon infection with either YFV or ZIKV, we observed a striking re-localization of tagRFP-TMEM41B from a diffuse reticular-like pattern to a large cytosolic aggregate that co-localizes with viral nonstructural proteins, NS4A (ZIKV) and NS4B (YFV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). NS4A and NS4B are multipass transmembrane proteins known to induce membrane curvature, which, together with additional nonstructural viral and likely host proteins, form the viral RNA replication complex.</p>
<p id="P27">To further confirm that TMEM41B co-localizes with NS4A and NS4B, we next performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments using an anti-RFP antibody to immunoprecipitate tagRFP-TMEM41B. We found that NS4A in lysates from ZIKV-infected cells and NS4B in lysates from YFV-infected cells co-immunoprecipitated with tagRFP-TMEM41B, whereas no NS4A or NS4B signal was detected in immunoprecipitates from lysates from uninfected cells or infected cell lysates immunoprecipitated with an IgG isotype control antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B, C</xref>). We probed these blots for β-actin to confirm that similar amounts of lysate were used as input and we probed for RFP to confirm that equal amounts of tagRFP-TMEM41B were immunoprecipitated in both uninfected and infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A, B</xref>). All together, these results suggest that TMEM41B is likely recruited to sites of viral RNA replication either indirectly or potentially by direct interaction with NS4A and/or NS4B.</p>

<title>Adaptive mutations in NS4A and NS4B restore flavivirus infectivity in TMEM41B KO cells</title>
<p id="P28">Viruses exist as diverse populations of variants and can readily adapt to new environments. These genetic adaptations can highlight viral proteins or viral RNA structures that are under selective pressure in a given context. Throughout our experiments, we often observed rare YFV and ZIKV antigen positive cells after infecting clonal TMEM41B KO populations. To gain potential insight into which stage of the virus replication cycle was affected by the absence of TMEM41B, we sought to capitalize on these rare infection events to select for adaptive mutations within the viral genome. We did this by serial passaging of ZIKV-infected cells and culture supernatants to select viral variants capable of replicating in TMEM41B-deficient cells. We performed virus supernatant passaging experiments in human TMEM41B KO A549 and HAP1 cells, and in parallel, we passaged ZIKV-infected TMEM41B KO mosquito Aag2 cells. Serial passages were performed in multiple independent lineages for each cell type, and we similarly passaged virus in wildtype cells to control for cell culture adaptive mutations that arise which are unrelated to TMEM41B KO. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref> shows a graphical outline of these experiments.</p>
<p id="P29">After 15-20 rounds of passaging, we deep-sequenced viral cDNA from cell supernatants to identify viral variants that were enriched in virus populations passaged in TMEM41B KO cells relative to virus populations passaged in wildtype cells. To qualify as a potential adaptive mutation, we applied a stringency filter that required mutations to be present in at least three independent passages (regardless of cell type) and <italic>not</italic> present in virus that had been passaged in wildtype cells. Remarkably, all mutations that met these criteria were located in NS4A and NS4B. Further, NS4B mutations at positions Ile42 and Ser236 were selected in both mosquito and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P30">To confirm that these mutations we selected enable ZIKV to infect TMEM41B-deficient cells, we chose to introduce two mutations in NS4B, Ile42Thr and Phe91Tyr, into the infectious cDNA clone of the Cambodian ZIKV strain FSS13025 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Shan et al., 2016</xref>), and we generated viral stocks. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C and D</xref> demonstrates that these individual point mutations in NS4B render ZIKV infectious in both mosquito (Aag2) and mammalian (A549) TMEM41B KO cells.</p>

<title>Wild and vaccine strain chimeras overcome TMEM41B deficiency</title>
<p id="P31">As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A</xref>, we observed that two highly similar strains of YFV—the parental Asibi strain and the 17D vaccine strain—were differentially sensitive to TMEM41B deficiency in A549 cells. The live-attenuated YFV 17D strain differs from the Asibi strain by only 31 amino acids, three of which are located within NS4A (V107I) and NS4B (M95I and Y232H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">dos Santos et al., 1995</xref>). Given the strain-specific differences we observed in TMEM41B KO A549 cells, together with the observation that single amino acid changes in NS4A and NS4B could allow flavivirus replication in TMEM41B KO cells, we next generated 17D:Asibi chimeric viruses by swapping NS4A and NS4B individually, or by swapping the region containing both NS4A and NS4B which includes the 2K protein. Remarkably, we found that in the 17D viral background, NS4B from the Asibi strain significantly increased infection in TMEM41B KO A549 cells, whereas the NS4B from the 17D strain slightly decreased the infectivity of the Asibi strain in TMEM41B KO cells. In contrast, the NS4A changes had no impact on infection. Importantly, parallel infections in wildtype A549 cells show that the results observed in the KO cells are not due to an overall increase or decrease in viral replication, but rather were likely due to a differential requirement for TMEM41B in this cellular context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E, F</xref>).</p>

<title>TMEM41B KO cells mount an exaggerated innate immune response to flavivirus inoculum</title>
<p id="P32">During the process of studying infection of TMEM41B KO cells, we observed an apparent cytotoxicity with high virus inocula (MOI &gt; 5 PFU/cell) that was not seen with similar inocula to wildtype cells. We hypothesized that this cytotoxicity may have resulted from an exaggerated innate immune response due to increased exposure of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in TMEM41B-deficient cells. This hypothesis is based on recent evidence supporting a role for TMEM41B in mobilizing lipids and inducing membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Moretti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Morita et al., 2019</xref>), and our own data which indicates that TMEM41B is likely recruited to flavivirus replication complexes. Flavivirus replication complexes are sites at which viral RNA replication machinery assembles within invaginations into the ER lumen utilizing host curvature-stabilizing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aktepe and Mackenzie, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Neufeldt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Rajah et al., 2020</xref>). Within these structures, dsRNA intermediates that form during viral RNA replication are protected from host innate immune sensors that survey the cytosol for pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In the absence of TMEM41B, viral RNA replication may initiate in aberrant replication complexes that are exposed to the cytosol.</p>
<p id="P33">To test if the observed cytotoxicity was due to innate immune activation, we inoculated wildtype and TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells with a high YFV 17D virus inoculum (MOI = 0.4 PFU/cell), then quantified viral RNA and mRNA encoding 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) by qPCR at 24 h post infection. OAS1 is a classic interferon (IFN) stimulated gene (ISG) induced by type I and III IFNs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>, we found that YFV 17D RNA levels were 100-fold lower in TMEM41B KO cells compared to wildtype cells, consistent with an inability to replicate. Supporting our hypothesis, OAS1 was highly induced in the KO cells but not induced in wildtype cells. To determine if OAS1 induction was due to the virus itself or functional viral RNA, we inoculated both wildtype and TMEM41B KO cells with viral particles inactivated by UV light. UV-inactivated virus failed to induce OAS1 expression in both cell lines suggesting that viral protein production and perhaps initiation of viral RNA replication was required to induce innate immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). To control for the possibility that TMEM41B KO cells are hypersensitive to PAMPs in general, we infected both wildtype and TMEM41B KO cells with a recombinant influenza A virus (IAV) lacking a critical innate immune antagonist protein, NS1 (IAV ΔNS1). This virus is well known for its defect in antagonizing IFN production and ISG expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Garcia-Sastre et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Wang et al., 2000</xref>). We found that both wildtype and TMEM41B KO responded to IAV ΔNS1 as expected, with wildtype cells expressing even slightly higher amounts of OAS1 mRNA than TMEM41B KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P34">Upon detection of viral PAMPs, cells secrete IFN to protect neighboring cells from infection then subsequently initiate apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Drappier and Michiels, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gusho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Schwartz and Conn, 2019</xref>). To assay if the cytotoxicity we observed in TMEM41B KO cells after inoculation with high viral loads was in fact apoptosis, we inoculated wildtype and TMEM41B KO cells with a high YFV 17D inoculum (MOI = 4 PFU/cell) and quantified the number of apoptotic cells at 24 h post inoculation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>, we observed an approximate three-fold increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in TMEM41B KO cells compared to wildtype cells. Importantly, at this early time point, there was almost no increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in the infected wildtype cell population as compared to mock-infected cultures. Further, the positive control, staurosporine (STS), induced apoptosis in approximately 70% of the cells, with no notable difference between wildtype and TMEM41B KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P35">Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 gene disruption screens are a powerful method of discovery. We applied this method to discover cellular host factors that flaviviruses require to replicate in human cells. As a testament to the robustness of this approach, our results along with CRISPR-Cas9 screens performed by research groups using different flaviviruses, different cell types, and different sgRNA libraries identified many shared genes and biological pathways. Screens, however, are often only the first step towards understanding new virus-host biology.</p>
<p id="P36">From our loss-of-function screens using a ZIKV isolate from Puerto Rico (PRVABC59) and the Asibi strain of YFV, we noted a strong dependence on an obscure host factor with a generic name: TMEM41B. During the course of our studies, TMEM41B was independently identified by several groups that performed CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens designed to uncover novel regulators of autophagy. As a result, a cellular role for TMEM41B began to emerge.</p>
<p id="P37">In our validation studies we found that all flaviviruses we tested, including both mosquito-borne and tick-borne flaviviruses, required TMEM41B for infection and replication. Further, we found that TMEM41B was required in the mosquito vector as well, supporting a conserved role for TMEM41B in flavivirus infection in distantly related species. Given that TMEM41B is required for flavivirus infection and that TMEM41B is also required for autophagy, the question arose: is autophagy required for flavivirus infection? To address this question, we generated CRISPR KO cell lines lacking <italic>BECN1, ATG5</italic>, and <italic>ATG7</italic> since these genes are known to have critical roles in cellular autophagy. Our results suggest that under the conditions we tested the full autophagy pathway is not essential for flavivirus infection. This is also indirectly supported by the fact that <italic>VMP1</italic> and <italic>TMEM41B</italic> are the only hits shared among our ZIKV CRISPR-Cas9 screen and a CRISPR-Cas9 autophagy screen. This led us to hypothesize that flaviviruses may hijack TMEM41B and VMP1 for their ability to remodel host cell membranes–a feature required both for autophagy and for the formation of viral replication complexes.</p>
<p id="P38">Although every flavivirus we tested required TMEM41B in most cell types, there were several virus-cell combinations we tested where TMEM41B was either not required or played a less essential role in virus infection. This conundrum may be explained by cell type-specific differences in the abundance of structurally or functionally related cellular host proteins such as VMP1 and TMEM41A, which we found can partially support flavivirus infection in the absence of TMEM41B. These findings suggest that TMEM41B may be an important cellular determinant that defines flavivirus tissue tropism and pathogenesis. Along these lines, it is notable that a SNP in <italic>TMEM41B</italic> present in approximately 20% of East and South East Asian and 3.5% of Latin American populations has a reduced capacity to support flavivirus infection. While it is nearly impossible to know for sure what drove selection of this SNP in these populations, it is conceivable that a pathogenic flavivirus may have been involved.</p>
<p id="P39">While variations in the host environment can influence virus tropism, so too can variations in the virus. Our studies uncovered that two highly related yellow fever viruses, the virulent Asibi strain and the live attenuated 17D vaccine strain, displayed a differential ability to infect JEG3 and A549 cells lacking TMEM41B. The fact that the YFV Asibi and 17D strains differ by only 31 amino acids provided us with an opportunity to potentially isolate the flavivirus TMEM41B dependency down to the level of an individual viral protein. Concurrently, we made additional observations that suggested amino acid differences in NS4A and NS4B between these two strains may be responsible for their differential TMEM41B requirement. These observations included our findings that (i) TMEM41B relocalizes upon flavivirus infection and colocalizes with NS4A and NS4B, (ii) TMEM41B co-immunoprecipitated with NS4A and NS4B in flavivirus-infected cells, and (iii) mutations within ZIKV NS4A and NS4B can compensate for the lack of TMEM41B. Based on these data, we made 17D:Asibi chimeric viruses and found that two amino acid differences within NS4B were sufficient to confer or bypass TMEM41B dependence. Future studies are needed to better understand how only one or a few amino acids changes in NS4A and NS4B are able to bypass the strong TMEM41B requirement during flavivirus infection. Together these results highlight remarkable plasticity even among “essential” host factors and demonstrate that loss of a critical host factor can be overcome by relatively few genetic changes in the viral genome. This contrasts the notion that resistance barriers may be higher when targeting host factors with antiviral therapeutics as opposed to targeting the virus. When dealing with highly diverse viral populations, multi-target drug cocktails are still likely to be important regardless of whether therapies target host or viral factors.</p>
<p id="P40">Our final observation where we demonstrate that TMEM41B cells initiate a strong innate immune response when exposed to a large number of virus particles provides mechanistic insights into the role of TMEM41B in the flavivirus replication cycle. Based on our collective results together with what is known about the role of TMEM41B in lipid mobilization and inducing membrane curvature, we propose a model, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>, where upon flavivirus infection and translation of the viral polyprotein, TMEM41B is recruited to sites on the ER membrane together with NS4A and NS4B where replication complexes are forming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Neufeldt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Paul and Bartenschlager, 2015</xref>). This recruitment may be through direct protein:protein interaction or through passive diffusion, where, by mobilizing neutral and sterol lipids, TMEM41B helps lower the local free energy imposed by NS4A- and NS4B-induced membrane curvature. We propose that TMEM41B’s role in facilitating membrane curvature is dependent upon a functional interaction between TMEM41B and VMP1, the latter of which is highly mobile and associates with cell organelles, vesicles and lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Tabara and Escalante, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). In the absence of TMEM41B, flavivirus NS4A and NS4B proteins assemble and viral RNA replication initiates, but because replication complexes are improperly formed, dsRNA intermediates are exposed to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). At this point, the infectious replication cycle is aborted, either due to an innate immune response or simply because the RNA genome cannot be efficiently copied. Future work is needed to thoroughly test this model and understand how TMEM41B works together with viral proteins and other host factors during assembly of flavivirus replication complexes.</p>
<p id="P41">Lastly, during our studies, we uncovered a role for TMEM41B in the coronavirus replication cycle. Recently, we and others also identified TMEM41B as a top scoring hit in genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss of function screens designed to identify coronavirus host dependency factors ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Baggen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) and accompanying manuscript: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Schneider et al., 2020</xref>)). It will be fascinating to learn if TMEM41B is also required to assemble coronavirus replication complexes. In conclusion, TMEM41B may be a candidate target to inhibit the replication of a broad range of emerging and reemerging flavivirus and coronavirus pathogens.</p>

<title>Analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen data</title>
<p id="P45">FASTQ files were processed and trimmed to retrieve sgRNA target sequences followed by enumeration of sgRNAs in the reference sgRNA library file using MAGeCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Z-scores were computed using the following approach: for each condition, the log2 fold change with respect to the initial condition was computed. A natural cubic spline with 4 degrees of freedom was fit to each pair of infected and control cells and residuals were extracted. To obtain gene-wise data, the mean residuals for each group of sgRNAs was calculated, a z-score was computed, and a p-value was determined using a 2-sided normal distribution test. P-values were combined across screens using Fisher’s sumlog approach and corrected for multiple testing using the method of Benjamini &amp; Hochberg.</p>

<p>TMEM41B and VMP1 are required for both autophagy and flavivirus infection, however, autophagy is not required for flavivirus infection.</p>
<p>TMEM41B associates with viral proteins and likely facilitates membrane remodeling to establish viral RNA replication complexes.</p>
<p>TMEM41B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present at nearly twenty percent in East Asian populations reduce flavivirus infection.</p>
<p>TMEM41B-deficient cells display an exaggerated innate immune response upon high multiplicity flavivirus infection.</p>
