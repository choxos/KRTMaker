<abstract>
<p id="P1">We describe a mammalian cell-based assay capable of identifying coronavirus 3CL protease (3CLpro) inhibitors without requiring the use of live virus. By enabling the facile testing of compounds across a range of coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes, including the one from SARS-CoV-2, we are able to quickly identify compounds with broad or narrow spectra of activity. We further demonstrate the utility of our approach by performing a curated compound screen along with structure-activity profiling of a series of small molecules to identify compounds with antiviral activity. Throughout these studies, we observed concordance between data emerging from this assay and from live virus assays. By democratizing the testing of 3CL inhibitors to enable screening in the majority of laboratories rather than the few with extensive biosafety infrastructure, we hope to expedite the search for coronavirus 3CL protease inhibitors, to address the current epidemic and future ones that will inevitably arise.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection of the past several months has paralyzed countries around the world<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. This crisis is further exacerbated by the dearth of approved therapeutics, leaving physicians with few proven treatment options. In the past two decades, the world has already suffered from two other major coronavirus outbreaks, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), suggesting that coronaviruses represent a real and ever-present threat to global health that must be addressed<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. Yet, even if therapeutics against the existing epidemic strains are identified, there are several hundred other coronaviruses in active circulation within animal populations, many with the theoretical potential to infect humans. To help identify therapeutics for the current epidemic along with preparing for the next, there is a need for readily deployable small molecule screening assays that enable the identification of therapeutics that are broad-acting across a large collection of coronavirus strains.</p>
<p id="P3">During coronavirus infection, the RNA genome is delivered into cells and translated into a pair of polyproteins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. These polyproteins are then processed by a set of virally encoded proteases, of which the three-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) performs the majority of cleavage events<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. As a result of its essential role in viral replication and high degree of conservation across all coronaviruses, 3CLpro enzymes represent important targets for therapeutic drug development<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. Previous work expressing a variety of viral proteases within yeast and mammalian cellular systems have shown that protease expression can lead to profound cellular toxicity, which can be rescued by the addition of protease inhibitors<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. We hypothesized that if the expression of coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes within mammalian cells leads to a similar toxic phenotype, this could form the basis of an easily implemented mammalian cell-based assay to evaluate protease inhibitors. While multiple assays exist to evaluate protease inhibitors, an assay of the nature we envisioned has clear advantages, as it requires minimal upfront cost or effort, is accessible to many biomedical research labs, does not involve the use of live virus, and requires no specialized reporter to read out protease activity. In contrast, <italic>in vitro</italic> protease assays using purified protein have formed the backbone of inhibitor screening, but require upfront efforts to isolate the pure protease and are not conducted under physiologic cellular conditions<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. In addition, if one desires to identify broad-acting coronavirus inhibitors, one must purify and identify experimental conditions suitable for testing each protease <italic>in vitro</italic>. An alternative approach for identifying protease inhibitors is the use of live virus which is performed under more biologically relevant conditions, assuming relevant host cell systems can be identified, but requires intensive safety training and specialized biosafety protocols<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. For many coronaviruses, no live virus assay exists, limiting the ability to test compounds within mammalian cell systems to a small subset of all coronaviruses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. Furthermore, compounds with activity against live virus may function through a number of mechanisms other than protease inhibition which cannot be readily determined, and may lead to undesired off-target activities which are not realized until much later in the drug development process<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">Here, we report a mammalian cell-based assay to identify coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitors that does not require the use of live virus. We demonstrate the utility of the assay using the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, with EC<sub>50</sub> values obtained from the assay showing good concordance with traditional live virus testing for multiple compounds. We next establish the generality of the approach by testing a diverse set of 3CLpro enzymes. Finally, we perform a small molecule screen, along with structure-activity profiling of a set of compounds to find those with enhanced antiviral activity. The presented data support the use of our assay system for the discovery of small molecule 3CLpro inhibitors and the rapid characterization of their activity across multiple coronaviruses to identify those with broad inhibitory activity.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Expression of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in HEK293T cells results in cell toxicity and can be used as a readout of drug activity</title>
<p id="P5">Prior work has shown that the exogenous expression of viral proteases within cellular systems can result in growth suppression or cell death. Motivated by this work, we sought to determine the effect of expressing the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in HEK293T cells. Utilizing a cost-effective crystal-violet-based approach to quantify cell abundance, we observed that expression of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro results in significant growth inhibition as compared to the expression of a control protein, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-b</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. This suppression of growth was dependent upon the catalytic function of the enzyme, as mutating cysteine 145, which is essential for the enzyme's peptidase activity, abolished the growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-b</xref>). We sought to determine if the observed growth defect could be rescued by incubating cells with GC376, a feline coronavirus inhibitor that was recently reported to have activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. In comparison to untreated control cells, the addition of GC376 led to a robust increase in cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-d</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Compound rescue of transfected 3CLpro cytotoxicity is similar to results obtained with live virus</title>
<p id="P6">We next tested if this transfection-based assay could be used to determine compound EC<sub>50</sub> values and whether the values showed any correlation with those obtained with live virus. After incubating SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro transfected cells with a range of GC376 concentrations, we calculated an EC<sub>50</sub> of 3.30 μM, which is similar to published values reported using live virus on Vero E6 (EC<sub>50</sub> 2.2 μM, 0.9 μM, 0.18 μM, 4.48 μM) and Vero 76 cells (EC<sub>50</sub> 3.37 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. We investigated the assay's tolerance to deviation by varying the amount of plasmid transfected or the number of cells seeded into wells containing compound (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). In all cases, the assay was robust to variation, delivering a similar EC<sub>50</sub> for GC376 across all conditions. We also tested an orthogonal method of quantifying cell abundance based on fluorescence microscopy and observed agreement with the results obtained with crystal violet staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). This suggests that the assay system is robust to variation and provides consistent results.</p>
<p id="P7">We next conducted dose-response profiling for two additional SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors, compound 4 and compound 11a, and observed reversal of the toxic effect of the protease in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b-c</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. In agreement with the results obtained with GC376, the EC<sub>50</sub> value for compound 4 was comparable to those obtained with live virus, 0.98 μM and 3.023 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. Unexpectedly, we calculated an EC<sub>50</sub> of 6.89 μM for 11a, which is approximately 10-fold higher than the literature reported value of 0.53 μM, based on viral plaque assay<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. We have noticed that literature reported EC<sub>50</sub> values from live virus testing could range over an order of magnitude depending on the exact method employed, as is the case for GC376 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). To resolve this discrepancy between the transfection-based approach and the live virus assay, we conducted live virus testing of 11a using the commonly employed readout of cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells and observed closer concordance with our transfection-based results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. To measure the toxicity of each compound, we exposed EYFP-transfected cells to each molecule and determined CC<sub>50</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). We also calculated the selectivity index (SI) for each compound tested in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">We hypothesized that the assay would be able to distinguish between compounds that are only active on the purified SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and those that are able to inhibit the live virus through protease inhibition. In general, we observe concordance between compounds showing activity within this transfection-based 3CL assay and live virus studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a-e</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. However, within the assay, we did not observe activity for ebselen, a small molecule with demonstrated activity against the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro <italic>in vitro</italic> and activity against the SARS-CoV-2 live virus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4f</xref>). We suggest that this may be due to ebselen targeting more than 3CLpro within the live virus assay, which is in line with work showing that ebselen is highly reactive and readily forms selenosulfide bonds with numerous proteins including the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLP)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Demonstrating assay compatibility across a range of coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes</title>
<p id="P9">We hypothesized that this assay may be used to study other coronavirus 3CLpros to enable users to identify broad-acting inhibitors, as constructs containing other 3CLpro enzymes could be readily synthesized. To test the assay's generality, we created expression constructs for 3CL proteases from five other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Bat-CoV-HKU9, HCoV-NL63 and IBV) with variable amino acid identity compared with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). For each of these proteases, we confirmed that expression in mammalian cells resulted in toxicity that is dependent upon the enzyme's catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). Next, we tested GC376, compound 4, and 11a across this panel of proteases. GC376, a drug originally identified for use against the Feline Infectious Peritonitis virus, showed EC<sub>50</sub> &lt;10 μM for the most, but not all of proteases tested<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. Unexpectedly, compound 4, which was originally designed as a SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor showed particular potency against IBV 3CLpro (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.058 μM) along with broad activity (EC<sub>50</sub> &lt;10 μM) for all other 3CL proteases tested. In contrast to GC376 and compound 4, 11a had a relatively narrow activity spectrum with EC<sub>50</sub> &lt;10 μM against only SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Of note, in all cases where previous live virus data was available, the EC<sub>50</sub> values obtained from this transfection-based assay were similar (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Rapid testing to identify SARS-CoV-2-3CL protease inhibitors</title>
<p id="P10">Having further determined the assay's ability to examine the effects of active individual compounds, we sought to determine its suitability for small molecule screening. Before performing the screen, we optimized the testing parameters to ensure suitable performance characteristics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref> and Methods)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>. We compiled a collection of 162 diverse protease inhibitors, along with compounds with reported <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against 3CLpro enzymes or structural similarity to known 3CLpro inhibitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Of the nearly 200 compounds tested, two potent hits were identified, GC373 and GRL-0496 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P11">We noted that GC373 is structurally similar to its prodrug GC376, except for the change of the bisulfide salt adduct to an aldehyde warhead<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>. Additional testing of GC373 revealed it to have a similar EC<sub>50</sub> as GC376 in both the transfection assay and when tested against live SARS-CoV-2 virus, suggesting that the differences in structure has a minimal effect on their potency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), although solubility may be affected<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>. The other hit from the screen, GRL-0496, shares structural similarity to several other compounds within the library, one of which is a previously reported 3CLpro inhibitor (MAC-5576) that failed to show activity against SARS-CoV-2 in a live virus assay<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. Additional testing of GRL-0496 revealed it to have an EC<sub>50</sub> of 5.05 μM against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro within our transfection-based assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). To verify GRL-0496's activity, we tested it against live SARS-CoV-2 virus, and confirmed its potency (EC<sub>50</sub> = 9.12 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). We next tested GRL-0496 against the full panel of 3CLpro enzymes we had previously examined and observed a narrow range of activity, with EC<sub>50</sub> &lt;10 μM only observed against SARS-CoV 3CLpro and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, in agreement with previous live virus testing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. We also tested GC373 against the full panel of 3CLpro enzymes and observed concordance with GC376, with SARS-CoV 3CLpro, MERS-CoV 3CL pro, and IBV 3CL pro demonstrating an EC<sub>50</sub> &lt;10 μM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P12">Given the potential for protease inhibitors in the treatment of viral illnesses, small molecule inhibitors of coronavirus 3CL proteases represent a promising avenue for treating infections caused by this large family of viruses. Here, we present a simplified assay to identify candidate inhibitors under physiologic cellular conditions. This approach presents significant advantages over other methods to detect 3CL protease inhibitory activity with its ease of use and ability to be performed with equipment and reagents commonly available to many biomedical research laboratories. While conventional methods for identifying 3CL protease inhibitors make use of <italic>in vitro</italic> purified protease, the isolation of sufficiently pure enzyme in its native state can be costly and labor intensive. Furthermore, assays using purified protease fail to consider cell permeability and the influence of the extracellular and intracellular milieu on compound activity. In comparison to live virus-based assays, the outlined approach does not require extensive biosafety containment. These data also suggest that the approach described here is applicable to a number of coronaviruses for which live virus assays may not be available or would be deemed ethically challenging to be performed even with extensive biosafety infrastructure<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. Finally, because the phenotype assayed within this approach is driven solely by protease activity, it may enable the distinction between compounds with multiple biological targets and subsequent potential for off-target toxicity from those that function primarily as 3CLpro inhibitors.</p>
<p id="P13">A number of surrogate assays that aim to identify molecules with activity against proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 have recently been reported<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>. These assays were developed to provide physiologically meaningful molecule testing without needing to use live SARS-CoV-2 cultures in order to allow for rapid testing and widespread adoption to labs without necessary safety infrastructure. The aforementioned assays have focused primarily on identifying neutralizing antibodies targeted at the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. To our knowledge, a reporter-free surrogate assay to identify coronavirus 3CL protease inhibitors validated with multiple known coronavirus 3CL protease inhibitors has not been reported.</p>
<p id="P14">Within the literature, EC<sub>50</sub> values obtained for a 3CLpro inhibitor against live virus can show a broad range of potency, with some compounds demonstrating EC<sub>50</sub> values across multiple orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). These differences appear to be driven by variation in experimental setup such as cell line used, assay readout, incubation period, and initial concentration of virus added. While we have observed agreement between the EC<sub>50</sub> values obtained from the described transfection-based method and those reported in the literature, given the differences in EC<sub>50</sub> across assays, we suggest caution when comparing results across studies. By developing this transfection-based 3CLpro testing platform, we hope to facilitate the discovery of new coronavirus inhibitors while also facilitating the comparison of existing inhibitors within a single simplified assay system. Furthermore, we propose that this cellular protease assay system could be industrialized to screen and optimize a large number of compounds to discover potential treatments for future viral pandemics.</p>

HEK293T and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) which was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). HEK293T and HEK293 cells were confirmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination with the Agilent MycoSensor PCR Assay Kit. To obtain HEK293 cells stably expressing EYFP, cells were co-transfected with EYFP plasmids harboring the <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposon (pPB bsr2-EYFP) (Yusa et al., 2009) and pCMV-mPBase (mammalian codon-optimized PBase) encoding a piggyBac transposase using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One day after transfection, the transfected cells were selected with 10 μg/mL of blasticidin (Invitrogen).</p>

<title>Transfections and Drug Selections</title>
<p id="P16">24 h prior to transfection, 293T cells were seeded at 65-75% confluency into 24-well plates coated for 30 min with a 1 mg/mL solution of poly-D-lysine (MP Biomedicals Inc.) and washed with PBS (Gibco) once prior to media addition. The next day, 500 ng of 3CLpro expression plasmid, unless otherwise stated, was incubated with Opti-MEM and Lipofectamine 2000 for 30 min at room temperature prior to dribbling on cells, as per manufacturer's protocol. For plating into drug conditions, 20 h after transfection, cells were washed once with PBS and 200 μL Trypsin-EDTA 0.25% (Gibco) was added to cells to release them from the plate. Trypsinized cell slurry was pipetted up and down repeatedly to ensure a single cell suspension. 96-well plates were coated with poly-D-lysine, either coated manually with 1 μg/mL poly-D-lysine in PBS solution for 30 min or purchased pre-coated with poly-D-lysine (Corning). Wells were filled with 100 μL of media ± drug and 1 μg/mL puromycin and were seeded with 9 μL of trypsinized cell slurry. For higher throughput experiments, multiple individually transfected wells of a 24-well plate were combined after trypsinization and prior to seeding in drug. After seeding into wells containing drug and puromycin, cells were incubated for 48 h unless otherwise specified.</p>

<title>Plasmids</title>
<p id="P17">All vectors used in this study were cloned into the pLEX307 backbone (Addgene #41392) using Gateway LR II Clonase Enzyme mix (Invitrogen). 3CL proteases used in this study were generated using gene fragments ordered from Twist Biosciences. Inactive 3CL proteases were generated by site directed mutagenesis of the essential catalytic cysteine. DNA was transformed into NEB 10-beta high efficiency competent cells. Sanger sequencing to verify proper inserts were done for all plasmids used in this study (Genewiz).</p>
<p id="P18">Plasmid DNA was isolated using standard miniprep buffers (Omega Biotek) and silica membrane columns (Biobasic). To reduce batch-to-batch variability between plasmid DNA isolations and its subsequent impact on transfection efficiency, multiple plasmid DNA extractions were conducted in parallel, diluted to 50 ng/μL and pooled together.</p>

<title>Crystal Violet Staining and Quantification</title>
<p id="P19">The crystal violet staining protocol was adapted from Feoktistova et. al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup> Briefly, after compound incubation with 3CLpro expressing cells in 96-well plates, the medium was discarded and cells were washed once with PBS. Cells were incubated with 50 μL of crystal violet staining solution (0.5% crystal violet in 80% water and 20% methanol) and rocked gently for 30 min. The staining solution was removed and cells were washed four times with water using a multichannel pipette. Stained cells were left to dry for ≥4 h on the laboratory bench or within the chemical hood. The crystal violet staining solution was eluted by the addition of 200 μL of methanol over the course of 30 min with gentle rocking. Plates were sealed with parafilm to mitigate methanol evaporation. 100 μL of eluted stain from each well was transferred to a new 96-well plate for reading in a Tecan Infinite F50 plate reader. Absorbance was measured at 595 nm twice and values were averaged between replicate measurements. Blank wells were included in each batch of experiments, and absorbance values were normalized by background levels of staining from blank wells.</p>

<sec id="S13">
<title>Statistical Analysis of Dose Response Curves</title>
<p id="P20">For analysis of crystal violet staining experiments, relative growth was calculated from background normalized absorbance values. Test wells containing drug were divided by average background normalized values from wells where cells were expressing protease and exposed to vehicle, when available. Otherwise, values were normalized by values from protease-expressing cells exposed to the lowest concentration of drug included in the dose-response curve. When there were significant deviations from protease-expressing cells exposed to no drug and protease-expressing cells exposed to lowest concentrations of drug included in the dose-response curve, experiments were repeated with normalization by protease-expressing cells exposed to no drug. CC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated in Prism using the nonlinear regression functionality and derived from dose-response curves with EYFP transfected cells. A nonlinear curve fitting function accounting for variable curve slopes was calculated by plotting the normalized response as a function of log(compound). Similarly, EC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated in GraphPad Prism also using the nonlinear regression functionality. A nonlinear curve fitting function measuring the stimulatory response of a compound as a function of an unnormalized response was used to calculate the EC<sub>50</sub>. All reported values were confirmed to not have ambiguous curve fitting. The 95% confidence interval of EC<sub>50</sub> calculations was also calculated and included.</p>
<p id="P21">For analysis of live virus experiments, EC<sub>50</sub> values were determined by fitting a nonlinear curve to the data with the assumption of a normalized response (GraphPad Prism). Cells were confirmed as mycoplasma negative prior to use.</p>

<title>Compound Screening</title>
<p id="P22">For screening condition optimization, we measured the Z-Factor for replicates of positive controls GC376, tested at 50 μM, and compound 4, tested at 20 μM. Replicate measurements were recorded for DMSO negative controls and positive control compounds after 48, 72, and 96 h of incubation with drug. Background normalized crystal violet absorbance values at each timepoint were collected.</p>
<p id="P23">During the drug screen, within each of the four plates screened, two positive controls wells were included to ensure assay reliability, along with several wells with the negative control 0.1% DMSO condition. All compounds were screened at 10 μM resuspended in DMSO (Fisher Scientific). For hit selection, we employed a robust z-score method. We first normalized data using a robust z-score that uses median and median absolute deviation (MAD) instead of mean and standard deviation. We then used a threshold of 3.5 MAD to determine which drugs rescued the cytotoxicity imposed by expression of the viral protease<sup>

<title>Live Virus Assay</title>
<p id="P24">The SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019-nCoV/USA_WA1/2020 was grown and titered in Vero-E6 cells. One day before the experiment, Vero-E6 cells were seeded at 30,000 cells/well in 96 well-plates. Serial dilutions of the test compound were prepared in media (EMEM + 10% FCS + penicillin/streptomycin), pipetted onto cells, and virus was subsequently added to each well at an MOI of 0.2. Cells were incubated at in a humidified environment at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 72 h after addition of virus. Cytopathic effect was scored by independent, blinded researchers. The reported cytopathic effect value represents the average from two independent reviewers. Percent Inhibition was calculated by comparison to control wells with no inhibitor added. All live virus experiments were conducted in a biosafety level 3 lab.</p>

<title>Microscopy</title>
<p id="P25">Cells plated on a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-OneTM) and washed once immediately before imaging. EYFP fluorescence imaging was performed using an Axio Observer 7 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 10X objective (0.45 N.A.) with 1-by-1 pixel binning. Optical Illumination bias was empirically derived by sampling background areas and subsequently used to flatten images. After a global background subtraction, cell density was calculated based on area of EYFP intensity.</p>
