<abstract>
<p id="P1">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major public health issue. To screen for antiviral drugs for COVID-19 treatment, we constructed a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) pseudovirus system using an HIV-1-based lentiviral vector with a luciferase reporter gene to screen 188 small potential antiviral compounds. Using this system, we identified nine compounds, specifically, bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, that potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry, with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.1–10 μM. Mechanistic studies showed that these compounds, reported as calcium channel blockers (CCBs), inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated membrane fusion and consequently suppressed coronavirus entry. These candidate drugs showed broad-spectrum efficacy against the entry of several coronavirus pseudotypes (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 [S-D614, S-G614, N501Y.V1 and N501Y.V2]) in different cell lines (293T, Calu-3, and A549). Antiviral tests using native SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells confirmed that four of the drugs (SC9/cepharanthine, SC161/hernandezine, SC171, and SC185/neferine) reduced cytopathic effect and supernatant viral RNA load. Among them, cepharanthine showed the strongest anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Collectively, this study offers new lead compounds for coronavirus antiviral drug discovery.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major public health issue. The spike (S) protein mutation D614G (a single change in the genetic code; D = aspartic acid, G = glycine) became dominant in SARS-CoV-2 during global pandemic, which displayed increased infectivity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Entry of a virus into host cells is one of the most critical steps in the viral life cycle. Since blockade of the entry process is a promising therapeutic option for COVID-19, research attention has been focused on the discovery of viral entry inhibitors. Although SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor development is very attractive, no candidates have progressed into clinical trials yet.</p>

The cells were replaced to fresh DMEM medium 8 h post-infection. Cells were lysed by 30 μl lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 72 h post-infection to measure RLU with luciferase assay reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the product description.

<title>Cell-cell fusion assay</title>
<p id="P11">HEK 293T effector cells were transfected with plasmid pAdTrack-TO4-GFP encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) or pS-G614 encoding the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 S protein. 293T-ACE2 cells were used as target cells. At 8 h post-transfection, the effector cells were washed twice with PBS and were pretreated with compounds or DMSO as control for another 16h. Subsequently, the effector cells were overlaid on target cells at a ratio of approximately one S-expressing cell to two receptor-expressing cells with about 90% confluent. After a 4-hour coculture, images of syncytia were captured with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon eclipse Ti, Melville, NY).</p>
<p id="P12">For quantification of cell-cell fusion, three fields were randomly selected in each well to count the fused and unfused cells. The fused cells were at least twice as large as the unfused cells, and the fluorescence intensity was weaker in fused cells since GFP diffusion from one effector cell to target cells. The percentage of cell-cell fusion was calculated as: [(number of the fused cells/number of the total cells) × 100%].</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p id="P19">Using a luciferase-expressing pseudovirus encoding SARS-CoV-2 S (G614) protein, a library of 188 natural compounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tab. S1</xref>) was screened in 293T-ACE2 cells (HEK 293T cells overexpressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) to find novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors. A workflow chart of screening is shown in Fig. 1a. After a preliminary screening, 41 compounds associated with a relative infection rate &lt;30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) were identified. We selected 19 compounds with low cytotoxicity for further testing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tab. S2, Fig. S1</xref>). Among the 19 hits, nine compounds (SC9, SC161, SC171, SC182–187) with relatively high activity (EC<sub>50</sub> &lt; 10 μM), low cytotoxicity (CC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 20 μM), and high specificity (SI &gt; 10) were selected for subsequent analyses. Specifically, all these compounds were bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids except SC171.</p>
<p id="P20">Next, we analyzed the relationship between the antiviral efficacy of the nine selected compounds against S-G614 pseudovirus and the timing of treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). We divided the S-G614 pseudovirus entry into three stages: pretreatment, pseudovirus entry, and pseudovirus post-entry. In total, eight experimental groups were set up for each compound, including seven treatment groups (A–G) and a control group. Importantly, pretreatment with each compound (group B) significantly inhibited S-G614 pseudovirus infection. In the pseudovirus entry stage (group C), the compounds exerted similar suppressive effects. However, in the pseudovirus post-entry stage (group D), none of the compounds showed any inhibitory effect. Our data demonstrated that the nine selected compounds showed effective entry blockade presenting in the pretreatment stage, indicating that they target host factors at the entry stage.</p>
<p id="P21">Cell lines mimicking important aspects of respiratory epithelial cells should be used when analyzing the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Hence, we determined their EC<sub>50</sub> values against S-G614 pseudovirus in Calu-3 and A549 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S3a-i</xref>). Five compounds (SC9, SC161, SC171, SC182, and SC185) with EC<sub>50</sub> &lt; 10 μM in all three cells lines were selected for subsequent experiments.</p>
<p id="P22">To determine whether these compounds have broad-spectrum antiviral effects against coronaviruses, we constructed S-D614, N501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7), N501Y.V2 (B. 1.351), S-SARS, and S-MERS pseudoviruses using the same lentiviral system as S-G614, and then determined the EC<sub>50</sub> values of SC9 (cepharanthine, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), SC161 (hernandezine, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), SC171 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), SC182 (tetrandrine, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>), and SC185 (neferine, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>) against these pseudoviruses in 293T cells expressing ACE2 or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Interestingly, SC9, SC161, SC171, and SC185 exhibited highly potent pan-inhibitory activity against S-pseudotyped coronaviruses including two emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants N501Y.V1 and N501Y.V2, reported in United Kingdom and South Africa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S3j</xref>). As SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been reported to enter host cells via binding to ACE2, and while DPP4 is critical for MERS-CoV entry, it could be ruled out that the five compounds interfere with ACE2 to block pseudovirus entry.</p>
<p id="P23">Then, we used competitive ELISAs and thermal shift assays to determine whether these five compounds interact with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S protein of SARS-CoV-2. SBP1, a peptide derived from the ACE2 α1 helix, bound RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and exhibited a weak ability to inhibit the entry of S-G614 pseudovirus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4a</xref>), whereas the interaction between SC9, SC161, SC171, or SC185 and RBD was negligible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4c-d</xref>). Thus, the blockade of virus entry by these candidate compounds is not related to interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain.</p>
<p id="P24">Following attachment to host receptor, the membrane fusion process mediated by S protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in viral entry. Thus, we examined whether these compounds perturb cell fusion mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Compared to DMSO, SC9, SC161, SC182, and SC185 at 5 μM potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion of 293T cells with approximately 90% decrease of fusion rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4e</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) plays a critical role in SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV S-mediated fusion with host cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Calcium channel blockers (CCBs), originally used to treat cardiovascular diseases, are supposed to have a high potential to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> We noted that the identified bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids had been reported as CCBs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Herein, the bis-benzylisoquinoline CCBs abolished S–ACE2-mediated membrane fusion in 293T-ACE2 cells. Calcium-free medium or intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelation with BAPTA-AM significantly diminished SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4f-i</xref>), suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Upon pretreatment with BAPTA-AM, the bis-benzylisoquinoline CCBs had approximately 10-fold higher EC<sub>50</sub> values than those without BAPTA-AM pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j-k</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4j-k</xref>). Additionally, perturbation of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway with the CCB amlodipine reduced viral infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> Consistent herewith, the bis-benzylisoquinoline CCBs upregulated intracellular cholesterol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4i</xref>), which also likely contributes to inhibition of viral infection. These data indicated that blockade of S-G614 pseudovirus entry by bis-benzylisoquinoline CCBs mainly depends on calcium homeostasis.</p>
<p id="P25">Finally, the antiviral activities of SC9 (cepharanthine), SC161 (hernandezine), SC171, and SC185 (neferine) were confirmed in Vero E6 cells infected with native SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 induced cytopathogenic effect (CPE) and the viral RNA levels were partly inhibited by these compounds, with SC9 (cepharanthine) at the highest efficacy and the other three compounds much less active. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1l-m</xref>). The results showed that these compounds inhibited SARS-CoV-2 to varying degrees and may be useful as leads for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic drug development.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P26">In summary, we reported a set of bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids as coronavirus entry inhibitors. These inhibitors effectively protected different cell lines (293T, Calu-3, and A549) from infection by different coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 [S-D614 and S-G614 variant]) <italic>in vitro</italic>. The compounds block host calcium channels, thus inhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated fusion and suppressing virus entry. Considering the effectiveness of CCBs in the control of hypertension, our study provided clues to support that CCBs may be useful in treating coronavirus infection in patients with hypertension.</p>
