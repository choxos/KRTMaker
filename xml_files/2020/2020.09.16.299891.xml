<abstract>
<p id="P1">The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor via receptor binding domain (RBD) to enter into the cell and inhibiting this interaction is a main approach to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. We engineered ACE2 to enhance the affinity with directed evolution in 293T cells. Three cycles of random mutation and cell sorting achieved 100-fold higher affinity to RBD than wild-type ACE2. The extracellular domain of modified ACE2 fused to the human IgG1-Fc region had stable structure and neutralized SARS-CoV-2 without the emergence of mutational escape. Therapeutic administration protected hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection, decreasing lung virus titers and pathology. Engineering ACE2 decoy receptors with human cell-based directed evolution is a promising approach to develop a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing drug that has affinity comparable to monoclonal antibodies yet displaying resistance to escape mutations of virus.</p>

<p id="P2">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread across the world as a tremendous pandemic and presented an unprecedented challenge to human society. The causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-strand RNA virus that belongs to lineage B, clade 1 of the betacoronavirus genus(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The virus binds to host cells through its trimeric spike glycoprotein composed of two subunits; S1 is responsible for receptor binding and S2 for membrane fusion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is lineage B clade 1 specific receptor including SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1 subunit directly binds ACE2, therefore, it is the most important targeting site to inhibit viral infection. In fact, the RBD is the common binding site of effective neutralizing antibodies identified from convalescent patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p>
<p id="P3">RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 have high mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), which are correlated with high evolvability including the acquisition of anti-viral drug resistance. Accumulating evidence demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies isolated from convalescent COVID-19 patients have high potency in neutralizing viruses. However, mutations in the spike gene can lead to the SARS-CoV-2 adaptation to such neutralizing antibodies. In the replicating SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus culture experiment, escape mutation was observed against monoclonal antibody as early as in the first passage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) and virus evasion was seen even against the polyclonal convalescent plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Notably, some mutations identified in <italic>in vitro</italic> replicating culture experiment are present in natural population according to the database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), indicating that selection and expansion of escape mutants can occur naturally not only in the therapeutic use of monoclonal antibodies, but in the vaccination that was recently approved to use in the mRNA vaccine platform.</p>
<p id="P4">Similar to anti-RBD antibodies, extracellular domain of ACE2, soluble ACE2 (sACE2), can also be used to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 as a decoy receptor. The therapeutic potency was confirmed using human organoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), and now Apeiron Biologics conducts European phase II clinical trial of recombinant sACE2 against COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In addition, fusing sACE2 to the Fc region of the human IgG1 has been shown to enhance neutralization capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics to the level of IgG in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Most importantly, sACE2 has a great advantage over antibodies due to the resistance to the escape mutation. The virus with escape mutation from sACE2 should have limited binding affinity to cell surface native ACE2 receptors, leading to a diminished or eliminated virulence. Unfortunately, many reports, including our current study, have revealed that the binding affinity of wild-type (WT) sACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD is much weaker (K<sub>D</sub> ∼20 nM) than that of clinical grade antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Thus, the therapeutic potential of the WT sACE2 as a neutralizing agent against SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain.</p>
<p id="P5">Here we conducted human cell-based directed evolution to improve the binding affinity of ACE2 to the spike RBD with the combination of surface display of mutagenized library and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Among various host cells, the budding yeast is popular in directed evolution due to the efficient surface display and greater molecular diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). However, posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation are substantially different between yeast and mammalian cells, which could alter the protein activity including binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). In consideration of future drug development in mammalian cells, we developed the screening system based on 293T cells. The protease domain (PD) of ACE2 is known to harbor the interface to viral spike protein, located in the top-middle part of ACE2 ectodomain. In this study, ACE2 residues 18-102 and 272-409, referred to as PD1 and PD2, respectively, were mutagenized independently. Synthetic signal sequence and HA tag were appended and restriction sites were introduced in both sides of PD1 and PD2 by optimizing codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We used error-prone PCR to mutagenize the protease domain of ACE2 with an average of about one amino acid mutation per 100 bp, then inserted the fragment into the introduced restriction site. The reaction sample was transformed to competent cell, generating a library of ∼10<sup>5</sup> mutants. Mutant plasmid library was packaged into lentivirus, followed by expression in human 293T cells in less than 0.3 MOI (multiplicity of infection) to yield no more than one mutant ACE2 per cell. Cells were incubated with recombinant RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein fused to superfolder GFP (sfGFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We confirmed the level of bound RBD-sfGFP and surface expression levels of HA-tagged ACE2 with Alexa Fluor 647 in two-dimensional display of flow cytometry. Top 0.05 % cells showing higher binding relative to expression level were harvested from ∼5 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells by FACS. To exclude the structurally unstable mutants, cells with preserved signal of surface ACE2 were gated. Genomic DNA was extracted from collected cells and mutagenized again to proceed to the next cycle of screening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">Random mutagenesis screening for PD1 was performed 3 times and mutated sequences from top 0.05% population were reconstructed into the backbone plasmid, and expressed in 293T cells individually. The binding capacity to the RBD-sfGFP was verified in 100-300 clones. As the selection cycle advances, the two-dimensional distribution of library cells in flow cytometry became broader and higher in RBD-binding signal, and individual clone validation identified several mutants with higher binding capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D</xref>). To evaluate the neutralization activity in the form of sACE2, we first generated fusion protein of the soluble extracellular domain of mutagenized ACE2 residues 18-614 and sfGFP (sACE2-sfGFP) and used them to compete with the cell-surface WT ACE2 for the RBD binding. To this end, the concentration of each mutant sACE2-sfGFP in the cultured medium from transfected cells was quantitatively standardized with sfGFP signal, serially diluted, preincubated with RBD-sfGFP for 30 min, and then transferred to WT ACE2 expressing 293T cells. After 30 min, the RBD-bound cells were analyzed in flow cytometry. Higher neutralization activity against the RBD was confirmed according to the accumulation of mutagenesis cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">Second mutagenesis based on the top hit of the first screening, 1-19 mutant, was also performed, but the distribution of the library cells expanded little, and we could not isolate clones showing higher binding signals than the bulk of top 0.05% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1</xref>). We next performed PD2 mutagenesis in both the bulk of top 0.05% and one of the highest mutants of the 3<sup>rd</sup> library, the clone 3N39. Again, the binding distribution of the PD2 library cells was similar to the basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D</xref>), suggesting the inability of this strategy to obtain clones with higher binding activity to RBD. A recent study reported, via deep mutational scanning, that several specific mutations in PD2 were enriched in high RBD-binding clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Even when we applied these mutations in 3N39, it failed to further improve the capacity of the RBD neutralization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2</xref>). In the end, we identified 3 highest neutralizing mutants, 3N39, 3J113 and 3J320 in the top population from 3rd library. To identify essential mutations, each mutation was altered to WT in these 3 mutants individually or in combination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figs. S3</xref>). Mutants composed of essential mutations were referred to as v2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) and we characterized their binding affinities by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The K<sub>D</sub> value of WT sACE2 was 17.63 nM, whereas those of mutants were determined to be from 0.29 nM to 3.98 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), confirming that the increased RBD-binding activity of these mutants were in fact due to the increased binding affinity up to ∼100-fold. The SPR sensorgrams indicates that high affinity mutants all have very slow off-rate compared to the WT ACE2. It is commonly believed that ACE2 binding can occur when RBD is in a “up” conformation in the spike trimer, and most of the cryo-EM images of the ACE2-spike complex have only one ACE2 bound per spike trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). In fact, a mass photometry analysis of WT ACE2-spike trimer complex reveals that it exists as the mixture of complexes with varying ratios, with 1:1 complex as the major species. In sharp contrast, spike trimer incubated with either 3N39 or 3N39v2 mutants behaved predominantly as 3:1 stoichiometric complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S4</xref>), indicating that the mutants can saturate all three RBDs on the spike trimer due to their slow dissociation.</p>
<p id="P8">Having a few high affinity ACE2 mutants in hand, we next decided to assess their potentials as anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic agents. First, we confirmed that none of the mutants were structurally unstable compared with WT ACE2 by measuring the Tm values in a thermal denaturation experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S5</xref>). In fact, mutants 3J113v2 and 3J320v2 showed Tm values higher than the WT. Next we formulated our high affinity mutant sACE2s as human IgG1 Fc fusion (ACE2-Fc), as recombinant soluble ACE2 (rsACE2) monomer was reported to have a fast clearance rate in human blood with a half-life of hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). We then evaluated their efficacy in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infections. First, we confirmed that mutant ACE2-Fcs directly inhibited the binding of full-length spike trimer to cell-surface ACE2 with more than 100-fold increase in the blocking efficacy from the WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S6</xref>). Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay in ACE2-expressing 293T cells exhibited that IC<sub>50</sub> values of WT, 3N39, 3N39v2, 3J113v2 and 3J320v2 were 24.8, 0.056, 0.082, 0.33 and 0.068 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, left). All mutants except for 3J113v2 were also capable of strongly inhibiting the infection of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-1, another ACE2-dependent coronavirus, indicating wide-range of therapeutic potential of 3N39v2 and 3J320v2 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, right). When the neutralization potential against the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in TMPRSS2-expressing VeroE6 cells was evaluated, each mutant ACE2-Fc demonstrated significant neutralizing effect even in 100-fold lower concentration than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">In order to know the structural basis for the affinity enhancement, we next determined the structure of the highest affinity ACE2 mutant, 3N39, in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The crystal structure of the complex was solved at 3.2-Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Two 3N39-RBD complexes are contained in the asymmetric unit and they are structurally indistinguishable with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) value of 0.176 Å for 672 Cα atoms. The crystal structure confirms that 3N39 binds to RBD using the same interface as WT ACE2 reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Among the 7 mutated residues in 3N39, the side chains of E26, I64, and H90 are exposed to solvent and not involved in either inter- or intra-molecular interactions, corroborating their nonessential nature in the affinity enhancement. In contrast, mutation sites K31N and E35K are located at the center of the binding interface. In the WT structure, E35 forms an intramolecular salt bridge with the K31 in the preceding helical turn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, right), making it less favorable for forming direct intermolecular hydrogen bonding with Q493 in the RBD. This salt bridge is lost by the simultaneous mutations of K31N and E35K in 3N39, and K35 now forms a direct inter-molecular hydrogen bond exclusively with Q493 of RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, left). This results in small but significant ∼1 Å approach of the α1 helix of ACE2 toward RBD, likely contributing to the affinity enhancement of the mutant. As for L79F and A25V, both mutations are conservative in nature but accompany acquisition of larger sidechains. In WT ACE2, L79 forms a small hydrophobic pocket with Y83 and M82 that accommodates F486 of RBD, which has been suggested to be a key determinant of SARS-CoV-2 that gives higher affinity than SARS-CoV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3C</xref>, right) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). This hydrophobic contact became even more extensive due to the L79F mutation in 3N39. In addition, A25V mutation fills a space at the back of the pocket together with L97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3C</xref>, left). It is thus assumed that these mutations collectively lead to the 100-fold increase in the overall affinity, which is equivalent to 2.76 kcal/mol.</p>
<p id="P10">In the crystal structure, 3N39 adopts a “closed” conformation where the enzymatic active site is completely inaccessible due to the closure of the substrate binding groove (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7A</xref>, left). This is very different from the “open” structures of WT ACE2 found in both RBD-bound (e.g., 6m0j) and unbound (e.g., 1r42) states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7A</xref>, right). Interestingly, the same closed structure was reported with WT ACE2 bound by an inhibitor MLN-4760 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7B</xref>, center)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). In fact, superposition of the two structures at the protease domain resulted in a surprisingly low RMSD value of 0.471 Å for 540 Cα atoms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7B</xref>). In the 3N39 ACE2 structure, the active site Zn is intact but there was no density corresponding to any substrate-like compounds in the pocket except for a sulfate ion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7C</xref>). This observation made us to wonder if the closed conformation of the 3N39 mutant contributed to its increased RBD binding ability, although the active site groove was far away from the RBD-binding interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7A</xref>). In order to test this idea, we designed an ACE2 mutant that is fixed in the closed conformation by introducing S128C/V343C double mutations in WT ACE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7D</xref>). Successful formation of the designed disulfide bond was inferred by an upward band shift of the mutant in a non-reducing SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7E</xref>), as well as its complete loss of ACE2 activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7F</xref>). When this mutant was evaluated for its RBD-binding neutralization activity, it showed identical dose response curve with the WT ACE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7G</xref>), indicating that the closed conformation <italic>per se</italic> is not responsible for the enhanced affinity. However, this observation gives us an important lesson that the inhibitor-blocked ACE2 in the closed conformation can still engage SARS-CoV-2 RBD, suggesting that caution must be taken when considering the possibility of using ACE2 inhibitors as the therapeutics against coronavirus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">There is a general concern in antiviral therapies that pathogenic virus could acquire drug resistance due to the frequent mutation. Actually, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 escape mutation arose rapidly during the culture with a neutralizing antibody(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, 10). We evaluated the occurrence of escape mutation using authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. At the first passage, 0.1 MOI virus was added to the culture in the presence of serially diluted mutant ACE2-Fc or recombinant monoclonal antibody (clone H4) isolated from a convalescent patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), and a total of 3 x 10<sup>5</sup> copies of amplified virus from partially neutralized well was transferred to the next passage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Consistent with previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), the virus pool after the treatment with single antibody became insensitive to the highest concentration of the same antibody at the fourth passage, suggesting the acquisition of the antibody resistance. In contrast, the neutralizing capacity of the mutant ACE2-Fcs remained very high against the passaged virus pool, indicating the lack of emergence of escape mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">Among three v2 mutant ACE2-Fcs showing similar neutralizing capacity and structural stability, we selected 3N39v2-Fc based on its high expression efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S8</xref>) to be used in the evaluation of therapeutic potential in hamster model of COVID-19 characterized by rapid weight loss and severe lung pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Since pharmacokinetic analysis of ACE2-Fc exhibited short half-life despite the effective distribution to lung tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figs. S9</xref>), 3N39v2-Fc or control-Fc were intraperitoneally administered 2 h after intranasal 1.0x10<sup>6</sup> plaque forming units (PFU) virus challenge as a therapeutic application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Hamsters that received control-Fc lost 4.3% of body weight, whereas those treated with 3N39v2-Fc gained 7.3% similarly to the unchallenged control 5 days post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). In micro-CT before necropsy, the control group showed multi-lobular ground glass opacity mainly in the cranial portion, conversely, lung abnormalities were limited in the treated one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">movies S1-S3</xref>). The content of SARS-CoV-2 in lungs was evaluated as functional virus particle and genome RNA copy number and the both were significantly decreased in the treatment with 3N39v2-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). We also performed histopathological analyses of infected hamsters. The control hamsters showed severe interstitial pneumonia characterized by widespread infiltration of inflammatory cells, alveolar septal thickening, and alveolar hemorrhage, whereas 3N39v2-Fc treatment obviously reduced lung pathologies and viral antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5E and F</xref>). Consistent with these results, the expression of inflammatory or chemotactic cytokines was attenuated in the treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">In addition to the decoy receptor, ACE2-Fc might have a protective effect on acute lung injury through proteolysis of angiotensin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, 29), but could have off-target vasodilation effect in the high-dose administration. Our ACE2 mutants exhibited similar catalytic activity with WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S10</xref>) and the closed-type mutation in the binding pocket of ACE2 exhibited no enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7F</xref>) and intact neutralizing activity in both WT and 3N39v2 background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7G</xref>). Whether catalytic function should be active or deleted remains to be investigated.</p>
<p id="P14">High affinity modified ACE2 fused with Fc is the promising strategy to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. The time frame for running one cycle of mutagenesis and sorting was just one week in our system, and we succeeded in developing optimized mutants in a couple of months independently of patients-derived cells or tissues. Thus, our system can rapidly generate therapeutic candidates against various viral diseases and may be well suited for fighting against future viral pandemics.</p>

<title>Directed evolution to generate high affinity ACE2 in 293T cells.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Full length ACE2 was optimized to fit screening. Synthetic signal sequence and HA tag were fused to mature ACE2 and restriction sites were introduced by optimizing codon optimization for the mutated fragment replacement. (<bold>B</bold>) ACE2 mutant library was expressed in 293T cells and incubated with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 fused to superfolder GFP (sfGFP). (<bold>C</bold>) Error-prone PCR amplification of ACE2 protease domain induced random mutations. Mutant library-transduced cells were incubated with the RBD-sfGFP. Top 0.05 % population with high level of bound RBD-sfGFP was sorted and underwent DNA extraction, followed by next cycle mutagenesis. (<bold>D</bold>) PD1 mutagenesis and high affinity selection were performed 3 times and followed by PD2 random mutation. Top 0.05% population were harvested and reconstructed into the backbone plasmid to be verified individually. (<bold>E</bold>) Neutralization activity against the RBD was evaluated with sACE2-sfGFP and the RBD-sfGFP. Serial dilution of sACE2-sfGFP was analyzed with the 50-fold diluted RBD-sfGFP in flow cytometry. The experiments were independently performed twice and similar results were obtained. One representative data were shown.</p>

<title>No emergence of escape mutation under the treatment of modified ACE2-Fc.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Protocol of generating escape mutation in SARS-CoV-2. At first, 0.1 MOI of SARS-CoV-2 was cultured in Vero6E/TMPRSS2 cells with indicated concentration of ACE2-Fc or H4 antibody, then a total of 3 x 10<sup>5</sup> copies of virus in partially neutralized well was passed in the presence of ACE2-Fc or H4 antibody dilution. Supernatants were collected from each well and analyzed virus RNA copy number by quantitative PCR. (<bold>B</bold>) The copy number of SARS-CoV-2 genome RNA in cultured medium was analyzed in each passage. The virus from indicated well (arrow head) was passed and escape mutant expansion was observed only in H4 antibody at passage 4. The test for 3J113v2 was discontinued due to no growth of virus at passage 2.</p>
