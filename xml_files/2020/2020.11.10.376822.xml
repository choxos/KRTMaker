<abstract>
<p id="P1">The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented global health crisis. Here, we report the identification of a synthetic nanobody (sybody) pair (Sb#15 and Sb#68) that can bind simultaneously to the SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD and efficiently neutralize pseudotyped and live-viruses by interfering with ACE2 interaction. Two spatially-discrete epitopes identified by cryo-EM translated into the rational design of bispecific and tri-bispecific fusions constructs, exhibiting up to 100- and 1000-fold increase in neutralization potency. Cryo-EM of the sybody-spike complex further revealed a novel <italic>up-out</italic> RBD conformation. While resistant viruses emerged rapidly in the presence of single binders, no escape variants were observed in presence of the bispecific sybody. The multivalent bispecific constructs further increased the neutralization potency against globally-circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Our study illustrates the power of multivalency and biparatopic nanobody fusions for the development of clinically relevant therapeutic strategies that mitigate the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 escape mutants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The spike glycoprotein (S-protein) is the most prominent surface-exposed entity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and possesses the vital molecular machinery required for recognition and fusion with host membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. To date, most authorized vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rely on exposure of patients solely to the S-protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Similarly, the S-protein is the exclusive target of currently approved monoclonal antibody therapies for COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Unfortunately, recent months have seen the emergence and rapid spread of mutant viral strains conferring amino acid changes in the S-protein which can attenuate neutralization by many convalescent, vaccine-induced, and monoclonal antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Therefore, from a public health perspective, it is imperative to pursue the development of therapeutic strategies that can withstand the continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 escape mutants.</p>
<p id="P3">The S-protein mutations that cause increased virulence and immune evasion are predominantly found in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], which is specifically responsible for host recognition via interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. The RBD harbors two hotspots for antibody recognition. One of these epitopes overlaps with the ACE2 binding interface and is evolutionarily unique in SARS-CoV-2; the second so-called “cryptic” epitope is found in a peripheral region that is conserved among RBDs from several characterized coronaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. While individually targeting either epitope with antibodies quickly results in the emergence of escape mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], there is growing evidence that simultaneous engagement of both epitopes via polyvalent antibodies may mitigate viral escape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p>
<p id="P4">Here, we present two synthetic single-domain antibodies (sybodies), designated Sb#15 and Sb#68, that recognize non-overlapping epitopes on the RBD. Sybodies offer several advantages over conventional antibodies such as the potential for rapid development, low-cost production in prokaryotic expression systems, and facile engineering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that Sb#15 binds within the ACE2 interface, whereas Sb#68 engages the adjacent conserved cryptic epitope. Structural analysis also demonstrated that the dual presence of Sb#15 and Sb#68 resulted in the adoption of a novel RBD conformation that we termed <italic>up/out</italic>. Fusion of Sb#15 and Sb#68 yielded a bispecific construct, termed GS4, that displayed enhanced avidity and neutralization potency relative to the separate sybodies. Exposure of SARS-CoV-2 to the individual sybodies <italic>in vitro</italic> resulted in the rapid emergence of escape mutants, including a Q493R-RBD variant (within the ACE2 epitope) that has recently been observed in COVID-19 patients treated with a monoclonal antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], as well as a novel P384H-RBD mutation in the cryptic epitope. In contrast, no escape mutants were detected upon treatment with GS4. Finally, we found that additional valency engineering via covalent trimerization of GS4, giving a construct we termed Tripod-GS4r, results in further enhancement of viral neutralization potential against the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.351 (beta) SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Overall, our study demonstrates favorable prospects for such multivalent sybodies to be a valuable therapeutic tool vis-à-vis future SARS-CoV-2 variants or comparable forthcoming viral pandemics.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Identification of a sybody pair that (i) simultaneously bind to the spike RBD, (ii) compete with ACE2 interaction and (iii) efficiently neutralize viruses</title>
<p id="P5">We sought to engineer a pair of synthetic nanobodies (sybodies) which may mitigate viral escape due to the simultaneous binding of discrete non-overlapping epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein. Using our established sybody generation workflow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], we conducted a selection campaign against the isolated receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein. Upon screening single sybody clones with ELISA and grating-coupled interferometry (GCI), we identified six sybodies exhibiting affinities against the RBD ranging from 24 – 178 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). In this study, we focus on sybodies Sb#15 and Sb#68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), that can simultaneously bind the immobilized S-protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) and exhibit affinities of 12 nM and 9 nM, respectively, when probing against the entire spike protein stabilized by two prolines (S-2P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">To investigate whether Sb#15 and/or Sb#68 could block the interaction between the S-protein and ACE2, we performed an ACE2 competition experiment using GCI. To this end, S-protein was coated on a GCI chip and Sb#15 (200 nM), Sb#68 (200 nM) as well as a non-randomized convex sybody control (Sb#0, 200 nM) were injected alone or together with ACE2 (100 nM) to monitor binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Indeed, Sb#0 did not bind when injected alone and consequently did not disturb ACE2 binding when co-injected. Conversely, both Sb#15 and Sb#68 were found to dominate over ACE2 in the association phase during co-injection, and the resulting curves are highly similar to what was observed when these two sybodies were injected alone. This experiment demonstrated that Sb#15 and Sb#68 compete with ACE2 for access to its binding site on the S-protein.</p>
<p id="P7">Having established that Sb#15 and Sb#68 could bind the S-protein and block ACE2 association in vitro, we next asked whether these sybodies (and the other four high affinity sybodies analyzed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) could inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 fusogenic machinery in viral neutralization assays. With the exception of Sb#42 and Sb#45, all sybodies neutralized vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV) that were pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 S-protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 2.8 µg/ml (178 nM) and 2.3 µg/ml (138 nM), for Sb#15 and Sb#68, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Since Sb#15 and Sb#68 can bind simultaneously to full-length spike protein, we mixed Sb#15 and Sb#68 together to investigate potential additive or synergistic neutralizing activity of these two independent sybodies. Indeed, consistent with the binding assays, the simultaneous presence of both sybodies resulted in improved neutralization profiles with IC<sub>50</sub> values reaching 1.7 µg/ml (53 nM). In addition to the individual sybodies, we also explored potential avidity effects of sybodies genetically fused to human IgG1 Fc domains. The respective homodimeric sybody-Fc constructs exhibited VSV pseudotype IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.2 µg/ml (15.5 nM) and 3.9 µg/ml (49.6 nM) for Sb#15 and Sb#68, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This improvement in VSV neutralization potency suggests that the bivalent arrangement of the Fc fusion constructs resulted in a discernible avidity effect. For neutralization of live SARS-CoV-2 we employed a plaque reduction assay and confirmed that both sybodies successfully inhibited cell entry by active SARS-CoV-2, with ND<sub>50</sub> values of 37.4 µg/ml (2380 nM) for Sb#15 and 34.6 µg/ml (2070 nM) for Sb#68, but no neutralization by the other four sybodies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The approximately 10-fold discrepancy in neutralization efficacies measured using either live SARS-CoV-2 virus or pseudotyped VSV may reflect slight differences in viral physiology (variation of incorporated spikes per viral particle) or could owe to the different assay methods (luciferase emission versus plaque reduction determination). Collectively, these data highlight the successful discovery of a pair of sybodies (Sb#15 and Sb#68) that bind simultaneously to the spike RBD, compete with ACE2 interaction, and neutralize viral infection in vitro.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Structural basis of Sb#15 and Sb#68 neutralizing activity</title>
<p id="P8">To gain structural insights into how Sb#15 and Sb#68 recognize the RBD and neutralize viruses, we performed single particle cryo-EM analysis of purified sybody-spike protein complexes. Three cryo-EM datasets were collected, allowing a glimpse of the spike protein either simultaneously bound to both sybodies, or associated to Sb#15 or Sb#68 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2-7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). The highest resolution was obtained for the spike protein in complex with both sybodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>), whereas structures with the individual sybodies were determined based on fewer particles and mainly served to unambiguously assign the binding epitopes of Sb#15 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>) and Sb#68 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). Analysis of the spike/Sb#15/Sb#68 particles after 3D classification revealed that the spike protein adopts two distinct conformations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). The first conformation (30% of particles) has a three-fold symmetry, with three RBDs in the <italic>up</italic> conformation (<italic>3up</italic>) and two sybodies bound to each of the RBDs, confirming that Sb#15 and Sb#68 bind simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">Although the global resolution of the spike protein in complex with both sybodies is around 3 Å, the local resolution of the RBDs with bound sybodies was only in the range of 6-7 Å, presumably due to conformational flexibility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Therefore, we did not build a full model for Sb#15, but instead fitted a homology model into the density. In contrast, a crystal structure of Sb#68 in complex with the RBD had recently been determined at a resolution of 2.6 Å (PDB: 7KLW) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], and therefore we used this high resolution structure of Sb#68 to fit it into the cryo-EM density.</p>
<p id="P10">Sb#15 binds to the top of the RBD. Its binding epitope roughly consists of two regions (residues 444-448 and 491-507) and thereby strongly overlaps with the ACE2 binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). In contrast, Sb#68 binds to the side of the RBD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7D-E</xref>) and recognizes a conserved “cryptic” epitope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] clearly distinct from the ACE2 interaction site, which includes residues 369-385 and R408 and is buried if the RBD is in its <italic>down</italic> conformation. Although the binding epitope of Sb#68 is clearly distinct from the one of ACE2, there would be a steric clash between the Sb#68 backside loops and ACE2, if ACE2 docks to the RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This accounts for Sb#68’s ability to compete with ACE2 as evident from GCI analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">The second resolved conformation (20 % of particles) of the spike/Sb#15/Sb#68 complex is asymmetric, with the RBDs in three distinct states, and was obtained at a global resolution of 3.3 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5B</xref>). In this conformational state, each RBD was bound to Sb#15, whereas only two RBDs were associated with Sb#68-attributable cryo-EM density. One RBD was in the <italic>up</italic> conformation, having Sb#15 and Sb#68 bound in an analogous fashion as in the symmetric 3<italic>up</italic> structure. The orientation of this <italic>up</italic>-RBD closely superimposes with a variety of other reported cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). However, interestingly, a second RBD adopted a unique positioning that we term <italic>up-out</italic>. To our knowledge, this conformation has not been observed in prior S-protein structures, and therefore represents a novel RBD orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D and E</xref>). Notably, the density for Sb#68 was comparatively weak, indicating either high flexibility or a sub-stoichiometric occupancy. The novel <italic>up-out</italic> conformation appears to be caused by steric influences from the third RBD, which, in a <italic>down</italic> state and singularly bound to Sb#15, acts as a wedge that pushes the second RBD away from the three-fold symmetry axis and into its distinctive orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">Virtually the same asymmetric <italic>1up/1up-out/1down</italic> spike conformation was observed for the spike/Sb#15 complex, reinforcing our interpretation that wedging by Sb#15 is responsible for the outward movement of the second up-RBD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). However, according to our analysis, comprising only a limited number of images (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D</xref>), Sb#15 alone was unable to induce the <italic>3up</italic> conformation, suggesting that adoption of the <italic>3up</italic> state requires the synergistic action of both sybodies to populate this symmetric conformation.</p>
<p id="P13">Finally, analysis of the spike/Sb#68 complex dataset revealed two distinct populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7</xref>). The most abundant class showed an <italic>1up/2dow</italic>n conformation without sybody bound, which is identical to the one obtained for the spike protein alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. The second structure featured two RBDs in an <italic>up</italic> conformation with bound Sb#68. Density for the third RBD was very weak, presumably due to high intrinsic flexibility, hindering the interpretation of its exact position and conformation. We therefore refer to this conformation as an <italic>2up/1flexible</italic> state. Structural comparisons revealed that Sb#68 cannot access its epitope in the context of the <italic>1up2dow</italic>n conformation, due to steric clashes with the neighboring RBD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7B</xref>). In order to bind, at least two RBDs need to be in the <italic>up</italic> conformation.</p>

<title>Suppression of emergence of drug-resistant viruses by design of a biparatopic fusion construct</title>
<p id="P14">Biochemical and structural data provided evidence that fusing both sybodies may boost viral neutralization. To this end, Sb#15 and Sb#68 were genetically fused via a flexible (GGGGS)<sub>4</sub> linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The resulting purified bispecific Sb#15-(GGGGS)<sub>4</sub>-Sb#68 construct, designated as GS4, displayed a ≥40-fold increase in binding affinity for the S-protein (apparent Kd ≈ 0.3 nM), relative to either Sb#15 or Sb#68 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Strikingly, the neutralization potency of GS4 was increased by ≥100-fold over the individual binders, for both pseudotyped VSV (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.02 µg/ml; 0.7 nM) as well as for live SARS-CoV-2 (ND<sub>50</sub> = 0.79 µg/ml; 25.9 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), which suggest a highly synergistic inhibition mechanism mediated by the fusion molecule.</p>
<p id="P15">We next asked whether simultaneous targeting of two spatially-distinct epitopes within the RBD would provide any advantages towards mitigating the development of escape mutants. By employing a replication-competent VSV<sup>GFP</sup>-SARS-CoV-2-S chimera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] and a reported strategy to generate viral escape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], we observed no resistant viruses in GS4-treated cells, whereas escape mutants emerged rapidly in the singular presence of either Sb#15 or Sb#68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Among the identified mutations from Sb#15- or Sb#68-treated cells, two were selected (Q493R for Sb#15 and P384H for Sb#68) and introduced into isolated RBDs (for binding kinetics measurements) and full-length S-protein (for neutralization determination). Indeed, our cryo-EM structures as well as a recently determined crystal structure of the RBD/Sb#68 complex were suggestive for a critical impact of both mutations on the respective epitope/paratope interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Sb#15 and Sb#68 exhibited reduced binding with RBD-Q493R and RBD-P384H, respectively, although this attenuation was considerably more pronounced in case of the Sb#15/RBD-Q493R interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). This correlated with the severely reduced neutralization efficacy by Sb#15 or Sb#68 against VSV expressing the corresponding adapted S-protein escape variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). A previous study revealed that both mutations were neither significantly affecting ACE2 binding nor the overall expression profile, as revealed by a deep mutational scanning approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Finally, the bispecific fusion construct GS4 showed favorable binding kinetics and neutralization profiles in the presence of either individual mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B-C</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that simultaneously targeting multiple epitopes effectively mitigates evolutionary viral adaptation.</p>

<title>Activity of sybodies and multivalent fusion constructs against globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern</title>
<p id="P16">We next investigated the efficacy of Sb#15, Sb#68 and the GS4 fusion construct against spike proteins harboring key mutations of the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.351 (beta) SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. With regard to the RBD, S-alpha carries the N501Y substitution, whereas S-beta harbors the combination of K417N, E484K and N501Y mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">Consistent with the three mutations mapping at, or close to, the RBD/Sb#15 interface (K417N, E484K and N501Y), Sb#15 interacted with all single-mutation variants with reduced affinity, which was most pronounced for RBD-K417N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Compared to the individual mutations, the combined K417N/E484K/N501Y (KEN) triple mutant displayed a qualitatively additive effect with regards to reduced binding signal with Sb#15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). These binding kinetic phenotypes correlated with reduced neutralization efficacies for Sb#15 in pseudotyped VSV experiments with S-protein mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). In sharp contrast, Sb#68, which binds to the peripheral “cryptic epitope” of the RBD distant from the investigated KEN mutations, preserved proper binding kinetics and neutralization profiles against all spike variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Likely owing to this resilience of Sb#68 against the K417N/E484K/N501Y mutations, the binding affinities and neutralizing IC<sub>50</sub> values of the bispecific GS4 molecule remained very favorable against these individual mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). However, concerning the combined triple KEN mutant, although no significant impairment in the binding kinetics was recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>), the neutralizing IC<sub>50</sub> values revealed that the bispecific construct GS4 was less potent than Sb#68 alone (about 400 nM versus 100 nM, respectively, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). This suggests that, in the context of the KEN mutant, other potential factors that differ between purified spike protein and membrane-anchored spike protein in the context of VSVs influenced the overall neutralization profile of GS4.</p>
<p id="P18">We finally determined whether engineering additional layers of multivalency into the bispecific GS4 molecule would provide further advantages in neutralization profiles. To this aim, we grafted trimerization motifs (foldon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], GCNt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] and a covalently linked trimeric peptide) to the C-terminal region of Sb#15 via a flexible (GGGGS)<sub>4</sub> linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, see Materials and Methods for more details). Furthermore, the N-terminal domain of Sb#15 was fused to the C-terminal region of Sb#68 via a second (GGGGS)<sub>4</sub> linker. Of note, the position of both sybodies were reversed as compared to their orientation in GS4; this was based on the observed binding orientation of the sybodies in the context of our cryo-EM structures. This covalently-trimerized construct, termed Tripod-GS4r, was confirmed to undergo covalent multimerization that was reversible in reducing conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>). Neutralization assays were conducted with VSV pseudotyped with wildtype spike or the spike protein harboring key mutations of the alpha or beta SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Remarkably, the recorded neutralizing IC<sub>50</sub> values for tripod-GS4r were in the low picomolar range against viruses carrying all investigated spike mutations, including the triple KEN mutant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Importantly, confirming specificity and lack of cytotoxicity, Tripod-GS4r did not neutralize control viruses pseudotyped with the non-cognate VSV-G spike glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P19">Since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, multiple viral variants of concern have emerged, which threaten the progress made at the vaccination front [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Therefore, mitigation strategies that take into account the rapid evolution of the virus are urgently needed. Targeting multiple epitopes on the spike protein with large molecules can efficiently prevent viral escape, a strategy that was chosen by the pharmaceutical company Regeneron in bringing antibody cocktails on the market to treat COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Nanobodies offer key advantages over conventional antibodies, in particular the ease of multimerization, inexpensive production and high protein stability. The latter simplifies logistics and facilitates development in an inhalable formulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], thereby not only enabling direct delivery to nasal and lung tissues (two key sites of SARS-CoV-2 replication), but also offering the potential of self-administration.</p>
<p id="P20">Our study focused on a pair of sybodies, Sb#15 and Sb#68, which recognize two non-overlapping epitopes on the RBD. Both sybodies were found to compete with ACE2 binding. While the binding epitope of Sb#15 directly overlaps with the one of ACE2, this is not the case for Sb#68, which interferes with ACE2 through a steric clash at the sybody backside. Sb#15 and Sb#68 exhibited similar neutralization efficiencies, as well as a moderate synergistic effect in the virus neutralization test when both individual sybodies were mixed together. This synergy may be explained by the concerted action of the sybodies to compete with ACE2 docking via epitope blockage and steric clashing.</p>
<p id="P21">Cryo-EM analyses confirmed distinct binding epitopes for the two sybodies Sb#15 and Sb#68. Without sybodies, the spike protein predominantly assumes an equilibrium between the <italic>3down</italic> and the <italic>1up2down</italic> conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Upon addition of Sb#15, the conformational equilibrium was shifted towards an asymmetric <italic>1up/1up-out/1down</italic> state, whereas addition of Sb#68 favored an asymmetric state with RBDs adopting a <italic>2up/1flexible</italic> conformation. When added together, the sybodies synergized to stabilize two states: a predominant <italic>3up</italic> state, as well as the asymmetric <italic>1up/1up-out/1down</italic> state, thereby shifting the conformational equilibrium of the spike towards RBD conformations competent for ACE2 binding. These structural findings are reminiscent of a recent study, in which a pair of nanobodies isolated from immune libraries (VHH E and VHH V) was found to bind to similar epitopes as Sb#15 and Sb#68 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. However, in contrast to Sb#15 stabilizing the asymmetric <italic>1up/1up-out/1down</italic> state when added alone, the corresponding VHH E nanobody is exclusively bound to, and thereby stabilizes, the <italic>3up</italic> conformation. Hence, what is unique for our Sb#15/Sb#68 pair is its concerted action to shift the conformational equilibrium of the spike towards the <italic>3up</italic> state and its capability to trap the spike protein in an unusual <italic>1up/1up-out/1down</italic> conformation, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously described.</p>
<p id="P22">Akin to the antibodies CR3022 and EY6A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] as well as a growing number of nanobodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], the Sb#15/Sb#68 pair stabilized spike conformations with <italic>2up</italic> or <italic>3up</italic> RBDs. Thereby, the spike protein may be destabilized, resulting in the premature and unproductive transitions to the irreversible post-fusion state. This mechanism was dubbed “receptor mimicry” in a study on a neutralizing antibody S230, which only bound to up-RBDs and thereby triggered fusogenic conformational changes of SARS-CoV-1 spike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. In elegant experiments, König et al. could demonstrate that stabilization of the spike protein in its <italic>3up</italic> conformation by the addition of nanobodies VHH E and V indeed resulted in aberrant activation of the spike fusion machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Hence, it is plausible to assume that our sybody pair inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection and or/entry via such a receptor mimicry mechanism, in addition to blockage of ACE2 binding.</p>
<p id="P23">The binding epitope of Sb#68, also called the “cryptic” epitope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], is highly conserved between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. The same conserved epitope is also recognized by the human antibodies CR3022 (isolated from a SARS-CoV-1 infected patient and showing cross-specificity against SARS-CoV-2) and EY6A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] as well as the nanobody VHH-72, which had been originally selected against SARS-CoV-1 but was shown to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Recent months have brought about a growing number of other nanobodies from immune and synthetic libraries whose epitopes overlap with Sb#68 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], suggesting that the cryptic epitope constitutes a preferred binding site for VHHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). The cryptic epitope is unchanged in currently circulating variants of concern, including the B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta) and the B.1.617.2 (delta) lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>) and consequently, neutralization efficiency of Sb#68 is unaffected against these variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P24">Fusion of nanobodies via flexible linkers has emerged as a promising strategy to improve neutralization efficiencies by exploiting avidity effects. This potency-boosting procedure has been explored in the context of SARS-CoV-2 binders by either fusing up to three identical nanobodies (multivalency) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], or by the structure-based design of biparatopic nanobodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. We exploited our structural data to first fuse Sb#15 and Sb#68 into the biparatopic GS4 construct, which resulted in a more than 100-fold gain of neutralization efficiency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In a subsequent fusion step, the bi-paratopic GS4 construct was equipped with a trimerization domain (Tripod-GS4r), resulting in a further 10-fold boost in neutralization potential, thereby increasing the cumulative neutralization potency by a factor of around 1000 when compared to the single constituent nanobodies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). To our knowledge, engineering of such a “trimer-of-dimers” construct has not yet been attempted with anti-SARS-CoV-2 binder proteins. In addition to neutralizing virus entry via competition with receptor-binding and inducing premature activation of the fusion machinery, the unique multivalent structure of Tripod-GS4r may trigger clustering of neighboring spikes, thereby eventually deactivating multiple viral entry machineries simultaneously.</p>
<p id="P25">The ability of enveloped RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 to rapidly develop resistance mutations is a crucial issue of consideration for the development of reliable therapeutics. Escape mutants indeed rapidly emerged when <italic>in vitro</italic> selection experiments were carried with single monoclonal antibodies or nanobodies targeting either the receptor-binding motif or the cryptic epitope alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. It is interesting to note that the Q493R escape mutation we isolated for Sb#15 has been recently observed in a COVID-19 patient who received monoclonal antibody therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Thus, an attractive strategy to potentially suppress mutational escape is to employ a cocktail of neutralizing antibodies binding to discrete epitopes of the spike. Accumulating evidence indeed demonstrate that rapid viral escape is not observed when experiments are performed either in the presence of a combination of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies/nanobodies or in the presence of biparatopic fusion constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, in addition to efficiently suppress mutational escape, our biparatopic molecules (<italic>e.g.</italic>, GS4 and Tripod-GS4r) consistently retained their neutralization capacity against pseudotyped VSV carrying spikes that harbored key mutations of common SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. In particular, the trimerized biparatopic construct (Tripod-GS4r) exhibited ultra-potent neutralizing activity against all tested spike variants, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of low picomolar range. Hence, our study provides evidence that combining multivalency and biparatopic nanobody fusion proteins represent a promising strategy to potentially generate therapeutic molecules with clinical relevance.</p>
<p id="P26">In conclusion, the rapid selection of sybodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and their swift biophysical, structural and functional characterization, provide a foundation for the accelerated reaction to potential future pandemics. In contrast to a number of synthetic or naïve SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies from other libraries that required a post-selection maturation process to reach satisfactory affinities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], sybodies selected by us and by other labs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>] exhibited affinities in the single and double digit nM range and where thus of similar affinity as nanobodies isolated from immune libraries using classical phage display [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Deep-mining of such sybody pools with our recently described flycode technology is expected to facilitate discovery of exceptional sybodies possessing very slow off-rates or recognizing rare epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Single domain antibodies and their derivative multi-component formats can be produced inexpensively and the biophysical properties of single domain antibodies make them feasible for development in an inhalable formulation, thereby offering the potential of self-administration. Hence, nanobodies show great promise to be used as prophylactic agents in the current or future pandemics.</p>

<title>Sybody selections</title>
<p id="P29">Sybody selections, entailing one round of ribosome display followed by two rounds of phage display, were carried out as previously detailed with the three synthetic sybody libraries designated concave, loop and convex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. All targets were chemically biotinylated using NHS-Biotin (ThermoFisher #20217) according to the manufacturer protocol. Binders were selected against two different constructs of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD; an RBD-vYFP fusion and an RBD-Fc fusion. MBP was used as background control to determine the enrichment score by qPCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. In order to avoid enrichment of binders against the fusion proteins (YFP and Fc), we switched the two targets after ribosome display. For the off-rate selections we did not use non-biotinylated target proteins as described[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] because we did not have the required amounts of purified target protein. Instead, we employed a pool competition approach.

The resulting three expressed pools were subsequently combined, giving one sybody pool for each selection scheme. These two final pools were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, followed by buffer exchange of the main peak fractions using a desalting PD10 column in TBS pH 7.5 to remove imidazole. The pools were eluted with 3.2 ml of TBS pH 7.5. These two purified pools were used for the off-rate selection in the second round of phage display at concentrations of approximately 390 µM for selection variant 1 (competing for binding to RBP-Fc) and 450 µM for selection variant 2 (competing for binding to RBP-YFP). The volume used for off-rate selection was 500 µl, with 0.5% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 added to pools immediately prior to the competition experiment. Off-rate selections were performed for 3 minutes. For identification of binder hits, ELISAs were performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. 47 single clones were analyzed for each library of each selection scheme. Since the RBD-Fc construct was incompatible with our ELISA format due to the inclusion of Protein A to capture an α-myc antibody, ELISA was performed only for the RBD-vYFP (50 nM) and the M) and later on with the S-2P (25 nM). Of note, the three targets were analyzed in three separate ELISAs. As negative control to assess background binding of sybodies, we used biotinylated MBP (50 nM). 72 positive ELISA hits were sequenced (Microsynth, Switzerland).</p>

GCNt is a trimerization motif that was previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Foldon stems from fibritin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. TST denotes a C-terminal His/TwinStrepTag sequence for purification purposes. The Tripod-GS4r expression plasmid (3 mg) was sent to the Protein Production and Structure Core Facility of the EPFL (Switzerland) for expression (7 days in ExpiCHO cells).

<title>Dual-sybody competition ELISA</title>
<p id="P33">Purified sybodies carrying a C-terminal myc-His Tag (Sb_init expression vector) were diluted to 25 nM in 100 µl PBS pH 7.4 and directly coated on Nunc MaxiSorp 96-well plates (ThermoFisher #44-2404-21) at 4°C overnight. The plates were washed once with 250 µl TBS pH 7.5 per well followed by blocking with 250 µl TBS pH 7.5 containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA per well. In parallel, chemically biotinylated prefusion Spike protein (S-2P) at a concentration of 10 nM was incubated with 500 nM sybodies for 1 h at room temperature in TBS-BSA-T. The plates were washed three times with 250 µl TBS-T per well. Then, 100 µl of the S-2P-sybody mixtures were added to the corresponding wells and incubated for 3 min, followed by washing three times with 250 µl TBS-T per well. 100 µl Streptavidin-peroxidase polymer (Merck, Cat#S2438) diluted 1:5000 in TBS-BSA-T was added to each well and incubated for 10 min, followed by washing three times with 250 µl TBS-T per well. Finally, to detect S-2P bound to the immobilized sybodies, 100 µl ELISA developing buffer (prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]) was added to each well, incubated for 1 h (due to low signal) and absorbance was measured at 650 nm.

<title>Grating-coupled interferometry (GCI)</title>
<p id="P34">Kinetic characterization of sybodies binding onto SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins was performed using GCI on the WAVEsystem (Creoptix AG, Switzerland), a label-free biosensor. For the off-rate screening, biotinylated RBD-vYFP and ECD were captured onto a Streptavidin PCP-STA WAVEchip (polycarboxylate quasi-planar surface; Creoptix AG) to a density of 1300-1800 pg/mm<sup>2</sup>. Sybodies were first analyzed by an off-rate screen performed at a concentration of 200 nM (data not shown) to identify binders with sufficiently high affinities. The six sybodies Sb#14, Sb#15, Sb#16, Sb#42, Sb#45, and Sb#68 were then injected at increasing concentrations ranging from 1.37 nM to 1 μM (three-fold serial dilution, 7 concentrations) in 20 mM Tris pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl supplemented with 0.05 % Tween-20 (TBS-T buffer). Sybodies were injected for 120 s at a flow rate of 30 μl/min per channel and dissociation was set to 600 s to allow the return to baseline.</p>
<p id="P35">In order to determine the binding kinetics of Sb#15 and Sb#68 against intact spike proteins, the ligands RBD-vYFP, S-2P and S-6P were captured onto a PCP-STA WAVEchip (Creoptix AG) to a density of 750 pg/mm<sup>2</sup>, 1100 pg/mm<sup>2</sup> and 850 pg/mm<sup>2</sup> respectively. Sb#15 and Sb#68 were injected at concentrations ranging from 1.95 nM to 250 nM or 3.9 nM to 500 nM, respectively (2-fold serial dilution, 8 concentrations) in TBS-T buffer. Sybodies were injected for 200 s at a flow rate of 80 μl/min and dissociation was set to 600 s. In order to investigate if Sb#15 and Sb#68 bind simultaneously to the RBD, S-2P and S-6P, both binders were either injected alone at a concentration of 200 nM or mixed together at the same individual concentrations at a flow rate of 80 μl/min for 200 s in TBS-T buffer.</p>
<p id="P36">To measure binding kinetics of the three bispecific fusion construct GS4, S-6P was captured as described above to a density of 1860 pg/mm<sup>2</sup> and increasing concentrations of the bispecific fusion constructs ranging from 1 nM to 27 nM (3-fold serial dilution, 4 concentrations) in TBS-T buffer at a flow rate of 80 μl/min. Because of the slow off-rates, we performed a regeneration protocol by injecting 10 mM glycine pH 2 for 30 s after every binder injection.</p>
<p id="P37">For ACE2 competition experiments, S-2P was captured as described above. Then Sb#15, Sb#68 or Sb#0 (non-randomized convex sybody control) were either injected individually or premixed with ACE2 in TBS-T buffer. Sybody concentrations were at 200 nM and ACE2 concentration was at 100 nM.</p>
<p id="P38">All sensorgrams were recorded at 25 °C and the data analyzed on the WAVEcontrol (Creoptix AG). Data were double-referenced by subtracting the signals from blank injections and from the reference channel. A Langmuir 1:1 model was used for data fitting with the exception of the Sb#15 and Sb#68 binding kinetics for the S-2P and the S-6P spike, which were fitted with a heterogeneous ligand model as mentioned in the main text.</p>

Briefly, propagation-defective, spike protein-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was produced by transfecting HEK-239T cells with SARS-CoV-2 Sdel 18 (SARS-2 S carrying an 18 aa cytoplasmic tail truncation) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. The cells were further inoculated with glycoprotein G <italic>trans</italic>-complemented VSV vector (VSV*ΔG(Luc)) encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) and firefly luciferase reporter genes but lacking the glycoprotein G gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>].

<title>Generation of chimeric VSV*ΔG-S<sub>Δ21</sub>
</title>
<p id="P42">Recently, we generated a recombinant chimeric VSV, VSV*ΔG(MERS-S), in which the VSV glycoprotein (G) gene was replaced by the full-length MERS-CoV spike protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. VSV*ΔG(MERS-S) also encoded a GFP reporter which was expressed from an additional transcription unit located between the MERS-CoV spike and VSV L genes. In order to generate a chimeric VSV expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the MERS-S gene in the antigenomic plasmid pVSV*ΔG(MERS-S) was replaced by a modified SARS-CoV-2 spike gene (Genscript, Piscattaway, USA) taking advantage of the flanking <italic>Mlu</italic>I and <italic>BstE</italic>II endonuclease restriction sites. The modified SARS-CoV-2 spike gene was based on the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (GenBank accession number NC_045512) but lacked the region encoding the C-terminal 21 amino acids in order to enhance cell surface transport of the spike protein and its incorporation into the VSV envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. In addition, the modified spike gene contained the mutations R685G, H655Y, D253N, W64R, G261R, A372T, which have been previously reported to accumulate during passaging chimeric VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S on Vero E6 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. The amino acid substitution R685G is located in the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site and has been shown to reduce syncytia formation and to enhance virus titers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>].</p>
<p id="P43">The chimeric virus was rescued following transfection of cDNA according to a previously described protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. Briefly, BHK-21 cells were infected with a modified virus Ankara (MVA) expressing T7 bacteriophage RNA polymerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>] using a multiplicity of infection of 1 focus-forming unit (ffu)/cell. Subsequently, the cells were transfected with the VSV antigenomic plasmid along with plasmids driving the T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription of the VSV N, P, and L genes. After 24 hours of incubation, the cells were trypsinized and seeded along with an equal number of Vero E6 cells and incubated for an additional 48 hours at 37°C. The expression of the GFP reporter in the cells was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. The recombinant virus was rescued from the supernatant of GFP-positive cells and passaged subsequently on Vero E6 cells. Following the fourth passage, virus was harvested from the cell culture supernatant and stored in aliquots at -70°C in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).</p>
<p id="P44">Infectious virus titers were determined on confluent Vero E6 cells grown in 96-well microtiter plates. The cells were inoculated in duplicate with 40 μl per well of serial 10-fold virus dilutions for 1 hour at 37°C. Thereafter, 160 μl of EMEM containing 1% methyl-cellulose was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C. The number of infectious foci was determined under the fluorescence microscope taking advantage of the GFP reporter and infectious virus titers were calculated and expressed as ffu/ml.</p>

Briefly, a total of 10<sup>4</sup> ffu of the parental VSV*ΔG-S<sub>Δ21</sub> were incubated with serially diluted sybodies prior to infection of Vero E6 cells that were grown in 24-well cell culture plates. Two days post infection, the cell culture supernatant from wells containing the highest antibody concentration which did not completely inhibit virus replication as monitored by GFP fluorescence was collected and subjected to a second round of selection on Vero E6 cells grown in 96-well microtiter plates in the presence of increasing sybody concentrations. Virus recovered after a third round of selection was used to infect Vero E6 cells grown in 6-well plates.</p>

In analogous way, the sample of S-6P with Sb#68 was prepared. The protein complexes were concentrated to 0.7-1 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> using an Amicon Ultra-0.5 mL concentrating device (Merck) with a 100 kDa filter cut-off. 2.8 μl of the sample was applied onto the holey-carbon cryo-EM grids (Au R1.2/1.3, 300 mesh, Quantifoil), which were prior glow discharged at 5 - 15 mA for 30 s, blotted for 1–2 s and plunge frozen into a liquid ethane/propane mixture with a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher) at 15 °C and 100% humidity. Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen until further use. Screening of the grid for areas with best ice properties was done with the help of a home-written script to calculate the ice thickness (manuscript in preparation). Cryo-EM data in selected grid regions were collected in-house on a 200-keV Talos Arctica microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientifics) with a post-column energy filter (Gatan) in zero-loss mode, with a 20-eV slit and a 100 μm objective aperture. Images were acquired in an automatic manner with SerialEM on a K2 summit detector (Gatan) in counting mode at ×49,407 magnification (1.012 Å pixel size) and a defocus range from −0.9 to −1.9 μm.

<p id="P49">For the S-2P/Sb#15/ Sb#68 complex dataset, in total 14,883 micrographs were recorded. Beam-induced motion was corrected with MotionCor2_1.2.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>] and the CTF parameters estimated with ctffind4.1.13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. Recorded micrographs were manually checked in FOCUS (1.1.0), and micrographs, which were out of defocus range (&lt;0.4 and &gt;2 μm), contaminated with ice or aggregates, and with a low-resolution estimation of the CTF fit (&gt;5 Å), were discarded. 637,105 particles were picked from the remaining 12,454 micrographs by crYOLO 1.7.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>], and imported in cryoSPARC v2.15.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>] for 2D classification with a box size of 300 pixels. After 2D classification, 264,082 particles were imported into RELION-3.0.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>] and subjected to a 3D classification without imposed symmetry, where an ab-initio generated map from cryoSPARC low-pass filtered to 50 Å was used as reference. Two classes resembling spike protein, revealed two distinct conformations. One class shows a symmetrical state with all RBDs in an <italic>up</italic> conformation (3<italic>up</italic>) and both sybodies bound to each RBD (78,933 particles, 30%). In the asymmetrical class (52,839 particles, 20%) the RBDs adopt one <italic>up</italic>, one <italic>up-out</italic> and one <italic>down</italic> conformation (<italic>1up/1up-out/1down)</italic>, where both sybodies are bound to RBDs <italic>up</italic> and <italic>up-out</italic> state, while only Sb#15 is bound to the <italic>down</italic> RBD. The <italic>3up</italic> class was further refined with C3 symmetry imposed. The final refinement, where a mask was included in the last iteration, provided a map at 7.6 Å resolution. Six rounds of per-particle CTF refinement with beamtilt estimation and re-extraction of particles with a box size of 400 pixels improved resolution further to 3.2 Å. The particles were then imported into cryoSPARC, where non-uniform refinement improved the resolution to 3 Å. The asymmetrical <italic>1up/1up-out/1down</italic> was refined in an analogous manner with no symmetry imposed, resulting in a map at 7.8 Å resolution. Six rounds of per-particle CTF refinement with beamtilt estimation improved resolution to 3.7 Å. A final round of non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC yielded a map at 3.3 Å resolution. Local resolution estimations were determined in cryoSPARC. All resolutions were estimated using the 0.143 cut-off criterion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>] with gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) between two independently refined half-maps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>].

The best class comprising 22,055 particles (38%) represented an asymmetrical <italic>1up/1up-out/1down</italic> conformation with Sb#15 bound to each RBD. Several rounds of refinement and CTF refinement yielded a map of 4.0 Å resolution.</p>
<p id="P51">For the dataset of the S-6P/Sb#68 complex, in total 5,109 images were recorded, with 4,759 used for further image processing. 344,976 particles were autopicked via crYOLO and subjected to 2D classification in cryoSPARC. 192,942 selected particles were imported into RELION-3.0.8 and used for subsequent 3D classification, where the symmetrical <italic>3up</italic> map, described above, was used as initial reference. Two distinct classes of spike protein were found. One class (24,325 particles, 13%) revealed a state in which two RBDs adopt an <italic>up</italic> conformation with Sb#68 bound, whereby the density for the third RBD was poorly resolved representing an undefined state. Several rounds of refinement and CTF refinement yielded a map of 4.8 Å resolution. Two other classes, comprising 44,165 particles (23%) and 84,917 particles (44%), were identical. They show a <italic>1up/2down</italic> configuration without Sb#68 bound to any of the RBDs. Both classes were processed separately, whereby the class with over 80k particles yielded the best resolution of 3.3 Å and was used for further interpretation. A final non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC further improved resolution down to 3.1 Å.</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Affinity determination of Sb#15 and Sb#68 against the immobilized S-protein (S-2P) using GCI. The data were fitted using a heterogeneous ligand model. (<bold>B</bold>) <italic>left</italic>, GCI epitope-binning experiment showing Sb#15 (blue), Sb#68 (red) and their combination (black) against immobilized S-protein (S-2P). Since both sybodies were present at saturating concentrations, the increased amplitude is indicative of simultaneous binding. Right, ELISA experiment confirming dual-binding of Sb#15 and Sb#68. Myc-tagged Sb#15 was immobilized on an anti-myc antibody-coated ELISA plate, followed by exposure of biotinylated RBD which was pre-mixed with tag-less sybodies (indicated on the x-axis). (C) Competition of sybodies and ACE2 for S-protein binding, investigated by GCI. Biotinylated S-protein was immobilized on the GCI sensor and then Sb#15 (200 nM, left), or Sb#68 (200 nM, right) were injected alone or premixed with human ACE2 (100 nM). Sb#0 represents a non-randomized control sybody.</p>
