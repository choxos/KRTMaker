We discovered a non-covalent, non-peptidic inhibitor scaffold with lead-like properties that is differentiated from current main protease inhibitors. Our approach leveraged crowdsourcing, machine learning, exascale molecular simulations, and high-throughput structural biology and chemistry. We generated a detailed map of the structural plasticity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, extensive structure-activity relationships for multiple chemotypes, and a wealth of biochemical activity data. All compound designs (&gt;18,000 designs), crystallographic data (&gt;840 ligand-bound X-ray structures), assay data (&gt;10,000 measurements), and synthesized molecules (&gt;2,400 compounds) for this campaign were shared rapidly and openly, creating a rich open and IP-free knowledgebase for future anti-coronavirus drug discovery.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Despite rapid progress in vaccine development, the global failure to abate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) culminating in more than 690 million confirmed cases worldwide by July 2023, will likely cause the virus to become endemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>), and continue to cause a significant number of deaths, especially in the Global South unless there is an accessible treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Antiviral therapeutics are a necessary and complementary strategy to vaccination in order to control COVID-19(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Several directly acting oral antivirals are now approved for usage against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, including ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), ensitrelvir (Japan)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), and molnupiravir(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).</p><p id="P4">COVID-19 is not an isolated event, but the latest exemplar of a series of threats to human health caused by beta-coronaviruses also responsible for the SARS (2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (2010) pandemics(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Open knowledge bases and technology infrastructures for antiviral drug discovery will enable pandemic preparedness by refreshing the antivirals pipeline and providing multiple starting points for the development of therapeutics. Here, we report the open science discovery of a potent SARS-CoV-2 antiviral lead compound and a roadmap for the potential development of future SARS-CoV-2 and pancoronavirus antivirals.</p><p id="P5">The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro; or 3CL-protease) is an attractive target for antiviral development due to its essential role in viral replication, a large degree of conservation across coronaviruses, and dissimilarity of its structure and substrate profile to human proteases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">FIg S1</xref>). Pioneering studies during and after the 2003 SARS pandemic established the linkage between Mpro inhibition and antiviral activity in cell culture(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). This work has been corroborated by in vitro and in vivo studies for SARS-CoV-2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and the clinical success of nirmatrelvir (the Mpro inhibitor component of Paxlovid)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) and ensitrevir (Xocova)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To warrant early use in the course of disease or even prophylactically among at-risk populations, an antiviral drug would need to be orally available with an excellent safety profile. Given the historical difficulties in developing peptidomimetic compounds into oral drugs and the risk of downstream idiosyncratic hazards of covalent inhibition, we chose to pursue non-covalent, non-peptidomimetic scaffolds. First-generation oral Mpro inhibitors have now demonstrated clinical efficacy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), but the need for cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor co-dosing (ritonavir, in the case of Paxlovid) to achieve sufficient human exposure may substantially limit use in at-risk populations due to drug-drug interactions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).

This dataset was posted online on 18 Mar 2020(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), days after the screen was completed(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). The non-covalent fragment hits did not show detectable inhibition in a fluorescence-based enzyme activity assay (assay dynamic range IC<sub>50</sub> &lt; 100 ŒºM). However, they provided a high-resolution map of key interactions that optimized compounds may exploit to inhibit Mpro(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Numerous approaches have been proposed to advance from fragments to lead compounds(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). One strategy, <italic>fragment merging</italic>, aims to combine multiple fragments into a single, more potent molecule, whereas <italic>fragment expansion</italic> elaborates a fragment to engage neighboring interactions. While these strategies are usually applied to a single fragment or a handful of fragments, our large-scale fragment screen produced a dense ensemble of hits, providing an opportunity for rapid lead generation by combining chemotypes from multiple fragments. Nonetheless, this approach requires heuristic chemical reasoning that accounts for the spatial orientation of fragments in the binding site‚Äîa feat that can challenge algorithms but is potentially also solvable by humans. Building on successes in crowdsourced protein(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) design campaigns, we hypothesized that crowdsourced human analysis and algorithmic strategies could accelerate the generation of potent lead compounds and furnish diverse chemical matter, as different chemists would employ different approaches and reasoning strategies.</p><p id="P9">We launched an online crowdsourcing platform [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://postera.ai/covid">http://postera.ai/covid</ext-link>] on 18 March 2020 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), soliciting participants to submit compounds designed based on the fragment hits(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Compounds selected for synthesis were evaluated by biochemical assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Data S1</xref>) and x-ray crystallography and the results were released rapidly on the same platform, enabling contributing designers to build on all available data, as well as designs contributed by others. To facilitate transparency and maximal speed, and to avoid delays around intellectual property, all designers were asked to contribute their designs directly into the public domain, with every design and all related experimental data immediately disclosed online, made openly available explicitly free of IP restrictions. This aggressive open science policy enabled contributors from multiple fields in both academia and industry to freely share their ideas. Within the first week, we received over 2,000 submissions, representing a diverse set of design strategies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Data S2</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Many submissions exploited spatially overlapping fragment hits. For example, the submission <bold><underline>TRY-UNI-714a760b-6</underline></bold> was inspired by five overlapping fragments, furnishing a non-covalent inhibitor with an SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzymatic IC<sub>50</sub> of 23.7 ŒºM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). This compound seeded the ‚Äúaminopyridine‚Äù series, whose optimization is described in detail below. We should note that only 11 of the 998 fragments in the DSi-poised library(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) contained a 3-amino pyridine, yet four of them were successfully identified in the structures and were consequently picked-up for merging by the designers. Apart from the aminopyridine series, our campaign identified three other major chemically distinct lead series with measurable potencies against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inspired by reported SARS-CoV-1 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>). Those compounds span the same binding pocket but feature different chemotypes, and the large quantity of structure-activity relationship (SAR) subsequently generated for these series furnishes multiple backup series with different risk profiles. Other groups have subsequently further elaborated on the Ugi(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) and the benzotriazole series we generated(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Analysis of the submissions provides some hints to the utility of crowdsourcing as a general strategy for hitdiscovery or hit-to-lead campaigns. A qualitative assessment of the textual description of submitted designs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3</xref>) hints that many of the designers used tools like docking to assess fragment ‚Äòlinking‚Äô, ‚Äòmerging‚Äô or ‚Äòcombination‚Äô. When trying to more thoroughly categorize submissions it doesn‚Äôt appear that hypothesis-driven designs perform better than docking driven designs, however ‚Äòpredicting‚Äô historical SARS inhibitors is the best performing strategy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Throughout the campaign, designs were contributed by both the core group of labs and medicinal chemists leading this project, as well as by the community. One could hypothesize that the core group being committed to the project, as well as thoroughly invested in the campaign details would contribute more potent designs. However, there is no obvious difference in the distributions of designs produced by the core group vs. the community, in the early stages of the campaign (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) nor were the designs contributed by the community less synthetically accessible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Later in the campaign, (lead optimization stage) the number of submissions from the community decreased, and comparing potency became irrelevant as other attributes of the molecules were being optimized. It is important to mention that several key compounds along the optimization trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) of our lead were contributed by the community and not core group members including: <bold>TRY-UNI-714a760b-6</bold>, <bold>ADA-UCB-6c2cb422-1</bold> and <bold>VLA-UCB-1dbca3b4-15</bold> (the racemic mixture of <bold>MAT-POS-b3e365b9-1</bold>). Although anecdotal, this example demonstrates the potential power of crowdsourcing as a strategy to drive fragment-to-lead campaigns.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Technologies to support rapid optimization cycles</title><p id="P12">With a growing number of chemically diverse submissions, we relied on a team of experienced medicinal chemists supported by computational methods to aid in triaging design proposals with the goal of increasing potency. To execute a rapid fragment-to-lead campaign, we used models to plan synthetic routes, enumerate synthetically accessible virtual libraries, and estimate potencies to prioritize which compounds to target for synthesis. We did not use an ‚Äúautonomous‚Äù approach - expert judgment is used to make decisions given all the model predictions. Further, in the context of a fast-moving campaign, we prioritized making progress over granular ‚Äúhuman-versus-machine‚Äù evaluations.</p><sec id="S4"><title>Synthetic route predictions guided decision making to accelerate design-make-test-analyze cycles</title><p id="P13">We used an established synthetic contract research organization (CRO), Enamine, to carry out rapid synthesis of progressed compound designs. To take full advantage of the available building block collection, we used a machine learning approach that plans efficient retrosynthetic routes to predict synthetic tractability(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). We automatically computed synthetic routes for all crowdsourced submissions utilizing Enamine‚Äôs in-stock building block inventories. From the computed routes, synthetic complexity was estimated based on the number of steps and the probability of success of each step. The synthetic accessibility score, as well as the predicted synthetic route, were then used to aid medicinal chemistry decision making. Our predicted synthetic complexity correlated with the actual time taken to synthesize target compounds and the algorithm was able to pick out advanced intermediates as starting materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Alchemical free energy calculations prioritized potent compounds for synthesis</title><p id="P14">We estimated potency of proposed designs and virtual synthetic libraries of analogues using alchemical free energy calculations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), an accurate physical modeling technique that has hitherto not been deployed in a high throughput setup due to its prohibitive computational cost. We employed Folding@Home(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>)‚Äîa worldwide distributed computing network where hundreds of thousands of volunteers around the world contributed computing power to create the world‚Äôs first exascale computing resource(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>)‚Äîto compute the free energy of binding of all 20,000+ crowdsourced and internal design submissions using the Open Force Field Initiative ‚ÄúParsley‚Äù small molecule force fields(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) and nonequilibrium switching with the open source PERSES alchemical free energy toolkit(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) based on the GPU-accelerated OpenMM framework(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Detailed Methods</xref>). Comprehensive sampling was prioritized over efficiency of computation given the abundant compute resources available on Folding@home.</p><p id="P15">We first performed a small retrospective study using bioactivity data generated from the first week of crowdsourced compound designs, triaged solely using synthetic accessibility. The results of these free energy calculations showed good correlation with experimentally-measured affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Henceforth, alchemical free energy calculations were used as an additional (though not sole) criteria to guide compound selection and iterative design (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S51">Data Availability</xref>). During the campaign, distinct objectives were solicited from submitters to address medicinal chemistry problems, and free energy calculations were used to assess these submissions based on predicted potency. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> shows that predicted pIC<sub>50</sub> tracks experimental measurements across 3 chronologically distinct design campaigns: decoration of the benzopyran ring, replacement of the benzopyran system, and replacement of the isoquinoline system. Note that some design ideas with low predicted pIC<sub>50</sub> were synthesized since the medicinal chemistry team balanced between gaining insights on structure-activity and structure-property relationship and potency optimization. The champion compounds from each design campaign are highlighted on the right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>. Although free energy calculations identified multiple potency-improving transformations, the strategically useful one was the swap from pyran to a piperidine sulfonamide system, which is on the critical path to the lead compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). On average, 80 GPU hours/compound was used across the three panels (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Detailed Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P16">A major strength of alchemical free energy calculations proved to be their ability to select potent analogues from virtual synthetic libraries from which the medicinal chemistry team had already selected compounds sharing a common intermediate, as well as highlighting submitted designs predicted to be highly potent but where major synthetic effort would be required. Our design team prioritized for synthesis small libraries suggested by the aforementioned computational approaches. Chemically-related groups of outliers frequently provided new chemical insight that informed modeling choices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5</xref>). The approach was not without drawbacks, including the need to focus on a single reference compound and structure to design transformation networks (rather than leveraging the abundant structural data), the requirement that protonation states be fixed for the entire calculation (requiring the entire transformation network to be recomputed to assess a different protonation state), and the relatively large computational cost required to handle large replacements (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Detailed Methods</xref>). The method is also not uniformly accurate across all chemical transformations, and accurately estimating its accuracy beforehand is challenging. For example, isoquinoline replacements show lower correlation between calculated and predicted free energy (Panel 3 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) compared to the benzopyran replacements (Panel 2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Nanomole-scale high-throughput chemistry enabled rapid evaluation of structure-activity relationship (SAR)</title><p id="P17">A complementary method for rapid SAR evaluation was the use of nanomole scale high-throughput chemistry(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>) (HTC), coupled with a ‚Äòdirect to biology‚Äô(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>) biochemical screening. Two examples include the optimization of the Chan-Lam reaction(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) to extend molecule <bold>ADA-UCB-6c2cb422-1</bold> and amide coupling to extend <bold>MAT-POS-4223bc15-21</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). In both cases, we determined the co-crystal structures of the parent compounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S6</xref>) and suggested vectors that could target the P4 pocket of Mpro. Optimization of the reaction conditions was performed for the starting building block with model amines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S7</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8</xref>) and the optimal conditions were applied to HTC with a library of 300 amine building blocks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Data S3</xref>). Yield estimation was performed in both cases and showed for the Chan-Lam library only 29 of the library yielded &gt;30% of the desired product, in comparison to 151 for the amide coupling. Nevertheless, the crude mixtures were subjected to a biochemical assay against Mpro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Data S3</xref>). Seven compounds were selected for resynthesis from the Chan-Lam series and 20 from the amide series (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S9</xref>). In parallel to synthesis, the crude reaction mixtures were subjected to soaking and x-ray crystallography. The structures verified the extended compounds indeed adopt a similar binding mode to the parent. Chan-Lam extended compounds indeed occupied P4, whereas the amides extended towards P3/P5, in both cases forming new interactions with Mpro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Upon resynthesis, one of the Chan-Lam compounds was able to slightly improve over the parent compound IC<sub>50</sub>. Several of the amide-coupling series were able to improve by up to 300-fold on the parent acid-compound (up-to 3-fold on the corresponding methyl-amide) with the best inhibitor exhibiting an IC<sub>50</sub> of 28nM against Mpro.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Covalent targeting strategies</title><p id="P18">Another approach that was attempted in order to rapidly gain potency was the use of electrophiles to covalently target the catalytic Cys145. The original fragment screen(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) that launched this effort, included electrophiles(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>) and resulted in 48 structures of covalently bound fragments, the vast majority of which were chloroacetamides.

The P1 and P2 pockets are the hotspots of interactions, yet the interaction patterns are starkly different. The salient interactions sampled by our ligands in the P1 pocket are H163 (H-bond donor), E166 (H-bond acceptor), and N142 (hydrophobic interactions). Whereas P2 interactions are dominated by œÄ-stacking interactions with H41 and hydrophobic interactions M165. The P1‚Äô and P3/4/5 pockets are sparingly sampled by our ligands; the former can be targeted via hydrophobic interactions (T25), whereas the latter via H-bonds (Q192).</p><p id="P20">This pattern of intermolecular interactions is reflected in the plasticity of the different subpockets. The dominance of directional interactions in P1 renders it more rigid than P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The rigidity is also dependent on the chemical series (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>), with the Ugi and benzotriazole series being able to deform the P2 pocket.

The former strategy aimed to increase the probability of achieving oral bioavailability, while the latter heuristic was motivated by the substrate envelope hypothesis for avoiding viral resistance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> outlines the critical intermediates on the path towards an optimized lead compound.</p><p id="P22">Starting from the fragment hit, we explored the P1 pocket, which admits a steep SAR, perhaps unsurprising given its rigidity and preference for directional H-bond interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). An increase in potency was unlocked by replacing pyridine with isoquinoline, which picks up additional hydrophobic interactions with N142. The SAR around the P2 pocket is considerably more tolerant to modifications, and broadly favors hydrophobic moieties. A step-change in potency was achieved by rigidifying the scaffold: We introduced a tetrahydropyran ring to transform the P2 substituent into a chromane moiety (compound <bold>MAT-POS-b3e365b9-1</bold>; the racemic mixture <bold>VLA-UCB-1dbca3b4-15</bold>, which was initially synthesized, has a IC<sub>50</sub> of 360 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), chosen because of building block availability. Despite possessing a degree of molecular complexity, <bold>MAT-POS-b3e365b9-1</bold> is obtained via a one-step amide coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We then further explored the P2 pocket with a library chemistry strategy in mind. Thus, guided by free energy calculations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), we first substituted the chromane for a tetrahydroisoquinoline to introduce a functionalizable handle (<bold>MAT-POS-3ccb8ef6-1</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), which maintained potency. Finally, we constructed a focused library realized via sulphonamide Schotten-Baumann coupling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S14</xref>), furnishing an increase in both enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral efficacy.

identified novel chemotype scaffolds by merging fragment hits.</title><p><bold>A:</bold> A Diamond / XChem fragment screen that initiated this SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor discovery campaign generated 58 hits that completely cover the Mpro active site, with a variety of chemotypes engaging each pocket; 1495 x-ray datasets were collected and 78 solved structures for hits were publicly posted(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p><p>The peptidomimetic N3 ligand is shown at left for comparison to indicate natural substrate engagement in the binding site, defining the peptide sidechain numbering scheme used throughout this work. The nucleophilic Cys145 reacts with the scissile peptide bond between P1 and P1‚Äô; His41-Cys145 form a catalytic dyad whose coupled charge states shuttle between zwitterionic and neutral states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>).</p><p><bold>B:</bold> On March 18th 2020, the COVID Moonshot set up a crowdsourcing website to empower scientists across the globe to contribute molecule designs. The number of designs actioned for synthesis each quarter (except for the 2020Q2 which is shown per-month in brackets) is shown, subdivided by the region of the submitter of the design idea. The total number of unique submitters that contributed actioned designs for that quarter is shown on top of the bars.</p><p><bold>C:</bold> Many submissions, such as TRY-UNI-714a760b-6, exploited spatially overlapping fragment hits to design potent leads that are synthetically facile.</p><p><bold>D:</bold> Experimental biochemical potency of designs broken down by submission group. Multiple submissions in 2020 from the community were more potent than the best designs from the core team as seen for the top three chloroacetamide structures (left) and non-covalent structures (right).</p><p><bold>E:</bold> Distribution of synthetic accessibility scores for designs contributed by the core team and the community. The concern that community submissions may be of poor quality is not supported by the fact that these were as synthetic accessible as those designed by the core team (median: community 0.17 core 0.13,). Half of the outliers (SAScore = 1) were primarily natural products, which are hard to achieve via organic chemistry.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS102757-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Strategies to support rapid optimization cycles.</title><p><bold>A:</bold> Machine learning forecasts experimental synthesis time (left) and returns efficient routes that leverage over 10 million in-stock advanced intermediates (right). Our algorithm predicts the probability of each step being successful, and predicts synthetic accessibility by taking the product of the probabilities along the whole route. We analysed all compounds made in COVID Moonshot from 2020-05-01 to 2021-07-01 (n=898). The right panel exemplifies the experimental execution of the predicted routes, demonstrating the ability of the algorithm to build on functionalized intermediates to shorten synthesis.</p><p><bold>B:</bold> Applying alchemical free energy calculations at scale enables us to estimate the potency of compounds. Retrospective assessment of our automated free energy calculation workflow on early compounds in the 3-aminopyridine series in the first month of the COVID Moonshot campaign suggested free energy calculations could provide good predictive utility, which inspired confidence for large scale deployment during this campaign. Here, the absolute free energy of binding ŒîG is shown in the rightmost panel by adding a constant offset to the computed relative free energy differences.</p><p><bold>C:</bold> Alchemical free energy predictions for all submissions elaborating on the depicted scaffold for three representative batches of prospective free energy calculations plotted as calculated (converted using Cheng-Prusoff equation) versus experimental pIC<sub>50</sub>. Simulations were run using Mpro in dimer form, with neutral catalytic dyad and no restraints. Each batch (numbered 1-3 from left to right) is annotated with its scaffold and top-scoring candidates are shown on the righthand side (numbered 1-3 from top to bottom)---for these the structure names are shown together with their predicted and experimental pIC<sub>50</sub> (‚ÄúPred‚Äù/‚ÄùP‚Äù and ‚ÄúExpt‚Äù/‚ÄùE‚Äù, resp.). Statistical performance with 95% confidence intervals for each batch is shown as a table in each scatterplot.</p><p><bold>D:</bold> Two examples of nanomole scale high throughput chemistry (HTC) campaigns used to optimize the potency of intermediate binders, centering on the Chan Lam reaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S7</xref>) and amide couplings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S8</xref>). Direct biochemical screening of crude reactions identified candidates that were resynthesized and in both cases were able to improve the potency of the parent compound. Soaking of crude reaction mixtures of the most potent biochemical hits into Mpro crystals provided complex structures with the identified hits (Chan-Lam - PDBs: 7GJJ/7GJZ resolution: 1.75√Ñ/1.65√Ö; Amide coupling PDBs: 7GNL/7GNQ resolution: 1.68√Ö/1.53√Ö). In both cases new interactions were discovered, explaining the improved activity. It is interesting to note, that while for the Chan Lam reaction campaign, the extended compounds indeed occupied the intended P4, for the amide-coupling vector, all compounds extended into the P3/5 pockets.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS102757-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Analysis of 367 complex crystal structures reveals hotspots for ligand engagement, and a variety of ways to engage substrate recognition subpockets.</title><p><bold>A:</bold> The five substrate recognition subpockets exhibit distinct preferences for intermolecular interactions.
