<abstract>
<p id="P1">COVID-19 vaccines are being developed urgently worldwide, among which single-shot adenovirus vectored vaccines represent a major approach. Here, we constructed two novel adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidates on simian adenovirus serotype 23 (Sad23L) and human adenovirus serotype 49 vectors (Ad49L) carrying the full-length gene of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), designated Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines, respectively. The immunogenicity elicited by these two vaccine strains was individually evaluated in mice. Specific humoral and cellular immune responses were proportionally observed in a dose-dependent manner, and stronger response was obtained by boosting. Furthermore, five rhesus macaques were intramuscularly injected with a dose of 5×10<sup>9</sup> PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine for prime vaccination, followed by boosting with 5×10<sup>9</sup> PFU of Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine at 4-week interval. Three macaques were injected with Sad23L-GFP and Ad49L-GFP vectorial viruses as negative controls. Both mice and macaques tolerated well the vaccine inoculations without detectable clinical or pathologic changes. In macaques, prime-boost vaccination regimen induced high titers of 10<sup>3.16</sup> S-binding antibody (S-BAb), 10<sup>2.75</sup> cell receptor binding domain (RBD)-BAb and 10<sup>2.38</sup> neutralizing antibody (NAb) to pseudovirus a week after boosting injection, followed by sustained high levels over 10 weeks of observation. Robust IFN-γ secreting T-cell response (712.6 SFCs/10<sup>6</sup> cells), IL-2 secreting T-cell response (334 SFCs/10<sup>6</sup> cells) and intracellular IFN-γ expressing CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response (0.39%/0.55%) to S peptides were detected in the vaccinated macaques. It was concluded that prime-boost immunization with Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines can safely elicit strong immunity in animals in preparation of clinical phase 1/2 trials.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) usually presents as severe acute respiratory syndrome triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), which has become globally pandemic and killed nearly one million people worldwide (WHO Coronavirus Disease [COVID-19] Dashboard) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Currently the most urgent need is to develop safe and effective vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P3">SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, encoding four structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). The S protein is a glycoprotein carrying the cell receptor binding domain (RBD), and is a major protective antigen that may elicit potent neutralizing antibody (NAb) and cellular immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Therefore, S protein has been the primary target antigen for developing recombinant vaccines.</p>
<p id="P4">According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report for a draft landscape of COVID-19 candidate vaccines on August 28, 2020, there are 33 vaccine candidates in clinical evaluation, which are mainly distributed across five types of biotechnological platforms, <italic>i.e</italic>., inactivated virus, DNA, RNA, protein subunit and non-replicating viral vector vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Among COVID-19 candidate vaccines in clinical trials, five non-replicating adenovirus vectored vaccines progressed to the frontline, of which one (CanSino Biological Inc./Beijing Institute of Biotechnology) has been approved for emerging use in Chinese military personal, one (Gamaleya Research Institute) has been registered in Russia, and two have been in initial phase III clinical trial (University of Oxford/AstraZeneca; Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies), and one in phase I clinical trial (ReiThera/LEUKOCARE/Univercells), respectively. Recombinant adenovirus vectors originated from various serotype of strains have displayed good safety profiles and induced broad and strong humoral and cellular immune responses, which have been widely used for research and development of vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Based on the published data regarding human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5), chimpanzee adenovirus type 25Y (ChAdOx1) and human adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vectorial COVID-19 vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), results showed that a single-shot vaccine prevented SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in rhesus macaques and hamsters, and elicited significant immune response in the majority of recipients in phase I/II clinical trials. However, relatively weaker protection in animals and lower immune response in humans were observed with a single dose of vaccine compared with prime-boost immunizations by two or three doses of inactivated virus or mRNA vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Enhancement of immune response was evidenced by prime and boost vaccination regimens with homologous boosting of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in animals and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), or with heterologous Ad26 and Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccines in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">In this study, two novel simian adenovirus type 23 (SAdV23) and human adenovirus type 49 (HAdV49) derived vectors (Sad23L and Ad49L) were used for developing the COVID-19 vaccines carrying the full-length S gene of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) designated Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines, respectively. These two adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccines presented high infectious titers and low frequencies of pre-existing immunity in humans. Immunogenicity was extensively evaluated in mice and rhesus macaques by prime-boost vaccinations with these two novel heterologous adenovirus vectored vaccines.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Production and characterization of Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines</title>
<p id="P7">An optimized and synthesized full-length S gene of SARS-CoV-2 was cloned into the deleted E1 region under cytomegalovirus (CMV) promotor regulation within two novel adenovirus vectorial Sad23L and Ad49L plasmids, designated as Sad23L-nCoV-S or Ad49L-nCoV-S, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The recombinant adenoviruses were rescued from HEK-293A. A large amount of Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S candidate vaccines were produced from HEK-293A cell cultures, and further purified and titrated over 10<sup>11</sup> PFU/ml.</p>
<p id="P8">Expression of S protein was verified in Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine strains infected HEK-293A cells by Western blot with rabbit polyclonal anti-RBD antibodies and COVID-19 patient’s serum IgG, respectively, but not in the Sad23L-GFP and Ad49L-GFP vectorial viruses infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The expression of S protein in the vaccine strains-infected HEK-293A cells was also observed in red color by an immunofluorescence staining, but not in the adenovirus-GFP infected control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). These results indicated that Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines could effectively produce SARS-CoV-2 S protein in the infected cells.</p>
<p id="P9">To measure pre-existing immunity to these two vectors, 600 healthy blood donor samples were collected from six cities crossing the south, north, east, west and central regions of China and were tested for neutralizing antibodies (NAb) reacting with Sad23L-GFP, Ad49L-GFP and Ad5-GFP viruses, respectively. The seroprevalence of Sad23L, Ad49L and Ad5 was 10.2%, 2.2% or 75.2% respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), indicating that Sad23L and Ad49L vectors had low pre-exposure rate in the Chinese population.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Animal tolerance of Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine inoculation</title>
<p id="P10">C57BL/6 mice (n=5 per group) were intramuscularly injected with individual Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines at doses of 10<sup>7</sup>, 10<sup>8</sup> and 10<sup>9</sup> PFU or by prime-boost immunization with these two adenovirus vectored vaccines (10<sup>9</sup> PFU/each) at 4 week interval and compared with vectors and PBS controls, respectively. Mice tolerated well the various doses of vaccines or vector controls at 28 or 56 days, presenting no obvious change of weight and body temperature when compared with injected PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In addition, histopathological examination of brain, lung, heart, liver, kidney and muscle tissues (at intramuscular injection site and para-tissues) did not present significant pathological lesions over 4 weeks following the prime only or prime-boost injections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">Vaccination (n=5) and sham control (n=3) groups of rhesus macaques (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) were first injected with 5×10<sup>9</sup> PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine or Sad23L-GFP control, and then at 4 week interval, animals were injected with a second dose of 5×10<sup>9</sup> PFU Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine or Ad49L-GFP control, respectively. During the course of immunization, clinical parameters were monitored for eight weeks. All monkeys displayed normal appetite and mental state, and no obvious change of weight and body temperature was observed with these eight animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Hematological and biochemical examination of blood samples showed no notable variation when comparing the vaccinated or vector control animals during 8 weeks pre-vaccination and post-vaccination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2; Table S2</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>A single-shot immunization of Sad23L-nCoV-S or Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine induced specific immune response in mice</title>
<p id="P12">To evaluate the immunogenicity of individual Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines, a single dose of 10<sup>7</sup>, 10<sup>8</sup> or 10<sup>9</sup> PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S or Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine was intramuscularly injected to C57BL/6 mice (n=5/group). Vector control groups (n=5/group) received 10<sup>9</sup> PFU Sad23L-GFP or Ad49L-GFP viruses, and naïve control group (n=5) received an equal volume of PBS, respectively. Four weeks post-immunization, titers of S or RBD binding antibody (S-BAb or RBD-BAb) were quantified by ELISA in a dose-dependent manner with both Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S immunized mice, but not in the control groups (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, A-D</xref>). A dose of 10<sup>9</sup> PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine induced antibody titers of 10<sup>4.27</sup> S-BAb and 10<sup>3.98</sup> RBD-BAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>), while the same dose of Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine induced titers of 10<sup>3.02</sup> S-BAb and 10<sup>2.42</sup> RBD-BAb, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">The neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers to SARS-CoV-2 were titrated in two individual vaccine immunized mice by surrogate virus based NAb test (sVNT) and pseudovirus-based NAb test (pVNT) at 50% inhibitory dilution (ID<sub>50</sub>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, E-H</xref>). A dose of 10<sup>9</sup> PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine induced NAb titers of 10<sup>2.41</sup> sVNT(ID<sub>50</sub>) and 10<sup>2.79</sup> pVNT (ID<sub>50</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>), and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine induced titers of 10<sup>1.38</sup> sVNT (ID<sub>50</sub>) and 10<sup>1.57</sup> pVNT(ID<sub>50</sub>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, G and H</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">Specific T-cell response of isolated splenocytes was examined in vaccinated and sham mice after stimulation with S peptides, S protein and RBD protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, I-N</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). A single dose of Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine elicited strong specific IFN-γ secreting T cell response to S peptides (450.2-898.4 SFCs/million cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>) and S protein (81.5-246.8 SFCs/million cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J</xref>), while a dose of Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine induced similar pattern of IFN-γ secreting T cell response (336.8-857.1 or 82.8-232 SFCs/million cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, K and L</xref>). Both vaccines elicited T cell response significantly higher than sham controls (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), but response to RBD protein was not significantly different (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3, A and B</xref>). Specific intracellular levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response to S peptides were measured by ICS, in which significantly higher frequency of IFN-γ and TNF-α but not IL-2 expressing CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells was found in both Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccinated mice compared to sham mice (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, M and N</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3, C-F</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">Overall, individual Sad23L-nCoV-S or Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccinated mice developed specific BAb and NAb antibodies and T cell responses to S protein, RBD protein or S peptides of SARS-CoV-2 in a dose-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting strong immunogenicity of the two novel adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>Prime-boost immunization of mice with Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines</title>
<p id="P16">To further improve reactivity and longevity of immune response to vaccines, the prime-boost vaccination regimen was utilized to immunize C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice (n=5/group) with a prime dose of 10<sup>9</sup> PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S on day 0 and a boost dose of 10<sup>9</sup> PFU Ad49L-nCoV-S on day 28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). In comparison with prime immunization with Sad23L-nCoV-S, a booster with Ad49L-nCoV-S significantly increased BAb and NAb titers in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, B-G</xref>), and titers were maintained at high level for 10 weeks of monitoring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, D and G</xref>). Profiling of IgG subclasses showed a predominant serum IgG2a to RBD protein associating with Th1 response in prime-boost vaccinated mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Regarding specific T cell response, the boosting with Ad49L-sCoV-S on Sad23L-nCoV-S prime immunization enhanced or stabilized specific IFN-γ-secretion T cell responses to S peptides, S protein or RBD protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>), as well as levels of intracellular cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α but not of IL-2 response to S peptides compared with single dose of vaccine vaccinated or sham control C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">Taken together, the results suggest that prime-boost vaccination of two species of mice with Sad23L-nCoV-S followed by Ad49L-nCoV-S enhanced specific immune response to SARS-CoV-2 when compared with prime vaccination only with a single-shot of Sad23L-nCoV-S or Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine.</p>

<sec id="S7">
<title>Rhesus macaques’ specific immune response to prime-boost vaccination with combined Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines</title>
<p id="P18">Eight rhesus macaques aged 11-14 years were selected and tested for the baseline values of antibody and T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 S from blood samples in pre-vaccination at week -1 or week 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The pre-existing NAb titer to Sad23L, Ad49L or Ad5 was detected &lt; 1:10 in serum samples from all eight animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table. S1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">Five rhesus macaques were intramuscularly injected first with a dose of 5×10<sup>9</sup> PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine, then with a boost injection of 5×10<sup>9</sup> PFU Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine 4 weeks later, while three sham rhesus macaques controls were injected with equal doses of Sad23L-GFP and Ad49L-GFP viruses, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Blood samples were collected weekly from these two groups of animals. Both BAb (S-BAb and RBD-BAb) and NAb (sVNT and pVNT) levels were titrated in the vaccinated group but not in sham group. BAb and NAb reactivity increased at week 2 post prime-immunization, at week 4 (W0 for boost-immunization), at weeks 5 and 6 and then stayed at high levels up to week 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5, B-E</xref>). Titers of 10<sup>3.16</sup> S-BAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>), 10<sup>2.75</sup> RBD-BAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), 10 <sup>2.01</sup> sVNT(ID<sub>50</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>) and 10<sup>2.38</sup> pVNT(ID<sub>50</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>) were quantified and found higher than the corresponding antibody titers found in sera from 25 asymptomatic, 14 mild and 9 severe COVID-19 convalescent patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5, B-E</xref>). Strong correlation between BAb and NAb titers was observed (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, R=0.784-0.927; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5, F and G</xref>), suggesting the reliability of these antibody quantitative assays.</p>

Prime vaccination with a dose of Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine induced an increase of IFN-γ secreting T cell response to S peptides (406.6-526.3 SFCs/million cells) at weeks 2 and 4 post prime-vaccination, and then boosting with a dose of Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines enhanced the IFN-γ secreting T cell response (583.9-712.6 SFCs/million cells) at weeks 5 to 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). IFN-γ secreting T cell reaction to S and RBD proteins stayed at high levels after prime-boost immunizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6, B and C</xref>). Relatively high IL-2 secreting T cell response to S peptides, S and RBD proteins was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6, D-F</xref>), but weak IL-4 secreting T cell response by ELISpot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). Frequency of intracellular IFN-γ expressing CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses to S peptides was observed in vaccinated macaques at weeks 2 to 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6, G-J</xref>), significantly higher than observed in pre-vaccination and sham controls (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P23">A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine is one of the most wanted goods in the world. Among 33 COVID-19 candidate vaccines in clinical trials (WHO report on 28 August 2020) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), 9 vaccines have initiated clinical phase III trial, and experimental data from pre-clinical and/or clinical studies have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). In the frontline of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in clinical trial phase III, the range of approaches includes three inactivated virus, two lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA and four non-replicating adenovirus vectored vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Beyond general comments on the disadvantages of major types of COVID-19 vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), the limitations of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are crucial biosafety concerns regarding large amounts of infectious virus being processed above biological safety level-3 (BSL-3) condition and production capacity; for LNP-mRNA vaccines instability and lack of evidence for efficacy are puzzling; for adenovirus vectored vaccines, pre-existing immunity to the carrier virus and the relative weakness of single-shot immunization appear limiting factors.</p>
<p id="P24">In this study, we generated two novel adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccines encoding the full-length S gene of SARS-CoV-2. The intact S glycoprotein rather than the shorter S or RBD proteins was shown to be the most effective antigen eliciting protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection in DNA vaccines and Ad26 vectored vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). The vectors Sad23L and Ad49L originated from simian adenovirus type 23 and human adenovirus type 49, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), are novel adenoviral vector. Comparing Ad5-vectored COVID-19, ChAdox1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), three attractive aspects emphasized in this study are highlighted below.</p>
<p id="P25">Firstly, there is a low-seroprevalence of pre-existing antibodies to Sad23L and Ad49L vectors in humans. According to the investigation of NAb to three types of adenoviruses in Chinese population, the prevalence of both Sad23L and Ad49L NAb was below 10%, while the prevalence of Ad5 NAb was over 75% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). However, the pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity might partly limit vaccine effectiveness, especially for populations aged over 50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), while the low seroprevalence of antibodies to novel adenoviral vectors such as ChAdox1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), Ad26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), and Sad23L and Ad49L used in this study might avoid a negative impact on vaccine efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>).</p>
<p id="P26">Secondly, the prime-boost vaccination regimen with two heterologous adenoviruses vectored Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines examined in mice and rhesus macaques suggested that the boost with Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine significantly enhanced the levels of neutralizing antibody and IFN-γ expressing CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses following prime-immunization with Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In addition, specific IFN-γ secretion T cell response was prolonged at high level after boosting vaccination. Two recent publications compared prime only with a single-dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and homologous boost with a second dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in mice and pigs, and human clinical trials, showed that boost vaccination significantly increased and prolonged the level of binding or neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). By boosting with Ad5-S vaccine the Ad26-S vaccine primed immunization, a higher level of immunity was observed in humans as reported in a recent Russian study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Compared with homologous boosting of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or boosting of Ad5-S vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), heterologous prime-boost vaccinations with Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines have the advantage of avoiding vector’s immunity interfering with prime vaccination or enhancing pre-existing Ad5 immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).</p>
<p id="P27">Thirdly, in order to achieve an effective vaccine immunity, a low dose of two heterologous adenovirus vectored vaccines (&lt;5×10<sup>10</sup> vp) with prime-boost immunization regimen should theoretically reduce severe adverse reaction induced by a high dose of adenovirus vectored vaccine (&gt;5×10<sup>10</sup> vp) with prime only immunization in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). In this study, a relatively low dose of Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines elicited a robust immunity in both young mice and older rhesus macaques (aged 11-14 years), but no obvious clinical symptoms or histopathological changes were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1; Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P28">There are two limitations to this work. Considering biosafety and restriction for SARS-CoV-2 virus manipulation, conventional live virus neutralization test (cVNT) and virus injection challenge experiments have not been performed in this study. However, sVNT and pVNT reported in this study have well demonstrated a significant correlation with cVNT in NAb titers to SARS-CoV-2 (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, <italic>R</italic>=0.7678-0.8591) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). This was also evidenced by close correlation between ELISA and pVNT or cVNT by other studies using adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccines in rhesus macaques (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, <italic>R</italic>=0.8314-0.8427) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), hamsters (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001; <italic>R</italic>=0.7849) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) and human clinical phase II trial (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, <italic>R</italic>=0.72-0.75) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). In addition, compared with a panel of convalescent serum samples from COVID-19 patients the level of binding or neutralizing antibodies observed in this study was favorable and in line with all other published data from COVID-19 vaccines. Protective efficacy of Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines for prime-boost vaccination of animals might be referred to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or Ad26.COV2.S vaccine immunized rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), because Sad23L and ChAdOx1, Ad49L and Ad26 were classified in the same species E or D of adenoviruses, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p>
<p id="P29">In conclusion, two novel adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccines were produced, which could, when used in succession, safely elicit robust humoral and T-cell immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in mice and Rhesus macaques. Prime-boost vaccination regimen with priming of Sad23L-nCoV-S and boosting of Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines were recommended to develop the better protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in humans. These two vaccines are being planned for clinical phase I/II trials after an extensive safety evaluation has been carried out in pre-clinical animal examination.</p>
