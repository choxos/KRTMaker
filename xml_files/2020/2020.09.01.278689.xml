<abstract>
<p id="P2">A spike protein mutation D614G became dominant in SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the mutational impact on viral spread and vaccine efficacy remains to be defined. Here we engineer the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain and characterize its effect on viral replication, pathogenesis, and antibody neutralization. The D614G mutation significantly enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, through an improved infectivity of virions with the spike receptor-binding domain in an “up” conformation for binding to ACE2 receptor. Hamsters infected with D614 or G614 variants developed similar levels of weight loss. However, the G614 virus produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, than the D614 virus. The hamster results confirm clinical evidence that the D614G mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increases transmission. For antibody neutralization, sera from D614 virus-infected hamsters consistently exhibit higher neutralization titers against G614 virus than those against D614 virus, indicating that (i) the mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and (ii) therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus before clinical development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China in late 2019<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused &gt;25 million confirmed infections and &gt;850,000 fatalities worldwide. Hospitals and public health systems were overwhelmed first in Wuhan, followed by Italy, Spain, New York City, and other major cities, before cases peaked in these locations. Although most infections are mild, SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe, life-threatening pneumonia, particularly in older age groups and those with chronic pulmonary and cardiac conditions, diabetes, and other comorbidities. The exact mechanisms of severe disease remain unclear but typically involve a dysregulated, hyperinflammatory response following the initial stages of viral infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. However, in addition to the host response, variation in viral strain phenotypes could also contribute to disease severity and spread efficiency.</p>
<p id="P4">Coronaviruses have evolved a genetic proofreading mechanism to maintain their long RNA genomes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. Despite the low sequence diversity of SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>, mutations that mediate amino acid substitutions in the spike protein, which interacts with cellular receptors such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to mediate entry into cells, can strongly influence host range, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis. During the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002-2003, one such mutation was shown to mediate adaptation for infection of the intermediate civet host as well as for interhuman transmission<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. For SARS-CoV-2, analyses of over 28,000 spike protein gene sequences in late May 2020 revealed a D614G amino acid substitution that was rare before March but increased in frequency as the pandemic spread<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>, reaching over 74% of all published sequences by June 2020<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. The D614G substitution was accompanied by three other mutations: a C-to-T mutation in the 5′ untranslated genome region at position 241, a synonymous C-to-T mutation at position 3,037, and a nonsynonymous C-to-T mutation at position 14,408 in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. This set of mutations not only increased globally, but during co-circulation within individual regions during outbreaks, suggesting a fitness advantage rather than simply founder effects or genetic drift. The association of spike protein amino acid substitutions with coronavirus transmissibility suggested that the D614G substitution was critical to this putative selective sweep. The correlation of this mutation with higher nasopharyngeal viral RNA loads in COVID-19 patients<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup> also supported a putative advantage of the mutant in transmission, which is key for viral fitness. However, direct measurements of fitness were needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p>
<p id="P5">Initial phenotypic characterizations of the D614G spike substitution were performed using pseudotyped viruses, whereby vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and lentiviral particles incorporating the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone were studied by replication kinetics. The production of significantly higher pseudotyped viral titers in multiple cell types by the G614 spike variant suggested that this substitution could be associated with enhanced entry into cells and replication in the airways of infected patients<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. However, these results need to be confirmed in studies with authentic SARS-CoV-2 containing the spike 614 variant, and also using <italic>in vivo</italic> studies with a suitable animal model. Therefore, using an infectious cDNA clone for SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>, we generated the D614G substitution in the January 2020 USA-WA1/2020 strain<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup> and performed experimental comparisons using <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture, a primary human 3D airway tissue, and a hamster infection model<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. We also developed a pair of D614 and G614 mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 viruses that could be used for rapid neutralization testing of serum specimens and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Using the reporter SARS-CoV-2 viruses, we analyzed the effect of D614G mutation on susceptibility to neutralization. Our study has important implications in understanding the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the development of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutic antibodies.</p>

<title>Enhancement of viral replication and infectivity by the spike D614G substitution in human lung epithelial cells</title>
<p id="P6">We first examined the effect of the spike D614G substitution on viral replication in cell culture. A site-directed mutagenesis was performed on an infectious cDNA clone of SARS-CoV-2 to prepare a pair of recombinant isogeneic viruses with spike D614 or G614 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Similar infectious amounts of D614 and G614 viruses were recovered from Vero E6 cells (monkey kidney epithelial cells), with viral titers of 1×10<sup>8</sup> and 8×10<sup>7</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml, respectively. The two viruses formed similar plaque morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In Vero E6 cells, the G614 virus replicated to a higher infectious titer than D614 at 12 h post-infection (hpi), after which the two viruses replicated to comparable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). A similar trend was observed for extracellular viral RNA production from the infected Vero E6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). To compare the infectivity between the two viruses, we calculated the genomic RNA/PFU ratios; no significant differences were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), indicating that the D614G mutation does not affect viral replication or virion infectivity on Vero E6 cells.</p>
<p id="P7">Next, we compared the replication kinetics of D614 and G614 viruses on the human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells. After infection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 PFU/ml, the G614 virus produced modest 1.2-, 2.4-, and 1.9-fold more infectious virus than the D614 virus at 24, 36, and 48 hpi, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>), indicating that D614G enhances viral replication. In contrast, the G614-infected cells produced less (at 24 and 36 hpi) or equivalent (at 48 hpi) extracellular viral RNA compared to D614-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). The genomic RNA/PFU ratios of D614 virus were therefore 1.9- to 3.0-fold higher than those of G614 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>), indicating that the D614G mutation increases the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 produced from the human lung cell line.</p>
<p id="P8">To explore the mechanism of increased infectivity of G614 virus produced from Calu-3 cells, we compared the spike protein processing from D614 and G614 viruses. Virions were purified from the culture medium of infected Calu-3 using ultracentrifugation and a sucrose cushion. The pelleted viruses were analyzed for spike protein processing by Western blot, with nucleocapsid included as a loading control. For both viruses, full-length spike was almost completely processed to the S1/S2 cleavage form and S2’, with comparable cleavage efficiencies of 93% for D614 and 95% for G614 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). When virions produced from Vero E6 cells were analyzed, less full-length spike protein was processed to the S1/S2 form, with cleavage efficiencies of 73% for D614 and 67% for G614 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref>). These results suggest that (i) more spike protein is cleaved to S1/S2 within virions produced from Calu-3 cells than those produced from Vero E6 cells and (ii) the D614G substitution does not significantly affect the spike cleavage ratio.</p>

<title>Increased fitness in the hamster upper airway of SARS-CoV-2 with the D614G substitution</title>
<p id="P9">The <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of the S-D614G mutation was evaluated in the golden Syrian hamster model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). After intranasally infecting four- to five-week-old hamsters with 2×10<sup>4</sup> PFU of D614 or G614 virus, animals from both groups exhibited similar mean weight losses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). No visible illness was observed in either infected cohort. On day 2 postinfection (pi), infectious viral titers from nasal washes, trachea, and various lobes of the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>) were consistently higher in the G614-infected subjects compared to the D614-infected animals, although the differences did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The viral titer differences were greater in the upper airway samples than those in the lower airway tissues. On day 4 pi, the differences in infectious viral titers between the two viruses became more significant in the upper airway, with 1.3 log<sub>10</sub> PFU/ml higher G614 virus than D614 in nasal wash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The trachea had 0.9 log<sub>10</sub> PFU/g higher G614 virus than D614, but the statistical significance was lost upon correction for multiple comparisons. The viral loads in various lung lobes were nearly identical, with ≤0.1 log<sub>10</sub> PFU/g differential between the two viruses. No infectious virus was detected in any airway tissues on day 7 pi (data not shown). Overall, the results demonstrate that the D614G mutation leads to a higher infectious virus production and shedding in the upper airway of infected hamsters.</p>
<p id="P10">We compared the infectivity of the D614 and G614 viruses produced in hamsters by determining their viral RNA levels and viral RNA/PFU ratios. In contrast to the higher infectious titers for G614 than D614 virus, the two viruses produced nearly identical levels of viral RNA across all organs and timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2d</xref>). The RNA/PFU ratios of G614 virus were 0.3 log<sub>10</sub> to 0.7 log<sub>10</sub> lower than those of D614 virus across airway tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). On day 4 pi, a 1.1 log<sub>10</sub> lower RNA/PFU ratio was detected for G614 than D614 in nasal wash, while the differences in the trachea and lungs were 0.1 log<sub>10</sub> to 0.3 log<sub>10</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). On day 7 pi., despite no detectable infectious virus (detection limit 40 PFU/ml), more than 10<sup>8</sup> viral RNA copies/ml were detected in the nasal washes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), demonstrating high levels of viral RNA persistence after the clearance of infectious virus; this result recapitulates findings in COVID-19 patients, who frequently tested positive with RT-PCR for up to several weeks but have low or undetectable infectious virus. One caveat of the above RNA/PFU calculation was that the total RNA could include viral RNAs from both virions and lysed cells during sample processing. Nevertheless, the results suggest that mutation D614G may enhance the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract, particularly in the upper airway of infected animals.</p>
<p id="P11">The above results prompted us to directly compare the finesses of D614 and G614 viruses through a competition experiment. This approach has major advantages over performing individual strain infections with numerous host replicates; each competition is internally controlled, eliminating host-to-host variation that can reduce the power of experiments, and the virus strain ratios can be assayed with more precision than individual virus titers. Thus, competition assays have been used for many studies of microbial fitness, including viruses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. To perform the competition between D614 and G614 variants, we intranasally infected hamsters with equal amounts of the two viruses (10<sup>4</sup> PFU per virus). Since the infecting viruses were prepared from Vero E6 cells with comparable viral RNA/PFU ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), the animals also received equivalent levels of D614 and G614 viral RNA. On days 2, 4, and 7 pi, nasal wash and respiratory organs were harvested and quantified for relative amounts of D614 and G614 RNAs by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The ratios of G614/D614 RNA were then calculated from the electropherograms to indicate the relative fitness for viral replication. A G614/D614 ratio of &gt;1.0 or &lt;1.0 indicates a replication advantage for G614 or D614, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">i</xref>, all respiratory tissues showed G614/D614 ratios of 1.2 to 2.6 on days 2, 4, and 7 pi, indicating that G614 virus has a consistent advantage over D614 virus when infecting the respiratory tract of hamsters.</p>

<title>Dramatic enhancement of viral replication by spike mutation D614G in a primary human airway tissue model</title>
<p id="P12">To further define the function of D614G mutation in human respiratory tract, we characterized the replication of D614 and G614 viruses in a primary human airway tissue model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). This airway model contains human tracheal/bronchial epithelial cells in multilayers which resemble the epithelial tissue of the respiratory tract. The primary tissue is cultured at an air-liquid interface to recapitulate the barrier, microciliary response, and infection of human airway tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. After infecting the airway tissue at an MOI of 5, both D614 and G614 viruses produced increasing infectious titers from day 1 to 5, up to 7.8×10<sup>5</sup> PFU/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), demonstrating that the airway tissue supports SARS-CoV-2 replication. The infectious viral titers of G614 were significantly higher (2.1- to 8.6-fold) than those of D614 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In contrast, no differences in viral RNA yields were observed between the two viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The genomic RNA/PFU ratios of D614 virus were 1.4- to 5.3-fold higher than those of G614 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Sequencing of the D614 and G614 viruses collected on day 5 pi did not show any other mutations. Collectively, the results demonstrate that substitution D614G enhances viral replication through increased virion infectivity when SARS-CoV-2 replicates on primary human upper airway tissues.</p>
<p id="P13">Next, we performed competition experiments to directly compare the replication fitness of D614 and G614 viruses in the human airway culture. After infecting with a 1:1 infectious ratio of D614 and G614 viruses (produced from Vero E6 cells), the G614/D614 ratios increased to 1.2, 3.7, 8.2, 8.8, and 13.9 on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 pi, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). In addition, after infecting the airway culture with 3:1 ratio of D614 and G614 viruses, the G614 variant was able to rapidly overcome its initial deficit to reach a slight advantage with a G614/D614 ratio of 1.2 by day 1 pi, with that advantage increasing to 9.1-fold by day 5 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Furthermore, when infecting the airway tissue with 9:1 ratio of D614 and G614 viruses, the G614/D614 ratios increased from 1.4 to 5.2 from days 1 to 5 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). A similar competition result was obtained when the experiment was repeated using a different donor-derived human airway culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). These competition results confirm that the G614 virus can rapidly outcompete the D614 virus when infecting human airway tissues, even initially as a minor variant in a mixed population.</p>

<title>Effect of spike mutation D614G on neutralization susceptibility</title>

<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. An important question is whether substitution D614G could reduce vaccine efficacy, assuming G614 virus continues to circulate. To address this question, we measured the neutralization titers of a panel of sera collected from hamsters that were previously infected with D614 SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). Each serum was analyzed by a pair of mNeonGreen reporter SARS-CoV-2 viruses with the D614 or G614 spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. The mNeonGreen gene was engineered at the open-reading-frame 7 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4a</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">c</xref>, all sera exhibited 1.4- to 2.3-fold higher neutralization titers (mean 1.7-fold) against G614 virus than those against D614 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>), suggesting that mutation D614G may confer higher susceptibility to serum neutralization.</p>
<p id="P15">To further examine the role of D614G mutation in antibody recognition and neutralization, we evaluated a panel of eleven human receptor-binding domain (RBD) mAbs against the D614 and G614 mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The details of these RBD mAbs are reported elsewhere (An et al., submitted for publication). One mAb (mAb18) showed a 2.1-fold higher potency against G614 than D614 virus, whereas the other ten mAbs exhibited similar neutralization activities against both viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4d</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Figs. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P16">We demonstrated that the spike substitution D614G enhanced SARS-CoV-2 replication in the upper respiratory tract through increased virion infectivity. Compared with the original D614 virus, the emergent, now dominant G614 virus replicated to a higher level in the human lung Calu-3 cells and primary human upper airway tissues. The replication differences were more dramatically observed in the human airway culture, with up to a 13.9-fold advantage when the two viruses were compared in a head-to-head competition test. The increased replication fitness corelated with an enhanced specific infectivity of the G614 virion. Since previous studies with pseudotyped virus showed that the cleavage efficiency of the spike protein into S1/S2 modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>, we compared the S1/S2 ratios between the D614 and G614 virions. Although virions produced from Calu-3 cells had more complete S1/S2 cleavage than those produced form Vero E6 cells, no substantial differences in spike cleavage were detectable between the D614 and G614 virions produced from either cell type, suggesting that the enhanced virion infectivity is not likely due to the D614G-mediated spike cleavage difference. Our results from authentic SARS-CoV-2 are in contrast with previous studies reporting that the D614G mutation changes the cleavage and shedding of spike protein when expressed alone or in the context of pseudotyped virions<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. Mechanistically, two recent studies showed that the D614G mutation abolishes a hydrogen-bond interaction with T859 from a neighboring protomer of the spike trimer<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>, which allosterically promotes the RDB domain to an “up” conformation for receptor ACE2 binding and fusion<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>, leading to an enhanced virion infectivity.</p>
<p id="P17">The higher viral loads of G614 in the upper airway of COVID-19 patients<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup> and infected hamsters support the role of D614G mutation in viral transmissibility. The robust replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the human upper airway may be partially conferred by a higher ACE2 receptor expression in the nasal cavity compared to that in the lower respiratory tract<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. Patients infected with G614 virus developed higher levels of viral RNA in the nasopharyngeal swabs than those infected with D614 virus, but disease severity is not associated with the D614G mutation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. Our hamster infection model recapitulated these clinical findings: The G614 virus developed higher infectious titers than the D614 virus in nasal washes and tracheas, but not lungs; no differences in weight loss or signs of disease were observed between the G614- and D614-infected animals. If the lower viral RNA/PFU ratio of the G614 virus observed in our hamster and human airway models could be extrapolated to COVID-19 patients, the modest differences in cycle threshold (Ct) values of RT-qPCR observed in patients’ nasopharyngeal swabs would translate to ≥10-fold infectious G614 virus, underscoring the potential for enhanced transmission and spread. This potential is further bolstered by the observation that a COVID-19 patient with two distinct populations of SARS-CoV-2 in the throat swabs and sputum samples only transmitted the throat strain to individuals downstream in the transmission chain<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. Similar nasal-driven transmission was recently reported for human influenza A virus in a ferret model<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P18">Our results showed that G614 virus is consistently more susceptible to neutralization by sera collected from D614 virus-infected hamsters. The increased susceptibility of G614 virus to serum neutralization generated by D614 seems counterintuitive, but could be explained by the D614G-mediated increase in the “up” conformation of the RDB for binding to ACE2 receptor<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. Since current COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials are based on the original D614 sequence, our neutralization result mitigates the concern that the D614G mutation might compromise the efficacy of vaccines against the circulating G614 virus. Future studies are needed to eliminate this concern by testing human sera collected from the D614 spike vaccinatees. Besides antisera, we also showed that, depending on the epitope locations on RBD, the neutralizing potency of certain mAbs may be affected by the D614G mutation. The results underscore the importance to test therapeutic mAbs against G614 and other newly emerged mutant viruses during preclinical development.</p>
<p id="P19">In summary, we have used authentic SARS-CoV-2 to demonstrate that spike substitution D614G enhances viral replication in the upper respiratory tract and increases neutralization susceptibility. These findings have important implications in understanding the evolution and spread of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine efficacy, and therapeutic antibody development.</p>

<p id="P35">For virus competition experiments, relative replicative fitness values for G614 strain over D614 strain were analyzed according to w=(f0/i0), where i0 is the initial D614/G614 ratio and f0 is the final D614/G614 ratio after competition. Sanger sequencing (initial timepoint T0) counts for each virus strain being compared were based upon average counts over three replicate samples of inocula per experiment, and post-infection (timepoint T1) counts were taken from samples of individual subjects. For the primary human airway samples, multiple experiments were performed, so that f0/i0 was clustered by experiment. To model f0/i0, the ratio T0/T1 was found separately for each subject in each strain group, log (base-10) transformed to an improved approximation of normality, and modeled by analysis of variance with relation to group, adjusting by experiment when appropriate to control for clustering within experiment. Specifically, the model was of the form Log10_CountT1overCountT0 ~ Experiment + Group. Fitness ratios between the two groups [the model’s estimate of w=(f0/i0)] were assessed per the coefficient of the model’s Group term, which was transformed to the original scale as 10^coefficient. This modeling approach compensates for any correlation due to clustering within experiment similarly to that of corresponding mixed effect models, and is effective since the number of experiments was small.

<title>Importance</title>
</caption>
<p>Understanding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for disease control and prevention. A spike protein mutation D614G emerged and became dominant soon after the pandemic started. By engineering the D614G mutation into an authentic wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain, we demonstrate the importance of this mutation to (i) enhanced viral replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, (ii) improved viral fitness in the upper airway of infected hamsters, and (iii) increased susceptibility to neutralization. Together with clinical findings, our work underscores the importance of this mutation in viral spread, vaccine efficacy, and antibody therapy.</p>

For all graphs, error bars represent standard deviations. Weight loss (a) was analyzed by two-factor ANOVA with virus strain and timepoint as fixed factors, and a Tukey’s post-hoc test to compare all cohort pairs at a given timepoint. All other datasets (b-f) were analyzed by measures two-factor ANOVA with virus strain and tissue as fixed factors, and a Sidak’s post-hoc test to compare D614 versus G614 within a given tissue. For the competition assay (g-i), 100 μl mixtures of equal D614 and G614 viruses (10<sup>4</sup> PFU per virus) were inoculated intranasally into 4- to 5-week-old Syrian hamsters. The initial ratio of D614 and G614 viruses is 1:1.

<bold>(a)</bold> Experimental scheme. D614 and G614 viruses were inoculated onto the primary human airway tissues. After incubation at 37°C for 2 h, the culture was washed with DPBS for three times to remove the un-attached virus. The culture was maintained at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 5 days. On each day, 300 μl DPBS was added onto the culture.

Human airway tissues were infected with D614 or G614 virus at an MOI of 5. The amounts of infectious virus (b) and genomic RNA (c) were quantified by plaque assay and real-time RT-qPCR, respectively. The genomic RNA/PFU ratio (d) was calculated to indicate virion infectivity. The results were pooled from two independent biological replicates. Data are presented as means ± standard deviations. <italic>P</italic> values were determined by two-tailed Mann– Whitney test. <bold>(e,f)</bold> Competition assay. A mixture of D614 and G614 viruses with different initial ratios were inoculated onto the human airway tissues at a total MOI of 5. The initial D614/G614 virus ratio was 1:1 (e), 3:1(f), or 9:1(g). The G614/D614 ratios after competition were measure by Sanger sequencing and analyzed using R statistical software. The distribution of the model-adjusted means is illustrated by catseye plots with shaded +/- standard error (SD) overlaid by scatterplots of subject measures; scatterplots have been randomly jittered horizontally for clarity, and are shown on the log<sub>10</sub> scale such that comparisons are a null value of 1. *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, ** <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.01, *** <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.001.</p>
