<abstract>
<p id="P2">Of the 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps) encoded by SARS CoV-2, Nsp3 is the largest and plays important roles in the viral life cycle. Being a large, multidomain, transmembrane protein, Nsp3 has been the most challenging Nsp to characterize. Encoded within Nsp3 is the papain-like protease PLpro domain that cleaves not only the viral protein but also polyubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like modifier ISG15 from host cells. We here compare the interactors of PLpro and Nsp3 and find a largely overlapping interactome. Intriguingly, we find that near full length Nsp3 is a more active protease compared to the minimal catalytic domain of PLpro. Using a MALDI-TOF based assay, we screen 1971 approved clinical compounds and identify five compounds that inhibit PLpro with IC<sub>50</sub>s in the low micromolar range but showed cross reactivity with other human deubiquitinases and had no significant antiviral activity in cellular SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. We therefore looked for alternative methods to block PLpro activity and engineered competitive nanobodies that bind to PLpro at the substrate binding site with nanomolar affinity thus inhibiting the enzyme. Our work highlights the importance of studying Nsp3 and provides tools and valuable insights to investigate Nsp3 biology during the viral infection cycle.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">COVID-19 has taken a significant toll on human life and has impacted society in unprecedented ways. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 interacts with human cells and the functions of the different viral proteins in establishing infection is of paramount importance. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps) which play different roles in the viral life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Wu <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Nsp3, the largest of the Nsps, is a 217 kDa multidomain membrane protein that is a key component of the viral replication and transcription complex assembled on host cell membranes where replication and transcription of the viral genome occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Angelini <italic>et al</italic>, 2013;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wolff <italic>et al</italic>, 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">2020b</xref>). Another essential role of Nsp3 is its function as a protease. Encoded within Nsp3 is the papain-like protease (PLpro<sup>CoV-2</sup>) that cleaves between Nsp1-Nsp2, Nsp2-Nsp3 and Nsp3-Nsp4 to release Nsp1, Nsp2 and Nsp3 from the viral polypeptide. While several coronaviruses express two PLpro enzymes, SARS-CoV-2 only expresses one PLpro enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Barretto <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">PLpro<sup>CoV-2</sup> shows many similarities to the PLpro encoded by SARS, PLpro<sup>SARS</sup>. The structure of PLpro is similar to that of human ubiquitin specific protease (USP) deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which resembles an extended or open hand with thumb, palm and fingers subdomains that mediate contacts with substrate to form the S1 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Shin <italic>et al</italic>, 2020;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Klemm <italic>et al</italic>, 2020;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Ratia <italic>et al</italic>, 2014;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chou <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). In addition to processing viral polypeptides, PLpro possesses deubiquitylating and deISGylating activities as it can also efficiently cleave ubiquitin and ISG15 modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bailey-Elkin <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Ubiquitylation and ISGylation, the covalent attachment of ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like modifier (Ubl) ISG15 respectively to proteins, are important posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in host innate immune antiviral and inflammatory signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Swatek &amp; Komander, 2016</xref>). ISG15 is an interferon-stimulated gene whose expression is induced following viral infection and is important to host antiviral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Perng &amp; Lenschow, 2018</xref>). PLpro<sup>SARS</sup> has a unique mode of action as it recognizes ubiquitin at an additional S2 ubiquitin-binding site in order to bind and cleave K48-linked ubiquitin chains from substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Békés <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">2016</xref>). ISG15 contains two connected Ubl domains which together resemble diubiquitin that can bind to the S1 and S2 sites. These additional protease activities of PLpro antagonize host ubiquitylation and ISGylation to effectively subvert antiviral signalling and the host immune response. These multifaceted roles of PLpro render it essential for viral replication, thereby making it an attractive therapeutic target for COVID-19.</p>
<p id="P5">Given the large size of Nsp3, PLpro and the other domains in Nsp3 have each been individually characterized in detail. However, most studies have examined only the minimal proteolytic PLpro domain and there is little known about the influence of the other domains in Nsp3 on protease activity and function. In the present study, we perform detailed biochemical characterization of minimal PLpro<sup>CoV-2</sup> and compare it with the protease activity of Nsp3<sup>CoV-2</sup>. We make the surprising observation that extended Nsp3 is a more active protease cleaving both ISG15 and K48-linked chains with greater efficiency. Intriguingly, while Nsp3 can very efficiently cleave the viral polypeptide Nsp1-Nsp2, the minimal PLpro is unable to cleave this fusion. To find inhibitors of PLpro, we employed a high-throughput MALDI TOF-based assay to screen 1971 FDA approved compounds and identify inhibitors of the protease with IC<sub>50</sub> values in the 1-10 μM range. Despite displaying good inhibition <italic>in vitro,</italic> none of the inhibitors show any efficacy in blocking viral replication in a SARS-CoV-2 viral infection model. We therefore engineered nanobodies that bind to and inhibit PLpro in the nanomolar range. These nanobodies will be valuable tools to identify cellular substrates of Nsp3 and to investigate Nsp3 biology.</p>

<title>Characterization of protease activity of PLpro and Nsp3</title>
<p id="P6">PLpro is a multifunctional enzyme with three distinct protease activities that catalyse the cleavage of (i) K48-linked polyubiquitin, (ii) ISG15 and (iii) viral polypeptides. To understand how PLpro can cleave these structurally distinct substrates and to characterize these three activities further, we first generated appropriate substrates. As previously observed for PLpro<sup>SARS</sup>, PLpro<sup>CoV-2</sup> is also selective at cleaving K48-linked chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>), and shows a similar mode of cleavage by cleaving triubiquitin into diubiquitin and monoubiquitin as final products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Békés <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Monitoring the cleavage of proISG15, which carries an 8-residue peptide at the C-terminus of ISG15, shows that PLpro is also very active towards ISG15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). Processing of the viral polypeptide involves cleavage between Nsp1-Nsp2, Nsp2-Nsp3 and Nsp3-Nsp4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). To monitor the cleavage of the viral polypeptide, we expressed and purified full length Nsp1 fused to the first 19 amino acids of Nsp2 (Nsp1-2Δ). When used as a substrate in cleavage assays, we were surprised to find that PLpro is unable to cleave Nsp1-2Δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). To confirm this observation, we incubated increasing concentrations of PLpro with Nsp1-2Δ, which was still resistant to cleavage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">We wondered if recognition elements outside the minimal PLpro domain might be responsible for detection and cleavage of Nsp1-2Δ. Nsp3 is a multidomain protein containing a transmembrane segment that mediates its localization to membrane vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Imbert <italic>et al</italic>, 2008;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lei <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). In addition to the protease domain, Nsp3 contains an N-terminal Ubl (ubiquitin-like domain) followed by an ADRP (ADP-ribose phosphatase, SUD (SARS-unique domain) domain, another Ubl domain that is part of PLpro. C-terminal of the protease is a NAB (nucleic acid binding) domain followed by a TM (transmembrane segment) and a ZnF (zinc finger) domain at the very C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lei <italic>et al</italic>, 2018;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Tan <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). Despite being a large multidomain protein, we obtained milligram amounts of pure and stable recombinant Nsp3 truncations when we either removed or replaced the transmembrane segment and the acidic stretch at the N-terminus with a linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). As all the Nsp3 variants were equally active (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1C</xref>), Nsp3 spanning residues 179-1329 (henceforth referred to as Nsp3) was chosen for further characterization. We first compared cleavage efficiency of the three substrates using 50 μM Nsp3, the same concentration as that of PLpro used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>, which revealed that extended versions of Nsp3 unlike PLpro actively cleaved all three substrates including Nsp1-2Δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). The C-terminus of all PLpro substrates contains a -GG motif, with PLpro cleaving after the last Gly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1D</xref>). Indeed, mutating the C-terminal G180 of Nsp1 renders it resistant to cleavage by Nsp3 as does mutation of the catalytic C856 of Nsp3 to Ala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1E</xref>), confirming that the extended Nsp3 maintains substrate specificity and does not contain additional protease catalytic sites. We then made propargylated Nsp1 (Nsp1<sup>Prg</sup>), a reactive probe which would covalently modify the catalytic Cys of PLpro and Nsp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ekkebus <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Indeed, while Nsp3 was efficiently modified by Nsp1<sup>Prg</sup>, barely any conversion was observed for PLpro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1F</xref>). The Nsp1-2 substrate tested so far only contains 19 amino acids from Nsp2. To test if the presence of intact Nsp2 made a difference, we expressed and purified Nsp1-Nsp2 full length fusions. When used as substrate, we again find that PLpro is still unable to cleave this substrate whereas Nsp3 is efficient at cleaving it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1F</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">We next compared the activities of PLpro and Nsp3 for each of the substrates in qualitative gel-based assays. With polyubiquitin, nearly all triubiquitin is cleaved by Nsp3 (50 nM) after 15 minutes whereas a significant portion is still to be cleaved by PLpro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1G</xref>, top). Similarly, Nsp3 (20 nM) cleaves most of the pro-ISG15 by 15 minutes while only ~50% is cleaved by PLpro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1G</xref>, <bold>lower</bold>). With the Nsp1-2Δ substrate, Nsp3 (1 μM) is able to cleave, whilst PLpro is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>) These qualitative assays suggest that Nsp3 is a more active enzyme. To confirm these observations, we used a MALDI TOF based DUB assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ritorto <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>), which shows that PLpro efficiently cleaves K48 trimers with a <italic>Km</italic> of 29.39 <italic>μ</italic>M, a V<sub>max</sub> of 0.66 μM*min<sup>-1</sup> and a k<sub>cat</sub> of 22 min<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1G</xref>). In contrast, Nsp3 cleaves K48-linked triubiquitin with a <italic>Km</italic> of 17.79 μM, a Vmax of 0.62 μM*min<sub>-1</sub> and a kcat of 20.6 min<sup>-1</sup>. The comparatively lower <italic>Km</italic> of Nsp3 potentially explains the higher cleavage activity observed. Even though Nsp3 is more active than PLpro, it still retains its specificity for cleaving K48-linked polyubiquitin and does not cleave any of the other linkages tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1I</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">Despite several attempts, we were unable to crystallize longer variants of Nsp3 on its own or in complex with a substrate. Intriguingly, Nsp3 elutes at an apparent molecular weight of ~520kDa on a size-exclusion chromatography column raising the possibility that it could be tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1J</xref>). However, mass photometry analysis reveals Nsp3 to be a monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1K</xref>), suggesting that the behaviour on gel filtration could be attributed to an extended conformation or coiled-coil content in Nsp3. Obtaining a structure of Nsp3 in complex with its substrate might reveal why it is more active compared to PLpro and why it can cleave Nsp1-Nsp2.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Interactome of PLpro and Nsp3</title>
<p id="P10">Since we observe differences in protease activity between Nsp3 and PLpro, we next wanted to compare the interactomes of PLpro and Nsp3. To date most efforts to comprehensively define the interactomes of SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins have failed to identify the interactome of Nsp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Gordon <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). When we expressed full length Nsp3 in HEK 293 cells, we observed very low expression levels that made it challenging to get enough material for affinity enrichment/mass spectrometry (AE/MS) analysis. Hence, we made a truncation where we deleted the transmembrane segments of Nsp3 (Nsp3 ΔTM). The lung epithelial cell line A549 was transfected with either Strep-tagged Nsp3 ΔTM or PLpro and cells were lysed following IFN-a stimulation for 36 hours.</p>
<p id="P11">Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis revealed that Nsp3 ΔTM and PLpro had a largely overlapping interactome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, many of the interactors enriched for both PLpro and NSP3 ΔTM are interferon stimulated and proteins involved in antiviral signalling. With its preference for cleaving ISG15, we observed ISG15 as a significant interactor that was also identified in the PLpro<sup>CoV-2</sup> interactome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Shin <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Other prominent overlapping interactors include the IFITs (Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats), IFIT1 and IFIT2, antiviral proteins that function as sensors of viral single-stranded RNAs to inhibit expression of viral messenger RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Diamond &amp; Farzan, 2013</xref>). Nsp3 ΔTM also interacts with the antiviral proteins SAMHD1, which binds to nucleotides and depletes cellular dNTPs, and 1’-5’-oligoadenylate synthase 3 (OAS3), another interferon-induced gene that inhibits viral replication by degrading viral RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). In addition, both PLpro and Nsp3 ΔTM interact with the multifunctional ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3X, which promotes IRF3 activation leading to the production of the type I interferons, IFN-α and IFN-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Soulat <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">Our data also identifies interactors linked to translation (EIF5A2, EIF2S1, ICE1, EIF2S3L) and the actin cytoskeleton (Cofilin-1, tubulins, KIF9, MYL4, PDLIM5), which was also observed in a recent study that used proximity labelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Laurent <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). While most interactors are largely overlapping between Nsp3 ΔTM and PLpro, we identify the RNA binding protein Fragile X mental retardation syndrome-related protein 1 (FXR1) to be enriched only in Nsp3 ΔTM pull downs. Interestingly, Nsp3 from Sindbis virus interacts with FXR1 to bind viral RNAs for the assembly of viral replication complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">Despite having several additional domains, no additional unique interactors were identified for Nsp3 ΔTM. We attribute the lack of additional interactions to Nsp3 ΔTM to the following possibilities: (i) the Nsp3 used in our experiments lacks the transmembrane segment and hence does not localize to the right subcellular compartment where the relevant cellular interactors of Nsp3 may be present; (ii) the majority of the interactions with Nsp3, i.e., the Ubl1 domain, the SUD domain and macrodomain are with RNA or ADP-ribose, and (iii) Nsp3 has been suggested to function as a scaffold mediating binding to other Nsps to form replicative organelles explaining the lack of interactions with human proteins. Indeed, several interactions of Nsp3 with other viral Nsps have been identified by Y2H, but the functional implications of these interactions to the viral life cycle are unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Pan <italic>et al</italic>, 2008;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Imbert <italic>et al</italic>, 2008;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">von Brunn <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification and characterization of inhibitors to PLpro</title>
<p id="P14">We employed the previously developed MALDI-TOF DUB assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ritorto <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>) to evaluate the ability of 1971 FDA approved drugs to inhibit PLpro from SARS-CoV-2. Importantly the bioactivity and safety of these compounds has been tested in clinical trials allowing rapid repurposing of any hit compounds into therapies for the treatment of COVID-19. Compared to other fluorescent-based approaches, the MALDI-TOF-based assay has the advantage of using K48 ubiquitin trimer, a physiological PLpro substrate, for high-throughput screening (HTS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">De Cesare <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Further, the final products generated upon cleavage of triubiquitin are diubiquitin and monoubiquitin, which makes it compatible for analysis using the MALDI DUB assay. The reaction is terminated by the addition of 2% TFA and <sup>15</sup>N ubiquitin. To circumvent the spot-to-spot variability typical for MALDI-TOF based detection, the mono-ubiquitin signal is normalized to the <sup>15</sup>N internal standard signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The FDA-approved drug library was screened in duplicate at a concentration of 10 μM. The Z’ value is commonly employed to determine the robustness of HTS, with Z’ values greater than 0.5 indicating a robust assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). The MALDI-TOF DUB assay resulted in an average Z’ value of 0.77 ± 0.12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Compounds returning percentage inhibition values &gt;50% were identified as hits and 30 compounds met this criterion (1.5 % hit rate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The hit compounds were cherry picked and retested in a 10-point dose–response to determine IC<sub>50</sub> values against both PLpro and Nsp3. The MALDI-TOF-based results were further validated by orthogonal, gel-based assays employing K48-linked triUb and pro-ISG15 as substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D;</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A-C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">Based on these analyses, five compounds were confirmed for their ability to inhibit PLpro and Nsp3 <italic>in vitro</italic> (confirmation rate = 16.6%): Thioguanine, Nordihydroguaiaretic acid, Disulfiram, Auranofin and Tideglusib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thioguanine inhibits PLpro and Nsp3 with IC<sub>50</sub> of 4.54 and 8.67 <italic>μ</italic>M respectively, in the MALDI-TOF-based assay. Intriguingly, despite this reasonable IC<sub>50</sub>, we could not observe inhibition of PLpro by Thioguanine in the orthogonal gel-based assay Interestingly, thioguanine was previously found to inhibit PLpro<sup>SARS</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Báez-Santos <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) and SARS-CoV-2 replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Swaim <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">In our assays, we identify nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDA) to be a potent inhibitor of PLpro and Nsp3, with IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.06 and 1.62 <italic>μ</italic>M in the MALDI-TOF based assay. NDA is a compound extracted from plants, used in traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases, and found to inhibit numerous cellular targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Manda <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Its ability to inhibit a range of cysteine-based enzymes is linked to the redox properties of its two catechol rings, resulting in the formation of cysteine adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Manda <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Despite its beneficial effects, the main drawback to the use of this compound is its potential renal and liver toxicity over prolonged use.</p>
<p id="P17">Disulfiram is a thiocarbamate drug (commercially available as Antabuse®) that has received FDA approval for the treatment of alcoholism and has been in use for more than 60 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Johansson, 1992</xref>). Disulfiram has been previously identified by <italic>in silico</italic> screening and fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay to inhibit the main SARS-CoV-2 Cys-protease, Mpro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lobo-Galo <italic>et al</italic>, 2020;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Jin <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Disulfiram also inhibits PLpro<sup>CoV2</sup> and Nsp3 with similar potencies, 0.69 and 0.66 <italic>μ</italic>M in the MALDI-TOF-based assay, and between 1 and 2.5 <italic>μ</italic>M when assessed by gel-based orthogonal assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-E</xref>). Tideglusib, a Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitor, has also been found to inhibit the main SARS-CoV-2 Cys-protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Jin <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). We found that Tideglusib strongly inhibits both PLpro and Nsp3 with IC50 of 0.21 and 1.48 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively in the MALDI-TOF based assay. Similar potency of Tidegusib was also validated in the gel-based assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-E</xref>). Auranofin is a gold-containing compound employed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Roder &amp; Thomson, 2015</xref>), known to suppress inflammation and stimulating cell-mediated immunity. Of note, Auranofin has been recently shown to inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Rothan <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Interestingly, we found that Auranofin strongly inhibits PLpro and Nsp3 with potency in the 1 <italic>μ</italic>M range in the MALDI-TOF based assay with a similar inhibition pattern observed in the gel-based assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-E</xref>). We then tested GRL-0617, a non-covalent inhibitor identified to inhibit PLpro<sup>SARS</sup>, following the outbreak of SARS in 2002–2003, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.6 <italic>μ</italic>M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ratia <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). We found that GRL-0617 also inhibits PLpro with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2.21 <italic>μ</italic>M and Nsp3 with an IC50 of 3.39 <italic>μ</italic>M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). The high sequence similarity between PLpro from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and the conserved active site explain why GRL-0617 inhibits both proteases.</p>
<p id="P18">The human genome encodes about 100 deubiquitinating enzymes, most of which are cysteine proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Clague <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Since PLpro has architectural features in common with the USP DUBs, we assessed the selectivity of GRL-0617 and the five HTS positive hits by testing them at the final concentrations of 10 and 1 <italic>μ</italic>M against a DUBs panel including 42 human DUBs and the viral ovarian tumor (vOTU) from Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Virus. Unsurprisingly, we found that Disulfiram, Thioguanine, NDA, Tideglusib and Auranofin inhibited – at different extents – several other human DUBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>), while GRL-0617 showed greater specificity with less off-target inhibition in the panel of DUBs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Interestingly, GRL-0617 was also able to inhibit cleavage of the viral polypeptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3D</xref>) The presence of highly reactive chemical groups able to covalently modify reactive cysteines might explain the poor specificity of these small molecules. Despite the broad range of activity of these compounds, their relative safety has been extensively evaluated in FDA pre-clinical and clinical trials.</p>
<p id="P19">We next tested the efficacy of these compounds to inhibit PLpro in cell-based assays measuring activation of interferon expression using an IFN-β luciferase reporter or the ability to inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in CaCo cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Shin <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). To our disappointment, none of the compounds other than GRL-0617 showed any effects of inhibiting PLpro in cells (data not shown). These results are in contrast to what was shown for some of these inhibitors. For instance, the use of Auranofin and thioguanine has been shown to limit SARS-CoV-2 replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Swaim <italic>et al</italic>, 2020;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Rothan <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>) but the underlying mechanism of action is not entirely understood. Our data demonstrate that Auranofin and thioguanine inhibit the deubiquitinating activity of the PLpro protease <italic>in vitro</italic>. The low potency of the identified hits at limiting viral replication suggests that repurposing may not be an effective strategy to identify inhibitors suitable for clinical development and a systematic approach is required to develop specific and effective inhibitors of PLpro/Nsp3. Our results, showing that extended versions of Nsp3 can cleave viral polypeptides, which the minimal PLpro is not as efficient at suggest that using Nsp3 to screen for inhibitors could lead to the identification of allosteric inhibitors that may inhibit all three activities of Nsp3. Despite not being very potent on their own, combining drugs targeting essential SARS-CoV-2 proteases (PLpro and/or main protease) with other essential viral enzymes such as RNA-dependent polymerase may represent a therapeutic strategy.</p>

<title>Development of nanobodies that inhibit PLpro</title>
<p id="P20">Since all the identified inhibitors identified show off-target effects and inhibit other human DUBs, we wanted to devise other ways to selectively inhibit PLpro as a strategy to investigate the roles of Nsp3 in the viral life cycle, in interfering with host immune signalling and to examine if inhibition of PLpro can effectively block viral replication. Previously, ubiquitin variants (Ubv) have been developed to selectively inhibit DUBs by binding to the S1 pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2017;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gorelik &amp; Sidhu, 2017</xref>). Hence, we aimed to engineer a nanobody that binds to the S1 site with high affinity to inhibit PLpro. Further, the S1 site is important for both deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities of PLpro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Békés <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). We therefore used a recently developed yeast surface nanobody display library that was developed recently to screen and identify nanobodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">McMahon <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). To steer nanobody selection towards the S1 site, we had to discard nanobodies that recognized other regions of PLpro. Hence, we introduced a negative selection step using PLpro<sup>CoV-2</sup> carrying mutations in the S1 site. As these mutations were designed based on the available structure of PLpro<sup>SARS</sup> in complex with ubiquitin (PDB 4MM3, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Ratia <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>)) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4A</xref>), we first tested if these mutations also affected PLpro<sup>CoV-2</sup>. Indeed, compared to WT, the mutant PLpro<sup>CoV-2</sup> was unreactive to propargylated Ub and was unable to cleave K48-linked triUb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4B-C</xref>). Following multiple rounds of negative and positive selection using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS), as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>, single yeast clones were tested for their binding to PLpro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). Excitingly, we identified several nanobodies that bound to WT PLpro<sup>CoV-2</sup> but not the S1 site mutant, suggesting that these nanobodies specifically bind to the S1 site (NbSL-17, -18, 19). Sequencing these nanobodies revealed differences in the CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 loops of the different nanobodies.</p>
<p id="P21">To further characterize these nanobodies, they were recombinantly expressed and purified from bacteria. Of the three individual nanobody sequences we identified, soluble expression was obtained for only two nanobodies (NbSL17 and NbSL18). We first performed analytical gel filtration, which identified NbSL18 to form a complex with PLpro<sup>CoV-2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>). Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we find the binding affinity of NbSL18 for PLpro<sup>CoV-2</sup> to be ~500nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D</xref>). Intriguingly, we do not observe any detectable binding of PLpro for K48-linked diUb or ISG15 by ITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4E</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">F</xref>). Since NbSL18 binds to PLpro with higher affinity compared to K48-linked diUb, we next evaluated the ability of NbSL18 to inhibit PLpro. With increasing concentration of NbSL18, the cleavage of K48-linked triUb by PLpro is inhibited with ~50% inhibition at 500nM NbSL18, which is consistent with the binding affinity of NbSL18 for PLpro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4G</xref>). In contrast, higher concentrations of NbSL18 are required to inhibit the cleavage of ISG15. Recent crystal structures of ISG15 in complex with PLpro<sup>CoV-2</sup> show that the C-terminal UBL of ISG15 uses a slightly different mode of interaction compared to ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Shin <italic>et al</italic>, 2020;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Klemm <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>), thus explaining the differences in the inhibition of deubiquitylating and deISGylating activities by NbSL18.</p>
<p id="P22">Understanding how the viral polypeptide is recognised by Nsp3, and building on this to inhibit release of mature Nsp1/2/3, could represent a legitimate strategy to suppress viral replication. Nsp1, for instance, plays a key role in the infection process by binding to host 40S ribosomal subunits and blocking the mRNA channel with its C-terminal domain, thereby suppressing translation of host proteins and sequestering ribosomes for translation of viral proteins. Preventing Nsp1 maturation from the viral polypeptide could therefore be vital in hindering viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Schubert <italic>et al</italic>, 2020;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Thoms <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). We therefore tested if NbSL18 could also inhibit cleavage of Nsp1-Nsp2 FL fusions. Excitingly, our data reveals that NbSL18 can indeed inhibit Nsp1-2 FL cleavage by Nsp3 suggesting that the viral peptide also occupies the same S1 site as ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4H</xref>).</p>
<p id="P23">Determining a crystal structure of NbSL18 in complex with Nsp3 or PLpro would shed light into the mode of interaction and allow us to engineer mutations to not only increase the binding affinity but also selectively inhibit deubiquitylating, deISGylating or viral polypeptide processing activities. However, despite several attempts we were unable to obtain well-diffracting crystals. Nevertheless, the nanobodies developed here would be valuable tools to dissect the relative contributions of the three different peptidase activities of Nsp3 to viral replication and infection. In summary, our work reveals differences in protease activities between the minimal PLpro domain of Nsp3 and longer versions of Nsp3 and highlights the need to study the mechanism of Nsp3. Further, current efforts to develop inhibitors are focussed solely on PLpro and our findings suggest that it would be important to evaluate not only their efficacy at inhibiting full length Nsp3, but also the ability of the protease to cleave viral polypeptides.</p>

Nanobody-expressing yeast were washed with and selected against in sterile-filtered, ice-cold PBM (1x PBS (Gibco) supplemented with 0.5% BSA (Sigma) and 5 mM Maltose (Sigma)). Nanobodies were selected in four rounds of magnetic cell sorting (MACS) on LD columns (Miltenyi) for negative selection against biotinylated PLpro S1* mutant and subsequent positive selection on LS columns (Miltenyi) against biotinylated PLpro. In the first MACS round, 5*10^9 yeast in 5 ml PBE were incubated with 400 nM biotinylated PLpro S1* mutant immobilized on Streptavidin microbeads (Miltenyi) for 40 min at 4°C. The mixture was applied to an equilibrated LD column on a magnetic rack, the flow-through was collected and the column was washed with 2 ml PBM to collect further unbound yeast. Unbound yeast was pelleted at 4°C and 2500 g for 3 min and resuspended in 5 ml PBM containing 400 nM biotinylated PLpro immobilised on streptavidin microbeads and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. Yeast were pelleted as above, resuspended in 3 ml PBM and applied to an LS column on a magnetic rack. The column was washed three times with 3 ml PBM, removed from the magnetic rack and yeast were eluted with 5 ml PBM. Eluted yeast were pelleted, resuspended in 4 ml YGLC-glu and incubated at 30 °C and 200 rpm shaking overnight.
