<abstract>
<p id="P1">The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought an urgent need for animal models to study the pathogenicity of the virus. Herein, we generated and characterized a novel mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain, named MASCp36, that causes severe acute respiratory symptoms and mortality in standard laboratory mice. Particularly, this model exhibits age and gender related skewed distribution of mortality akin to severe COVID-19, and the 50% lethal dose (LD50) of MASCp36 was 58 PFU in 9-month-old, male BALB/c mice. Deep sequencing identified three amino acid substitutions, N501Y, Q493H, and K417N, subsequently emerged at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of MASCp36, during in vivo passaging. All three mutations in RBD significantly enhanced the binding affinity to its endogenous receptor, mouse ACE2 (mACE2). Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of human ACE2 (hACE2) or mACE2 in complex with the RBD of MASCp36 at 3.1 to 3.7 angstrom resolution elucidates molecular basis for the receptor-binding switch driven by specific amino acid substitutions. Interestingly, N501Y and Q493H enhanced the binding affinity to human ACE2 (hACE2); while triple mutations N501Y/Q493H/K417N decreased affinity to hACE2, thus led to the reduced infectivity of MASCp36 to human cells. Our study not only provides a robust platform for studying the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and rapid evaluation of coutermeasures against SARS-CoV-2, but also unveils the molecular mechanism for the rapid adaption and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in human and animals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a public health crisis <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, ranging from fever, fatigue, dry cough and dyspnea, and mild pneumonia to acute lung injury (ALI) and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADS) in severe cases. In fatal cases, multi-organ failures accompanied by a dysregulated immune response have been observed <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. Numerous studies have highlighted age and gender related discrepancies in the distribution of COVID-19 cases where the elderly and men tend to have a higher case-fatality ratio when compared to the young and females, suggesting that elderly man are more likely to succumb to COVID-19<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus of the <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family, and is an enveloped, single stranded positive-sense RNA virus. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), has been demonstrated as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect standard laboratory mice due to inefficient interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike (S) protein and mouse ACE2 (mACE2)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. So, several hACE2-expressing mouse models such as hACE2 transgenic mice<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>, AAV-hACE2 transduced mice<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup> and Ad5-hACE2 transduced mice<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup> have been developed. Furthermore, mouse adapted strains of SARS-CoV-2 have also been developed <italic>via</italic> either <italic>in vivo</italic> passaging or reverse genetics<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. However, most these models cause only mild to moderate lung damage in mice. A small animal model capable of recapitulating the most severe respiratory symptoms and high case fatality ratio of COVID-19 remains of high priority.</p>
<p id="P4">In this study, we generated a mouse-adapted strain, MASCp36, from a previous described, MASCp6, by further <italic>in vivo</italic> passaging for additional 30 time in mice<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. Further characterization demonstrated MASCp36 caused 100% fatality in 9-month-old, male BALB/c mice with severe malfunctions of the respiratory system and multi-organ damage. Combined biochemical assay, viral genome sequencing, and cryo-EM analysis clearly demonstrated the critical role of the progressively emerged amino acid mutations in the RBD of the mouse-adapted strains at different passages.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Generation of a lethal mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2</title>
<p id="P5">In our previous study, we generated a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2 (MASCp6) by 6 serial passages of a SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate in the lung of BALB/c mice, which caused moderate lung damage in mice. Herein, we further serially passaged for additional 30 times to generate a more virulent mouse-adapted strain, and the resulting SARS-CoV-2 at passage 36 (named as MASCp36) was used for stock preparation and titration.</p>
<p id="P6">To characterize the pathogenicity of MASCp36 to standard laboratory mice, groups of BALB/c mice at different age and sex were subjected to intranasal injection of varying doses of MASCp36. Strikingly, survival curve analysis showed that 9-month-old mice are highly susceptible to MASCp36 challenge, and the infected animals succumbed to MASCp36 challenge in a dose dependent manner. What's more, male mice were more susceptible to MASCp36 in comparison to female ones, and the 50% lethal dose (LD50) was calculated to 58 PFU (male) and 690 PFU (female), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). All 9-month-old mice challenged with high doses (1,200 or 12,000 PFU) of MASCp36 developed typical respiratory symptoms and exhibited features like ruffled fur, hunched back, and reduced activity. Of particular note, tachypnea was common in all moribund animals. Additionally, this unique gender-dependent mortality was also recorded in 9-month-old C57BL/6 mice challenged with MASCp36 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Interestingly, 8-week-old mice, either male or female, were resistant to MASCp36 challenge, and only 1 animal that received 12,000 PFU of MASCp36 challenge died during the observation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-d</xref>). Thus, the newly-developed MASCp36 was sufficient to cause mortality in BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice in an age and gender skewed manner.</p>
<p id="P7">We further characterized the <italic>in vivo</italic> replication dynamics and tissue distribution of MASCp36 in mice. The results from qRT-PCR showed that high levels of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNAs were persistent in the lung and tracheas till 4 day post infection (dpi) in 9-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Interestingly, the 8-week-old mice sustained a similar tissue distribution as the 9-month-old ones upon MASCp36 challenge, and lung and tracheas represented the major tissues supporting viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Consistent with the sgRNA levels, infectious SARS-CoV-2 could be recovered in the lung homogenate from 9-month-old and 8-week-old mice that received MASCp36 challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1g, h</xref>). Multiplex immunofluorescence staining showed that large amount of SARS-CoV-2 N protein positive signals were detected in lung sections from the MASCp36-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>), and co-localization with the SPC<sup>+</sup> alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells and CC10<sup>+</sup> club cells, as well as the ACE2<sup>+</sup> club cells, were shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2a</xref>); while few FOXJ1<sup>+</sup> ciliated cells and PDPN<sup>+</sup> alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). More importantly, despite more SPC<sup>+</sup>AT2 cells were detected in the lung of younger mice, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were more abundant in the lung from 9-month-old mice than those from the 8-week-old animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In fact, the ratio of ACE2<sup>+</sup> AT2 cells in the un-infected 9-month-old mice was much higher than that in the un-infected 8-week-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), which supported the observed age-skewed susceptivity to SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<title>MASCp36 causes multiple organs damage in mice</title>
<p id="P8">To further characterize the pathological outcome in MASCp36-infected mice, lung tissues were collected at 4 dpi and subjected to histopathological and immunostaining analysis. Naked eye observation recorded severe lung injury characterized with bilateral cardinal red appearance and sticky mucus in lungs when compared with that from the un-infected control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). According to the metrics of acute lung injury (ALI) laid out by the American Thoracic Society (ATS)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>, MASCp36 infection induced necrotizing pneumonia and extensive diffuse alveolar damages (DAD) on 4 dpi. The microscopic observation showed large quantities of desquamative epithelial cells in bronchiole tubes (yellow arrow) and a large area of necrotic alveoli epithelial cells, fused alveoli walls with inflammatory cells infiltration especially neutrophils in alveolar septae or alveolar airspace, serious edema around vessels (cyan arrow) and scattered hemorrhage (blue arrow) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In addition, foamy cells, polykaryocytes, fibrin cluster deposition, and hyaline membrane formation were common in the MASCp36 infected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), indicative of acute lung injury, which is well characterized in severe COVID-19 patients<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. Besides, the formation of typical viral inclusion bodies were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Additionally, we also observed the lung pathology in 9-month-old male mice infected with a lower dose (120 PFU) of MASCp36 at 7 dpi. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, lung fibrosis was observed in the MASCp36-infected mice as evidenced by the depositions of collagen in pulmonary artery wall and thickened alveoli. Meanwhile, an increased proliferation of alveolar mesenchymal cells was also observed in MASCp36-infected mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">Apart from the lung damage, spleen damage was also observed in MASCp36-infected mice, which was characterized by atrophic splenic corpuscle, splenic cells necrosis and hemorrhage in red pulp (green arrow) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Multiplex immunofluorescence staining showed a striking loss of germinal centers in the spleen as suggested by the reduction in CD19<sup>+</sup> B and CD3<sup>+</sup> T cell counts as well as diminished ICOS<sup>+</sup> follicular helper T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Similar observations have been well described in severe COVID-19 patients<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. In addition, renal tubular damage with casts in renal tubules, as well as breakdown of CD31<sup>+</sup> glomerular capillary epithelium and PDPN<sup>+</sup> basement membrane were also observed in kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). Similar splenic lesion and kidney damage were also reported in cases with postmortem examinations of deceased COVID-19 patients <sup>

<title>MASCp36 induces age- and gender-specific response in mice</title>
<p id="P10">To characterize the host response to MASCp36 infection in BALB/c mice at different age and gender, RNA-Seq analysis were performed using lung homogenates collected at 1 and 4 dpi. Upon MASCp36 infection, large numbers of genes were readily regulated in both 8-week-old and 9-month-old mice at 1 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). In the MASCp36-infected 9-month-old mice, 16 of the top 20 up-regulated genes were Interferon simulated genes (ISGs) and cytokines, including Cxcl10, Mx1, Gbp7, Mx2, Ifi44, Oasl2, Itgp, Gbp9, Isg15, Ifit1, Gbp4, Irgm2, Irf7, Ifit2, Stat2; while in the 8-week-old mice, only Ifit3, Mx2, Trim34b, Ifi44l and Rtp4 were related to antiviral immunity. At 4 dpi, the 9-month-old mice exhibited more dramatic response with a total of 2762 up-regulated genes and 2363 down-regulated genes. And cytokines Il6 and Ccl2 were among the top 20 up-regulated genes at 4 dpi; while ISGs including Mx1, Ifit1, Ifit3, Irf7, Dhx58 and Ifi44 were in the MASCp36-infected 8-week-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses showed that MASCp36 infection induced strong transcription of genes related to antiviral response, inflammatory, cytokine production and cell death in both 8-week-old and 9-month-old mice infected with MASCp36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Strikingly, the induction of “cytokine production”, “leukocyte activation”, “inflammatory response”, “interferon-gama production” and “positive regulation of cell death” was much quicker and stronger in the older mice. Of particular note, a large number of cytokines and chemokines transcription were up-regulated in response to MASCp36 in 9-month-old mice, while less and smaller up-regulation of cytokines and chemokines were observed in 8-week-old mice. Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl10 and Cxcl11 were the most significant up-regulated genes in the MASCp36-infected 9-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Meanwhile, Luminex analysis also detected obvious elevated cytokine and chemokine production, including IL6, CCL7, CCL12, CXCL10, CXCL16, CCL3, CXCL1, CXCL13, in the lung homogenates from the MASCp36 infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Strikingly, we found many genes involved in “cilium movement” were significantly stimulated at 1 and 4 dpi in the younger mice, while only a small number of genes were upregulated in the older mice at 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">Additionally, immunofluorescence staining of lung sections also indicated MASCp36 infection caused more extensive cell death and AT2 loss in the 9-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Interestingly, less CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages and Ly-6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils were detected in 9-month-old mice than that in young mice 1 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>), and reversed on 4 dpi. Of note, although the inflammatory cell infiltration was lagged on day 1 in 9-month-old mice, it elevated and sustained a high level until 4 days. However, the response was rapid and short-lived in young mice. The results indicated that the lagged and sustained immune response to viral infection may be related to the lung damage and contribute to the more severe outcomes in 9-month-old mice.</p>
<p id="P12">Furthermore, to understand the gender-skewed mortality in mice, we also compared the different gene expression in lungs of male and female mice. First of all, we confirmed that 1075 genes were significantly highly expressed in female mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>) in total of 1308 DEGs, and the genes enriched in “Cilium movement”, “Immunoglobin production”, “Adaptive immune responses” and “Cellular response to interferon-beta” GO terms, which coincided with previous studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. After infection, both the antiviral response and inflammatory response were stronger elevated in female mice when compared to the male especially on 1dpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4 b, c</xref>).</p>

<p id="P13">To further test the utility of this MASCp36-based mouse model for evaluation of countermeasures, H014, a known human monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>

Administration of a single dose of H014 (50 mg/kg) resulted in 100% survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>) and complete clearance of virus from the lungs of infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7 b, c</xref>). By contrast, all animals that received a control isotype mAb treatment showed high levels of viral replication in lungs and eventually died with respiratory diseases within 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a-c</xref>). Multiplex immunofluorescence staining demonstrated H014 treatment completely protected animals from viral infection and no viral antigen was detected at 4 dpi, while significant AT2 loss and neutrophil infiltration were seen in the mice treated with isotype mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>). H&amp;E staining also confirmed that H014-treatment dramatically prevented the MASCp36-induced lung damage characterized by fused alveoli walls, desquamative epithelial cells, severe edema and scattered hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>). These data perfectly match the results from hACE2 humanized mice<sup>

<title>Adaptive mutations responsible for the enhanced binding affinity to ACE2</title>
<p id="P14">To deduce the genetic basis for the lethal phenotype of MASCp36, deep sequencing was performed to identify the mutations emerged during the <italic>in vivo</italic> passaging history. Sequence comparisons of the WT strain and mouse-adapted strains at different passages (6, 15, 25, 30, and 36) revealed a process of gradual accumulation of amino acid substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a</xref>). Besides the four mutations (L37F, P84S, N501Y, and D128Y) identified in MASCp6, MASCp36 acquires additional 8 amino acid substitutions, including I1258V, H470Y, S301L, A128V, S8F, K417N, Q493H, and R32C in the NSP3, NSP4, NSP5, NSP6, NSP7, S and N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig.8a</xref>). Specially, single (N501Y), double (Q493H, N501Y) and triple (K417N, Q493H, N501Y) mutations in the RBD were identified in MASCp6, MASCp25 and MASCp36, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8b</xref>). To clarify the potential role of these mutations, the RBD of these different adaptive strains were expressed in HEK Expi 293F cells, and their binding affinities to mACE2 were determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). As expected, the RBD of WT SARS-CoV-2 presented no detectable binding, but RBDs from different passages of mouse-adapted strains (RBD<sub>MASCP6</sub>, RBD<sub>MASCP25</sub> and RBD<sub>MASCP36</sub>) gain gradually enhanced binding abilities to mACE2 with affinities ranging from ~500 μM to 2 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>). Meanwhile, we also compared the binding characterization of these RBD mutants and hACE2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8d</xref>, all three RBD mutants could bind to hACE2 with affinities at nanomole (ranging from 500 nM to 20 nM). Interestingly, compared to RBD<sub>MACSp6</sub> with a mutation of N501Y, RBD<sub>MACSp25</sub>, which contains an extra Q493H substitution, showed an enhanced binding affinity to hACE2. However, the third substitution of K417N significantly reduced binding activity of RBD<sub>MACSp36</sub> to hACE2, rendering a lower affinity than that of RBD<sub>WT</sub>. Collectively, these results demonstrated MASCp36 retained the high binding affinity to hACE2.</p>
<p id="P15">Furthermore, to confirm whether the mouse-adapted strain MASCp6 retained the infectivity to human cells, primary human airway epithelia (HAE) culture was infected with MASCp36 and WT SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Although both MASCp36 retained the infectivity to HAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9a</xref>), the progeny viral RNA loads of MASCp36 were much lower than that of WT SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9b</xref>), which was consistent to the binding affinity assay.</p>

<sec id="S8">
<title>Structural basis for the enhanced virulence of MASCp36</title>
<p id="P16">Finally, to elucidate the molecular basis for the gradual changes in specificity of MASCp36, structural investigations of the mACE2 in complex with RBD<sub>MASCP25</sub> or RBD<sub>MASCP36</sub> were carried out. Two non-competing Fab fragments that recognize the RBD beyond the mACE2 binding sites were used to increase the molecular weight of this complex for pursuing an atomic resolution by cryo-EM reconstruction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5-8</xref>). Interestingly, cryo-EM characterization of the mACE2 in complex with RBD<sub>MASCp25</sub> revealed that the complex adopts three distinct conformational states, corresponding to tight binding (state 1), loose binding (state 2) and no binding modes (state 3) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>), indicative of a quick association and quick dissociation interaction manner between the mACE2 and RBD<sub>MASCp25</sub>. However, only the tight binding conformation was observed in the mACE2-RBD<sub>MAscp36</sub> complex structure, reflecting a more stable/mature binding mode for the RBD<sub>MASCP36</sub> to mACE2, akin to that of the RBDWT and hACE2. We determined asymmetric cryo-EM reconstructions of the mACE2-RBD<sub>MASCp36</sub> complex at 3.7 Å and three states of the mACE2-RBD<sub>MASCp25</sub> complex at 4.4 to 8.2 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.6, Supplementary Fig.7, Supplementary Fig.9, Supplementary Fig.10 and Supplementary table 1</xref>). The map quality around the mACE2-RBD<sub>MASCp36</sub> interface was of sufficient quality for a reliable analysis of the interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary table 2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">The overall structure of the mACE2-RBD<sub>MASCp36</sub> complex resembles that of the RBDWT-hACE2 complex with a root mean square deviation of 1.0 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.8</xref>). The RBD<sub>MASCP36</sub> recognizes the helices (α1 and α2) located at the apical region of the mACE2 <italic>via</italic> its receptor binding motif (RBM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10a-c</xref>). The interaction area on the mACE2 could be primarily divided into three patches (PI, PII and PIII), involving extensive hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions with three regions separately clustered by three adaptation-mediated mutated residues (K417N, corresponding to Clus1; Q493H, corresponding to Clus2; and N501Y, corresponding Clus3) in the RBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10 c-e</xref>). Coincidentally, a number of amino acid substitutions, such as Q493K, Q498Y and P499T, in the RBM identified in other reported mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 isolates<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup> were included either in the Clus2 or Clus3, underlining the putative determinants for cross-transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10 d,e</xref>). An extra Clus1 is further accumulated in the MASCp36 to gain utmost binding activity and infection efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10 d,e</xref>). The extensive hydrophobic interactions in Clus3 constructed by Y501 (or Y498 or H498 in other mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 isolates), Y505 in the RBD<sub>MASCp36</sub> and Y41, H353 in the mACE2, hydrogen bonds in Clus2 formed H493 (K493 in other mouse-adapted strain) in the RBD<sub>MASCp36</sub> and N31, E35 in the mACE2 and hydrophilic contacts constituted by N417 in the RBD<sub>MASCp36</sub> and N30, Q34 in the mACE2 contribute to the tight binding of the MASCp36 to mACE2. Contrarily, structural superimposition of the RBD<sub>WT</sub> over the mACE2-RBD\<sub>MASCp36</sub> complex reveals the loss of these interactions, leading to the inability of the RBD<sub>WT</sub> to bind mACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P18">Meanwhile, the atomic structures of hACE2 in complex with RBD<sub>MACSp6</sub>, RBD<sub>MACSP25</sub> or RBD<sub>MACSP36</sub> were also solved at 3.1 to 3.7 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.11, Supplementary table 3</xref>). The same as RBD <sub>MACSP36</sub> -mACE2 complex, the interaction region could be divided into three patches, the three adaption-mutated residues (K417N, located at PI; Q493H, located at PII; and N501Y, located at PIII) were located at the three patches, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig 10.f</xref>). The extensive hydrophobic interactions in PIII were constructed by Y501, T500 in the RBD and Y41, L45 in the hACE2, salt bridge interactions in PII were formed by H493 in the RBD and E35 in the hACE2. However, in PI, the substitution of K with N at residue 417 in RBD<sub>MACSp36</sub> loses the salt bridge interaction, which would be formed by K417 in the RBD<sub>WT</sub> and D30 in the hACE2, structurally explaining the reduced binding affinity of RBD<sub>MACSp36</sub> to hACE2. Overall, these analysis pinpoints key structure-infectivity correlates, unveiling the molecular basis for host adaptation-mediated evolution of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P19">Clinically, the severe COVID-19 disease onset might result in death due to massive alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. However, most animal models previously described recaptulated the mild to moderate clinical symptoms of COVID-19. The MASCp36-based mouse model described here recapitulated most spectrums of seriously ill COVID-19 patients caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as pulmonary oedema, fibrin plugs in alveolar, hyaline membrane, and scattered hemorrhage<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. The complicated immunopathological phenomena observed in severe COVID-19 patients, such as massive macrophages and neutrophils infiltration, and excessively increased proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, were also observed in this MASCp36 infected mouse model. Herein, 9-month-old, male BALB/c mice infected with MASCp36 developed DAD, as well as comprehensive vasculature damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3</xref>). Importantly, thick fluid in pericardial cavity, hemorrhage and severe edema with less lymphocyte-cuff were observed in lung tissue, resembling clinical manifestations of severe COVID-19 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P20">Lung fibrosis and regeneration were also observed in this model which is the signs of fibrosis in clinic. Although SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen has been detected in kidney of post-mortem specimens <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>, no viral antigen or viral RNA were detected in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1e,f</xref>). So in this MASCp36 infected mouse model, the kidney injury may arise due to secondary endothelial injury leading to proteinuria<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. In addition, although SARS-CoV-2 has also been implicated to have neurotropic potential in COVID-19 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>, we did not find typical characteristics of viral encephalitis in this model. Importantly, the imbalanced immune response with high-levels of proinflammatory cytokines, increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes, which were in line with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>, playing a major role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>, were also observed in this model.</p>
<p id="P21">The skewed age distribution of COVID-19 disease was reproduced in the MASCp36 infected mouse model where more severe symptoms were observed in 9-month-old mice when compared to young mice. Different from H1N1 pandemic<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>, COVID-19 appears to have a mild effect on populations under 30 years, and the elderly are more likely to progress to severe disease and are admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) worldwide<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>. ACE2, the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2, expressed increasingly in the lungs with age, which might provide an explanation to the higher disease severity observed in older patients with COVID-19<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. More importantly, the host immune response may determine the outcome of the disease. Our immune system is composed of innate immunity and adaptive immunity. The innate immunity comprises of the first line of defense against pathogens and is acute as well as short lived. However, aging is linked with insufficient, prolonged and chronic activation of innate immunity associated with low-grade and systemic increases in inflammation (inflamm-aging) which can be detrimental for the body<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>. The delicate co-operation and balance are interrupted by the chronic activation of innate immunity and declined adaptive immune responses with increasing age in COVID-19<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. In the MASCp36 infected mouse model, the young mice presented acute inflammatory response with more innate immune cells infiltration on day 1, while lagged and sustained immune response in 9-month-old mice. After further analyzing the RNA-Seq results, we observed robust innate immune response at 1dpi in 9-month-old mice. While we found that T cell activation in 9-month-old mice was not as strong as in 8-week-old mice at 4 dpi. Meanwhile, we found genes involved in “cilium movement” were significantly stimulated at 1 and 4dpi in 8-week-old male mice. While much less genes related to cilium movement were upregulated in 9-month-old male mice till 4 dpi. Previous studies show that mucociliary clearance is an important defense mechanism in the respiratory tract that requires coordinated ciliary activity and proper mucus production to propel airway surface liquids that traps pathogens and pollutants, permitting their clearance from the lungs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>. A recent study on ACE2 shows the receptor protein robustly localizes within the motile cilia of airway epithelial cells, which likely represents the initial or early subcellular site of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry during host respiratory transmission<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>. So, we concluded that stimulation of cilium movement may be benefit to young mice to clear virus at the early stage of infection, and over-stimulated innate immune response and reduced adaptive immune response may lead to higher mortality in male 9-month-old mice. The different immune response in mice model may be vital in limiting virus replication at early times and contribute to different outcome on day 4 in young or 9-month-old mice.</p>
<p id="P22">In addition to the age-related skewed distribution of COVID-19, gender-related differences in distribution of COVID-19 disease is also recapitulated in this MASCp36 infected mouse model with increased susceptibility and enhanced pathogenicity observed in male mice when compared to their female counterparts. Biological sex is an important determinant of COVID-19 disease severity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup>. In China, the death rate among confirmed cases is 2.8% for women and 4.7% for men <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. In Italy, half of the confirmed COVID-19 cases are men which account for 65% of all deaths <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup>. This pattern is generally consistent around the world. The skewed distribution of COVID-19 suggests that physiological differences between male and female may cause differential response to infection. So the hypothesis that females display reduced susceptibility to viral infections may be due to the stronger immune responses they mount than males<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup>. In this study, based on the RNA-Seq results, we also found that female 9-month-old mice show higher intrinsic expression level of immune response related genes than male 9-month-old mice. Stronger immune response was also observed in female 9-month-old mice after infection. It has been studied that androgens may lower and estrogens may enhance several aspects of host immunity. Channappanavar etal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup> had studied that estrogen receptor signaling is critical for protection in females against SARS-CoV infection. So, we speculated here that estrogen may also play an important role in the protection against MASCp36 infection in female mouse model. In addition, androgens facilitate and estrogens suppress lymphocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, genes on the X chromosome important for regulating immune functions, and androgens may suppress the expression of disease resistance genes such as the immunoglobulin superfamily <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
</sup>. In the MASCp36 infected mouse model, we found out that it presented higher mortality of the male than the female infected with the same dose of virus, indicating the successful recapitulation of COVID-19 and also its potential application in the study of the pathogenesis of the disease.</p>
<p id="P23">A total of 12 amino acid mutations were identified in the genome of MASCp36 in comparison with WT SARS-CoV-2 strain. The sequentially acquired triple substitutions N501Y/Q493H/K417N in S protein of MASCp36 increased their affinities to mACE2, thus contributed to enhanced infectivity and lethal phenotype mice. Interestingly, MASCp36 showed decreased affinity to hACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig.8d</xref>) as well as decreased infectivity to primary human airway epithelia cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>) in comparison with WT SARS-CoV-2. These experimental observations were further verified by structural analysis in which MASCp36 loses the key salt bridge interaction with hACE2 when compared to WT SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig10.f</xref>). More importantly, Cryo-EM structures of both hACE2 and mACE2 in complex with RBD<sub>MASCp25</sub> and RBD<sub>MASCp36</sub> define preciously the atomic determinants of the receptor-binding switch: N501Y/Q493H/K417N in MASCp36 formed tight interactions with mACE2 in three patches, respectively, while K417N reduced interaction with hACE2. Thus, MASCp36 showed enhanced virulence in mice whereas decreased infectivity to human cells.</p>
<p id="P24">In addition, there are 9 amino acid substitutions outside the S protein of MASCp36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a</xref>). Notably, R32C and D128Y in the N protein deserves special attention. The D128Y mutation in N protein has been well recorded in human variants from D128Y<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup>. A recent report demonstrated acts as an antagonist of interferon (IFN) and viral encoded repressor of RNA interference<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
</sup>. Previous studies also reported N protein help package encapsidated genome into virions via binding Nps3<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>. Also, mutations were note in Nsp3 and Nsp5 which play role in blocking host innate immune response, promoting cytokine expression and inhibiting IFN signaling. Further studies will focus on the influence of virus changes to host innate immunity in mice<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>
</sup>. Recently, Shi and colleagues found that SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 and nsp6 suppress IFN-I signaling which provides insights on viral evasion and its potential impact on viral transmission and pathogenesis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>
</sup>. Whatever, multiple amino acid substitution might contribute to the enhanced virulence phenotype, independently or synergistically. At present, we cannot rule out the contribution of these mutations, and further validation with reverse genetic tools will help understand the biological function of each single mutation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P25">There is another interesting point that deserve concerns. These adaptive mutations emerged during mouse passage, however many of them have been documend in SARS-CoV-2 variants during human transmission. For example, the 501Y.V1 variant firstly detected in the United Kingdom (UK) contained the unique N501Y mutation in RBD<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup>, and more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants (501Y.V2 and 501Y.V2) contained both N501Y and K417N substitutions in S protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>. Except for N501Y and K417N, several other amino acid substitutions in MASCp36 were also found in human variants, including L37F in nsp6 and D128Y in N protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>
</sup> The coincidental emergence of the same mutations during mice passaging and COVID-19 epidemics highlight the importance of these mutations during host adaption.</p>
<p id="P26">In conclusion, our MASCp36 mouse model exhibited symptoms of DAD and acute lung injury in both laboratory standard BALB/c and C57BL/6 rodent model, which largely simulated COVID-19 severe disease. And the age and gender-dependent mortality well reproduced the clinical findings of human COVID-19. This novel model will be of high value for studying the pathogenesis of COVID-19 with genetic modified mice and for the rapid efficacy tests of potent countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2.</p>

</sup> and subjected to RNA-Seq. Total RNA from lung tissue were extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen, USA) and treated with DNase I (NEB, USA). Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext® UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB, USA) following the manufacturer’s recommendations and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot cluster generation system using HiSeq PE Cluster Kit v4-cBot-HS (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster generation, the libraries were sequenced on Illumina Novaseq6000 platform and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. After sequencing, perl script was used to filter the original data (Raw Data) to clean reads by removing contaminated reads for adapters and low-quality reads. Clean reads were aligned to the mouse genome (Mus_musculus GRCm38.99) using Hisat2 v2.1.0. The number of reads mapped to each gene in each sample was counted by HTSeq v0.6.0 and TPM (Transcripts Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads) was then calculated to estimate the expression level of genes in each sample. DESeq2 v1.6.3 was used for differential gene expression analysis. Genes with padj≤0.05 and |Log2FC| &gt; 1 were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DEGs were used as query to search for enriched biological processes (Gene ontology BP) using Metascape. Heatmaps of gene expression levels were constructed using heatmap package in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/pheatmap/index.html">https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/pheatmap/index.html</ext-link>). Dot plots and volcano plots were constructed using ggplot2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/</ext-link>) package in R.</p>

<p id="P37">The cloning and production of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (residues 319-541, GenBank: MN_908947.3), RBD mutants (RBD<sub>MACSp25</sub>: Q493H, N501Y; RBD<sub>MACSP36</sub>: K417N, Q493H, N501Y) hACE2 (residues 19-624, GenBank: NM_021804.3) and mACE2 (residues 19-739, GenBank: NM_001130513.1) were synthesized and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS with a C-terminal 2×StrepTag to facilitate protein purification. Briefly, RBD<sub>WT</sub>, RBD<sub>MACSP25</sub>, RBD<sub>MACSP36</sub>, hACE2 and mACE2 were expressed by transient transfection of HEK Expi 293F cells (Gibco, Thermo Fisher) using Polyethylenimine Max Mw 40,000 (polysciences). The target protein was purified from clarified cell supernatants 3 days post-transfection using StrepTactin resin (IBA). The resulting protein samples were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) or a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare) in 20mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.0.</p>
<p id="P38">To purify the final quaternary complex (RBD<sub>MACSp25</sub>/RBD<sub>MACSp36</sub>-Fab<sub>B8</sub>-Fab<sub>D14</sub>-mACE2), firstly, the ternary complex (RBD<sub>MACSp25</sub>/RBD<sub>MACSp36</sub> -Fab<sub>B8</sub>-Fab<sub>D14</sub>) was assembled. RBD<sub>MACSp25</sub> or RBD<sub>MACSp36</sub> was mixed with Fab<sub>B8</sub> and Fab<sub>D14</sub> at the ratio of 1 : 1.2 : 1.2, incubated for 30 min on ice. The mixture was then subjected to gel filtration chromatography. Fractions containing the ternary complex (RBD<sub>MACSp25</sub>/RBD<sub>MACSp36</sub>-Fab<sub>B8</sub>-Fab<sub>D14</sub>) were pooled and concentrated. Then mACE2 was mixed with the ternary complex (RBD<sub>MACSp25</sub>/RBD<sub>MACSp36</sub>-Fab<sub>B8</sub>-Fab<sub>D14</sub>) at the ratio of 1 : 1.2 and incubated for 60 min on ice. The mixture was then subjected to Superose6 10/300 column (GE Healthcare). Fractions containing the quaternary complex (RBD<sub>MACSp25</sub>/RBD<sub>MACSp36</sub>-Fab<sub>B8</sub>-Fab<sub>D14</sub>-mACE2) were concentrated to 2mg/ml. The preparation method of the RBD<sub>MACSp6</sub>/RBD<sub>MACSp25</sub>/RBD<sub>MACSp36</sub>-Fab<sub>B8</sub>-Fab<sub>D14</sub>-hACE2 complex is the same as that of the RBD<sub>MACSp25</sub>/RBD<sub>MACSp36</sub>-Fab<sub>B8</sub>-Fab<sub>D14</sub>-mACE2 complex.</p>
