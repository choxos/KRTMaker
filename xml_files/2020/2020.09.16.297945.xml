<abstract>
<p id="P1">SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent behind the COVID-19 pandemic, and responsible for over 170 million infections, and over 3.7 million deaths worldwide. Efforts to test, treat and vaccinate against this pathogen all benefit from an improved understanding of the basic biology of SARS-CoV-2. Both viral and cellular proteases play a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 replication, and inhibitors targeting proteases have already shown success at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models. Here, we study proteolytic cleavage of viral and cellular proteins in two cell line models of SARS-CoV-2 replication using mass spectrometry to identify protein neo-N-termini generated through protease activity. We identify previously unknown cleavage sites in multiple viral proteins, including major antigenic proteins S and N, which are the main targets for vaccine and antibody testing efforts. We discovered significant increases in cellular cleavage events consistent with cleavage by SARS-CoV-2 main protease, and identify 14 potential high-confidence substrates of the main and papain-like proteases, validating a subset with <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. We showed that siRNA depletion of these cellular proteins inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, and that drugs targeting two of these proteins: the tyrosine kinase SRC and Ser/Thr kinase MYLK, showed a dose-dependent reduction in SARS-CoV-2 titres. Overall, our study provides a powerful resource to understand proteolysis in the context of viral infection, and to inform the development of targeted strategies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and treat COVID-19.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">SARS-CoV-2 emerged into the human population in late 2019, as the latest human coronavirus to cause severe disease following the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV over the preceding decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutic agents to treat COVID-19 are already yielding results, however it is widely expected that this first generation of treatments might provide imperfect protection from disease. As such, in-depth characterisation of the virus and its interactions with the host cell can inform current and next-generation efforts to test, treat and vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2. Past efforts in this area have included the proteome, phosphoproteome, ubiquitome and interactome of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Proteolytic cleavage plays a crucial role in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, and indeed most positive-sense RNA viruses. Inhibitors targeting both viral and cellular proteases have previously shown the ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Here we present a first unbiased study of proteolysis during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and its implications for viral antigens, as well as cellular proteins that may represent options for antiviral intervention. Proteolytic cleavage of the two coronavirus polyproteins generates the various viral proteins needed to form a replication complex, required for transcription and replication of the viral genome and subgenomic mRNAs. The key viral enzymes responsible are the papain-like (PLP, nsp3) and main proteases (Mpro, nsp5). Aside from cleaving viral substrates, these enzymes can also act on cellular proteins, modifying or neutralising substrate activity to benefit the virus. A recent study highlighted the ability of the viral proteases to cleave proteins involved in innate immune signaling including IRF3, NLRP12 and TAB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). However, there has yet to be an unbiased study to identify novel substrates of the coronavirus proteases in the context of viral infection. The identification of such substrates can identify cellular enzymes or pathways required for efficient viral replication that may represent suitable targets for pharmaceutical repurposing and antiviral intervention for the treatment of COVID-19.</p>
<p id="P3">Viral proteins can also be the targets of cellular proteases, with the most prominent example for coronaviruses being the cleavage of the spike glycoprotein by the cellular proteases FURIN, TMPRSS2 and Cathepsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), but the exact cleavage sites within spike for most of these individual cellular proteases are not yet characterised. Proteolytic processing can also be observed for other coronavirus proteins, for example, signal peptide cleavage of SARS-CoV ORF7A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) and caspase cleavage of the nucleocapsid protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). The spike glycoprotein especially, forms the key or sole component of the vaccines currently in use. For a functional immune response, it is vital that the antigens presented to the immune system, as part of these vaccines, closely mimic those seen in natural infection. An understanding of any modifications to these antigens observed during natural infection, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation and proteolytic cleavage, is critical to enable the rational design and validation of vaccine antigens and the selection of appropriate systems for their production. Currently a range of vaccine platforms are being explored, and certain platforms or delivery routes more likely to suffer from altered post-translational modification states than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">Mass spectrometry-based proteomic approaches have already led to rapid advances in our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, with notable examples including the rapid release of the cellular interactome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) and proximity interactome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) for a majority of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, as well as proteomic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), phosphoproteomic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) and ubiquitomic analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Larger scale-initiatives have been launched focusing on community efforts to profile the immune response to infection, and provide in-depth characterization of viral antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Mass spectrometry has particular advantages for investigation of proteolytic cleavage as analysis can be conducted in an unbiased manner, and identify not only the substrate, but the precise site of proteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">In this work we have applied mass spectrometry-based methods for N-terminomics to study proteolysis and the resulting proteolytic proteoforms generated in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, enabling the identification of novel cleavage and processing sites within viral proteins. We discovered several of these novel cleavage sites show altered cleavage following treatment with the cathepsin/calpain inhibitor calpeptin. We also identify cleavage sites within cellular proteins that match the coronavirus protease consensus sequences for Mpro and PLP, show temporal regulation during infection, are cleaved <italic>in vitro</italic> by recombinant Mpro and PLP, and demonstrate these proteins are required for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication. These SARS-CoV-2 protease substrates include proteins that can be targeted with drugs in current clinical use to treat other conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Indeed, we demonstrate potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication with two compounds that are well-established chemical inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 protease substrates SRC and myosin light chain kinase (MYLK).</p>

<title>Proteomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected cell lines identifies alterations to the N-terminome</title>
<p id="P6">To investigate proteolysis during SARS-CoV-2 infection, N-terminomic analysis at various timepoints during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 and A549-Ace2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) was performed. Vero E6 cells are an African Green Monkey kidney cell line commonly used for the study of a range of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 which replicates in this cell line to high titres. A549-Ace2 cells are a human lung cell line which has been transduced to overexpress the ACE2 receptor to allow for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Cells were infected in biological triplicates at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, and harvested at 4 timepoints (0, 6, 12 and 24h) postinfection. Mock-infected samples were collected at 0h and 24h post-infection. These timepoints were chosen to cover SARS-CoV-2 infection from virus entry, over replication to virus egress: RNA levels increased from 9h post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), protein levels showed steady increases throughout infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), and viral titres increased at the 24h timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). These features were shared in both cell lines, with the Vero E6 cells showing greater RNA and protein levels, as well as viral titres compared with the A549-Ace2 cells. Analysis of the N-termini-enriched samples was performed by LC-MS/MS following basic reverse phase fractionation. For the purposes of this analysis, neo-N-termini were taken to be those beginning at amino acid 2 in a given protein or later. By this definition these neo-N-termini will include those with post-translational removal of methionine, signal peptide cleavage, as well as those cleaved by viral or cellular proteases. The modified N-terminomic enrichment strategy used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) employed isobaric labelling (TMTpro) for quantification as this permitted all samples to be combined prior to enrichment, minimising sample variability. This strategy meant that only those peptides with a TMTpro-labelled N-terminus or lysine residue were quantified. As only unblocked N-termini are labelled with undecanal, this approach results in the selective retention of undecanal-tagged tryptic peptides on C18 in acidified 40% ethanol, with N-terminal and neo-N-terminal peptides enriched in the unbound fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">Quality filtering of the dataset was performed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>), infected and mock samples separated by PCA and 0h Mock, 0h infected and 6h infected clustered together, and away from the 12h and 24h infected samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A-D</xref>). With the exception of the enriched Vero E6 dataset the 24h mock sample clustered with the 0h mocks. The Vero E6 24h Mock clustered away from the 0h and infected samples which may reflect regulation due to cell confluence as this was not observed with the paired unenriched sample. Sample preparation successfully enriched for blocked N-termini consisting of acetylated, pyroglutamate-N-termini and TMTprolabelled N-termini (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>), and blocked N-termini were more abundant in the enriched samples. In both datasets, TMTpro-labelled N-termini represent approximately 50% of the blocked N-termini, with the rest split evenly between pyroglutamate and N-terminal acetylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). After filtering, over 2700 TMTpro-labelled N-termini representing neo-N-termini were identified from each cell line. While the experimental design chosen is based around minimising missing data within rather than between the two datasets, 497 neo-N-termini were common to the two cell lines <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>, and show positive correlation (Pearson’s <italic>ρ</italic>, 0.64-0.7).</p>
<p id="P8">When the 24h infected and mock-infected timepoints were compared, both cellular and viral neo-N-termini in A549-Ace2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and Vero E6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>) were identified as showing significant alterations in their abundance. In line with expectation, N-termini from viral proteins were solely identified as showing increased abundance during infection in both cell lines. N-termini from cellular proteins showed both increased and decreased abundance during infection. We reasoned that those neo-N-termini showing increased abundance would include viral neo-N-termini, as well as those cellular proteins cleaved by the SARS-CoV-2 PLP and Mpro proteases. For this study we therefore focused specifically on viral N-termini and those cellular neo-N-termini identified as showing significantly increased abundance (t-test, multiple hypothesis testing corrected Q value ≤ 0.05) during infection.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Novel proteolytic processing of SARS-CoV-2 proteins is observed during infection</title>
<p id="P9">The 30kb SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes a large number of proteins including two long polyproteins formed through ribosomal frameshifting, the structural proteins S, E, M and N and a range of accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Coronavirus proteins, in line with those of other positive-sense RNA viruses are known to undergo post-translational modifications, including proteolytic cleavage in some cases. Across all datasets we identified the S, M and N structural proteins, with the exception of E which has also not been observed in other proteomics datasets due to both short length and sequence composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). We identified the ORF3a, ORF6, ORF8 and ORF9b accessory proteins, and all domains of the polyprotein aside from nsp6, 7 and 11.</p>
<p id="P10">We first sought to characterise neo-N-termini from viral proteins to understand potential patterns of cleavage that might generate functional proteolytic proteoforms of the viral proteins. Our search database included recently identified noncanonical translation products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), and neo-N-termini and N-termini were identified from 8 viral proteins including the polyprotein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Of these the nucleocapsid (N), ORF3a accessory protein and spike were most prominent. More cleavage sites were observed from infected Vero E6 cells than A549-Ace2 cells, which is in line with expectation given the higher levels of viral protein expression, and superior infectivity of this cell line compared to the A549-Ace2 cell line, permitting detection of less abundant cleavage products.</p>
<p id="P11">The coronavirus N protein is highly expressed during infection, and also represents a major antigen detected by the host immune response. Prior studies have identified cleavage of the SARS-CoV N protein by cellular proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), and our data identified multiple neo-N-termini consistent with proteolytic cleavage from both infected A549-Ace2 and Vero E6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). neo-N-termini common to both datasets include amino acids 17, 19, 69, 71, 76, 78, 154, and 263. Many of these cleavage sites were spaced closely together (e.g. 17/19, 69/71), consistent with a degree of further exoproteolytic processing. Some of these cleavage sites have subsequently been identified as autolysis products following extended incubations with N <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">The ORF3a putative viroporin also shows N-terminal processing, possibly reflecting signal peptide cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). In a recent study, cryoEM of ORF3a in lipid nanodiscs did not resolve the first 39 N-terminal suggesting this region is unstructured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). We observed N-terminal processing sites in the first 22 residues of the protein, with neo-N-termini beginning at amino acids, 10, 13 and 16 identified in both datasets, giving a possible explanation for the lack of N-terminal amino acids in cryoEM experiments.</p>
<p id="P13">Proteolytic cleavage of the spike glycoprotein is of major interest as it plays an important role in virus entry, with different distributions of cellular proteases between cell types resulting in the usage of different entry pathways, as well as potentially changing availability of surface epitopes for antibody recognition. Key proteases include FURIN, TM-PRSS2 and cathepsins, though in the latter two cases the actual cleavage sites targeted by these enzymes to process spike into S1 and S2 remain unclear. Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), we do not detect a neo-N-terminus deriving from the FURIN cleavage site as the trypsin digestion we employed would not be expected to yield peptides of suitable length for analysis. However, while beneficial for replication, FURIN cleavage is not essential and other cleavage events within spike can compensate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). We detect neo-N-terminal peptides from S637 in both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). In line with the pattern of viral gene expression observed in the unenriched datasets this neo-N-terminus showed consistent increases in abundance throughout the experimental timecourse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). S637 is located on a flexible loop near the FURIN cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>), suggesting it is accessible for protease cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). A mass spectrum for the S637 neo-N-terminus from the A549-Ace2 dataset is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>, the same peptide was observed with both 2+ and 3+ charge states in the Vero E6 dataset, and with a higher Andromeda score (124.37 vs. 104.82). Intriguingly, S637 was identified as a phosphorylation site in Davidson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). As phosphorylation can inhibit proteolytic cleavage when close the the cleavage site, this suggests potential post-translational regulation of this cleavage event.</p>
<p id="P14">Further neo-N-termini from spike were identified in the Vero E6 dataset alone, including a neo-N-terminus beginning at Q14 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>. This is slightly C-terminal of the predicted signal peptide which covers the first 12 amino acids. This peptide featured N-terminal pyroglutamic acid formed by cyclization of the N-terminal glutamine residue. The peptide does not follow an R or K residue in the spike amino acid sequence and thus represents non-tryptic cleavage. The absence of TMTpro labelling at the N-terminus suggests that this N-terminus was blocked prior to tryptic digestion, with this modified N-terminus preventing TMTpro modification. Artifactual cyclization of N-terminal glutamine or glutamic acid residues typically results from extended trypsin digestion and acidic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). However, the order of labelling and digestion steps in our protocol, and non-tryptic nature of this peptide suggests that this N-terminal pyroglutamic acid residue is an accurate reflection of the state of this neo-N-terminus in the original biological sample. While this is to our knowledge, the first observation of this N-terminal modification and signal peptide cleavage site for spike during infection, cleavage and cyclization of Q14 has been observed with recombinantly-produced SARS-CoV-2 spike in HEK293 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) and CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Three further N-terminal pyroglutamic acid residues were identified in SARS-CoV-2 proteins (N, ORF7A) within the Vero E6 dataset and can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">table S2</xref>.</p>
<p id="P15">We detected viral neo-N-termini and N-termini in M, ORF7a, ORF9b and pp1ab. Due to conservation with SARS-CoV ORF7a, the first 15 residues of SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a are expected to function as a signal peptide which is post-translationally cleaved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). neo-N-termini were identified in both datasets consistent with this hypothesis. Due to inclusion of the ORF7a iORF1 proposed N-terminal truncation of ORF7a which lacks the first two amino acids in ORF7a in the SARS-CoV-2 sequences used for data analysis, the start position of this neo-N-terminal peptide is given as 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). However, this would be position 16 in ORF7a, consistent with removal of the signal peptide (MKIILFLAL-ITLATC, in Uniprot P0DTC7), and conserved with that in SARS-CoV ORF7a.</p>
<p id="P16">The native N-terminus of ORF9b was also identified, and several sites mapping to the replicase polyprotein, including a conserved neo-N-terminus consistent with predicted nsp10-nsp12 cleavage by Mpro. A neo-N-terminus consistent with nsp15-nsp16 cleavage by Mpro was identified in A549-Ace2 cells, and several internal neo-N-termini deriving from nsp1, -2 and -3 were also observed, though not common to both datasets. All the viral neo-N-termini and N-termini identified in this study can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">tables S1</xref> (A549-Ace2) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S2</xref> (Vero E6) respectively. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S3</xref> includes all viral peptides identified in this study in both enriched and unenriched datasets.</p>

<title>neo-N-termini and current Variants of Concern (VOC’s)</title>
<p id="P17">Currently there is extensive interest in mutations present in emerging Variants Of Concern (VOCs) and Variants of Interest (VOIs), and using our understanding of virus biology to predict how such mutations could alter protein function or antibody evasion.</p>
<p id="P18">To investigate if the viral neo-N-termini we identified may be under selective pressure, mutations characteristic of current VOC/VOIs were identified from covariants.org (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) on the 24th May 2021. These included B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.427/9, B.1.525, B.1.526, P.1, B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2. Compared to the a background proteome of all viral peptides identified in the analysis, neo-N-termini were not overrepresented near characteristic variant mutations (KS test, p = 0.146) <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>. However, not all neo-N-termini may be under selective pressure, and in some cases mutations could be lethal to the virus so would not be observed in variants.</p>
<p id="P19">While our data does not suggest global enrichment of neo-N-termini proximal to characteristic variant mutations, 9 of our neo-N-termini were within 5 amino acids of a characteristic variant mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">table S6</xref>), and 17 were within 10 amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">table S7</xref>). Those neo-N-termini within 5 amino acids of variant mutations are of particular interest as the variant mutations could readily alter proteolytic cleavage. These variant mutations include multiple sites in S (13, 18, 19, 677), N (12, 80, 205, 377) and ORF3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Of particular interest is the S13I mutation in spike in strain B.1.427/B.1.429, immediately preceding the pyroglutamate-modified Q14 neo-N-terminus. Recent research has indicated that this is tolerated in spite of blocking signal peptide cleavage to generate the Q14 neo-N-terminus, with signal peptide cleavage instead generating a neo-N-terminus at V16 resulting in loss of antibody binding and structural rearrangements within spike due to loss of disulphide bond formation between C15 and C136 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). As further variants emerge, the incorporation of post-translational modification data from studies such as this can support efforts to predict phenotypes from genetic data on emerging variants.</p>

<title>Novel SARS-CoV-2 cleavage sites are sensitive to calpeptin and a mutation proximal to the 637 cleavage site results in a higher fraction of cleaved spike in purified pseudovirus and enhanced cell entry</title>
<p id="P20">The N-terminomics experiments above successfully identified multiple previously uncharacterised proteolytic cleavage sites within viral proteins. However, we have limited information on the identity of the causal proteases behind these cleavage events. To address this, we performed a further N-terminomics experiment comparing the relative abundance of these cleavage sites and viral proteins following treatment with specific protease inhibitors <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>. The first, camostat mesylate is currently in clinical trials to treat COVID-19 disease and acts on TMPRSS2 and trypsin. It should be noted that the cell lines our study focuses on are TMPRSS2 negative and so camostat mesylate was included as a control. The second, calpeptin inhibits cathepsin and calpain cleavage. The experiment was performed in Vero E6 cells as the majority of viral cleavage sites identified in the first dataset were found in this cell line. Inhibitors were added at 12h post-infection with the aim of reducing proteolytic cleavage rather than inhibiting virus replication <italic>per se</italic> by permitting viral replication to proceed unimpeeded for the first 12h. Samples were then harvested at 24h post-infection <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>. Quality control of this dataset against showed tight clustering of the relevent samples, with infected samples clustering away from the mock-infected cells <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A,B</xref>. This dataset identified fewer quantifiable N-termini <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C-F</xref>, but these included the key cleavage sites in S and N.</p>
<p id="P21">Analysis of viral protein levels showed that when added at this late time post-infection viral protein levels were simiilar but did show some differences with the untreated infected samples <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5G</xref>. ORF9B showed significantly reduced abundance in protease inhibitor-treated infected cells compared to infected but untreated cells (Camostat: t-test, p = 0.0031; Calpeptin: t-test, p = 0.0012). ORF3A showed significantly increased abundance compared to untreatedinfected cells in the camostat-treated cells alone (t-test, p = 0.0016). Neither N or S showed significant changes in their abundance with either inhibitor treatment.</p>
<p id="P22">Neo-N-termini corresponding to viral proteins were normalised to the abundance of the viral protein from which the neo-N-terminus was derived and can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>. The largest changes were observed following calpeptin treatment, resulting in significantly reduced abundance of neo-N-termini beginning at N(19),S(260) and S(637). Both neo-N-termini from S (260, 637) showed increased abundance following treatment with camostat compared to untreated infected cells (t-test, p = 0.0074 and 0.0288 respectively). Two neo-N-termini within N (78, 286) show increased abundance in the calpeptin-treated infected cells (t-test, p = 0.0045, 0.0120). Reduced abundance of neo-N-termini following calpeptin inhibibion (e.g. N(19), S(260, 637)) is consistent with cleavage of these sites by cathepsin which is known to cleave S(10). The enhanced cleavage of these sites following addition of camostat in Vero E6 cells suggests some increased diversion of S and N down a cathepsin-dependent cleavage pathway under conditions which inhibit TMPRSS2 and trypsin. While this cell line lacks TMPRSS2 expression, clearly there is some alteration of proteolytic activity following camostat treatment, suggesting inhibition of other proteases in this system which may have a compensatory or complementary function.</p>
<p id="P23">The same data lacking normalisation to total viral protein levels can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5H</xref>. As expected given the lack of significant changes to total N and S protein levels, all sites highlighted in the previous paragraph maintained their direction of change relative to mock, and remained t-test significant in this unnormalised dataset (p &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p id="P24">As a majority of these cleavage sites within viral proteins are novel, we lack a functional understanding of their role in viral infection. We sought to examine the importance of several of the novel cleavage sites found within the spike glycoprotein by mutating residues proximal to the cleavage sites and assessing their functions in a pseudovirus entry assay, utilising pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. Given our observed cleavage at Q14 we generated a S13A mutation, altering the P1 residue in this cleavage site following the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). For the cleavage sites at 637 and 671, given that cathepsin is known to cleave spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), and indeed the site at 637 showed sensitivity to calpeptin, a calpain and cathepsin inhibitor, we sought to modify cleavage through mutagenesis of the P2 residue within this cleavage site as the P2 site is considered important for cathepsin cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). This approach generated V635G and C671G mutants. RatG13 spike, a mutant lacking the FURIN cleavage site due to a deletion of four residues (Δ681-684, ΔPPRA) was included as an additional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>).</p>
<p id="P25">In HEK-ACE2 cells, both the V635G and RatG13 mutants showed significantly increased cell entry compared to wild-type (t-test p&lt;0.01), while the C671G mutant showed significantly decreased cell entry (Unpaired Welch’s t-test, p&lt;0.0001)<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>. Entry for both the S13A and the double V635G/C671G mutant was not significantly different to wild-type <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>. Representative FACS plots and the gating strategy applied can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>.</p>
<p id="P26">The same pattern was observed in HEK-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells, though the enhanced cell entry seen for the the V635G and RatG13 mutants did not reach significance <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>. This may reflect reduced importance of the V635G mutation in cells bearing high levels of TMPRSS2. Similarly while the pattern of partial recovery of the double V635G/C671G mutant remained visible, its entry remained significantly reduced (Unpaired Welch’s t-test, p &lt; 0.05) compared to wildtype <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>. While reproducible across multiple independent viral stocks and experiments, the phenotypes are modest (2-fold change) in both cell types, except for the marked infectivity defect of the C671G mutant. Representative FACS plots and the gating strategy applied can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>.</p>
<p id="P27">Western blotting of purified pseudovirus particles confirmed expression and incorporation of spike <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>. Notably constructs containing the C671G mutation showed limited incorporation and defective spike processing. While this could be in part due to cleavage, this cysteine residue is identified in a disulphide bond in several crystal structures suggesting that a more likely explanation for the lower entry phenotype in pseudovirus bearing this mutation is down to defective protein folding or stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9A</xref>. The wild-type, S13A and V635G mutants all show S0 (uncleaved) and S1 (cleaved) spike <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>. Notably the V635G mutant showed significantly increased levels of the cleaved S1, with a near 3:1 ratio of S1 to S0 compared to the wild-type where this is 1:1 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref> (Unpaired Welch’s t-test, p &lt; 0.05). This could reflect either enhanced cleavage at this location, or increased incorporation of the cleaved V635G S1 into pseudovirus particles. Of note, the increased incorporation of cleaved spike in V635G mutant particles was consistent with the increased infectivity of this mutant <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9B</xref>.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 infection induces proteolytic cleavage of multiple host proteins</title>
<p id="P28">Examination of cellular neo-N-termini from infected cells, has the potential to indicate activation of host cell proteases, or the targeting of specific host pathways. Motif analysis from both cell lines revealed strong enrichment of serine residues on the P’ region of cleavage sites corresponding to neo-N-termini <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, B</xref>. Diminished abundance of R/K was also observed, though it should be noted that we excluded neo-N-termini from our analysis which were preceded by R/K and could potentially be artifacts generated by tryptic digestion during sample processing.</p>
<p id="P29">Given this strong enrichment for specific residues in our datasets, we sought to identify if enriched or diminished neo-N-termini could be associated with a causal protease using TopFIND 4.0, which links neo-N-termini to causal proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). As this software does not currently support African Green Monkey datasets, this analysis could be performed only for the Ace2-A549 dataset, the results of which are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>. Of those significantly-regulated neo-N-termini, causal proteases were identified for a subset, though the analysis did not find the overall activities of these causal proteases to be significantly regulated in infected cells at 24h post-infection compared to mock-infected cells (p &lt;= 0.05, Adjusted Fisher’s exact test) S8, though this may reflect low numbers of annotated substrates for individual proteases.</p>
<p id="P30">Finally, we performed gene ontology analysis of proteins from which the significantly-regulated neo-N-termini were derived, identifying significantly regulated biological functions, cellular compartments and molecular functions within each cell line dataset <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12</xref>. While many of the enriched GO terms were unique to each cell line, common themes included mitochondria, and the cytoskeleton/cell adhesion.</p>
<p id="P31">We then sought to identify neo-N-termini that could be targeted directly by the SARS-CoV-2 proteases, rather than host cell proteases. The consensus sequences for coronavirus proteases are conserved between coronaviruses, with PLP recognising a P4 to P1 LxGG motif, and Mpro recognising a (A|P|S|T|V)xLQ motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). No strong preference has been identified for either protease at the P3 residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Analysis of both datasets showed strong enrichment for neo-N-termini consistent with cleavage at Mpro motifs (two-tailed Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13A,B</xref>). However, no comparable enrichment could be seen for neo-N-termini consistent with cleavage at PLP motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13C,D</xref>). This may reflect fewer cellular protein substrates of PLP compared to Mpro, or higher background levels of neo-N-termini generated by cellular proteases with similar P4 to P1 cleavage specificities as PLP.</p>
<p id="P32">Neo-N-termini matching, or close to the consensus sequences, for either Mpro or PLP and showing significant upregulation (t-test, q ≤ 0.05 after correction for multiple hypothesis testing) at 24h post-infection compared to the 24h mock sample were selected for further analysis. Perfect matches to the consensus sequences from A549-Ace2 cells included NUP107, PAICS, PNN, SRC and XRCC1. GOLGA3 and MYLK (MCLK) were identified from Vero E6 cells. Hits from both cell lines that resembled, but did not completely match the consensus sequence were ATAD2, ATP5F1B, BST1, KAT7, KLHDC10, NUCKS1 and WNK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D, E</xref>). Adding confidence to these observations, approximately half of these hits were also identified in a recent SARS-CoV-2 proximity labelling study (ATP5F1B, GOLGA3, NUP107, PNN, SRC and WNK)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), and GOLGA3 was additionally identified in an interactome study as an nsp13 interaction partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).</p>
<p id="P33">SRC, MYLK and WNK are all protein kinases, one of the protein families best studied as drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). MYLK is especially interesting as dysregulation of MYLK has been linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome - one of the symptoms of severe COVID-19 disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). NUP107 is a member of the nuclear pore complex, with nucleo-cytoplasmic transport a frequent target for viral disregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). GOLGA3 is thought to play a role in localisation of the Golgi and Golgi-nuclear interactions, and was identified in two recent studies of SARS-CoV-2 interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). PNN is a transcriptional activator, forming part of the exon junction complex, with roles in splicing and nonsense-mediated decay. The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus has previously been shown to target nonsense mediated decay, with pro-viral effects of inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). PAICS and BST1 both encode enzymes with roles in ADP ribose and purine metabolism respectively, with PAICS previously identified as binding the influenza virus nucleoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>).</p>
<p id="P34">The majority of these neo-N-termini showed enrichment at 24h, with levels remaining largely unchanged at earlier time-points, especially for Mpro substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D,E</xref>). This matches the timing for peak viral RNA, protein expression and titres over the timepoints examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-D</xref>). Exceptions to this trend include the potential PLP substrates, 2/3 of which begin to show increased abundance at 12h post-infection, with BST1 appearing to peak at 12h rather than 24h, indicating a potential temporal regulation of the two viral proteases. Data for all quantified and filtered N- and neo-N-termini from A549-Ace2 and Vero E6 cells is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">tables S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">S5</xref> respectively. Paired analysis of enriched neo-N-termini together with our unenriched dataset, allowed inference of cleavage stoichiometry for a subset of these significantly enriched cleaved cellular neo-N-termini by the HIquant approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>) <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S14</xref>, suggesting that by 24h in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, the majority of these proteins are present in the cleaved form.</p>
<p id="P35">We sought to validate a subset of prospective SARS-CoV-2 protease substrates <italic>in vitro</italic>, using the L. tarentolae system previously used to identify cleavage of proteins involved in the immune response by the SARS-CoV-2 proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). For these assays, the target protein is fused (N- or C-terminally) to GFP, which is then imaged directly in the SDS-PAGE gel. This system sucessfully validated cleavage of PNN, PAICS and SRC by Mpro (PNN, PAICS) and PLP (SRC) respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). It also indicated additional cleavage products of PNN, and SRC not identified in the original mass spectrometry study. SRC cleavage was identified by N-terminomics following a LfGG motif yielding a neo-N-terminus at F67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Two SRC cleavage products migrate at slightly over 30kDa (including the GFP tag). The second cleavage product found in vitro migrates at slightly higher molecular weight, consistent with cleavage at an LaGG motif 19 amino acids downstream of the first cleavage site, generating a neo-N-terminus at V86 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4,H</xref>).</p>
<p id="P36">Titration of the amount of PLP included in the reaction resulted in dose-dependent cleavage of SRC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S15</xref>).</p>
<p id="P37">In addition to a cleavage product consistent with the cleavage at S114 observed in the N-terminomics migrating between the 80-115kDa markers, a second cleavage product of PNN was also identified, migrating at slightly over 50kDa including the GFP tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>). However there are multiple candidate cleavage sites located in this portion of PNN that could explain this cleavage event.</p>
<p id="P38">We also validated cleavage of PAICS and GOLGA3 by SARS-CoV-2 in a cell-based assay. To generate functional Mpro, a plasmid containing the nsp4-5 sequence was generated, permitting autocleavage at the nsp4-5 junction and generation of an authentic N-terminus for nsp5 (Mpro). Transfection of HEK 293 cells with this construct resulted in cleavage of PAICS and GOLGA3. Both antibodies recognise the C-terminus of the cleaved proteins. As with the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, cleavage of PAICS resulted in the appearence of a single cleavage product. This assay recognises endogenous rather than tagged PAICS which is why both uncleaved and cleaved PAICS have differing apparent molecular weights in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref> and G. Anti-GOLGA3 cleavage results in the appearence of a single-cleavage product at slightly over 70kDa. This may reflect further proteolytic cleavage of this protein given that the observed cleavage at 365/366 would be expacted to result in a 40k reduction in the apparent molecular weight of GOLGA3 which migrates at slightly over its predicted molecular weight of 167kDa.</p>

<title>Prospective MPro and PLP substrates are necessary for efficient viral replication, and represent targets for pharmacological intervention</title>
<p id="P39">To investigate if the putative cellular substrates of MPro and PLP identified in the N-terminomic analyses are necessary for efficient viral replication, an siRNA screen was conducted <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>. Where proteolytic cleavage inactivates cellular proteins or pathways inhibitory for SARS-CoV-2 replication, siRNA depletion would be anticipated to result in inreased viral titres and/or RNA levels. If proteolysis results in altered function that is beneficial for the virus, we would expect siRNA depletion to result in a reduction in viral titres/RNA levels. Proteins with neo-N-termini showing statistically significant increased abundance during SARS-CoV-2 infection and either matching, or similar to the viral protease consensus sequences were selected for siRNA depletion.</p>
<p id="P40">Infection of A549-Ace2 cells was performed 24h posttransfection with the indicated siRNA and allowed to proceed for 72h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Cell viability for all targets was comparable to untreated controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S16</xref>). siRNA knockdown efficiency at the time of infection was confirmed by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S17</xref>), with a low of 77% efficiency for NUCKS1, and averaging over 95% efficiency for most targets. 10/14 coronavirus protease substrates showed significant reductions (one-way ANOVA, p ≤ 0.01) in viral RNA levels, averaging a 100-1000-fold median decrease in viral RNA equating to pfu equivalents per ml at 72h post-infection compared to treatment with a control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). PAICS, GOLGA3, NUCKS1, and XRCC1 did not show a significant drop in RNA copy number following siRNA treatment. Plaque assays were then conducted on these samples to determine whether this observed reduction in viral RNA levels reflected a reduction in infectious virus titres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). All 14 potential substrates showed a statistically significant (one-way ANOVA, p ≤ 0.01) reduction in viral titres following siRNA depletion. For PAICS and GOLGA3, which did not show reduced RNA levels, these reductions were approximately 10-fold. Most other siRNA targets showed reduced titres in the 100-1000-fold range. These differences in outcome between viral RNA levels and plaque assays may result from a subset of proteins required for efficient viral replication. While efficient mRNA knockdown was shown for all targets <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S17</xref>, it is also possible that this discrepancy between viral RNA levels and titres may result from differences in protein half-life of the knockdown targets. This could result in proteins with longer half lives only giving a phenotype at later stages of infection when infectious virus is produced. Finally, we extended our analysis to two previouslyidentified SARS-CoV-2 substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), IRF3 and TAB1 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S18</xref> not identified in our N-terminomic analysis. We found that in line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), the antiviral IRF3 resulted in an aproximately 3-fold increase in viral titres and increased RNA copies. In contrast, TAB1 depletion resulted in reduced SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies and viral titres, possibly reflecting the role of TAB1 in negative regulation of antiviral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). In line with the apparently pro-viral nature of the majority of the prospective SARS-CoV-2 substrates, we observed in a microscopy-based viability assay that siRNA-treated infected cells appeared to show enhanced viability compared to infected cells treated with a scrambled siRNA control, though only reached statistically significance (One-way ANOVA, Tukey’s correction for multiple hypothesis testing) for some substrates (PNN, XRCC1, GOLGA3, ATP5F1B).</p>
<p id="P41">A subset of the prospective viral protease substrates have commercially-available inhibitors, notably SRC and MYLK. In the case of SRC these include tyrosine kinase inhibitors in current clinical use. In light of the siRNA screening results we concluded that pharmacological inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 protease substrates could represent a viable means to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dose-response experiments were conducted with 7 inhibitors to determine whether pharmacological inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 protease substrates could be employed as a potential therapeutic strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S19</xref>). Of these, two tyrosine kinase inhibitors: Bafetinib and Sorafenib showed inhibition at concentrations which did not result in cytotoxicity in the human cell line A549-Ace2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). In the case of Bafetinib, a Lyn/Bcr-Abl inhibitor which has off-target activity against SRC the <italic>IC</italic>

Bafetinib has recently been independently identified as an inhibitor of the coronaviruses OC43 and SARS-COV-2 in a large-scale drug-repurposing screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Inhibition with Sorafenib which was included as a positive control and does not directly target any of the protease substrates was in the low micromolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), in line with a previously published report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Two inhibitors were trialed against MYLK. These were MLCK inhibitor peptide 18, and ML-7. Only ML-7 showed inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, with inhibition in the low micromolar range (<italic>IC</italic>

ML-7 and MLCK inhibitor peptide 18 have different mechanisms of action, with MLCK inhibitor peptide 18 outcompeting kinase substrate peptides, and ML-7 inhibiting ATPase activity. All four had <italic>CC</italic>

<p id="P42">The other 3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors tested (Bosutinib, Saracatinib, Dasatinib) all showed inhibition <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S19</xref>, however cytotoxicity results obtained with the assay used were also high preventing the unambiguous determination of whether inhibition was specific or due to cytotoxicity <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S20</xref>. However, it should be noted that these agents have been reported to be cytostatic in A549 cells, and the CellTiter Gloassay used to assess viability measures cellular metabolism so will not distinguish between cytostatic and cytotoxic effects.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P43">We employed a mass spectrometry approach to study proteolytic cleavage events during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Substrates of viral proteases are frequently inferred through studies of related proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). However, such approaches are unable to identify novel substrates, and even closely-related proteases can differ in their substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). Mass spectrometry-based approaches to identify protease substrates by identifying the neo-N-terminal peptides generated by protease activity have existed for a number of years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>), however, they have seen only limited application to the study of viral substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>), and have not been previously applied to the study of proteolysis during coronavirus infection.</p>
<p id="P44">While our approach identified multiple novel viral and cellular cleavage sites, it also failed to identify multiple known cleavage sites, including the FURIN cleavage site in spike, and multiple cleavage sites within the viral polyprotein. This can be understood from the dependence of the approach on the specific protease used for mass spectrometry analysis. Isobaric labelling prior to trypsin digestion blocks tryptic cleavage at lysine residues and causes trypsin to cleave solely after arginine residues. This results in the generation of long peptides and if the specific cleavage site does not produce a peptide of suitable length for analysis (typically 8-30 amino acids) then it will be missed. This can be alleviated through the application of multiple mass spectrometry-compatible proteases in parallel, yielding multiple peptides of different length for each cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). This would both increase the number of sites identified and cross-validate previously identified cleavage sites. These methods will likely prove a fruitful avenue for future investigations of proteolysis during infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses that employ protease-driven mechanisms of viral replication.</p>
<p id="P45">Our approach identified multiple cleavage sites within viral proteins. In some cases, such as the nucleocapsid protein, cleavage by cellular proteases has been observed for SARS-CoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), though the number of cleavage products observed was much higher in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Compared to the gel-based approaches used in the past, our approach is much more sensitive for detecting when protease activity results in N-termini with ragged ends, due to further exoproteolytic activity. Examples of this in our data are particularly evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> for the nucleocapsid and ORF3a where neo-N-termini appear in clusters. Cleavage sites within the nucleocapsid and spike protein are of particular interest as these are the two viral antigens to which research is closely focuses for both testing and vaccination purposes. In this context, neo-N-termini are of interest as N-termini can be recognised by the immune response, as they are typically surface-exposed. Antibodies recognising neo-N-termini such sites will not be detected in tests using complete or recombinant fragments that do not account for such cleavage sites. Indeed, a recent study revealed altered antigenicity of proteolytic proteoforms of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid following autolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), and loss of antibody responses to spike following mutations in circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants altering signal peptide cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Understanding cleavage events can also inform interpretation of protein structural analysis, for example in the ORF3a viroporin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Knowledge of cleavage sites can permit further analysis of spike entry mechanisms, and vaccine design, and inform genotype-to-phenotype predictions.</p>
<p id="P46">Formation of the most prominent neo-N-terminus we identified in SARS-CoV-2 spike at 637 appeared dependent on cathepsins and/or calpains, as its appearance was limited by calpeptin treatment. Mutation of the P2 residue in the putative cleavage site, resulting in mutant V365G, led to an increased incorporation of cleaved spike in pseudotyped viral particles. Consistent with an increased content of fusioncompetent cleaved spike, the V635G mutant showed an increased infectivity in HEK-Ace2 target cells.</p>
<p id="P47">Why blocking the formation of the 637 neo-N-terminus promotes cleaved spike incorporation remains to be elucidated. A possible explanation may lie in a competition between different cleavage sites in the producer cell, with cleavage at 637 inhibiting cleavage at the FURIN site, or inhibiting the incorporation of spike trimers already cleaved at the FURIN site. The capacity of producer cells to cleave viral glycoproteins at alternative sites may thus be viewed as an intrinsic defense mechanism. In contrast, the capacity of viral proteases to cleave multiple host proteins, as demonstrated in this study, contributes to well-established mechanisms aiming at inhibiting innate host responses, including in particular the interferon pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Therefore, the diversity of proteolytic cleavage events revealed by N-terminomics may reflect another layer in the dynamic evolutionary conflict between viruses and their hosts.</p>
<p id="P48">Proteolytic cleavage can alter protein function in several ways, including inactivation, re-localisation, or altered function including the removal of inhibitory domains. Our siRNA screen showed knockdown of the majority of potential protease targets we identified was inhibitory to SARS-CoV-2 replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Indeed, with the exception of the previously reported antiviral protein IRF3, no siRNA treatment resulted in higher viral titres or RNA levels, suggesting that inactivation is not the prime purpose of these cleavage events. This suggests that in many cases, proteolytic cleavage by viral proteases may be extremely targeted, serving to fine-tune protein activity, rather than merely serving as a blunt instrument to shut down unfavorable host responses. It is also worth noting the low overlap between our infection-based study, and a subsequently released N-terminomics dataset which used incubation of cell culture lysates with recombinant Mpro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Only GOLGA3 was common to both studies, in spite of the larger number of cleavage events identified in the Koudelka <italic>et al.</italic> study. However in such a lysate-based experiment subcellular compartmentalisation and regulation of relative enzyme and substrate localisation &amp; abundance is lost, so can risk identifying cleavage events not possible <italic>in vivo</italic> during genuine infection. An improved understanding of the exact ways in which proteolytic cleavage is regulated, modulates protein activity, and serves to benefit viral replication will be crucial for targeting cellular substrates of viral proteases as a therapeutic strategy.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p id="P49">In this study, we used two cell line models to characterise the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on protease activity and the generation of viral and cellular cleavage products. Notably, we tested the efficiency of several inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 infection only in the context of the A549-Ace2 cell line model. Given previous experiences translating cell culture findings for SARS-CoV-2 to the clinic, it is important to note these results present preliminary data that must be further validated in other models, <italic>in vivo</italic>, and through clinical trials before use in patients for the treatment of COVID-19 disease.</p>

At 48h after transfection, supernatants were collected and concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 23,000 g for 1h 30m at 4°C on a 20% sucrose cushion. Viral particles were resuspended in PBS and frozen in aliquots at -80°C until use. Gag p24 antigen concentration was measured with the Alliance HIV-1 p24 Antigen ELISA kit (Perkin Elmer).</p>
<p id="P69">Point mutations to generate the mutants were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis of phCMV-SARS-CoV-2-Spike using Q5 polymerase (Thermo Scientific) and validated by sanger sequencing.

<title>Infection with spike-pseudotyped lentivectors</title>
<p id="P70">The day before infection, 100,000 HEK-ACE2 or HEK-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were plated in 96-well plates and TMPRSS2 was induced by the addition of doxycycline. HEK-ACE2 +/- TMPRSS2 were infected with the equivalent of 2 µg of p24 Gag for each spike lentivector, in final volume of 100 µL. Infection was quantified by measuring the percentage of GFP+ cells two days post-infection by flow cytometry. Cells were harvested, washed in PBS, and stained with the viability dye eF780 (eBioscience) for 30 min at 4°C. After two washes in PBS, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde 2% (ThermoFisher) and acquired on an Attune NxT flow cytometer. Results were analyzed with FlowJo software (v10.7.1), with statistical analyses carried out with the GraphPad Prism software (v9).</p>

<title>Western blotting of spike-pseudotyped lentivectors</title>
<p id="P71">To prepare protein extracts, cells were lysed in buffer with NaCl 150 mM, Tris HCl 50 mM (pH8), 1% Triton, EDTA 5 mM, supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche) for 30 min on ice. For lentiviral particle extracts, an equivalent of 500 ng of p24 Gag was lysed in buffer with 1% Triton (ELISA kit, Alliance Perkin Elmer) for 30 min on ice. To preserve antibody reactivity, samples were not heated nor reduced before being run in a 4-12% acrylamide denaturing gel (NP0323, NuPAGE, ThermoFisher), and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (IB23001, ThermoFisher). The membrane was blocked with 5% dried milk in PBS Tween 0.1%, before incubation with the primary antibody for 1h at RT, followed by 3 washes, and incubation with the secondary antibody for 30 min at RT. After 3 more washes, the fluorescent signal was revealed on a LiCor Odyssey 9120 imaging system. Images were quantified with the ImageStudioLite (v5.2.5) software, using a mode with automated background subtraction. Primary antibodies consisted in the human anti-spike mAb 48 (1:1,000; a gift from H. Mouquet) or the mouse anti-p24 Gag MAB7360 (R&amp;D Systems; 1:1000). Anti-human or mouse IgG secondary antibodies, conjugated to DyLight-800 (A80-304D8, Bethyl Laboratories) or DyLight-680 (SA5-35521, ThermoFisher) respectively, were used at a 1:10,000 concentration.</p>

<title>In vitro cleavage assays</title>
<p id="P72">
<italic>In vitro</italic> cleavage assays were performed using the Leishmania tarentolae (LTE) system as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). SRC, PAICS, PNN and RPA2 (control) were cloned as GFP fusion proteins into dedicated Gateway vectors for cell-free expression. Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in pDonor were sourced from the Human ORFeome collection, version 8.1 and transferred into Gateway destination vectors that include N-terminal (SRC) or C-terminal (PAICS, PNN and RPA2) Fluorescent proteins. The specific Gateway vectors were created by the laboratory of Pr. Alexandrov and sourced from Addgene (Addgene plasmid # 67137; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene:67137">http://n2t.net/addgene:67137;RRID:Addgene_67137</ext-link>). LTE extracts for <italic>in vitro</italic> expression were prepared in-house as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). Purified recombinant Mpro and PLP were generated by the UNSW protein production facility as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p>
<p id="P73">The SRC, PAICS, PNN and RPA2proteins were expressed individually in 10 µL reactions (1µL DNA plasmid at concentrations ranging from 400ng/L to 2000ng/L added to 9 µL of LTE reagent). The mixture was incubated for 30 minutes at 27°C to allow the efficient conversion of DNA into RNA. The samples were then split into controls and protease-containing reactions. The proteases PLpro (nsp3) and 3CLpro (nsp5) were added at various concentrations, and the reactions were allowed to proceed for another 2.5h at 27°C before analysis. The controls and protease-treated LTE reactions were then mixed with LDS (Bolt LDS Sample Buffer, ThermoFisher) and loaded onto SDS-page gels (4-12% Bis-Tris Plus gels, ThermoFisher); the proteins were detected by scanning the gel for green (GFP) fluorescence using a ChemiDoc MP system (BioRad) and proteolytic cleavage was assessed from the changes in banding patterns. Note that in this protocol, the proteins are not treated at high temperature with the LDS and not fully denatured, to avoid destruction of the GFP fluorescence. As proteins would retain some folding, the apparent migration on the SDS-page gels may differ slightly from the expected migration calculated from their molecular weight. We have calibrated our SDS-page gels and ladders using a range of proteins, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p>

<title>Transfection and cell-based validation of proteolytic cleavage by Western blotting</title>
<p id="P74">A mammalian expression plasmid expressing the coding sequence of SARS-Cov-2 Nsp4-Nsp5 in a pCDNA3.1 backbone was synthesized (GeneArt™ Gene synthesis, ThermoFisher, USA). HEK 293T cells in a 6 well plate were transfected with polyethylenimine (PEI) and 2ug of Nsp4-Nsp5 fusion construct, or with pCDNA3.1 control, in 3 biological replicates. After 48 hours, cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (ThermoFisher, USA) in presence of Phosphatase/Protease inhibitors cocktail (ThermoFisher, USA). The lysate was centrifuged (15 min at 4°C and 13000rpm) and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was quantified using Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay kit (ThermoFisher, USA) and Western Blot performed with standard protocol. Briefly, proteins were seperated on a precast 4-20% gradient gel (Biorad, USA) and transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System and Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer Buffer (Biorad, USA). Membranes were blocked for 1 hour with 5% milk in TBST (Tris-Buffered Saline and Tween 20) buffer, rinsed, and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies in 2% BSA in TBST. Membranes were washed with TBST and incubated for 2h at room temperature with Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary secondary antibody (Cell signaling #7074). Chemiluminescent signal was revealed using SuperSignal™ West Pico PLUS Substrate (ThermoFisher, USA) and imaged with an Azure 600 Imaging system (Azure Biosystem, USA). The primary antibodies used were PAICS (Bethyl A304-547A-T), GOLGA3 (Bethyl A303-404A-T) and β-Tubulin (Cell Signaling #2128). Primary and secondary antibodies were used at 1/1000 and 1/5000 dilutions, respectively. Importantly, primary antibodies against PAICS and GOLGA3 recognized C-terminal immunogens, ensuring that cleaved proteins could be detected.</p>

<title>Virus infections in siRNA-based cellular protein knockdowns</title>
<p id="P75">Host proteins were knocked-down in A549-Ace2 cells using specific dsiRNAs from IDT. Briefly, A549-Ace2 cells seeded at 1x10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in 96-well plates. After 24 hours, each well was transfected with 5 pmol of individual dsiRNAs using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 24 hours post transfection, the cell culture supernatant was removed and replaced with virus inoculum (MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell). Following a 1 hour adsorption at 37°C, the virus inoculum was removed and replaced with fresh 2% FBS/DMEM media. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 3 days before supernatants were harvested. Samples were either heat-inactivated at 80°C for 20 min and viral RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR, using previously published SARS-CoV-2 specific primers targeting the N gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>). RT-qPCR was performed using the Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (NEB) in an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 7 thermocycler, using the following cycling conditions: 55 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 1 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 sec, followed by 60 °C for 1 min. The quantity of viral genomes is expressed as PFU equivalents, and was calculated by performing a standard curve with RNA derived from a viral stock with a known viral titer. Alternatively, infectious virus titers were quantified using plaque assays as described above. To quantify siRNA-based cellular protein knockdowns, A549-Ace2 cells were seeded and transfected with individual dsiRNAs as described above. After 24 hours incubation at 37 °C cells were lysed and RNA was extracted using Trizol (ThermoFisher Scientific) followed by purification using the Direct-zol-96 RNA extraction kit (Zymo) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA levels of target proteins were subsequently quantified by using RT-with the Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (NEB) in an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 7 thermocycler using gene-specific primers. Expression levels were compared to scrambled dsiRNA-transfected cells und normalized to expression of human beta-actin. Knockdown efficiencies were calculated using ΔΔCt in Matlab.</p>
<p id="P76">To assess cell viability after siRNA knockdowns, cells were seeded and transfected as described above. 24 hours after transfection cell viability was measured using alamar-Blue reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific), media was removed and replaced with alamarBlue and incubated for 1h at 37 °C and fluorescence measured in a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro plate reader. Percentage viability was calculated relative to untreated cells (100% viability) and cells lysed with 20% ethanol (0% viability), included in each plate.</p>
<p id="P77">For cell counting to determine cell numbers, cells were fixed in formalin to deactivate virus. The fixed cells were stained with 5µg/ml of Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). The assay plates were imaged on an IX-83 automated inverted microscope (Olympus) using a 10x objective. The DAPI settings (Ex UV 377/50, Em 415–480) were used to image Hoechst 33258. The acquisition setup was configured to image 4 sites per well. The nuclei were identified using the object detection module in the ScanR analysis software.</p>

<title>N-terminomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection of A549-Ace2 and Vero E6 cells.</title>
<p>A) Experimental design. B) Viral RNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR (n = 3 biological replicates). C) Protein levels were determined based on the TMTpro fractional intensity of the total protein intensity for the unenriched proteomic samples (n = 3 biological replicates). D) Infectious virus production (PFU). (n = 3 biological replicates). Error bars for B-D represent standard deviation. E) A549-Ace2 and F) Vero E6 neo-N-terminomic analysis reveals significant increases in peptides corresponding to viral and cellular neo-N-termini, where neo-N-termini must begin from amino acid 2 or later. P-values were obtained by two-tailed unpaired t-test, correction for multiple hypothesis testing to obtain Q-values was performed as described Storey (2002)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). bRP = basic reverse phase fractionation, PFU = plaque-forming units. The vertical and horizontal lines correspond to fold change (0.5) cutoff and Q-value (0.05) cutoffs respectively.</p>

<title>Proteolysis of viral proteins during SARS-CoV-2 infection.</title>
<p>A) Schematic of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and proteome, with the nsp3 (PLP) and nsp3 (MPro) highlighted. Proteolytic processing of SARS-CoV-2 proteins during infection of A549-Ace2 and Vero E6 cells includes B) extensive cleavage of the nucleocapsid protein C) N-terminal processing of the ORF3a putative viroporin, and D) a novel cleavage site between Y636 and S637 in spike, N-terminal of the FURIN cleavage site. E) The abundance of the S637 spike neo-N-terminus increases over the infection timecourse (n = 3, error bars show standard deviation from 3 biological replicates). F) This cleavage site is present on an flexible region, C-terminal of the RBD (PDB: 6X6P).</p>

<title>Several viral neo-N-termini show sensitivity to specific protease inhibitors and a spike 637-proximal mutation alters viral entry in TMPRSS2-ve cells.</title>
<p>a) Experimental design for N-terminomics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of protease inhibitors. b) Abundance of viral neo-N-termini in infected cells +/- inhibitors. Data normalised to total levels of the relevant viral protein (n = 3 biological replicates). Pseudovirus entry assay conducted in c) HEK-Ace2 and d) HEK-Ace2-TMPRSS2 cells. The infectivity of lentivectors (LV) pseudotyped with the different spike mutants was normalized to that of WT in the HEK-Ace2 cell line (n <italic>≥</italic> 5 biological replicates) E) Western blotting of the pseudovirus stocks used in C) and D) confirms spike expression and incorporation into lentiviral particles. F) Densitometry analysis of spike western blotting data, examining the ratio between uncleaved (S0) and cleaved (S1) portions of the spike protein present in purified pseudotyped lentivirus stocks (n <italic>≥</italic> 3 biological replicates). Boxplots show median and interquartile ranges with whiskers extending to the most extreme non-outlier values. Unpaired Welch’s t-tests, which do not assume equal variance were used for statistical analyses.</p>

<title>Increased abundance of novel cellular neo-N-termini consistent with SARS-CoV-2 protease consensus sequences suggests viral protease activity on cellular substrates.</title>
<p>a) and b) show motif analysis highlighting enriched amino acids proximal to the N-terminus of neo-N-termini enriched in SARS-CoV-2-infected A549-Ace2 and Vero E6 cells respectively. DAU = Differential amino acid usage. The P5 to P5’ positions for the cleavage sites are shown following the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger. c) Consensus motifs for Mpro and PLP. d) and e) show the relative abundance of cellular neo-N-termini identified as significantly upregulated (n = 3 biological replicates, unpaired two sample t-test, multiple-hypothesis corrected q &lt;= 0.05) and matching or resembling the Mpro or PLP consensus motifs from A549-Ace2 or Vero E6 cells respectively. Sequence match to the consensus is indicated by the pink or green coloring of the P4 to P1 positions of the relevant cleavage sites indicating match to the Mpro or PLP P4, P2 or P1 positions respectively. f) <italic>In vitro</italic> validation of GFP-tagged PNN, PAICS and SRC cleavage by SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and PLP, following incubation with 10µM of the respective protease. g) Cell-based validation of Mpro cleavage of GOLGA3 and PAICS following transfection of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp4-5 plasmid. β-tubulin is included as a loading control.</p>

<title>siRNA depletion of potential MPro and PLP substrates results in significant reductions to viral RNA copies and titres in A549-Ace2 cells.</title>
<p>A) Experimental design, B) Viral RNA copies and C) titres in supernatant at 72h post-infection, following infection 24h post-transfection with the indicated siRNA (n <italic>≥</italic> 4 biological replicates). Colored bars indicate median (hollow circle with dot) and 25th and 75th percentiles. Individual datapoints are shown in grey. Significance was calculated by one-way ANOVA. Blue bars indicate samples with significantly reduced viral RNA copies or titres (p&lt;=0.01). Those not meeting this threshold are shown in red. The control siRNA-treated sample is indicated with a black bar. The limit of detection in the plaque assay was calculated to be 40 PFU/mL (dotted line).</p>
