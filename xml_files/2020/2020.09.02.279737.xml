Viruses like influenza or coronaviruses can be transmitted through respiratory droplets or contaminated surfaces. An effective antiviral coating can decrease the viability of the virus particles in the outside environment significantly, hence reducing their transmission rate. In this work, we have screened a series of nanoparticles and their composites for antiviral activity using Nano Luciferase based highly sensitive influenza A reporter virus. Using this screening system, we have identified copper-graphene (Cu-Gr) nanocomposite shows strong antiviral activity. Extensive material and biological characterization of the nanocomposite suggested a unique metal oxide embedded graphene sheet architecture that can inactivate the virion particles only within 30 minutes of pre-incubation and subsequently interferes with the entry of these virion particles into the host cell. This ultimately results in reduced viral gene expression, replication and production of progeny virus particles, slowing down the overall pace of progression of infection. Using PVA as a capping agent, we have been able to generate a Cu-Gr nanocomposite based highly transparent coating that retains its original antiviral activity in the solid form.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Nanocomposite</kwd><kwd>Influenza virus</kwd><kwd>Nano-Luciferase</kwd><kwd>Antivirals coating</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The emergence of novel virus strains and the associated outbreaks are becoming a significant threat to mankind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Koven 2020</xref>). The currently ongoing pandemic, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has brought the majority of the world to a grinding halt, severely impacting health &amp; economy across the nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Letko, Marzi, and Munster 2020</xref>). So far, the COVID-19 pandemic has claimed 720,000 lives resulting from 19.4 million infections globally. This reminds us of the great 1918 Spanish flu pandemic by the influenza virus, which resulted in 500 million infections with 50 million deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Johnson and Mueller 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Patterson and Pyle 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Taubenberger and Morens 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Landrigan et al. 2018</xref>). Till date, there have been four worldwide pandemics caused by influenza viruses in the last century (1918, 1957, 1968, 2009) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">World Health Organization 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Saunders-Hastings and Krewski 2016</xref>), while Covid19 is the first pandemic caused by the Coronavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Y. Wu et al. 2020</xref>). Other than pandemics, influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal outbreaks (290,000 to 650,000 deaths worldwide: CDC FLUVIEW] and different coronaviruses cause mild flu-like symptoms to severe respiratory infections (SARS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">De Wit et al. 2016</xref>) and MERS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lin et al. 2019</xref>) coronavirus epidemics during 2002 and 2012 respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Fehr and Perlman 2015</xref>). Clearly, recurring respiratory infections caused by these viruses are becoming one of the global human health problem.</p><p id="P3">Both influenza and coronaviruses cause respiratory infections, which can be transmitted from infected to healthy individuals through respiratory droplets, aerosols or contacts. These respiratory pathogens are known for their ability to persist on inanimate surfaces for days and even up to months, depending upon weather conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Vasickova et al. 2010</xref>). As a result, touching contaminated surfaces in public places is a potential route of viral transmission. In fact, the inanimate surfaces have been identified as a major cause of infections, especially in institutions where individuals are in contact with patients or contaminated fomites. Thus, the development of low cost and easily scalable antiviral coating materials, which could be widely applied to various surfaces in order to inactivate the virus particles in the environment, may serve as an effective way to reduce the chance of infection and hence to lower the overall speed of transmission.</p><p id="P4">Different metal oxides, including Cu and Ag have been explored for their biocidal activity in soluble as well as in insoluble forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Minoshima et al. 2016</xref>). Copper and silver nanoparticles have remarkable properties like high electrical and thermal conductivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Barani et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">D. Deng et al. 2013</xref>), superior catalytic nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gawande et al. 2016</xref>), anti-fungal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Cioffi et al. 2005</xref>) and bacteriostatic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Ruparelia et al. 2008</xref>) to name a few. Solid-state cuprous oxide and silver nitrate have been shown to inactivate virus particles through interfering with the activity of the surface antigen, hemagglutinin (HA), thereby blocking the attachment of the virus to the host cell receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Fehr and Perlman 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Sunada, Minoshima, and Hashimoto 2012</xref>). Cuprous oxide nanoparticles had also been shown to inhibit the attachment and entry stages of Hepatitis C Virus infection, hence suggesting a generic mechanism for the copper-based nanoparticles for their antiviral activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hang et al. 2015</xref>). This may also explain the lesser viability of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles on copper surfaces (8 h) when compared to stainless steel and plastic surfaces (72 h) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Neeltje van Doremalen et al. 2020</xref>). Biological activity of the Cu or Ag nanoparticles largely depends upon their size, shape, stability and capping agent. Due to the high reactivity of these nanoparticles, they can undergo rapid agglomeration leading to the drastic reduction of their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Ma et al. 2011</xref>). One way to overcome this instability is to form a composite with other organic or inorganic compounds which stabilizes the nanoparticles by altering their surface architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Perdikaki et al. 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Graphene is composed of a single atom thick sheet of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms that forms a honeycomb lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mohammed et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Palmieri and Papi 2020</xref>). This structure of graphene is responsible for its large surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, strong mechanical strength and unique physicochemical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Edwards and Coleman 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Eigler and Hirsch 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Novoselov et al. 2012</xref>). It is used extensively in the field of nano-medicine due to easy surface functionality and controlled selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Park et al. 2020</xref>). In recent times, the two dimensional sheet of graphene has caught much attention due to its antimicrobial and antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Georgakilas et al. 2012</xref>). Differentially functionalized graphene oxide sheets can warp and encapsulate microorganisms, thereby severely restricting their interaction with host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Perdikaki et al. 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Vinothini and Rajan 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Karahan et al. 2018</xref>). For example, sulfate functionalized reduced graphene oxide has been shown to interact with the positively charged surface proteins of different orthopoxvirus strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Ziem et al. 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Ye et al. 2015</xref>). In this work, we have performed an extensive investigation of the potential antiviral activity of copper (Cu) nanoparticles, silver (Ag) nanoparticles, graphene (Gr) and their hybrid versions (nanocomposite materials) Ag-graphene, Cu-graphene and Ag-Cu-graphene against respiratory viruses using influenza A virus as a model system. Our data shows that prior incubation with the colloidal Cu-Gr nanocomposite can impose a strong reduction in viral infectivity, which gets manifested in the reduced viral entry, gene expression and subsequent production of progeny virions. Extensive material characterization using UV-Visible absorption and Raman spectroscopy along with X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) reveals a unique architecture of copper oxide decorated two-dimensional graphene sheets. The shape, size and distribution of the hybrid nanoparticles were also studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX). Finally, we have developed for the first time a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) based copper-graphene nanocomposite coating, which is completely transparent and shows strong antiviral activity in the solid phase.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Synthesis and preliminary characterization of the nanoparticles and nanocomposites</title><p id="P6">We have synthesized various nanoparticles and their hybrids using a simple and cost-effective chemical method as discussed in the experimental section. The synthesized materials are Cu nanoparticles, Ag nanoparticles, graphene (Gr) and their hybrid versions Ag-graphene, Cu- graphene and Ag-Cu-graphene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 A, B</xref>). Visible absorption spectra of each of these variants confirms the presence of respective components either alone or in combination with their composite partners, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C and D</xref>. The peak at 418 nm confirms the formation of Ag colloidal nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Jin et al. 2005</xref>). From literature, it is attributed to Surface Plasmon Resonance with spherical nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Hu et al. 2013</xref>). From the UV-vis spectra of the composite Ag-Gr, Plasmon absorption band at around 410 nm, indicates the formation of a hybrid structure. Incorporation of Ag nanoparticles on graphene sheets had led to a blue shift of the surface plasmon resonance, a characteristic similar to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kim et al. 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Furthermore, Cu nanoparticles, due to exposure of air at room temperature, goes through surface oxidation, which is the reason that samples contain oxygen in +1 and +2 states forming CuO or Cu<sub>2</sub>O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Yao et al. 2005</xref>). Composite including both Ag and Cu nanoparticles were also analyzed from the absorption spectrum. A broad graphene peak was observed at 280 nm in the composite. Both Ag and Cu nanoparticle plasmon peaks were observed and confirmed the presence of the colloidal nanoparticles on graphene sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Darabdhara et al. 2017</xref>). Particularly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> shows the absorption spectra of the composites and it confirms the formation of graphene and CuO/Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanoparticles. An absorption peak at 262 nm is due to π→π* transition in C=C bond of graphene. Another absorption band at~350-450 nm is attributed to the intrinsic band to band transition of the CuO and Cu<sub>2</sub>O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zhang et al. 2020</xref>). A blue shift was observed in the peak position compared to bulk CuO; this might be due to the quantum confinement effects exhibited by the particle when the size varies from bulk to nano. These UV-Vis peaks were well matched with CuO and Cu<sub>2</sub>O absorption profiles from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Chan et al. 2007</xref>). A broadened plasmon resonance peak for Cu-Gr nanocomposites is due to irregular shapes and sizes of the particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zhang et al. 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Screening of nanoparticles and their hybrids for antiviral activity</title><p id="P8">To test the antiviral activity of synthesized nanomaterials and their composites we have used a bioluminescent reporter variant of the influenza A virus, strain A/H1N1/WSN/1933, that has been previously reported by Tran et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Tran et al. 2013</xref>). This virus has a Nano-Luciferase (NLuc) gene fused to the carboxy-terminal of the viral PA gene, interspaced by the “self-cleaving” 2A peptide encoding sequence from porcine teschovirus. The Nano-Luc-influenza A reporter virus, as a part of its gene expression, synthesizes the PA-2A-NLuc polypeptide, which gets self-cleaved to produce Nano-luciferase. Subsequently, the luciferase activity could be measured as a quantitative estimate of viral gene expression and hence progression of virus replication cycle inside the cells. To test whether the Nano-luciferase activity could actually serve as a proxy to virus replication, we have infected MDCK cells with different amounts of input virus and viral replication/gene expression was monitored using Nano-Glo assay (Promega). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, there is a linear relationship between multiplicity of infection (0.01-0.1) and luciferase light unit measurements (R<sup>2</sup>= 0.9294), where an increase in one log in the input virus amount leads to about 50% increase in the luciferase activity or vice versa, measured at 8 hours of post-infection. This data suggests that the Nano-luciferase influenza A reporter virus could serve as an excellent tool to study the antiviral activity of various nanoparticles or their nanocomposites used in this study.</p><p id="P9">In order to test the antiviral activity, we have standardized a “Nano-Luc reporter assay” described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>. Briefly, Nano-luciferase influenza A reporter viruses were pre-incubated with the 5uM colloidal suspensions of each of the nanoparticles/ composites or with the vehicle control for 30 minutes at room temperature and subsequently used to infect MDCK cells at an MOI of 0.1. Luciferase activity was measured at 8 hours of post infection and plotted as a relative percentage of the vehicle control set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Prior treatment of the virus stock solution with Cu-Gr composite showed 64% reduction in viral gene expression, while prior treatment with Ag-Gr resulted in 20% reduction. Treatment with other materials shows no significant decrease in luciferase activity. From the correlation of input virus units and the corresponding luciferase activity, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, it can be inferred that prior treatment with Cu-Gr solution resulted in more than 10-fold reductions in the infectious virus population that has been used to infect the MDCK cells. In this context, it should be noted that none of the materials showed substantial cytotoxicity upon Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells (MDCK) within the concentration range of 0.5 uM - 5.0 uM as evaluated using MTT assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Hence, the reduction in Nano-luciferase activity as a result of prior exposure to Cu-Gr should be attributed exclusively to the reduction of the infectivity of the Nano-luciferase reporter virus. Henceforth, we focused upon the extensive characterization of the Cu-Gr nanocomposite.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Material characterization of Cu-Gr nanocomposite</title><p id="P10">We have extensively characterized the structural parameters of the synthesized Cu-Gr nanocomposites by optical measurements. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 A</xref> depicts Raman spectra of synthesized Cu-Gr nanocomposite samples at excitation of 532 nm in the range of 200 cm<sup>-1</sup> to 3000 cm<sup>-1</sup>. With Raman spectroscopy, we are able to distinguish both pristine graphene and copper peaks. The presence of D peak (1361 cm<sup>-1</sup>) and G peak (1527 cm<sup>-1</sup>) confirms the existence of graphene in the samples synthesized. Generally, D peak originates from defects in the hexagonal sp<sup>2</sup> carbon system while the G peak arises due to the stretching vibration of sp<sup>2</sup> carbon pairs in both rings and chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Ferrari et al. 2006</xref>). Except, D and G peak, the 2D peak arises at ~2700 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The 2D peak originates due to transverse optical (TO) phonons around the K point and is activated by triple resonance Raman scattering (TRRS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">J. Bin Wu et al. 2018</xref>). In the measured Raman spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), three peaks are (280 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 350 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 654 cm<sup>-1</sup>) observed to confirm the formation of oxide of Cu and originate due to the first order phonon scattering. The peaks are assigned to Ag and 2Bg peaks of copper oxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Y. Deng et al. 2016</xref>). The graphene sheets are also seen in the optical images, as shown in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 A</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> shows the XRD patterns of graphene, CuO, and Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanoparticles, which confirm the crystalline phase of composites samples (standard JCPDS file number 35– 0505, 80–1917). Interestingly, the intensity of the Cu<sub>2</sub>O is more intense compared to that of the CuO peaks, suggesting a higher abundance of Cu<sub>2</sub>O on the surface of the graphene sheets. No diffraction peaks corresponding to impurities are observed in the patterns.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Extensive characterization of antiviral property of Colloidal Cu-Gr nanocomposite</title><p id="P11">Followed by the material characterization, we have invested significant efforts for the characterization of the antiviral property of the Cu-Gr nanocomposites in its colloidal form. First, we have used the Nano-Luc reporter assay in order to identify the optimal time and concentration required for its antiviral activity. The Nano-Luc reporter assay was performed where the influenza A reporter virus was pretreated with the colloidal form of the Cu-Gr nanocomposite for various time periods before using them for infecting MDCK cells. As evidenced from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, a sharp decrease (&gt;50%) in the reporter activity was observed as a result of 30 minutes of preincubation with Cu-Gr composite, while longer times of preincubation showed only minor additional reduction. This data suggested that 30 minutes of preincubation with Cu-Gr composite can lead to more than tenfold reduction in input virus titer that ultimately results in ~50% decrease in reporter activity. Subsequently, we tried to identify the optimal concentration of the Cu-Gr composite required for its antiviral activity. Different concentrations of the Cu-Gr composite (50nM, 100nM, 500nM, 1μM, 2μM and 5μM, respectively) were used to treat the Nano-Luc influenza A reporter virus for 30 minutes followed by performing Nano-Luc reporter assay with the same. A precise dose dependent decrease in reporter activity and hence virus replication was observed as a result of prior treatment with Cu-Gr composite within the concentration range of 0.5mM to 5mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). While higher concentration (10μM) further reduced reporter activity, it may also show cytotoxicity upon the cells, hence excluded from the subsequent experiment.</p><p id="P12">Next, we intended to test whether the reduction in the luciferase activity of the reporter virus, as a result of pretreatment with Cu-Gr nanocomposite, can also be correlated to the reduction of progeny virus titer. A non-reporter variant of the influenza A/H1N1/WNS/1933 virus was used for this purpose. Virus stock solutions were either treated with two different concentrations of Cu-Gr nanocomposites (1μM and 5μM) or with the vehicle control prior to infection on MDCK cells. Plaque assay was performed to measure the titer of the progeny virus particles harvested at 8 hours of post-infection. There is about 40% decrease in viral titer for the sets treated 5uM Cu-Gr solution with respect to the vehicle treated sets. Treatment with 1μM Cu-Gr nanocomposite shows non-significant decrease in viral titer. This data further substantiates the fact that treatment with 5μM Cu-Gr significantly reduces viral infectivity which results in a decrease in viral gene expression, replication and subsequent production of viral titer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). The plaque assay titer data are tabulated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Prior treatment with Cu-Gr nanocomposite explicitly inhibits virus entry into the cells</title><p id="P13">At this point, we sought to examine the molecular mechanism by which Cu-Gr nanocomposite interferes with virus replication cycle. Metal nanoparticles have been shown to interfere with the integrity of the virus particles or the activity of the surface glycoproteins that may interfere with the entry of virus particles into the host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Sunada, Minoshima, and Hashimoto 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Ting Du. 2018</xref>). Hence, to investigate the effect of pretreatment of Cu-Gr specifically upon virus entry step, we have performed an ‘entry assay’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). The non-reporter variant of Influenza A WSN virus were either treated with Cu-Gr or with solvent and subsequently used to infect MDCK cells in a synchronized fashion. Post entry, cells were incubated with cycloheximide containing media for one hour to allow the import of the incoming viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) into the nucleus. Subsequently, the incoming viral RNPs were stained with antibodies specific to viral Nucleoprotein (NP), which is the major component of the RNPs. As shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6 B</xref>, input viral RNPs are solely detected inside the nucleus of the infected cells irrespective of the treatment. However, prior exposure to the Cu-Gr composite resulted in a significant reduction in the number of NP positive cells. A quantitative analysis of 5 different fields with a total of 500 cells for both treated and untreated sets shows roughly 80% decrease in number of NP positive cells in the Cu-Gr treated set, with respect to the untreated one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). This data clearly suggests that exposure to Cu-Gr nanocomposite compromises the ability of the virus particles to enter into the host cell, possibly by impacting the structural integrity of the of the virion particles.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Development of a Cu-Gr nanocomposite based transparent coating with strong antiviral activity</title><p id="P14">The ability of Cu-Gr nanocomposite to reduce the infectivity of influenza A virus prompted us to test its ability to inactivate influenza virus in the solid form. For this purpose, we have coated different wells of a 48 well plate with a series of coating solutions containing different concentrations of Cu-Gr composite (1μM, 5μM, 10 μM and 20 μM) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (1mm, 5mm, and 10mm) as a capping agent. As a control, wells were coated with only PVA. This process generated a thin transparent film of Cu-Gr nanocomposite onto the surface of each well. To test the antiviral activity of these films, defined amounts of Nano-Luc influenza A reporter virus were inoculated in these coated wells and incubated for 30 minutes. Post treatment, infectivity of these virus inoculums were tested on MDCK cells using the Nano-Luc reporter assay as mentioned above. Prior exposure to the coating materials having various concentrations of Cu-Gr composite blended in different amounts of PVA resulted in differential effects upon viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Films containing different concentrations of Cu-Gr composite, either in absence or in presence 1mM PVA barely showed any impact upon the infectivity of the virus. In contrast, an exact dose-dependent decrease in viral gene expression was observed as a result of prior treatment with the films containing increasing concentrations of Cu-Gr Composite in 5mM PVA. This antiviral activity was even more pronounced (70% decrease in Nano-Luc activity) for the films containing 1-5uM of Cu-Gr with 10mM of PVA. Together, this data shows 5uM of Cu-Gr composite capped with 10mM of PVA could be used to generate a transparent coating with high antiviral activity.</p><p id="P15">Encouraged by the results mentioned above, we have used dip-coating method used to coat a tempered glass with the Cu-Gr solution with optimum concentration. The glass unit was kept to soak the solution for 24 h and then air-dried naturally as shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>). No formation of visibly aggregated spots or clogging was observed on the glass surface. A clean, transparent screen was obtained, and when fixed on a cell phone, there was no compromisation of light intensity or clarity of image on the display screen observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>). Optical transmittance spectra confirm the transparency of the coating on glass substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>). As observed from the SEM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8D</xref>), the Cu-O nanoparticles were uniformly embedded on top of the graphene layer.

Irrespective of their specific differences in virus replication cycle, all of these viruses share broader structural similarities. The viral genomic RNA remains enwrapped with single or multiple viral proteins and remains enclosed within the lipid bilayer envelope embedded with viral spike proteins. The integrity of the lipid envelope and the functionality of the spike proteins are not only crucial for the protection of the viral genomic materials in the outer environment but also indispensable for conducting the first two steps of the virus life cycle that are “attachment” and “entry” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Jane Flint, Vincent R 2015</xref>). In this study, we have identified Cu-Gr nanocomposite as a potential antiviral agent that can interfere with these two steps of the influenza A virus life cycle, possibly through compromising the structural integrity of the virion particles.</p><p id="P17">We, for the first time, have used a highly sensitive Nano-Luc reporter assay to perform an unbiased screening of a series of nanoparticles and their composite materials in order to identify a coating substance with strong antiviral activity. Our data identified Cu-Gr nanocomposite as the most potential antiviral agent. Interestingly, Cu nanoparticles or graphene individually showed minimal or no antiviral activity in our assay while a hybrid between these two showed at least ten-fold decrease in effective viral titer. This might be due to the property of the composite substances, which is not just a hybrid between two materials in their original state, but rather a combination of the modified version of the materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Ramakrishnan et al. 2015</xref>). This can also be substantiated from the previous studies showing metal-ion based composites shows better activity compared to that of metal nanoparticles itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Minoshima et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Perdikaki et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Sunada, Minoshima, and Hashimoto 2012</xref>). Studies also reveal that the antiviral activity mainly depends on the presence of ions generated from the surface of nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Ma et al. 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Shen et al. 2010</xref>). Our XRD data clearly indicates the presence of various copper oxide species, Cu<sub>2</sub>O and CuO, embedded in the graphene sheets which may serve as the basis for the antiviral activity of the composite material. The presence of reactive oxygen species in Cu<sub>x</sub>O-graphene sheets may provide ions, which may interfere with the structural integrity of the lipid bilayer membrane or the surface antigens of the virion particles. This interference should compromise the ability of the virus particles to interact with the cell surface receptor essential for the attachment and subsequent entry into the host cell. Our entry assay supports this hypothesis, as prior treatment with Cu-Gr composite resulted in significant reduction in the percentage of infection positive cells with respect to the vehicle treated set.</p><p id="P18">Finally, we have used PVA as a capping agent and identified optimum concentrations of Cu-Gr and PVA to develop a thin transparent coating with intense antiviral activity. While we have used dip-coating method to coat a tempered glass with high visibility, other forms of coatings like doctor’s blade technique, spin coating, and spray coating can also be implemented. Due to the high transmission efficiency, such coating material could be implemented on a wide variety of surfaces, which could radically decrease the stability of the virus particles in the outer environment and hence reduce the transmission rate drastically. Needless to mention that such generic antiviral strategy can significantly reduce the overall burden of seasonal respiratory infection-related epidemics or occasional pandemics caused either by various influenza or coronaviruses.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="P19">Copper sulfate (CuSO<sub>4</sub> &gt; 99%), Silver nitrate (AgNO<sub>3</sub> &gt; 99%), Sodium borohydride (NaBH<sub>4</sub> &gt; 98%), Poly vinyl alcohol (&gt;99%), Sodium hydroxide pellets (NaOH &gt; 97%) and graphite powder (&gt;98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Cells, Viruses and Antibody</title><p id="P20">Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) (CCL-34) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% FBS at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> along with penicillin and streptomycin antibiotics (Gibco).</p><p id="P21">Influenza A virus strains, A/WSN/1933 (H1N1), WSN stably encoding PB2 with a C-terminal FLAG tag (WSN-PB2-FLAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Dos Santos Afonso et al. 2005</xref>) or PA-2A-Swap-Nluc (PASTN) reporter virus based on the strain A/WSN/33 (H1N1) were used for infecting the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Tran et al. 2013</xref>).
