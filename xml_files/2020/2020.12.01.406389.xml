In plants, a subset of NLRs contain noncanonical integrated domains that are thought to have evolved from host targets of pathogen effectors to serve as pathogen baits. However, the functions of host proteins with similarity to NLR integrated domains and the extent to which they are targeted by pathogen effectors remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the blast fungus effector AVR-Pik binds a subset of related rice proteins containing a heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain, one of the domains that has repeatedly integrated into plant NLR immune receptors. We find that AVR-Pik binding stabilizes the rice small HMA (sHMA) proteins OsHIPP19 and OsHIPP20. Knockout of <italic>OsHIPP20</italic> causes enhanced disease resistance towards the blast pathogen, indicating that <italic>OsHIPP20</italic> is a susceptibility gene (<italic>S</italic>-gene). We propose that AVR-Pik has evolved to bind HMA domain proteins and co-opt their function to suppress immunity. Yet this binding carries a trade-off, it triggers immunity in plants carrying NLR receptors with integrated HMA domains.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Classification</title><kwd>Major classification: Biological Sciences</kwd><kwd>Minor classification: Plant Biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><kwd>NLR</kwd><kwd>Effector</kwd><kwd>Host target</kwd><kwd>Rice</kwd><kwd>Evolution</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Plant pathogens target host processes to promote disease by secreting effector proteins (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>Hogenhout et al. 2009). Some of the host targets of effectors have been co-opted by plant intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors to act as baits to detect pathogens, and in this context are known as integrated domains (IDs) (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>Cesari et al. 2014; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>Wu et al. 2015; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>Sarris et al. 2016; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>Kroj et al. 2016). Genome-wide bioinformatics searches have found such domains in diverse NLR immune receptors from multiple plant families (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>Sarris et al. 2016; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>Kroj et al. 2016; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>Baggs et al. 2017; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>Bailey et al. 2018). We hypothesize that such widespread NLR-IDs modulate basic immune responses that are conserved among plants. One such domain is the heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain found in four botanical families (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>Sarris et al. 2016). In rice, HMA domains have been integrated into two different NLRs, RGA5 (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>Okuyama et al. 2011) and Pik-1 (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>Ashikawa et al. 2008). In addition to rice (a member of Poaceae), HMA domains have also integrated into NLR immune receptors of plant species in the Brassicaceae, Fabaceae and Rosaceae (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>Sarris et al. 2016; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>Kroj et al. 2016). This indicates that HMA-containing proteins have likely been repeatedly targeted by pathogens across the diversity of flowering plants. Therefore, understanding the endogenous function of HMA-containing proteins has the potential to reveal important basic features of plant disease susceptibility and immunity. In this study, we report rice HMA-containing proteins that are targets of a blast pathogen effector from <italic>Magnaporthe</italic> (syn. <italic>Pyricularia) oryzae</italic> and address their potential function.</p><p id="P3">The rice <italic>Pik</italic> locus comprises two NLR genes, <italic>Pik-1</italic> and <italic>Pik-2,</italic> and recognizes the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> effector AVR-Pik (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>Ashikawa et al. 2008), triggering an immune response that restricts infection. AVR-Pik is a 113-amino-acid protein originally defined as having no sequence similarity to known protein domains (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>Yoshida et al. 2009). More recently, structure-informed similarity searches showed that AVR-Pik belongs to the MAX <italic>(Magnaporthe</italic> AVRs and ToxB-like) family of fungal effectors (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>De Guillen et al. 2015), which adopt a six Œ≤-sandwich fold stabilized by buried hydrophobic residues, and commonly but not always, a disulphide bond. Pik-1 recognition of AVR-Pik is mediated by direct binding of the effector to an HMA domain (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>Maqbool et al. 2015) located between the N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) and nucleotide binding (NB) domains of Pik-1 (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>Kanzaki et al. 2012; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>Cesari et al. 2013). <italic>AVR-Pik</italic> and <italic>Pik-1</italic> are described as being involved in a coevolutionary arms race that has resulted in the emergence of allelic series of both effector genes in the pathogen and NLR genes in the host (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>Kanzaki et al. 2012; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>De la Concepcion et al. 2018; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>Bia≈Ças et al. 2018).</p><p id="P4">Biochemical and structural analysis of complexes between AVR-Pik variants and HMA domains of different Pik-1 alleles revealed the molecular interactions between the effector and NLR-ID (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>Maqbool et al. 2015; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>De la Concepcion et al. 2018; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>De la Concepcion et al. 2019). This knowledge recently allowed structure-guided protein engineering to expand the recognition profile of a Pik NLR to different AVR-Pik variants (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>De la Concepcion et al. 2019; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>Maidment et al. 2023). The Pik-1 HMA domains exhibit a four Œ≤-sheets and two Œ±-strands (Œ≤Œ±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±Œ≤) topology similar to the yeast copper transporter domain Ccc2A (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>Banci et al. 2001), even though the characteristic MxCxxC metal-binding motif is degenerate in Pik-1. The integrated HMA domain of RGA5 also adopts the classical HMA domain fold but, intriguingly, uses a different interface to interact with the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> effectors AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>Guo et al. 2018).</p><p id="P5">HMA domains are also found in other plant proteins that are unrelated to NLRs (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>De Abreu-Neto et al. 2013). These proteins form large and complex families known as heavy metal-associated plant proteins (HPPs) and heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant proteins (HIPPs), here collectively referred to as small proteins containing an HMA domain (abbreviated as sHMA proteins). One such sHMA protein is the product of the rice blast partial resistance gene <italic>pi21</italic> (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>Fukuoka et al. 2009). The recessive allele <italic>pi21,</italic> a presumed loss-of-function allele with a deletion mutation, confers partial broad-spectrum resistance to rice against compatible isolates of <italic>M. oryzae.</italic> This finding implicates HMA domain-containing proteins in rice defense (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>Fukuoka et al. 2009). However, the molecular function of Pi21 and other rice sHMA proteins have not been characterized to date.</p><p id="P6">Unlike other <italic>M. oryzae</italic> effectors, <italic>AVR-Pik</italic> does not show extensive presence/absence polymorphisms within the rice-infecting lineage, and its evolution in natural pathogen populations is mainly driven by nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>Kanzaki et al. 2012; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>Shi et al. 2018). This suggests that <italic>AVR-Pik</italic> encodes an activity of benefit to the pathogen that is maintained in resistance-evading forms of the effector. To address the virulence function of AVR-Pik, we set out to identify rice proteins other than the Pik NLRs that interact with this effector. We found that AVR-Pik binds and stabilizes a subset of sHMA proteins. Knockout of one sHMA gene <italic>(OsHIPP20)</italic> conferred enhanced resistance to infection by the blast pathogen, suggesting <italic>OsHIPP20</italic> is a susceptibility gene (S-gene). Our model is that AVR-Pik effectors interfere with sHMA function by stabilizing and relocating these proteins to support pathogen invasion.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>AVR-PikD binds members of a subclade of small heavy metal-associated proteins (sHMAs) of rice</title><p id="P7">To identify rice proteins that may be putative targets of AVR-PikD, we performed a yeast 2-hybrid screen (Y2H) with the effector as bait and a cDNA library prepared from leaves of rice cultivar Sasanishiki inoculated with <italic>M. oryzae</italic> as the prey. From this screen we identified four HMA-containing proteins, named OsHIPP19 (LOC_Os04g39350), OsHIPP20 (LOC_Os04g39010), OsHPP04 (LOC_Os02g37300) and OsHPP03 (LOC_Os02g37290) (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>De Abreu-Neto et al. 2013), as interactors of AVR-PikD, amongst other proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The sizes of AVR-PikD interacting HMAs ranged from 118 (OsHPP03) to 123 (OsHIPP19) amino acids.</p><p id="P8">Rice sHMA proteins typically comprise a conserved N-terminal HMA domain followed by a variable proline-rich domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) and may contain a C-terminal ‚ÄúCaaX‚Äù isoprenylation motif (where ‚Äúa‚Äù represents an aliphatic amino acid and X represents any amino acid). They form a large protein family with 87 members in the rice genome (cultivar Nipponbare) as annotated by Rice Genome Annotation Project (24Kawahara et al. 2013) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses of the aligned HMA domains of rice sHMA proteins revealed two clades supported by high bootstrap values (&gt; 90%) that we designate here as Clades A and B. All four sHMA proteins interacting with AVR-PikD belong to Clade A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Interestingly, the HMA domains of RGA5 and three alleles of the Pik-1 NLRs also cluster in Clade A. However, the integrated HMA domains of Pik-1 (Pik*-HMA, Pikm-HMA and Pikp-HMA) and RGA5 (RGA5-HMA) are on separate branches in the tree, indicating distinct lineages and diversification patterns.</p><p id="P9">To determine if AVR-PikD interacts with other Clade A sHMA proteins, we selected 15 that are expressed in rice leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) and tested pairwise interactions by Y2H (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). This experiment showed that AVR-PikD binds around half of the tested Clade A sHMA proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We also tested binding of AVR-PikD with three sHMA proteins from Clade B, including OsHIPP05 (Pi21). These sHMA proteins did not bind AVR-PikD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>), revealing that AVR-PikD shows specific binding to Clade A sHMA proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). These results were overall confirmed using the AlphaScreen (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogenous Assay Screen) method (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>Ullman et al. 1996; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>Nemoto et al. 2017) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Interestingly, RNA-seq analysis indicated that AVR-PikD-interacting sHMAs were induced by chitin treatment of rice suspension cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), suggesting potential roles in immunity.</p><p id="P10">We also tested the interaction of Clade A sHMA proteins OsHIPP19, OsHIPP20, OsHPP04, OsHPP03 and LOC_Os04g39380 with the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> effectors AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39, which interact with the HMA domain of RGA5 (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>Cesari et al. 2013). We found that AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 did not bind any of the sHMAs tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Also, none of the three AVRs interacted with the Pi21 HMA protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3</xref>). Interactions between AVR-PikD and OsHIPP19 and OsHIPP20 were further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation using proteins expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Naturally occurring AVR-Pik variants are differentially recognized by allelic Pik NLRs.

We took advantage of the multiple interactions we identified in our Y2H screen to further investigate AVR-PikD/sHMA complexes using computational structural biology. We predicted AVR-PikD/sHMA complex models using ColabFold v1.5.2 (AlphaFold2 using MMseqs2) (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>Mirdita et al. 2022), which revealed that three regions A, B, C conserved in Clade A sHMA seem closely (Atomic distance &lt; 5 √Ö) positioned to AVR-PikD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>).

To validate the importance of these interfaces, we selected OsHIPP16, an sHMA in Clade A that does not bind AVR-PikD in Y2H (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) or AlphaScreen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>), for further investigation. Modeling of the interaction predicted that OsHIPP16 does not form a complex with AVR-PikD in the way experimentally determined for OsHIPP19/AVR-PikF or predicted for OsHIPP20/AVR-PikD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C</xref>). We compared the amino acid sequences of OsHIPP16 and OsHIPP20 and found that the former has an insertion of an aspartic acid (D) at position 68, and has a serine (S) at position 80 where a lysine (K) is present in OsHIPP20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Modeling indicated a deletion of D68 (resulting in OsHIPP16-D68DEL) and an amino acid replacement S80K (OsHIPP16-S80K) could render OsHIPP16 capable of binding AVR-PikD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>).

We also tested a second AVR-PikD non-binding sHMA, OsHPP02 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1, S2</xref>) to see whether we could obtain a gain-of-binding mutant for this protein. Modeling of the interaction predicted that OsHPP02 does not form an OsHIPP20/AVR-PikD-like complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C</xref>), but may be converted to AVR-PikD-binding by a single amino acid change at position 79 (within region C) from an aspartic acid (D) to the valine (V) found in OsHIPP20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>). Indeed, OsHPP02-D79V bound to AVR-PikD in both Y2H and AlphaScreen assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>).

Firstly, we co-expressed OsHIPP19 and OsHIPP20 with AVR-PikD in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves by agroinfiltration (see Materials and Methods). Following expression, leaf extract was separated into supernatant and pellet fractions by centrifugation, and each fraction was analyzed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>).

In the supernatant fraction we observed that the OsHIPP19 and OsHIPP20 proteins were degraded to smaller fragments when co-expressed with GUS or AVR-Pii. However, when co-expressed with AVR-PikD, we detected stronger signals of intact OsHIPP19 and OsHIPP20. As an additional control we also tested OsHIPP17, an sHMA that does not bind AVR-PikD in either Y2H or by in planta coimmunoprecipitation, and only weakly interacts with AVR-PikD by the AlphaScreen method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2; S10</xref>). We found that OsHIPP17 was degraded to a smaller fragment even in the presence of AVR-PikD. These results show that the AVR-PikD effector stabilizes sHMA proteins OsHIPP19 and OsHIPP20 in the plant cytosol, and this stabilization is specific to sHMA proteins that interact with the effector. We also noted consistently observed lower accumulation of AVR-PikD in the supernatant when co-expressed with OsHIPP17. This suggests the possibility that AVR-PikD may require interaction with other proteins in the plant cytosol for its own stability.</p><p id="P15">Next, we tested whether binding of AVR-PikD affected the subcellular localization of specific sHMA proteins.

Interestingly, GFP:OsHIPP20 localized to dot-like structures in the cell wall.

However, it remains unclear how these sHMA proteins impact interactions with these diverse pathogens. Nonetheless, given that HMA domains have integrated into NLR immune receptors in at least four botanical families, it is likely that HMA containing proteins have repeatedly been targeted by pathogens across a diversity of flowering plant species and are thus important components in plant-pathogen interactions.</p><p id="P22">In addition to Pik-1, the NLR RGA5 also carries an integrated HMA domain that binds two <italic>M. oryzae</italic> effectors, AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39.

Next, it will be important to determine the roles of the extended family of sHMA proteins in rice and other plants to understand the interplay between effector-mediated protein stabilization and disease.</p><p id="P25">Our conceptual and mechanistic understanding of how plant NLR proteins perceive pathogens continues to expand. A model termed the integrated domain hypothesis postulates that NLRs can bait pathogen effectors directly through integrated decoy/sensor domains (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>Cesari et al. 2014; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>Wu et al. 2015; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>Sarris et al. 2016; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>Kroj et al. 2016). These unconventional NLR domains are thought to have evolved by duplication and integration of an effector host target into the receptor protein. However, there are only very few examples where the evolutionary origin of the NLR integrated domain could be traced to an effector target (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>Le Roux et al. 2015; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>Sarris et al. 2015; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>Grund et al. 2020). Here, we show that AVR-Pik interacts with sHMA proteins that belong to the same phylogenetic clade as the HMA domains integrated into the rice NLRs Pik-1 and RGA5. Therefore, throughout evolution, the Pik-1 NLR immune receptor has co-opted sHMA proteins through the integration of an HMA domain and neofunctionalization of this domain as a bait for the effector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). This has launched a coevolutionary arms race between Pik-1 and AVR-Pik. Given that binding of AVR-Pik to Pik-1 HMA domains is necessary for triggering cell death and disease resistance in rice, new variants of AVR-Pik have arisen in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> populations that evade binding the integrated Pik-1 HMA but maintain their virulence activity (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>Kanzaki et al. 2012; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>Maqbool et al. 2015; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>Bia≈Ças et al. 2018; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>Longya et al. 2019). Here we show that each of the AVR-Pik variants tested retain binding to OsHIPP19 and OsHIPP20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), consistent with the view that stealthy effectors can retain virulence activities. This demonstrates that effector variation can affect the phenotypic outcomes of disease susceptibility and resistance independently through mediating bespoke interactions with different HMA domains. This elegant model highlights a surprisingly intimate relationship between plant disease susceptibility and resistance, as well as microbial virulence, driven by complex coevolutionary dynamics between pathogen and host.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Construction of the maximum likelihood tree of HMA family genes</title><p id="P26">The protein sequences of the HMA domains were aligned by MAFFT (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>Katoh et al. 2013) with the following method parameter set: --maxiterate 1000 --localpair.

Statement</title></caption><p>Rice blast disease, caused by the fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae,</italic> is one of the most devastating diseases of rice. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of blast fungus infection and resistance of rice against the disease is important for global food security. In this study, we show that the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> effector protein AVR-PikD binds rice sHMA proteins and stabilizes them, presumably to enhance pathogen infection. We show that loss-of-function mutants in one rice sHMA, OsHIPP20, reduced the level of susceptibility against a compatible isolate of <italic>M. oryzae,</italic> suggesting that <italic>M. oryzae</italic> requires host sHMA to facilitate invasion. Remarkably, <italic>OsHIPP20</italic> knockout rice line showed no growth defect, suggesting editing sHMA genes may present a novel source of resistance against blast disease.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>AVR-PikD binds Clade A sHMAs.</title><p><bold>A:</bold> Schematic representation of the Pik-1 (Pikp-1, Pik*-1, Pikm-1) and RGA5 Nucleotide-binding Leucine Rich Repeat Receptors (NLRs) and small HMA (sHMA) proteins of rice.
