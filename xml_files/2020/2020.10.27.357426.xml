The development of an effective COVID-19 vaccine could limit the morbidity and mortality caused by infection, and may enable the relaxation of social distancing measures. Age is one of the most significant risk factors for poor health outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, therefore it is desirable that any new vaccine candidates should elicit a robust immune response in older adults. Here, we test the immunogenicity of the adenoviral vectored vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD-1222) in aged mice. We find that a single dose of this vaccine induces cellular and humoral immunity in aged mice, but at a reduced magnitude than in younger adult mice. Furthermore, we report that a second dose enhances the immune response to this vaccine in aged mice, indicating that a prime-boost strategy may be a rational approach to enhance immunogenicity in older persons.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the zoonotic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The pandemic has affected almost every aspect of human life, and will continue to do so until effective vaccines or therapeutics are developed. SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated when the trimeric ‘spike’ glycoprotein on the virion surface binds angiotensinconverting enzyme 2, allowing viral entry and initating viral replication(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). After an asymptomatic incubation period, the infection can cause highly heterogenous clinical outcomes, from negligible or mild symptoms to critical disease resulting in death(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). One of the main risk factors for severe disease and death is age(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Therefore, successful interventions to limit the severe health outcomes of COVID-19 disease should aim to be effective in older adults.</p><p id="P6">Vaccines have been one of the most successful medical interventions to date(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) and represent a potential solution to control the COVID-19 pandemic(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). However, age-related changes in the immune system mean that older individuals often do not generate protective immunity after vaccination(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). As older persons are more at risk of severe health outcomes after infection, significant effort has been made to specifically tailor vaccines to be more effective in people aged 65 years or older. Modifications to vaccines include increasing the antigen dose and the use of adjuvants, which can support then enhancement of immune responses in older people compared to standard formulations of vaccines(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). This indicates that the success of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine may require alterations to the dosing regimen, including an increase in the dose or the number of doses in order to induce a sufficient immune response in older people.</p><p id="P7">The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in older adults will ultimately be determined in clinical trials. However, studies in aged animals can be used to test alternative vaccine strategies or dosing regimens, and can therefore be used to inform clinical strategy. This pre-clinical work may therefore expedite the process of developing an effective vaccine against COVID-19 for older adults. Despite ageing occurring on different time scales in mice and people, many of the cellular and molecular changes that occur with ageing are conserved between the species(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), including those in the immune system such as thymic involution and the loss of naïve T cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). The response to vaccination is no exception(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>); after vaccination, both aged mice (&gt;20 months old) and older humans have reduced vaccine-specific antibody formation, an impaired type I interferon response and fewer T follicular helper cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). This impaired immune response to vaccination in older mice and humans has been linked with reduced protection against subsequent infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Importantly, interventions that enhance immunogenicity of vaccines in aged mice are also effective in humans(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), demonstrating that aged mice are a relevant pre-clinical model for testing the immunogenicity of new vaccine candidates.</p><p id="P8">ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is a chimpanzee adeno (ChAd)-vectored vaccine that encodes the full-length spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 elicits robust cellular and humoral immunity in mice, pigs and macaques(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Importantly, a single vaccination prevents viral pneumonia and reduces the viral load in rhesus macaques after high-dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). The phase I/II ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 trial demonstrated that this vaccine has an acceptable safety profile and is immunogenic in adults between 18 and 55 years of age, stimulating virus-neutralising antibodies and spike-reactive T cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). In macaques, pigs and people, a homologous booster dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 increased anti-spike antibody responses, indicating this is a safe and effective strategy to enhance immunogenicity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Here, we demonstrate that a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 elicits a B and T cell response in 3-month-old adult mice, with formation of plasma cells, germinal centres and T follicular helper cells contributing to anti-spike antibody production. The development of humoral immunity is complemented by the formation of polyfunctional vaccine-specific Th1 cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In aged 22-month-old mice a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induced the formation of Th1 cells, vaccine-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, a germinal centre response and vaccine-specific antibodies. However, the cellular and humoral response was reduced in magnitude in 22-month-old mice compared to 3-month-old adult mice, with antibody isotypes and subclasses produced being of a similar profile. Administration of a second dose enhanced the germinal centre response and antibody titre in aged mice, and also boosted the numbers of granzyme B producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Together, this indicates that the immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 can be enhanced in older individuals through the use of a prime-boost vaccination strategy.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Intramuscular immunisation with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 activates antigen presenting cells in the aortic lymph node and spleen</title><p id="P10">To map where antigen drains upon intramuscular immunisation, we immunised mice with fluorescent nanoparticles that freely drain into lymphoid organs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). The nanoparticles were injected into the right quadriceps muscle of 3-month-old adult mice. Twenty-four hours after injection, confocal microscopy revealed fluorescent nanoparticles in the aortic lymph node (aLN) and the spleen of all immunised mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig. 1a</xref>), while there was negligible detection of fluorescent nanoparticles in the inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes (data not shown). These data suggest the aLN and spleen are the main sites of antigen drainage upon intramuscular immunisation. As such, this study focused on the immune response induced by the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in these two immune compartments.</p><p id="P11">To characterise the early events of the immune response to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination, we immunised adult C57BL/6 mice and assessed the induction of interferon signalling as well as the expansion of antigen presenting cell populations at day 1 and 2 post immunisation. At the site of immunisation, the right quadriceps muscle, expression of the type I interferon inducible gene <italic>Mx1</italic> and the type 2 interferon inducible gene <italic>Gbp2</italic> was detected at day 1 in ChAdOx1 nCoV immunised mice compared to phosphate buffered saline (PBS) immunised controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The expression of both genes was significantly reduced by day 2, indicating that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine induces a short-lived interferon response at the site of injection. In the draining aLN and spleen, the expansion and activation of macrophages, type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2s), Langerhans cells and cDC1s was quantified by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig. 1b</xref>; gating strategy from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>)). In both the aLN and spleen of ChAdOx1 nCoV immunised mice there was a significant increase in the total number of CD11c<sup>+</sup> macrophages at day 2, while the total number of cDC2s, Langerhans and cDC1s remained unperturbed compared to PBS-immunised controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">d</xref>). However, two days after immunisation, there was an increase in the total number of activated CD40<sup>+</sup>CD86<sup>+</sup> cells in all antigen presenting cell populations compared to PBS-immunised controls, in both the aLN and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c, d</xref>). The induction of adaptive immunity through T cell priming relies on the activation of these professional APCs; of which cDC2s have been implicated as the main subset to activate Tfh cells while the cDC1 subset is able to cross-present exogenous antigens to activate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). These data demonstrate that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine activates several antigen presenting cell populations required for the initiation of cell-mediated and humoral immunity.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 immunisation stimulates B cell activation and differentiation</title><p id="P12">To assess the adaptive immune response to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in detail we used a high-dimensional flow cytometry panel that contained antibodies that recognise multiple molecules used to define different lymphocyte subsets and their activation status (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Mice were immunised with either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or PBS, and the immune response was assessed seven, fourteen and twenty-one days later. t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (tSNE) and FlowSOM analysis grouped B cells into five clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). A cluster that corresponded to naïve B cells which were present in both ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and PBS immunised mice, and four additional clusters which were overrepresented in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 immunised mice. These clusters are CD69<sup>+</sup> and CD86<sup>+</sup> activated B cells, CD138<sup>+</sup>IRF4<sup>+</sup> antibody-secreting plasma cells and Bcl6<sup>+</sup>GL-7<sup>+</sup> germinal centre B cells. Manual biaxial gating of these populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig. 2a</xref>) showed that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 immunisation induced a robust B cell response in the draining lymph node and spleen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">c</xref>), with early B cell activation and plasma cell formation occurring in the first week after immunisation, and the germinal centre response persisting over the three weeks assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b – g</xref>). Formation of T follicular helper and T follicular regulatory cells accompanied the germinal centre response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h, i</xref>). Antibodies binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were induced by vaccination, and, as expected, the temporal induction of anti-spike IgM was faster than that of IgG, and serum IgA antibodies were not observed at high titre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j</xref>). A mix of anti-spike IgG antibody subtypes was observed, with IgG2 and IgG1 subclasses persisting at later timepoints. At all timepoints a predominantly Th1 dominant response (IgG2) was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2k</xref>). The mean (and standard deviation) value for ratio of IgG2/IgG1 on day seven was 4.8 (1.4), on day fourteen 2.3 (0.5), and on day twenty-one 2.8 (1.8). This demonstrates that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 immunisation stimulates B cell activation and differentiation, culminating in the production of anti-spike antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 immunisation induces Th1 cell and Th1-like Treg formation</title><p id="P13">To investigate how ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 immunisation affects CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells beyond the germinal centre-associated subsets, tSNE analysis followed by manual gating was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a – c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">c</xref>). tSNE/FlowSOM clustering showed that vaccination induced populations of T cells that express markers associated with T follicular helper cells and Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was characterised by early activation and proliferation, as well as the formation of CXCR3<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a – f</xref>). The Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cell response was characterised by early expression of Ki67, indicative of proliferation, and the differentiation of CXCR3<sup>+</sup> Th1-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c, g</xref>). To further characterise CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses after vaccination, cells from the aLN were restimulated with PdBu/ionomycin and cytokine production was assessed. IL-2, TNFα, IL-10 and IFNγ were induced by cells isolated from animals that had been ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinated, with no difference observed in Th17-associated IL-17 or the Th2-associated cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">b</xref>). Furthermore, restimulation of splenocytes with peptide pools from SARS-CoV-2 identified antigen-specific IL-2, TNFα, and IFNγ producing cells, with triple producers persisting 21-days after immunisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig. 3c</xref>), consistent with previous work(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Therefore, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination induces an early formation of Th1 cells and Th1-like Treg cells accompanied by the induction of virus-specific Th1-skewed cytokine-secreting cells.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induces a CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response</title><p id="P14">tSNE analysis of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from the aLNs of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 immunised and PBS control mice revealed distinct clustering seven days after immunisation. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clusters that were present in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 immunised mice, but not in PBS immunised animals expressed high levels of CD44, Ki67, CXCR3, PD-1, IRF4 or CD69, indicative of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In order to understand how the response evolves over time, manual gating of different CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig. 2d</xref>), including those identified in the tSNE analysis, was done on samples taken seven, fourteen and twenty-one days after immunisation. In the aLN and spleen, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was characterised by an increase in Ki67 expression, the upregulation of the activation markers CD69, CXCR3 and PD-1, as well as the formation of CD44<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>-</sup> T effector memory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b – f</xref>). To characterise the overall production of granzyme B and cytokines by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells seven days after vaccination, cells from the aLN were restimulated with PdBu/ionomycin. There was a significant production of granzyme B, IL-2, TNFα and IFNγ in ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 vaccinated mice compared to PBS immunised mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). Restimulation of splenocytes with spike protein peptide pools from SARS-CoV-2 showed that antigen-specific cytokine producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells form in response to immunisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup.

Granzyme B producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells formed early, and tended not to co-produce cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). Both single and multiple cytokine producing cells formed at all time points, with TNFα and IFNγ being the dominant cytokines expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup.

With this dosing regimen, this data demonstrates that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 stimulates a robust CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response that peaks around the first week after vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>A prime-boost strategy corrects dysregulated CD8 T cell priming in aged mice</title><p id="P15">To assess the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 immunisation in the context of ageing, we immunised 3-month-old and 22-month-old mice and enumerated the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell types altered by vaccination (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) nine days after immunisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). In the draining aLN, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from aged mice expressed markers of activation and proliferation in response to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Unlike in younger adult mice, the frequency of CXCR3<sup>+</sup> cells or T effector memory cells did not increase in aged mice, compared to the PBS vaccinated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b – d</xref>). At this early timepoint, the frequency of central memory T cells was not altered in either younger adult or aged mice by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). In the spleen, fewer Ki67<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were observed in aged mice after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination, compared to younger adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). The formation of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was assessed by restimulating splenocytes with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide pools. Aged mice had a near absence of granzyme B producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, but production of IFNγ and TNFα was not significantly impaired compared to younger mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>). IL-2 production was low in both adult and aged mice at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>), compared to the seven days after immunisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g – h</xref>). Despite a trend to lower cytokine production by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in aged mice, the proportion of polyfunctional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was not significantly diminished in aged mice after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>).

Nine days after boost, an increase in Ki67<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells was not observed in the draining aLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5j</xref>), possibly due to the kinetics of the secondary response being faster than the primary. A significant increase in CXCR3<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and effector memory cells was observed in aged mice after boost, with no change in the proportion of central memory cells in either age group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5k – m</xref>). Assessment of antigen-specific splenocytes showed that the booster dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 rescued the production of granzyme B producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5n</xref>).

Therefore it was important to quantify the B cell response to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination in the context of ageing. Early antibody production after vaccination arises from antibody-secreting cells generated in the extrafollicular plasma cell response, which is fast, but typically short-lived(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). A comparable early plasma cell response was detected in the aLN of younger adult and aged mice after immunisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a, b</xref>), although there was an increase in the proportion of IgM<sup>+</sup> plasma cells in aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>).

Like the plasma cell response, there were more IgM<sup>+</sup> germinal centre B cells in aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7i</xref>). An increase in T follicular helper cells, but not T follicular regulatory cells, accompanied the lymph node germinal centre response in adult and aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7j, k</xref>). In the spleen, germinal centres were easily visualised by microscopy in adult mice nine days after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination, but were conspicuously absent in aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7l</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup.

This was accompanied by fewer proliferating non-germinal centre B cells and T follicular helper cells in aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7p, q</xref>). As in the draining lymph node, splenic T follicular regulatory cells were not induced by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7r</xref>).

Nine days after boost, there were Ki67<sup>+</sup> non-germinal centre B cells, plasma cells and germinal centre B cells in the draining lymph nodes of aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8b – h</xref>). Notably, the magnitude of the germinal centre response was larger in aged mice than in younger adult mice after boost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8f – h</xref>) and this was associated with increased T follicular helper and T follicular regulatory cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8i, j</xref>). A germinal centre response was not observed in the spleen of either adult or aged mice nine days after booster immunisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8k</xref>). This demonstrates that a second dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 can enhance the B cell response in aged mice. This improvement in the B cell response corresponded to an increase in anti-spike IgG, without skewing IgG subclasses, antibodies in every aged mouse that was given a booster immunisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8l – o</xref>). The post boost ratio of IgG2/IgG1 was 3.7 (3.0) in younger adult and 2.6 (1.6) in aged mice (mean and standard deviation). The functional effect of the humoral immunity after both prime and boost immunisations was measured by SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus microneutralisation assay. Nine days after prime immunisation, SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies were at a lower titre in aged mice than measured in adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8p</xref>). Nine days after boost, neutralising antibodies were detectable in all aged mice and had been boosted eight-fold compared to post-prime, although the titre was significantly lower than in younger adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8q</xref>).

Since older adults are more likely to have severe health outcomes after infection, a vaccination strategy that provides protection for this group is particularly desirable. Here, we have used a pre-clinical model to determine the immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in older bodies. Whilst this vaccine stimulates an immune response in aged mice, it is of reduced magnitude compared to that seen in younger adult animals, consistent with previous immunisation studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Importantly, the data presented here show that a second homologous immunisation at the same dose level was able to enhance the B cell, helper T cell and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response in aged mice. In people, the same prime-boost approach had an acceptable safety profile and enhanced humoral immunity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), indicating that this is a rational vaccination approach for use in the older members of our communities – arguably the sector of society most in need of an effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19.</p><p id="P23">After ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 immunisation of aged mice, a significant decrease in the proportion of class-switched germinal centre B cells and plasma cells was observed compared to young adult mice. This was linked with a lower titre of anti-spike antibodies after primary vaccination, with IgG being more affected than IgM by age. Previous studies, in both humans and mice, have demonstrated that ageing causes a B cell-intrinsic impairment in class-switch recombination. This is attributed to a decrease in the expression of the enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase, which initiates class-switch, and its positive regulator, the E2A-encoded E47 transcription factor, in B cells from aged mice and humans(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). The reduced expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase in B cells from older persons has been correlated with lower neutralising antibody production after seasonal influenza vaccination(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Therefore, vaccination strategies that aim to enhance class-switch recombination may improve vaccine efficacy in older people.</p><p id="P24">The age-dependent defects in the B cell response were not limited to class-switch recombination. This highlights that either the formation of antibody secreting cells, or their ability to secrete antibody is impaired by ageing. Antibody-secreting cells can form from two cellular pathways, but these are not equal in terms of quality or longevity. The first pathway, the extrafollicular response, produces an initial burst of antibodies early after antigenic challenge. This response is short-lived with no additional diversification of the B cell repertoire and thus its contribution to long-term immunity is minimal(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). The second pathway, the germinal centre reaction, is a specialised microenvironment that produces memory B cells and long-lived antibody secreting plasma cells with somatically-mutated immunoglobulin genes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). The germinal centre is the only cellular source of long-lived plasma cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>), and the only site where the B cell response can be altered in response to antigen. Nine days after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 immunisation, the formation of plasma cells was comparable in young and aged mice, a time at which the majority of plasma cells derive from the extrafollicular response(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). By contrast, the germinal centre response was diminished in aged mice, which is a well described deficit of the older immune system after vaccination(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). This indicates that poor germinal centre formation is the major barrier that must be overcome to improve humoral immunity in older individuals. In this study we show that a booster dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 enhanced the magnitude of the germinal centre response in aged mice, to a greater extent than it did in younger animals. This may be because younger mice have produced higher titres of anti-vaccine antibodies, which limits the action of a second dose. A similar phenomenon occurs with the seasonal influenza vaccine, in which individuals with high titres of vaccine reactive antibodies typically have a muted response to secondary vaccination(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), and has been observed in an adenovirus type-5(Ad5)-vectored COVID-19 vaccine in people who have high pre-existing antibody titres to the vaccine vector due to natural exposure to Ad5(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Another feature of the aged germinal centre reaction is reduced selection of high affinity B cells, resulting in a diminished quality of the response in ageing(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Whether the further diversification and affinity-based selection of the B cell receptor is important for protective humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be established. However, antibodies isolated from spike-specific B cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients can be both potently neutralising and have low levels of somatic hypermutation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>), indicating that extensive somatic hypermutation is not required for anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody formation. Therefore, the main barrier to inducing protective humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in older people may be an issue of enhancing the magnitude, rather than quality, of the germinal centre response. Our study shows that it is possible to enhance the number of germinal centre B cells in aged mice by giving a second dose of the vaccine.</p><p id="P26">It has been proposed that a failure of the germinal centre reaction in older mice is caused by an increased frequency of suppressive T follicular regulatory cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Here, we did not see an accumulation of T follicular regulatory cells in ageing, and their formation was only robustly observed later in the response. This result is similar to the delayed formation of T follicular regulatory cells after influenza A infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Because the germinal centre response requires the coordinated response of many cell types, identifying the causal defect is challenging. In heterochronic parabiosis experiments, the age of the microenvironment, and not the age of the recirculating lymphocytes, underpins the poor germinal centre response in ageing(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). This implicates non-migratory cells, such as stromal cells or tissue resident cells as causal factors in the diminished germinal centre reaction in ageing.</p><p id="P27">A rapid recall of memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in response to viral infections complements the humoral response by promoting efficient pathogen clearance and this becomes particularly important in scenarios where the protective ability or magnitude of neutralising antibodies is compromised(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). A single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine induces a CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response in both adult and aged mice. In aged mice there was a trend for fewer cytokine producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, but this was not statistically significant in either the discovery or replication cohort. There was, however, a profound defect in the generation of spike-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that produced granzyme B, a key cytotoxic effector molecule produced by effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This failure to generate granzyme B<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is a common feature in ageing, previously observed in aged mice after West Nile Virus infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>) and in aged monkeys infected with SARS-CoV(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). A similar trend for fewer granzyme B<sup>+</sup> CD8 cells in older people was observed after influenza vaccination, although this study was not sufficiently powered for the difference to be statistically significant(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Consistent with reduced expression of granzyme B in T cells from older adults, two weeks after influenza vaccination T cells taken from older adults have an impaired ability to kill influenza infected cells <italic>ex vivo</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). In a small study of older people, poor induction of granzyme B after influenza vaccination was associated with a greater likelihood of subsequent laboratory confirmed influenza infection, indicating that enhancing granzyme B<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may be important for protective immunity against respiratory viruses in older adults(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Here we demonstrate that a second dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was able to correct the defective granzyme B<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response in aged mice, indicating that two doses of this vaccine is a better approach to enhance the cellular immune response in older bodies.</p><p id="P28">ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is currently being trialed in older adults as part of a phase III trial, which will ultimately determine whether it is an effective vaccine for this demographic. Immunisation of people over 55 years of age with Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine resulted in lower antibody titres in the older age group, suggesting that adenoviral vectored vaccine strategies may require more than one dose in older people(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). However, as pre-existing immunity to Ad5, a naturally occurring human tropic adenovirus, can inhibit the response to this vaccine, it is possible that the reduced immunogenicity of this vaccine is due to an increased prevalence of antibodies to the vaccine vector in this age group. By contrast, the presence of anti-ChAdOx1 antibodies in the general population is low(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). The work presented here demonstrates that one dose of this vaccine is immunogenic in aged mice, but this response can be significantly improved with a second booster dose.

The results of the IgG subclass ELISA are presented using OD values instead of the ELISA units used for the total IgG ELISA. The ratio of IgG<sub>2</sub>/IgG<sub>1</sub> was calculated for each animal as sum of OD values (IgG<sub>2b</sub> <sup>+</sup> IgG<sub>2c</sub>) divided by the OD value of IgG<sub>1</sub> and represented as mean values with standard deviation (SD).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Micro neutralisation test using lentiviral-based pseudotypes bearing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike</title><p id="P38">Lentiviral-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viruses were generated in HEK293T cells incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 as previously described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 7.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> in 6 well dishes, before being transfected with plasmids as follows: 500 ng of SARS-CoV-2 spike, 600 ng p8.91 (encoding for HIV-1 gag-pol), 600 ng CSFLW (lentivirus backbone expressing a firefly luciferase reporter gene), in Opti-MEM (Gibco) along with 10 μL PEI (1 μg/mL) transfection reagent. A ‘no glycoprotein’ control was also set up using the pcDNA3.1 vector instead of the SARS-CoV-2 S expressing plasmid. The following day, the transfection mix was replaced with 3 mL DMEM with 10% FBS (DMEM-10%) and incubated for 48 and 72 hours, after which supernatants containing pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 pps) were harvested, pooled and centrifuged at 1,300 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. Target HEK293T cells, previously transfected with 500 ng of a human ACE2 expression plasmid (Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA) were seeded at a density of 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> in 100 μL DMEM-10% in a white flat-bottomed 96-well plate one day prior to harvesting SARS-CoV-2 pps. The following day, SARS-CoV-2 pps were titrated 10-fold on target cells, and the remainder stored at -80 °C. For micro neutralisation tests, mouse sera were diluted 1:20 in serum-free media and 50 μL was added to a 96-well plate in triplicate and titrated 2-fold. A fixed titred volume of SARS-CoV-2 pps was added at a dilution equivalent to 10<sup>5</sup> signal luciferase units in 50 μL DMEM-10% and incubated with sera for 1 hour at 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (giving a final sera dilution of 1:40). Target cells expressing human ACE2 were then added at a density of 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> in 100 μL and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 72 hours. Firefly luciferase activity was then measured with BrightGlo luciferase reagent and a Glomax-Multi<sup>+</sup> Detection System (Promega, Southampton, UK). Pseudovirus neutralization titres were expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution that inhibited luciferase expression by 50% (IC<sub>50</sub>).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Statistics</title><p id="P39">All experiments were performed either twice or three times with 3–8 mice per group. Data was first tested for gaussian distribution using a Shapiro-Wilk test. Then data that was consistent with a normal distribution was analysed with either a student’s t-test for comparing two data set, or one-way ANOVA test for data with multiple groups. If the data did not follow a normal distribution then a Mann-Whitney test was used for comparing two data sets and a Kruskal Wallis test for multiple comparisons. For ELISA data p-values were generated on log transformed data. All p-values shown are adjusted for multiple comparisons where multiple tests were performed on the same data. Analyses were performed within the Prism v8 software (GraphPad).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS102247-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d2aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Dr. Martin Turner, Dr. Geoff Butcher, Marc Wiltshire, Paul Symonds and Prof. Michael Wakelam for their support.
