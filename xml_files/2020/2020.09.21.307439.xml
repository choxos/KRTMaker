<abstract>
<p id="P2">In recognizing the host cellular receptor and mediating fusion of virus and cell membranes, the spike (S) glycoprotein of coronaviruses is the most critical viral protein for cross-species transmission and infection. Here we determined the cryo-EM structures of the spikes from bat (RaTG13) and pangolin (PCoV_GX) coronaviruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2. All three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of these two spike trimers are in the “down” conformation, indicating they are more prone to adopt this receptor-binding inactive state. However, we found that the PCoV_GX, but not the RaTG13, spike is comparable to the SARS-CoV-2 spike in binding the human ACE2 receptor and supporting pseudovirus cell entry. Through structure and sequence comparisons, we identified critical residues in the RBD that underlie the different activities of the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX/SARS-CoV-2 spikes and propose that N-linked glycans serve as conformational control elements of the RBD. These results collectively indicate that strong RBD-ACE2 binding and efficient RBD conformational sampling are required for the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to gain highly efficient infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">Zoonotic transmission of novel coronaviruses pose a tremendous threat to human health, as evidenced by the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002-2003, MERS-CoV in 2012 and SARS-CoV-2 since the end of 2019<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/">https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/</ext-link>). Current data suggest that similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>, SARS-CoV-2 likely originated in bats and eventually spread to humans following evolution in intermediate hosts. Coronavirus RaTG13, detected in the horseshoe bat <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic> in China's Yunnan province, was identified as the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. It shares 96.2% sequence identity with the SARS-CoV-2 genome, reflecting the likely origin of SARS-CoV-2 in bats<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. Pangolin coronaviruses (PCoV) closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have also been identified in smuggled Malayan pangolins (<italic>Manis javanica</italic>) in China's Guangxi (GX) and Guangdong (GD) provinces. Analyses of PCoV_GX and PCoV_GD genome sequences indicated a high level of similarity with SARS-CoV-2 (85.5% to 92.4% sequence identity)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. Whether pangolins are intermediate hosts or a natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 remains a topic of debate, and it is still unclear how SARS-COV-2 evolved to infect humans.</p>
<p id="P4">The spike (S) glycoprotein of coronaviruses forms a trimer, which plays a critical role in host cell attachment and entry by recognizing its cellular receptor and mediating membrane fusion. Consequently, the spike protein, particularly its receptor-binding domain (RBD), is the principal player in determining the host range of coronaviruses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes human ACE2 (hACE2) as an essential cellular receptor for infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. Complex structural determinations have revealed the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2 at an atomic level<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. Cryo-EM studies revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer, similar to that of SARS-CoV, needs to have at least one RBD in an “up” conformation to bind hACE2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, a spike trimer with all three RBDs “down” is in a receptor-binding inactive state, and the conformational change of at least one RBD from “down” to “up” switches the spike trimer to a receptor-binding active state<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. The spike and RBD of RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 share 97.5% and 89.2% amino acid sequence identity, respectively. Similar to RaTG13, PCoV_GX (GenBank: QIA48614.1) shares 92.3% and 86.7% amino acid sequence identity with the SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD. In contrast, PCoV_GD (GenBank: QLR06867.1) and SARS-CoV-2 have greater amino acid sequence identity in the RBD (96.9%) than in the spike protein (89.6%). Consistently, the RBD of PCoV_GD has demonstrated stronger binding to hACE2 than the RBD of RaTG13, and hACE2 also supported more efficient cell entry of PCoV_GD than RaTG13 pseudoviruses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. Data have not been reported regarding the binding of PCoV_GX spike and its RBD to hACE2 or whether hACE2 supports PCoV_GX pseudovirus cell entry.</p>
<p id="P5">Here we report the cryo-EM structures of RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes at 2.48 Å and 2.93 Å resolution, respectively. These two spikes have all three RBDs in the “down” conformation. Our structural comparisons of RaTG13, PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, coupled with functional data on hACE2 binding and pseudovirus cell entry, provide important insights into the evolution and cross-transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<p id="P6">The cDNAs encoding the PCoV_GX (GenBank: QIA48614.1) and RaTG13 (GenBank: QHR63300.2) spike proteins were synthesized with codon optimization for recombinant expression. The PCoV_GX ectodomain (residues 1-1205) was cloned into the pCAG vector and the RaTG13 ectodomain (residues 1-1209) into the pFastBac-Dual vector. Both constructs include a C-terminal foldon tag for trimerization, a Strep tag for purification, and the ‘2P’ mutations for protein stabilization (K980P and V981P for PCoV_GX; K982P and V983P for RaTG13). After purification of PCoV_GX spike from FreeStyle 293-F cells and that of RaTG13 from Hi5 insect cells, both proteins existed as heavy glycosylated homotrimers with no cleavage into the S1 and S2 subunits by endogenous proteases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Cryo-EM images were recorded using a FEI Titan Krios microscope operating at 300 KV with a Gatan K3 Summit direct electron detector. For the PCoV_GX and RaTG13 spike trimers, ∼700,000 and ∼450,000 particles, respectively, were subjected to 2D classification, and a total of 263,842 and 99,241 particles were selected and subjected to 3D refinement with C3 symmetry to generate density maps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). The overall density maps were solved to 2.48 Å for the PCoV_GX spike and 2.93 Å for the RaTG13 spike (gold-standard Fourier shell correlation = 0.143) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). The atomic-resolution density maps enabled us to build nearly all residues of the PCoV_GX spike (residues 14-1138) with 84 N-linked glycans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). The refined RaTG13 spike model contains residues 14-1133 with seven breaks (residues 19-23, 67-80, 144-156, 176-186, 243-264, 677-685 and 824-830) and 54 N-linked glycans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Data collection and refinement statistics for these two structures are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>.</p>

<title>Overall structures of RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes</title>
<p id="P7">The overall structures of homotrimeric RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes resemble the previously reported pre-fusion structures of coronavirus spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Both spikes have a mushroom-like shape (∼150 Å in height and ∼120 Å in width), consisting of a cap mainly formed by β-strands and a stalk mainly formed by α-helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Like other coronaviruses, the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spike monomers are composed of the S1 and S2 subunits with a protease cleavage site between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B,1C</xref>). The structural components of the spike include the N-terminal domain (NTD), RBD (also called the C-terminal domain, CTD), subdomain 1 (SD1) and subdomain 2 (SD2) in the S1 subunit; and the upstream helix (UH), fusion peptide (FP), connecting region (CR), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), central helix (CH), β-hairpin (BH), subdomain 3 (SD3) and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) in the S2 subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes have the typical β-coronavirus structural features<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. Their NTDs have a core consisting of three β-sheets plus one helix and a ceiling structure above the core (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). Three conserved disulfide bonds that are found in other β-coronavirus NTDs are also present in the NTDs of RaTG13 (15C-136C, 131C-166C and 291C-301C) and PCoV_GX (15C-134C, 129C-164C and 289C-299C) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). The RaTG13 and PCoV_GX RBDs adopt an architecture similar to that of other β-coronavirus RBDs, with a β sheet core and an inserted loop called a receptor-binding motif (RBM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Detailed structural descriptions and comparisons of these two RBDs are presented in the next section. The remaining SD1 and SD2 domains in the S1 subunit and the S2 subunits of RaTG13 and PCoV_GX are also structurally conserved and similar to those of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<title>Structures and hACE2 binding of the RBDs</title>
<p id="P9">Most β-coronaviruses utilize the RBD to specifically bind the host receptor. Compared to other structural components in the spike, the RBD harbors the most sequence and structure variations across different β-coronaviruses and thus has important implications for viral evolution and cross-species transmission. The RaTG13 and PCoV_GX RBD cores are comprised of a twisted five-stranded antiparallel β sheet (β1, β2, β3, β4 and β7) with connecting loops and helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The RBM, a long loop with two short β strands (β5 and β6), is inserted between the β4 and β7 strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Besides three disulfide bonds in the core (336C-361C, 379C-432C and 391C-525C in RaTG13; 334C-359C, 377C-430C and 389C-523C in PCoV_GX) that stabilize the β sheet, the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX RBDs also have an additional disulfide bond (480C-488C in RaTG13 and 478C-486C in PCoV_GX) that connects the loop at the distal end of the RBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The overall structures of the RaTG13/PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs are highly similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The rmsd for aligned Cα atoms is 0.91 Å between the RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and 0.59 Å between the PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs.</p>
<p id="P10">We measured the binding affinities of hACE2 with the RBDs of RaTG13, PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs bound to hACE2 with comparable affinities of 2.7 nM and 3.9 nM, respectively. However, the RaTG13 RBD bound to hACE2 with a much weaker affinity of 216 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Sequence comparisons showed that both the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX RBMs share 75.3% amino acid sequence identity with the RBM of SARS-CoV-2. Of the 16 residues in the SARS-CoV-2 RBM involved with ACE2 binding, ten are conserved in RaTG13, PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The other six SARS-CoV-2 residues that are not conserved in both RatG13 and PCoV_GX are Y449, F486, Q493, Q498, N501 and Y505 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Except for F486, which is replaced by a leucine in RaTG13 and PCoV_GX, these residues (Y449, Q493, Q498, N501 and Y505) in the SARS-CoV-2 RBM form a patch that has significant hydrophilic interactions with hACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). Of these five positions, SARS-CoV-2 Y449 forms two hydrogen bonds with hACE2 D38 and Q42 upon binding. This tyrosine is conserved in the PCoV_GX RBD but is replaced by a phenylalanine in the RaTG13 RBD, which would disrupt the hydrogen-bonding interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 Y505 forms two hydrogen bonds with hACE2 E37 and R393. This residue is conserved in PCoV_GX RBD, perhaps having a similar effect in facilitating hACE2 binding, whereas the histidine found at this site in the RaTG13 RBD would alter interactions with hACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). We therefore propose that Y449 and Y505 are two of the principal sites that contribute to the weaker binding of the RaTG13 RBD with hACE2 compared to that of the RBDs of PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>Conformations and hACE2 binding of the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes</title>
<p id="P11">As described above, at least one of the RBDs in the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer must adopt an “up” conformation in order to bind hACE2. By cryo-EM, we only captured conformational states of RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes with all three RBDs in the “down” position. Structures of SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer with all three RBDs in the “down” conformation were previously determined (PDB IDs: 6VXX and 6ZGE)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. In 6VXX, one of the SARS-CoV-2 RBDs exhibits contacts with 11 residues and the N165/N234-linked glycans from the counter-clockwise monomer and 5 residues from the clockwise monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). In 6ZGE, the three “down” RBDs are more compactly packed, with one RBD having interactions with 35 residues and the N165/N234-linked glycans of the two neighboring monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). In the RaTG13 spike, one RBD contacts 27 residues and the N165/N234/N370-linked glycans from the counter-clockwise monomer, and 13 residues from the clockwise monomer with a distance cutoff of 4.0 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). A nearly identical packing of RBDs was also observed in a recently reported RaTG13 spike structure (PDB ID:6ZGF)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. In the PCoV_GX spike, the number of RBD-contacting residues is 27 from the counter-clockwise monomer and 16 from the clockwise monomer. The N163/N232/N368-linked glycans from the counter-clockwise monomer are also involved in contact with the RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Therefore, regarding RBD packing, the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes are more similar to the SARS-CoV-2 spike structure 6ZGE than 6VXX.</p>
<p id="P12">Unlike in our study, the cryo-EM studies which determined the structures of 6ZGE and 6VXX did capture the SARS-CoV-2 spikes adopting a more loose state with one “up” RBD. Our observations of all three RBDs only in the “down” position in the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes suggests they are more prone to adopt the receptor-binding inactive state. Considering that the number of protein-protein interactions around the “down” RBD is nearly the same among the RaTG13, PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 (6ZGE) spikes, glycans may play an important role in how efficiently the RBD can sample different conformations. Of note, we observed contacts between the RBD and three neighboring N-linked glycans, spatially positioned at three vertices of a triangle, in the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Although the SARS-CoV-2 spike also has three asparagine residues (N165, N234 and N370) at these same positons, N370 is not a glycosylation site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike and thus glycans contacting the RBD are not observed at this positon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">To further our findings, we also measured the binding affinities of hACE2 with the spikes of RaTG13, PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we found that despite exhibiting only a receptor-binding inactive conformation in the cryo-EM images, the PCoV_GX spike bound hACE2 with an affinity of 130 nM, comparable to the 105 nM affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The binding of RaTG13 spike to hACE2 was weaker, with an affinity of 600 nM. We tested the entry of RaTG13, PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses into HEK293 cells expressing hACE2. Consistently, the PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses had comparable entry efficiency, whereas the RaTG13 pseudovirus exhibited little to no entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">To capture the hACE2-bound state of the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes, we mixed spike and ACE2 at a 1:4 molar ratio and performed negative-staining EM. The 2D classification did not show particles with bound hACE2 for the RaTG13 spike, but ∼9% of the PCoV_GX particles were bound to hACE2. After treating the PCoV_GX spike with trypsin for 2 hours, the ratio of hACE2-bound particles increased to 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). These results further support that the conformational switch of the spike is a dynamic equilibrium process and that binding of hACE2 would capture the spike with “up” RBDs and shift the process towards more spikes ready for receptor binding and membrane fusion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P15">Coronavirus spike glycoproteins recognize their host cellular receptor and mediate membrane fusion for entry, thereby functioning as the most critical coronavirus protein in determining viral evolution and cross-species transmission. In this study, cryo-EM structures of RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes were determined at atomic resolution. Our comparisons of the structures of the RaTG13, PCoV_GX and SARS-COV-2 spikes, the strength of their hACE2-binding, and their efficiency in facilitating pseudovirus cell entry provide important insights into the evolution and cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="P16">Our structural determinations of the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes showed that the RBDs of these two coronaviruses are highly similar to that of SARS-CoV-2. However, our SPR experiments showed that only PCoV_GX RBD exhibited a hACE2-binding affinity comparable to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, whereas RaTG13 RBD demonstrated far weaker binding. Sequence alignments showed that variation at six residues (SARS-CoV-2 Y449, F486, Q493, Q498, N501 and Y505) were responsible for the these differences in hACE2-binding among the RaTG13, PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV2 RBDs. The residues Y449, Q493, Q498, N501 and Y505 are especially important, clustering together to form a patch on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that has significant interactions with hACE2. We further pinpointed amino acid changes at two positions (Y449 and Y505) only seen in the RaTG13, and not the PCoV_GX, RBD that may account for the weaker binding we observed between hACE2 and the RaTG13 RBD. Our findings and conclusions are supported by recent reports of adapted and remodeled SARS-CoV-2 strains utilized in mouse model studies. Gu et al. reported an adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain with increased infectivity in mice that has a N501Y mutation in the RBD<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. Dinnon et al. remodeled the SARS-COV-2 RBD at two sites (Q498Y and P499T) to facilitate efficient binding to mouse ACE2, producing a recombinant virus that can effectively utilize mouse ACE2 for entry<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. These positions are within the patch we observed and suggest their importance in the binding capabilities of the RaTG13, PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to human ACE2. We further propose that the patch containing Y449, Q493, Q498, N501 and Y505 plays a critical role in the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, promoting especially tight binding to hACE2 and impacting the varying affinities observed between the RBD and ACE2 orthologs in wild and domestic animals<sup>

<p id="P17">The spikes of diverse coronaviruses infecting humans, mice, swine and other hosts have been structurally determined<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. Current data show that the spikes of only the highly pathogenic human coronavirus SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a unique structural feature, with the three RBDs in the trimer adopting “down” or “up” conformations<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. Structure determination of the spike-receptor complex has provided further confirmation that the “up” conformation is required for receptor binding, indicating that the sampling of “down” and “up” conformations by at least one RBD is a prerequisite for receptor binding<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup> in addition to specific interactions between the RBD and cellular receptor. In our cryo-EM study, the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes exhibited only a receptor-binding inactive state, with all three RBDs adopting the “down” conformation. Another group had the same conclusion in a recent structural determination of the RaTG13 spike<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. However, in studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, the protein seemed to have two conformations, even in the receptor-binding inactive state, with one having more compact packing of the three “down” RBDs than the other<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. We found that the spikes of RaTG13 and PCoV_GX are more similar to the SARS-CoV-2 spike with tight RBD packing. The molecular basis of the more efficient conformational sampling of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is still not well understood. We observed three N-linked glycans (SARS-CoV-2 positions: N165, N234 and N370) contact the RBD in the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes, whereas N370 is not a glycosylation site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike. The absence of glycans linked to N370 may contribute to the more flexible RBDs of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. This is also supported by a recent study showing that mutation of SARS-CoV-2 N165 resulted in an increase of “up” RBDs, suggesting that glycans serve as a conformational control element of the RBD<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. We also cannot exclude other factors, such as the furin site that enables cleavage of the spike protein into the S1 and S2 subunits during biogenesis, may also contribute to the RBD flexibility.</p>
<p id="P18">The RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes and their RBDs all bound hACE2 in our SPR experiments, although both the RBD and spike of PCoV_GX exhibited higher binding affinities than those of RaTG13. These results suggest that RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spikes can also spontaneously sample “up” RBD, which is essential for hACE2 binding. The reason for not observing these conformations in our cryo-EM study may be due to the ratio of RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spike particles adopting this state being too low. Interestingly, the PCoV_GX spike bound to hACE2 with an affinity comparable to that of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and also had similar efficiency in cell entry. In contrast, the RaTG13 spike was much weaker in binding hACE2 and mediating cell entry. We also confirmed the binding of PCoV_GX spike to hACE2 by negative-staining EM.</p>
<p id="P19">Based on all these results, we propose that the tight RBD-hACE2 binding we observed is the most critical factor in determining the varied cell-entry efficiency among RaTG13, PCoV_GX and SARS-COV-2. This and the RBD “down” to “up” conformational change are both required for the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to gain highly efficient transmission capability.</p>

Three monomers of the RaTG13 spike are colored magenta, red, and blue, respectively; three monomers of the PCoV_GX spike are colored hot pink, green and cyan, respectively. The cryo-EM maps are shown as a semitransparent surface. The trigonal axes are shown as black dashed lines. Visible segments of each monomer are labeled accordingly. The cap and stalk parts are partitioned by gray dashed lines. <bold>(B)</bold> Schematic representation of the RaTG13 spike monomer structural domains. The domains of RaTG13 are shown as boxes with the width related to the length of the amino acid sequence. The start and end amino acids of each segment are labeled. The position of the S1/S2 and S2’ cleavage sites are indicated by scissors. NTD, N-terminal domain; CTD, C-terminal domain; SD1, subdomain 1; SD2, subdomain 2; UH, upstream helix; FP, fusion peptide; CR, connecting region; HR1, heptad repeat 1; CH, central helix; BH, β-hairpin; SD3, subdomain 3. <bold>(C)</bold> Schematic representation of the PCoV_GX spike monomer structural domains. The abbreviations of elements are the same as in <bold>B. (D)</bold> Cartoon diagrams depicting three orientations of the spike monomer colored as in <bold>B</bold> and <bold>C</bold>. As the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX spike monomers have extremely similar structures, thus only the RaTG13 spike monomer was used to show the detailed architecture.</p>

The RaTG13 RBD is colored in magenta, PCoV_GX RBD in green, SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6VXX) RBD in wheat, and SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6ZGE) RBD in marine; remaining regions shown in gray. <bold>(B)</bold> Detailed structures of the RBD-glycans interface are shown. The RaTG13, PCoV_GX and SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6ZGE/6VXX) RBDs are colored the same as in <bold>A</bold>. Glycans are shown as red sticks and Asn-linked glycans are labeled. Sequence alignment of the SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 and PCoV_GX RBD-interacting glycosylation sites is shown in the bottom panel. Some sequences between the three sites are omitted and indicated by black dots. Amino acid positions of asparagines are indicated above the sequences according to SARS-CoV-2. Asparagines (N) are colored red and threonines (T) are colored blue.</p>
