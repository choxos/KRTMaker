<abstract>
<p id="P1">The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) enters its host cells after binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) <italic>via</italic> its spike glycoprotein. This interaction is critical for virus entry and virus-host membrane fusion. Soluble ACE2 ectodomains bind and neutralize the virus but the short <italic>in vivo</italic> half-lives of soluble ACE2 limits its therapeutic use. Fusion of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) part of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the ACE2 ectodomain can prolong the <italic>in vivo</italic> half-life but bears the risk of unwanted Fc-receptor activation and antibody-dependent disease enhancement. Here, we describe optimized ACE2-Fc fusion constructs that avoid Fc-receptor binding by using IgG4-Fc as a fusion partner. The engineered ACE2-IgG4-Fc fusion proteins described herein exhibit promising pharmaceutical properties and a broad antiviral activity at single-digit nanomolar concentration. In addition, they allow to maintain the beneficial enzymatic activity of ACE2 and thus are very promising candidate antivirals broadly acting against coronaviruses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Of the seven known human pathogenic coronavirus (hCoV) strains, three (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, hCoV-NL63) use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for entry into the human host cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Neuropilin-1 has recently been identified as another protein supporting SARS-CoV-2 infection potentially handing the virus over to ACE2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. ACE2 is located in the plasma membrane of respiratory epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. In addition to the respiratory tract, high expression of ACE2 is also found in several other tissues, including intestine, testes, liver, kidney, brain, and the cardiovascular system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p>
<p id="P3">ACE2 is a 805 amino acid type-I transmembrane protein consisting of an extracellular, a transmembrane and a cytosolic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. The extracellular domain is a zinc metalloprotease, which enzymatically functions as a carboxypeptidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] suppressing the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by cleaving angiotensin I to the inactive angiotensin 1-9 and even more efficiently cleaving angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Angiotensin 1-7 and its downstream peptides exert a broad spectrum of cell and tissue protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], it lowers diastolic blood pressure, has anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative and anti-fibrotic effects and thereby protects the lung, heart, kidney and other organs from injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. The potential contribution of angiotensin II to the COVID-19 pathophysiology has been indicated by reports that angiotensin II levels in plasma samples from COVID-19 patients were markedly elevated and correlated with viral load and severity of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p>
<p id="P4">ACE2-Fc fusion proteins composed of the human immunoglobulin G (IgG) fragment crystallizable (Fc) part fused to the extracellular domain of ACE2 have been suggested as a high-priority treatment option for COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. In addition to neutralizing SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the ACE2 enzymatic activity affecting the renin-angiotensin system provides a second mode of action, potentially alleviating the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therapeutic use of a soluble human recombinant ACE2 dimer (APN01) with a half-life of 10 hours is currently investigated in patients with COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Strong <italic>in vitro</italic> SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity has been described for several sequence variants of ACE2-IgG1-Fc fusion proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. A version of an ACE2-IgG1-Fc (HLX71) is in a Phase I clinical study with healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p>
<p id="P5">A concern arising from the experience with vaccines and neutralizing antibodies is disease enhancement by Fc effector functions such as complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Moreover, Fc receptor gamma III (CD16) binding, which for example has been shown for neutralizing antibodies in Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), has led to infection of CD16 positive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. It is well known that IgG1-Fc strongly binds to CD16 and has pronounced CDC and ADCC activity, whereas in contrast for IgG4-Fc such Fc-related effector functions are minimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. For this reason, the IgG4-Fc fragment would be a preferred fusion partner for ACE2. However, it is well known that naturally occurring IgG4 antibodies are less stable than IgG1 variants due to the formation of half antibodies, which limits their use in pharmaceutical preparations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>].</p>
<p id="P6">Therefore, we have chosen the immunoglobulin Fc region of an IgG4/kappa isotype with an S228P sequence alteration in the hinge region to generate a stable ACE2-IgG4-Fc fusion protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. For the ACE2 domain two different truncations, Q18-G732 and Q18-S740, respectively, were used for the fusion. In addition, in alternative constructs, point mutations were introduced in the ACE2 domain to abrogate its enzymatic activity.</p>
<p id="P7">Here we report the biophysical and functional characteristic of these ACE2-IgG4-Fc fusion proteins and demonstrate that they efficiently target and entirely neutralize different strains of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Europe in January and April 2020 as well as the 2003 SARS-CoV with strain-specific high affinities.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Expression and purification of ACE2-Fc proteins</title>
<p id="P8">ACE2-IgG4-Fc and ACE2-IgG1-Fc fusion proteins were designed based on crystal and EM structures of the ACE2 extracellular domain, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and its receptor binding domain (RBD), as well as the IgG4-Fc and IgG1-Fc domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">b</xref>). Details of the ACE2 sequences fused to the Fc fragments of IgG4 and IgG1 are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p id="P9">The expression yields of all fusion proteins were in a similar range, although slightly higher for Q18-G732 ACE2-Fc fusion proteins. Purity of the ACE2-Fc fusion proteins under investigation ranged between 95% and 98%, as evident from capillary electrophoresis sodium dodecyl sulfate (CE-SDS) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis. High molecular weight fractions (HMWS) measured after purification were slightly lower for Q18-G732 ACE2-Fc fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Peptide mapping confirmed the presence of the modifications in the ACE2-Fc fusion proteins.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Variations in the ACE2-Fc sequences have a minor effect on the basic structural properties</title>
<p id="P10">To assign secondary structure to the ACE2-Fc fusion construct, protein circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was performed. The Far-UV (190-250 nm) CD spectra of the fusion proteins could be superimposed indicating that the secondary structures are preserved among all constructs, regardless of the sequence variations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref> left). The same held true for the Near-UV (250-300 nm) CD spectra, which indicated that the overall tertiary structure is also highly similar in all ACE2-Fc proteins investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref> right).</p>
<p id="P11">Size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) was used to investigate the oligomeric state of the fusion proteins. All ACE2-Fc fusion molecules tested exhibit similar elution times and molecular masses of 230 to 235 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). These values agreed well with the theoretical mass of a homodimer, which is 216-218 kDa based on calculations from the primary sequence. The slightly higher molecular mass measured in solution was due to the glycosylation of the proteins.</p>
<p id="P12">Reducing and non-reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>) revealed that all ACE2-Fc fusion proteins separated under reducing conditions with dithiothreitol (DTT) run at about 110-120 kDa, which correlated to the theoretical mass of a monomeric ACE2-Fc molecule. The non-reduced ACE2-Fc fusion proteins exhibited a much higher apparent molecular weight, indicating that the intermolecular disulfide bonds in the ACE2-Fc homodimers are formed, which agrees with results from CE-SDS under reducing and non-reducing conditions.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>H374N and H378N mutations abolish enzymatic activity of ACE2-Fc constructs</title>
<p id="P13">The <italic>in vitro</italic> assay for the catalytic activity of ACE2 is based on the cleavage of a synthetic peptidyl-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA) and the release of the free MCA fluorophore that has an increased fluorescence intensity at 420 nm (excitation at 320 nm) compared to the peptidyl-MCA. The amount of released MCA was calculated from the slope of the increase in fluorescence intensity and a standard curve with known MCA concentrations. All constructs with wildtype (WT) ACE2 cleave the same amount of MCA during 30 min of incubation, while the constructs with mutations in the active ACE2 site lost the enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Interaction of the ACE2-Fc constructs with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2</title>
<p id="P14">Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) allowed to determine the binding affinity of our ACE2-Fc constructs to the RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that was recombinantly expressed and immobilized. The ACE2-Fc fusion proteins bound in a concentration-dependent manner to the viral protein domain, while an unrelated Fc fusion protein (aflibercept) used as a control showed no interaction with the ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). The binding constants revealed that all constructs analyzed bind to the immobilized SARS-CoV-2 RBD with a K<sub>D</sub> of around 4 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). This indicated that the structural variations do not influence the interaction between the ACE2-Fc fusion proteins and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="P15">Neutralizing activities of the ACE2-Fc fusion proteins against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were tested in a competition enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). All ACE2-Fc constructs tested bound and potently neutralized the binding of spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). Consistent with their affinities to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, there were no significant differences between the different fusion proteins. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) for SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein neutralization ranged from 2.5 to 3.5 nM.</p>

<sec id="S7">
<title>Neutralization assay with ACE2-IgG4-Fc using SARS-CoV-2-GFP</title>
<p id="P16">We next wanted to test if the competition of our ACE2-Fc fusion constructs with binding of the SARS-CoV-2 <italic>via</italic> S1 to its receptor ACE2 would translate into neutralization of infectious virus. Because of the expected favorable <italic>in vivo</italic> features, we chose two IgG4-based ACE2-Fc fusion proteins, construct 1 and construct 3, for virus neutralization tested <italic>via</italic> live cell imaging using the IncuCyte platform in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. When Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2-GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] pre-incubated with serial dilutions of the two ACE2-IgG4-Fc fusion proteins (ACE2 Q18-G732 wildtype and ACE2 Q18-G732 H374N/H378N fused to IgG4-Fc S228P) the virus was neutralized in a concentration-dependent manner and no green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression was detected in contrast to cell layers showing increasing GFP expression when infected with non-treated virus. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movies</xref>). This demonstrates that construct 1 and construct 3 completely reduce SARS-CoV-2-GFP infection of Vero E6 cells <italic>in vitro.</italic>

<sec id="S8">
<title>Neutralization of a variety of SARS-CoV strains</title>
<p id="P17">To determine whether the ACE2-Fc constructs would be able to neutralize a broader range of SARS-coronavirus strains, we compared the neutralization capacity of each of the eight ACE2-Fc fusion constructs against a range of virus isolates. Hereby, we included the original SARS-CoV isolate from 2003 as well as two different SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in January and April 2020. All ACE2-IgG-Fc fusion proteins developed against the novel SARS-CoV-2 also neutralized the first human pathogenic SARS-CoV circulating in 2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>] with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values in the range of 150 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a</xref>)</p>
<p id="P18">We then tested for the ability of the ACE2-Fc constructs to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, in particular SARS-CoV-2-Jan isolated from a Bavarian COVID-19 patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] from the earliest documented COVID-19 outbreak in Germany end of January 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], which was directly connected to the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China. All ACE2-Fc fusion proteins displayed strong neutralizing potential against SARS-CoV-2-Jan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref>) with IC50 values in the range of 10 nM.</p>
<p id="P19">The ACE2-Fc fusion protein variants were also compared for their ability to neutralize a second SARS-CoV-2 isolate, SARS-CoV-2-April, which was isolated when the virus was massively spreading in Europe. SARS-CoV-2-April displayed a different plaque-forming phenotype than SARS-CoV-2-Jan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). All ACE2-Fc constructs displayed significantly increased neutralizing potential against SARS-CoV-2-April (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c</xref>) with IC50 values below 1 nM.</p>

<sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P20">In this study, we design, express and evaluate different ACE2-Fc fusion proteins with favorable biochemical features and show that they elicit a broad antiviral activity against different human pathogenic coronaviruses including the 2003 SARS-CoV, as well as different strains of the 2020 SARS-CoV-2. All ACE2-IgG4-Fc and ACE2-IgG1-Fc fusion proteins selected inhibited infection of Vero E6 cells by the SARS-CoV-2 wildtype virus isolate SARS-CoV-2-Jan, which was obtained from the earliest documented COVID-19 cases in Germany from January 2020 and thus is closely related to the original Wuhan strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], with IC50 values of around 10 nM. Infection by the predominant SARS-CoV-2-April variant circulating worldwide was inhibited even more efficiently with IC50 values below 1 nM. All ACE2-Fc molecules also inhibited infection with the original SARS-CoV with IC50 values in the range of 150 nM. These results demonstrate that the ACE2-Fc constructs can be used for neutralization of various coronavirus strains.</p>
<p id="P21">Various sequence variants of ACE2-IgG1-Fc fusion proteins have been described in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. In this study, novel ACE2-Fc fusion proteins in which the ACE2 domain is fused to the Fc fragment of human IgG 4 (ACE2-IgG4-Fc) containing a stabilizing S228P mutation in the hinge region were designed. We used the full length ACE2 ectodomain sequence Q18-S740 and a shortened version comprising Q18-G732. In addition, an ACE2 variant was used comprising two point mutations which abolish its enzymatic activity.</p>
<p id="P22">It was thought that ACE2-Fc fusion proteins are homodimers stabilized by disulfide bonds in the hinge region, similar to IgGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. The ACE2 domain and the Fc part likely fold independently, however the Fc domain might have an impact on the overall stability of the molecule and the interaction with the virus spike protein. We therefore wondered whether the Fc fragment isotype impacts expression, purity, and activity of the ACE2 fusion protein. A comparison of the ACE2-IgG4-Fc and ACE2-IgG1-Fc constructs showed that they express equally well in mammalian cells, suggesting a similar <italic>in vivo</italic> folding and assembly efficiency, although yield and purity was slightly higher for the shortened Q18-G732 ACE2 sequence. Also, the enzymatic activity of the ACE2 domain is not affected by the Fc fusion in the wildtype constructs. As expected, the enzymatic activity was completely abolished in the ACE2 double assay point mutants. Thus, the basic properties of ACE2 do not seem to be affected in the two different fusion formats. In addition, the binding to the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein as determined by SPR is similar with a K<sub>D</sub> of 4 nM. Very similar values were also observed in an ELISA-based SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein neutralization assay for all ACE2-IgG4-Fc and ACE2-IgG1-Fc constructs.</p>
<p id="P23">Investigations on the genome sequences of multiple SARS-CoV-2 isolates reported from various countries identified genomic regions with increasing genetic variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Globally, one of these variations, the D614G substitution in the C-terminal region of the spike protein, is now the most prevalent pandemic form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Mutation D614G is associated with an improved ability to bind to ACE2 protein and infection. In addition, the D614G substitution makes the spike protein more sensitive for some neutralizing antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. Our results indicate that both, the ACE2-IgG4-Fc fusion proteins and the ACE2-IGg1-Fc fusion proteins, even more potently neutralize the worldwide predominant SARS-CoV-2-April variant than SARS-CoV-2-Jan which is closely related to the non-mutated, original SARS-CoV-2 strain from Wuhan. These findings are consistent with previous work that has shown that the D614G mutation increases the susceptibility of the virus towards neutralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. In line with our results, the affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for human ACE2 has been previously reported to be significantly higher than the affinity of the SARS-CoV spike protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. This may explain the high replication rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract and thus the high rate of infection.</p>
<p id="P24">Here we describe a decrease of the IC50 in the neutralization assays from 10 nM to 1 nM with SARS-CoV-2 isolates obtained from patients in Germany in January 2020 and April 2020 which indicates a further affinity maturation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein towards human ACE2 during the course of the pandemic.</p>
<p id="P25">It remains a concern that SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus variants have found reservoirs in animals living in close contact with humans and could transmit to humans from time to time, as happened recently with “cluster 5”, a SARS-CoV-2 variation with a combination of mutations that is not fully understood for its impact on disease severity and resistance to vaccination and therapeutic antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. In contrast to vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, which have been associated with a risk of virus escape by mutation as e.g. the occurrence of the spike variant N439K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>], administration of ACE2 as a virus blocker provides a high level of protection against drug resistance caused by virus mutation.</p>
<p id="P26">ACE2 plays a central role in the homeostatic control of cardio-renal actions and has been shown to protect against severe acute lung injury and acute angiotensin II-induced hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>].</p>
<p id="P27">Moreover, ACE2 has been identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and NL63 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] which is confirmed by our data showing neutralization potency for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Recombinant human ACE2, however, also is an interesting therapeutic candidate for COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. A soluble dimer (APN019) has been safely tested in a clinical phase I study in healthy volunteers and in a phase II study in patients with an acute respiratory distress syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. It is currently being tested for its therapeutic effect in a phase II study in COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. A human ACE2-Fc fusion protein designed with an IgG1 Fc portion to prolong the circulating half-life is currently in a phase I clinical study pursued by Hengenix Biotech Inc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p>
<p id="P28">Pharmacokinetic studies in mice and humans revealed that recombinant human ACE2 exhibits fast clearance rates resulting in a short half-life of only a few hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. When the extracellular domain of murine ACE2 was fused to an Fc fragment of murine immunoglobulin IgG the ACE2-Fc fusion protein demonstrated a prolonged <italic>in vivo</italic> half-life and effective organ protection in murine models of both, acute and chronic angiotensin II-dependent hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>].</p>
<p id="P29">The presence of the Fc domain markedly increases the plasma half-life of ACE2-Fc due to the interaction of the Fc domain with the neonatal Fc-receptor (FcRn), and therefore a slower renal clearance of the fusion molecule. FcRn is broadly expressed on many cell types including endothelial cells and respiratory epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]. Binding to FcRn extends the systemic half-life by chaperoning bound Fc fusion proteins away from lysosomal degradation. In addition, FcRn transports IgG and Fc fusion molecules across mucosal barriers into the lumen of the respiratory and intestinal tract thereby providing a dynamic trafficking between circulating and luminal IgG molecules at mucosal sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>].</p>
<p id="P30">The affinity of ACE2 dimer to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been reported to be lower compared to an ACE2-IgG1-Fc fusion protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Using our design, ACE2-IgG4-Fc and ACE2-IgG1-Fc have both shown high binding affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and spike protein and bound and neutralized the virus with IC50 values below 1 nM. In addition, the IgG4-Fc fragment could reduce the risk of disease enhancement related to complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) and infection <italic>via</italic> CD16 Fc receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Although the constant heavy chain regions of different IgG subclasses share over 95% sequence homology, their structures and effector functions differ. IgG4 in particular has poor ability to engage C1q and Fc gamma receptors and has been associated with anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>].</p>
<p id="P31">The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused an unprecedented challenge to develop COVID-19 drugs in rapid pace. However, progress with candidate therapies still has been slow. Here we show that ACE2-IgG4-Fc fusion proteins have favorable biophysical and pharmaceutical characteristics and significant <italic>in vitro</italic> SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing potency. The Fc part from IgG4 could bring clinical benefits for ACE2-Fc proteins by avoiding potential antibody-dependent disease enhancement during treatment. Therefore, ACE2-IgG4-Fc fusion proteins present a promising potential treatment option not only for the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic but also for future coronavirus infectious diseases.</p>

<title>Generation of expression plasmids</title>
<p id="P33">Plasmids encoding the Fc fusion proteins were generated at ThermoFisher. Genes of interest were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 Zeocin expression plasmids (Invitrogen V860-20) with an elongated CMV promoter using HindIII/XhoI restriction sites. Following amplification in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, expression plasmids were isolated and analyzed by restriction analysis as well as DNA sequencing.</p>

<title>Protein expression</title>
<p id="P34">Using the FreeStyle 293 Expression System (ThermoFisher), the different ACE2-Fc fusion proteins were transiently expressed in 3 x 240 mL culture media. On day six, samples were analyzed for cell viability as well as cell density and supernatants were harvested by centrifugation followed by sterile-filtration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. The material was either stored at -80°C until purification or subjected directly to purification.

</sec>
<sec id="S14">
<title>Protein purification</title>
<p id="P35">Purification of the fusion proteins secreted into the culture medium was performed by protein A column chromatography followed by preparative Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC). For protein A purification, after loading the sample, the Amsphere A3 column (JSR Life Sciences) was washed and the ACE2-Fc fusion proteins were eluted using 40 mM NaAc, pH 3.0. Following elution, samples were first neutralized to pH 7.5 using 1 M Tris, pH 9.0, subsequently diluted 1:1 with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl and concentrated to 10 mg/mL using spin filters. Concentrated proteins were further purified with a Superdex 200 increase (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl. The main peak was pooled, the protein concentration was determined by slope spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>] and adjusted to 1 mg/mL. The protein solution was passed through a sterilizing filter and stored at 4°C until further usage.</p>

<title>ACE2 activity assay</title>
<p id="P38">An ACE2 activity assay kit from Abcam (Cat.No. ab273297) was used to measure the enzymatic activity of the constructs. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s manual and is based on a synthetic peptidyl-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA) that is cleaved by the ACE2 enzyme. Upon cleavage, free MCA is detected fluorometrically (Ex320nm/Em420nm) and quantified with a standard curve obtained with MCA standard solutions with known concentrations. Two commercially available ACE2-Fc proteins obtained from Genscript (Cat.No. Z03484-1) and Acrobiosystems (Cat.No. AC2-H5257) were used as reference.</p>

After discarding the supernatant, 1 mL of 5% carboxymethylcellulose (Sigma) diluted in Minimum Essential Media (Gibco) was added per well and the plate was incubated at 37°C until obvious plaques appeared. After removing the supernatant, cells were fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde (ChemCruz) at RT for 30 min. Next, a washing step with PBS was performed, followed by the addition of 1% crystal violet (Sigma; diluted in 20% methanol and water). Following an incubation time of 15 min at RT, the solution was washed away with PBS and the plate was dried.
