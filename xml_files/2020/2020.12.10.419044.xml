<abstract>
<p id="P1">Global control of COVID-19 requires broadly accessible vaccines that are effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants. In this report, we exploit the immunostimulatory properties of bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG), the existing tuberculosis vaccine, to deliver a vaccination regimen with potent SARS-CoV-2-specific protective immunity. Combination of BCG with a stabilized, trimeric form of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen promoted rapid development of virus-specific IgG antibodies in the blood of vaccinated mice, that was further augmented by the addition of alum. This vaccine formulation, BCG:CoVac, induced high-titre SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and Th1-biased cytokine release by vaccine-specific T cells, which correlated with the early emergence of T follicular helper cells in local lymph nodes and heightened levels of antigen-specific plasma B cells after vaccination. Vaccination of K18-hACE2 mice with a single dose of BCG:CoVac almost completely abrogated disease after SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with minimal inflammation and no detectable virus in the lungs of infected animals. Boosting BCG:CoVac-primed mice with a heterologous vaccine further increased SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses, which effectively neutralized B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. These findings demonstrate the potential for BCG-based vaccination to protect against major SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating globally.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The world has entered a critical stage in the continuing fight against COVD-19. The deployment of effective vaccines has had a profound impact in reducing cases and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in countries with high vaccine coverage<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. However global cases are again on the rise, driven predominantly by a surge of infections in Europe, South America and the subcontinent due to the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Two of the dominant variants of concern (VOCs), B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, both have increased transmissibility<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup> and antibodies from convalescent patients and vaccinees have a reduced capacity to neutralize B.1.351<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. Vaccination with one of the most widely deployed vaccines, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, does not protect against mild-to-moderate COVID-19 due to the B.1.351 variant in South Africa<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. A critical issue is ensuring the adequate supply of vaccines to the hardest-hit low and middle income countries, particularly due to complex logistical requirements (e.g. storage at low temperature for mRNA vaccines). The requirement for multiple doses for most approved vaccines is a barrier to rapid, mass vaccination and has necessitated changes in dosing schedules in some countries to ensure sufficient vaccine coverage<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. Thus, ensuring the global supply of vaccines effective against emerging variants will be necessary to control the global COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p id="P3">One unique strategy is to ‚Äòrepurpose‚Äô existing licensed vaccines for use against COVID-19. Significant interest has focussed on <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the tuberculosis (TB) vaccine. Considerable data has been accumulated to show that BCG has beneficial, non-specific effects on immunity that affords protection against other pathogens, particularly respiratory infections<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. Most recently, BCG vaccination was shown to protect against viral respiratory tract infections in the elderly (greater than 65 years old) with no significant adverse events<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. This non-specific protective effect is attributed to the ability of BCG to induce ‚Äòtrained immunity‚Äô i.e. reprogramming of innate immune responses to provide heterologous protection against disease. For these reasons, a Phase 3, randomised controlled trial in healthcare workers has commenced to determine if BCG vaccination can reduce the incidence and severity of COVID-19 (the BRACE Trial)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. While that trial will determine if BCG can reduce the impact on COVID-19 during the current pandemic, BCG does not express SARS-CoV-2 specific antigens and thus, would not induce long-term immune memory.</p>
<p id="P4">Here, we have exploited the immunostimulatory properties of BCG to develop a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BCG:CoVac, that combines a stabilized, trimeric form of the spike protein with the alum adjuvant. BCG:CoVac stimulated SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell responses in mice after a single vaccination, including the elicitation of high-titre NAbs. Critically, a single dose was shown to protect mice against severe SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that BCG:CoVac is a highly immunogenic and promising vaccine candidate.</p>

<title>BCG vaccination promotes SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody and T cell responses in mice</title>
<p id="P5">The immunostimulatory properties of BCG<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup> led to us to test if the vaccine could serve as the backbone for a unique vaccine platform against COVID-19. This was also supported by our observation that prior BCG immunization could augment anti-spike IgG responses after boosting with SpK formulated in Alhydrogel/alum (Alm<sup>SpK</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). To determine if this property of BCG could be used in a single vaccine formulation, we subcutaneously (s.c) vaccinated mice with a single dose of BCG formulated with a stabilized, trimeric form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup> and the titre of IgG2c or IgG1 anti-SpK antibodies was determined at various timepoints post-immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). While BCG vaccination resulted in background levels of anti-SpK antibodies, titres were approximately 100-fold higher for both antibody isotypes after BCG<sup>Spk</sup> vaccination, and similar to those levels achieved with Alm<sup>SpK</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b, 1c</xref>). Addition of alum to BCG<sup>Spk</sup> (termed BCG:CoVac) further increased antibodies titres, particularly IgG2c, which were significantly greater after BCG:CoVac vaccination compared to mice immunized with either BCG or Alm<sup>SpK</sup>, at all timepoints examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b, 1c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">The IgG2c Ab isotype correlates with Th1-like immunity in C57BL/6 mice<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>, and such responses are considered necessary for effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. We therefore examined the frequency of IFN-Œ≥-expressing T cells after a single dose of BCG:CoVac at 2 weeks post-vaccination. BCG<sup>SpK</sup> and BCG:CoVac induced the generation of SpK-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells secreting IFN-Œ≥ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d, 1e</xref>), consistent with Th1 immunity observed after BCG vaccination<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. The greatest response was observed after vaccination with BCG:CoVac, with the numbers of IFN-Œ≥-secreting T cells significantly increased compared to vaccination with either BCG or Alum<sup>SpK</sup>. Low levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and TNF were observed after BCG:CoVac vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">We further dissected vaccine-induced immunity by defining the cellular composition in draining lymph nodes 7 days after vaccination. Both Alum<sup>SpK</sup> and BCG:CoVac induced appreciable expansion of SpK-specific germinal centre (GC) B cells (CD19<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup>GL7<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>‚àí</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) and plasma B cells (CD19<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Cells with a T follicular helper cell (Tfh) phenotype (CD4<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup>BCL6<sup>+</sup>) were apparent after vaccination with Alum<sup>SpK</sup> or BCG:CoVac, with Tfh frequency greatest in the latter group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The total numbers of GC B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), plasma B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>) and Tfh cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>) were all significantly increased in BCG:CoVac-vaccinated mice compared to immunization with Alum<sup>SpK</sup>.</p>
<p id="P8">Overall, these data show that co-delivery of trimeric SpK antigen with BCG vaccination promotes early and pronounced anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, and this is further enhanced with the addition of alum.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>High-titre, SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies after a single immunization with BCG:CoVac</title>
<p id="P9">The elicitation of GC B cell and Tfh responses after immunization with experimental SARS-CoV-2 vaccines correlate strongly with the induction of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. Such NAbs are a key determinant of protection induced by current vaccines used in humans<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. We therefore measured NAb levels after a single dose of BCG:CoVac. No NAbs were detected in the plasma of mice vaccinated with BCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Surprisingly, NAb titres were at near background levels for mice vaccinated with BCG<sup>SpK</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), despite the high levels of IgG Ab isotypes detected in these same animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). High NAb titres were detected as early as 2 weeks post-immunization upon vaccination with BCG:CoVac, and titres were significantly increased compared to vaccination with Alum<sup>SpK</sup> (approximate 10-fold increase). The mean NAb titres in the plasma of BCG:CoVac-vaccinated mice were approximately 10-fold greater than those seen in SARS-CoV-2 infected humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Although the levels of NAbs peaked at 2 weeks post-vaccination with BCG:CoVac, they remained significantly elevated up to day 42 post-immunization unlike those in the other immunized groups.</p>
<p id="P10">Since previous work suggests that the level of IgG antibody correlates with NAb titres after SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>, we examined whether a similar phenomenon was observed after vaccination with BCG:CoVac. Strong correlation (r&gt; 0.9) was observed between IgG2c isotype and NAbs in groups vaccinated with BCG:CoVac or Alum<sup>SpK</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), with a significant yet less robust correlation between IgG1 and NAbs for these groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). There was no correlation between NAbs and either IgG1 or IgG2c Ab for mice vaccinated with BCG<sup>SpK</sup> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d, 3e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">These data suggest that alum is required for the optimal generation of NAbs after BCG:CoVac vaccination. This is a significant advantage for implementation of this vaccine candidate, due to the low cost and long standing safety record of alum<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. Importantly, the potential risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) caused by the selective induction of Th2 T cell responses by alum is offset by the strong Th1 immunity induced by BCG:CoVac, which in turn is driven by BCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>BCG:CoVac affords sterilizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection in K18-hACE2 mice</title>
<p id="P12">Wild-type mice are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, owing to incompatibility in the receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein with the murine angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. Transgenic mice expressing the human (h)ACE2 such as the K18-hACE2 mouse, are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, succumbing to lethal infection within 7 days post-infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. We therefore assessed the protective role of BCG or BCG:CoVac vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 infection in K18-hACE2 mice. Mice were vaccinated 21 days prior to inoculation with 10<sup>3</sup> PFU SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Mice sham vaccinated with PBS succumbed to infection within 6 days with substantial deterioration in their condition with high clinical scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) and 20% weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). This outcome was associated with high viral titres in the airways (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, BALF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>) and lung tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). These events led to extensive lung inflammation with substantial increases in inflammatory cells in the airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>) and lung tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>), and the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, and chemokines KC (murine equivalent of IL-8) and MCP-1, in the lung tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>) and airways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). MCP-1 was also increased in serum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). These are the archetypal cytokines associated with severe human COVID-19<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. Vaccination with BCG showed some beneficial effects and partially protected against weight loss (~10%) and lung IL-6 and KC responses but not in other disease features. Remarkably, vaccination with BCG:CoVac 21 days prior to infection completely protected against infection, with no observable weight loss or any clinical scores throughout the duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b, 4c</xref>). These mice had no detectable virus in the airways or lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D, 4E</xref>). They had few signs of lung inflammation with moderate levels on inflammatory cells in the airways and virtually none in the lung tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>), and only baseline levels of all pro-inflammatory cytokines in the airways, lung and serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). Importantly, combination of the spike protein and alum with BCG did not alter the protective efficacy of the BCG vaccine against aerosol <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4i</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">Collectively, these findings demonstrate that single dose administration of BCG:CoVac is sufficient to completely protect mice from the development of COVID-19 disease manifestations, and to neutralize infectious SARS-CoV-2 and prevent pathogenic inflammation in the lung.</p>

<title>Enhancing BCG:CoVac immunity against SARS-CoV-2 by heterologous vaccine boosting</title>
<p id="P14">COVID-19 subunit vaccines typically display poor immunity after a single dose and require a booster to induce sufficient generation of NAbs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. Whilst we observed high-titre NAbs as early as two weeks post-BCG:CoVac vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), we sought to determine if responses could be further augmented by boosting with a prototype subunit vaccine (Alum<sup>SpK</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). At 7 days post-boost (day 28), IgG2c titres in plasma from mice primed either with BCG<sup>SpK</sup> or BCG:CoVac were increased and remained elevated up to day 42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Corresponding augmentation of NAbs was also seen in these boosted groups, with significantly elevated responses in BCG:CoVac primed mice boosted with Alum<sup>SpK</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Boosting Alum<sup>SpK</sup> vaccination with a second dose led to a greater than 10-fold increase in NAbs in boosted mice; however, responses were significantly higher in those with the BCG:CoVac-prime, Alum<sup>SpK</sup>-boost combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Strikingly, plasma from BCG:CoVac-vaccinated mice was able to neutralize both the B.1.1.7 variant (1.3-fold decrease compared to wild-type virus) and B.1.351 variant (2.7-fold decrease) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Neutralization capacity against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 was maintained to some extent after prime-boost with Alum<sup>SpK</sup> only, however titres were approximately 10-fold less than those following the BCG:CoVac prime, Alum<sup>SpK</sup> combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">Taken together, these data indicate that the antigen-specific immunity imparted by BCG:CoVac can be further enhanced by heterologous boosting with a second SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, with this vaccination regime able to induce antibodies that can neutralize key VOCs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P16">Global vaccine access and distribution to low- and middle-income countries is critical for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccines must offer effective protective immunity yet should be cheap to manufacture and have feasible cold chain management requirements. This study describes a COVID-19 vaccine formulation, BCG:CoVac, that when delivered as a single dose induces potent SARS-CoV-2 specific immunity in mice, particularly the generation of high-titre, anti-viral neutralizing antibodies. Encouragingly, the level of immune responses observed (particularly the generation of neutralizing antibodies) is equivalent to or exceeds immunity elicited by approved COVID-19 vaccines, when these candidate vaccines were tested in the murine model<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. BCG:CoVac may have the additional advantage of inducing protection against other respiratory infections for which BCG is known to induce some level of protective immunity, including future pandemic viruses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. In addition, the possibility that prior BCG exposure may impart protection against severe COVID-19<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>, raises the possibility that a BCG-based vaccine could afford protection against SARS-CoV-2 escape mutants or new pandemic coronavirus that may emerge. Indeed our data demonstrate that BCG:CoVac can neutralize two of the key VOCs that are circulating globally, namely B.1.1.7 and B.1351. BCG:CoVac could also provide additional benefit in countries where BCG is part of childhood immunization programs for the control of TB, based on recent findings that repeat BCG vaccination significantly reduced rates of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P17">An advantage of our vaccine approach is the use of alum to potentiate immune responses, particularly the generation of NAbs after vaccination. Alum is a low cost, globally accessible vaccine adjuvant with an excellent safety record in humans<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. The relative paucity of IFN-Œ≥-secreting T cells observed after Alum<sup>SpK</sup> vaccination corresponds with that previously seen with alum-precipitated vaccines using the spike protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup> and is consistent with the known preferential priming of Th2-type immunity by alum-based adjuvants<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. The ability of BCG:CoVac to induce strong Th1 immunity is due to the adjuvant effect of BCG components to induce such responses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>. This has clear importance, as T cell responses in recovering COVID-19 patients are predominately Th1-driven<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>, expression of IFN-Œ≥ was lower in severe COVID-19 cases compared to mild ones<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup> and the development of Th2 immunity correlated with VAERD<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>.We also observed only background levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and TNF after BCG:CoVac delivery, suggesting reduced levels of potentially deleterious, circulating inflammatory cytokines. Heightened expression of IL-17 correlates with severe COVID-19 disease<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>, while neutralizing IL-17 has been suggested as a possible therapy to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. In addition, the development of VAERD is also associated with Th17 immunity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P18">Our study contributes to defining correlates of immunity in animal models that could be applied to fast-track the development of next-generation COVID-19 vaccines. A single dose of BCG:CoVac was sufficient to clear infectious SARS-CoV-2 from the lungs of K18-hACE2 mice, with no signs of clinical disease during the infection time-course, which is otherwise lethal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Our findings are in agreement with previous reports that demonstrate that these mice succumb rapidly to infection, indicating that the level of NAbs elicited by BCG:CoVac is sufficient to clear SARS-CoV-2 infection in this model<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. While NAb levels are known to correlate with efficacy of COVID-9 vaccines in humans<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>, other immune parameters may play an important role. Accordingly, we observed that high NAb levels in blood corelated with strong induction of GC and plasma B cells in lymph nodes, as well as heightened levels of Tfh cells. In COVID-19 convalescent individuals, the presence of memory B cells and Tfh are closely associated with NAb activity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>. Further, although BCG vaccination alone did not reduce lung viral load, mice immunized with this vaccine did show an intermediate level of both weight loss and cytokine/chemokine induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting a possible ‚Äòdampening‚Äô of host inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Such an effect was seen in a human challenge model using the live-attenuated yellow fever vaccine, where BCG reduced circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>. It will be of particular interest to see the outcome of ongoing clinical trials to determine if BCG vaccination can reduce COVID-19 incidence and severity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P19">In conclusion, we describe a COVID-19 vaccine strategy based on the existing BCG vaccine, that would be broadly applicable for all populations susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of particular note, this strategy could be readily incorporated into current vaccine schedules in countries where BCG is currently used. Further assessment in humans will determine if BCG:CoVac can impart protective immunity against not only SARS-CoV-2, but also other respiratory infections for which BCG has known efficacy.</p>

<title>Heterologous boosting of BCG:CoVac-primed mice results in augmented SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG2c titres and neutralizing antibodies.</title>
<p>
<bold>a</bold>, C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and at day 21 mice were boosted with Alum<sup>Spk</sup>. <bold>b</bold>, Spike-specific IgG2c titres in plasma were determined by ELISA estimated from the sigmoidal curve of each sample interpolated with the threshold of the negative sample ¬± 3 standard deviations. <bold>c</bold>, Neutralizing antibody (NAb) titres (IC<sub>50</sub>) were calculated as the highest dilution of plasma for all groups that still retained at least 50% inhibition of infection compared to controls. The dotted line shows the limit of detection. <bold>d</bold>,<bold>e</bold>, NAb titres against the B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variants were also determined using plasma from either <bold>d</bold>, Alum<sup>SpK</sup> or <bold>e</bold>, BCG:CoVac-vaccinated mice. Data presented as mean ¬± s.d. Significant differences between groups compared to BCG<sup>Spk</sup> *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.01 or Alum<sup>Spk</sup> ‚Ä†p&lt;0.05, ‚Ä†‚Ä†p&lt;0.01, ‚Ä†‚Ä†‚Ä†p&lt;0.001 were determined by one-way ANOVA.</p>
