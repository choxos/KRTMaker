<abstract>
<p id="P3">One third of COVID-19 patients develop significant neurological symptoms, yet SARS-CoV-2 is rarely detected in central nervous system (CNS) tissue, suggesting a potential role for parainfectious processes, including neuroimmune responses. We therefore examined immune parameters in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 and significant neurological complications. We found divergent immunological responses in the CNS compartment, including increased levels of IL-12 and IL-12-associated innate and adaptive immune cell activation. Moreover, we found increased proportions ofB cells in the CSF relative to the periphery and evidence of clonal expansion of CSF B cells, suggesting a divergent intrathecal hum.oral response to SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, all COVID-19 cases examined had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the CSF whose target epitopes diverged from serum antibodies. We directly examined whether CSF resident antibodies target self-antigens and found a significant burden of CNS autoimmunity, with the CSF from most patients recognizing neural self-antigens. Finally, we produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies from patients' CSF and show that these target both anti-viral and anti-neural antigens—including one mAb specific for the spike protein that also recognizes neural tissue. This exploratory immune survey reveals evidence of a compartmentalized and self-reactive immune response in the CNS meriting a more systematic evaluation of neurologically impaired COVID-19 patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P4">The causative pathogen of pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), SARS-CoV-2, primarily causes a respiratory illness. Yet, in some patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection associates with severe and debilitating extrapulmonary symptoms, including neurological dysfunction(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Indeed, about a third of patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 develop neurologic symptoms including anosmia, dysgeusia, headache, impaired consciousness, and seizure—only some of which is explained by systemic complications including hypercoagulability(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). While studies of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in affected patients only rarely detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), the largest post-mortem neuropathological study to date found evidence for SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the brains of half of patients. However, there was little evidence of associated tissue damage(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest mechanisms other than viral replication may contribute to neuropathology, and point to the need for a broad characterization of the neuroimmune milieu during the course of neurologic impairment of COVID-19 patients. In this exploratory study, we compared the innate and adaptive arms of the intrathecal and peripheral immune responses in patients with COVID-19 complicated by diverse neurological symptoms.</p>

<title>Overview of study</title>
<p id="P5">Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diverse neurological symptoms who underwent clinically-indicated lumbar puncture were consented for collection of surplus CSF to be used for research. Six participants with acute COVID-19, based on positive nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR, were enrolled (Cases 1–6, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Neurological symptoms included encephalopathy (n=3), intractable headache (n=3), and seizure (n=l). All participants donated paired blood and CSF, except for one patient who did not donate blood. Lumbar punctures were performed on median hospital day 12.5 (range 2 - 43 days). Healthy controls were previously enrolled through a neuroinfectious disease biorepository at Yale prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, with CSF supernatant biobanked and frozen; these controls were included based on age and sex match to the COVID-19 cases (n=3). Because fresh CSF is required for single cell analyses, we also recruited additional uninfected control participants during the COVID-19 pandemic (n=3): 2 were healthy community-dwelling adults, and one was hospitalized for the work-up of frequent falls. These controls tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR. Fresh CSF and blood samples were processed into cells from the CSF, CSF supernatant, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). CSF (n=5) and plasma (n=6) samples from COVID-19 cases were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR using the CDC primer-probe sets(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>).</p>

<title>Transcriptional analysis reveals a coordinated innate immune cell response to COVID-19 in the CNS</title>
<p id="P6">To investigate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host immune cell gene expression, we performed single cell RNA sequencing with the 10X Genomics platform on 76,473 immune cells from the CSF and blood of patients hospitalized with acute COVID-19 (n = 5) and uninfected controls (n = 3 recruited in March-May 2020, and n = 8 healthy controls from Gate et al(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>)). To test for the presence of intracellular virus, open reading frames of SARS-CoV-2 (spike, ORF3a, envelope, membrane glycoprotein, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, nucleocapsid, and ORF10) were added to the reference genome before alignment with CellRanger. No viral transcripts were detected in any of the CSF cells or PBMCs. We performed unsupervised cluster analysis and represented gene expression data from cases and controls in UMAP space. We identified distinct T cell, B cell, and myeloid cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>), characterized by gene expression patterns of canonical immune cell genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1a</xref>). As expected, in both COVID-19 cases and controls B cells and neutrophils were enriched in the PBMC compartment compared to the CSF, whereas CSF was enriched for a population of myeloid cells rarely present amongst PBMCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1b-c</xref>). To study CSP-specific gene expression patterns of immune cell populations in COVID-19 patients, we compared gene expression in CSF from COVID-19 cases and controls, and compared these differentially expressed genes to genes that were differentially expressed in the PBMCs between COVID-19 cases and controls. In this way, we found COVID-19 associated transcriptional changes that were unique to the CSF.</p>
<p id="P7">While CD16+ and CD14+ monocytes included the most differentially downregulated genes in the PBMCs of COVID-19 patients, dendritic cells, and CSF-predominant myeloid cells yielded the most differentially expressed genes in the CSF compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). While NK cells in the CSF and the peripheral blood demonstrated comparable changes in the number of differentially expressed genes in COVID-19 cases compared to controls, the genes affected were mostly unique to each compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">Using single cell differential gene expression analysis, we found evidence for activation of dendritic cells in the CSF of COVID-19 patients: 57% and 47% of the upregulated genes in these cells were classified as type 1 and type 2 interferon stimulated genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). NK cells in the CSF of COVID-19 patients also specifically upregulated genes associated with NK cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). Using CellphoneDB signaling network analysis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) we found that in the CSF of COVID-19 patients, dendritic and NK cells are predicted to have increased interaction with CD8+ and CD4+ T cells compared to what is predicted in the CSF of healthy patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>). We asked whether the predicted interactions between activated innate and adaptive immune cells in the CNS could be interpreted as driving the transcriptional changes observed in the CSF T cells of COVID-19 patients. Using NicheNet(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), we designated the CSF innate immune cells as "sender" cells and CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and B cells as "receiver" cells, and found enrichment in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of potential regulatory genes affecting chemokine receptors, integrins, and activation of immune cells, consistent with results from CellphoneDB analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2</xref>).</p>

<title>T cells in the CSF display increased cellular activation during COVID-19</title>
<p id="P9">Because T cells were predicted to be the main recipients of innate-adaptive cross talk, we first subsetted and re-clustered CSF and blood T cells for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3a-d</xref>). While the relative proportions of CSF T cell populations were generally conserved in COVID-19 patients compared to controls, among the PBMCs there was a decrease in the frequency of naive CD4+ T cells (mean COVID-19 9.65%, healthy 18.219%; p =0.001) and an increase in effector CD8+ T cells (mean COVID-19 30.9%, healthy 16.245%; p= 0.02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). However, while relative T cell populations were conserved in CSF of COVID-19 cases compared to control CSF, we found significant COVID-19 associated transcriptional changes in CSF T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3d</xref>). Effector CD4+ T cells in the CSF of COVID-19 patients showed significant transcriptional changes compared to CD4+ T cells in the PBMCs of COVID-19 cases. After excluding any genes that were also differentially expressed between T cells in the CSF and periphery of healthy individuals, we identified genes that were upregulated in both Thl and Th2 CD4+ T cells from COVID-19 CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>) and found enrichment for several gene pathways important for T cell activation, as well as engagement oflL-1 and IL-12 mediated signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). Effector CD8+ T cells in the CSF were similarly enriched for genes involved with canonical immune response pathways when compared to CSF from healthy donors, including: 1) increased motility and cell adhesion, 2) differentiation/proliferation, and 3) effector programming (responses to IL-12, IL-1, IFN-g, and T cell co-stimulation), indicating the presence of a coordinated T cell based immune response in the CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f-g</xref>). Overall, COVID-19 associated transcriptional changes were observed in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the CSF, were agnostic to the effector state of the cells, and predicted cell-cell interactions that were unique to the CSF in COVID-19 cases, including T cell co-stimulation factors and trafficking interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S4a-b</xref>).</p>

<p id="P10">To validate the transcriptional enrichment in IL-12 and IL-1 signaling in the CSF of COVID-19 patients with neurologic symptoms, we measured inflammatory cytokine levels in the CSF and plasma using a Luminex cytokine panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2g-h</xref>). Consistent with the single-cell RNA sequencing results, IL-lb and IL-12 were elevated in the CSF of COVID-19 cases compared to healthy controls, but were not elevated in the plasma of COVID-19 cases. Conversely, CCL2, CXCL9, and IL-8 were significantly increased in the periphery of COVID-19 cases compared to controls, but not in their CSF. Because IL-12 is thought to be produced by activated antigen presenting cells to orchestrate Th1 responses through T and NK cell activation, we examined the cellular source oflL-12 in COVID-19 cases. The innate immune cells with the highest <italic>IL12A</italic> expression were CSF macrophages, NK, and dendritic cells (Fig sle). Taken together, these data support the single cell RNA sequencing analyses that identified IL-12 as differentially expressed in CSF but not blood innate immune cells of COVID-19 cases, and suggest a distinct effect of COVID-19 in the CNS on cytokines important for innate immunity and for the induction of cell-mediated immunity, including IL-1 and IL-12.</p>

<title>CNS B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 differ from those in the periphery</title>
<p id="P11">Having examined compartmentalized innate immune cells, T cells, and cytokine secretion, we next evaluated B cell populations in COVID-19 patients with neurologic symptoms. In these patients, we found a significant enrichment of B cells in the CSF when compared to CSF of controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). Single cell RNA sequencing revealed several subtypes ofB cells amongst PBMCs and in the CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>, s<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a-c</xref>), including distinct plasma cell clusters. We therefore asked whether antibody-secreting B cells in the CSF exhibit a different anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody profile than the those in the periphery. To do so, we utilized a recently developed SARS-CoV-2 epitope Luminex panel(J2) to screen for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the CSF and plasma of COVID-19 cases and controls. As expected, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were not detected in any controls. In contrast, all COVID-19 cases had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in both CSF and plasma. However, while all COVID-19 cases developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid in both the plasma and CSF, anti-RBD antibodies were rare in CSF but uniformly present in the plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). In addition, we found that in all COVID-19 cases, both the relative prevalence (rank score: 12 being most frequent, 1 being least frequent; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>) and levels of antibody (s<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5d</xref>) diverged between the CSF and plasma, revealing a different anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody profile between the CSF and plasma of the same patient.</p>

<title>A mouse model of CNS SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrates compartmentalized CNS antibody secretion in response to CNS infection</title>
<p id="P12">Direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF is extremely rare in reported cases of neurological complications of COVID-19(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was similarly absent in our cohort. However, we detected intrathecal anti-viral antibodies in all cases. To determine whether the presence of CSF anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the absence of viral nucleic acid is consistent with viral neuroinvasion as is the case for other encephalitis-causing viruses including West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and measles virus(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), we used a recently developed mouse model that reliably dissociates pulmonary and neurological infection of SARS-CoV-2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">In our mouse model, adeno-associated virus is used to express the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor in the lung, brain, or the lung and brain and allows us to target SARS-CoV-2 infection to specific tissues (s<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6a-b</xref>). First, we used mice that express hACE2 in both the lung and the brain and administered SARS-CoV-2 intranasally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). This allowed us to establish SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the lung and the brain. In these mice, as expected, we detected increased titers of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in both the lung and brain tissue following inoculation. However, despite robust brain infection, we do not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the CSF of these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). This suggests that direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in CSF at a single time point may be insensitive to parenchymal or short lived SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion.</p>
<p id="P14">We next used the mouse model to evaluate whether the detection of intrathecal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in our COVID-19 patients was more likely triggered by a local antigen (i.e., as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion) or reflected passive transfer of antibody from the systemic circulation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) When SARS-CoV-2 was administered intranasally to mice expressing hACE2 only in the lung, we detected significantly elevated anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the lung and serum of mice, while we saw little antibody signal in the brain or CSF of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, red). When SARS-CoV-2 was administered intranasally to mice expressing hACE2 in both the brain and lung, we detected increased anti-spike antibodies in all four compartments: lung, serum, brain, and CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, orange). Finally, when hACE2 was expressed in brain only and SARS-CoV-2 was administered intracranially (causing infection in the brain but not the lung), we detected increased anti-spike antibodies in the brain and CSF, but not in the lung or serum of the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, green). These data support that systemic infection alone may not be sufficient to account for the presence ofhumoral anti-viral immunity in the CNS. Indeed, in these mice, anti-spike antibodies in the CSF and brain were only observed in the setting of CNS infection, independent of whether there was an accompanying systemic SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

<title>Monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patient CSF are self-reactive</title>
<p id="P15">Although our COVID-19 cases did not have detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their CSF, our CSF serology data suggested that CSF-expanded B cell populations might be specific for SARS-CoV-2 antigen(s). To address this question, we cloned individual monoclonal antibodies from the COVID-19 case with the largest number of clonally expanded B cell receptor (BCR) sequences in the CSF (n=5) and blood (n=4) (Case l; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In this patient, the most prevalent BCR sequences comprised ~25% and ~10% of the total B cells in the blood and CSF, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>). Notably, the most prevalent BCR sequences detected in the CSF of case 1 did not overlap with the most prevalent peripheral BCR sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that a subset of CSF antibodies target antigen within the CNS. We found that one of five CSF-derived and two of four PBMC-derived monoclonal antibodies targeted SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>). None of the other monoclonal antibodies recognized other SARS-CoV-2 antigens on the Luminex panel. Given reports of new-onset hum.oral autoimmunity in COVID-19, we wondered whether some of the CSF-derived monoclonal antibodies might be autoreactive to neural tissue. Therefore, we tested all monoclonal antibodies for anti-neural immunoreactivity by anatomic mouse brain tissue staining. Monoclonal antibodies were used as a primary antibody to immunostain mouse brain tissue and labeled with an antihuman secondary antibody. An anti-influenza antibody targetting the hemagglutinin antigen (anti-HA) was used as a negative control (anti-INF). Similar to anti-HA, none of the PBMC-derived monoclonals recognized mouse brain tissue. In contrast, four of five CSF-derived monoclonal antibodies exhibited some degree of anti-neural immunoreactivity-including the anti-spike monoclonal (mAb C2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5D and E</xref>). Notably, mAb C2 produced a neuropil-predominant immunostaining pattern on mouse brain tissue suggesting that antigen may be enriched in neuronal process or harbor an extracellular epitope. Immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of mouse brain lysate using mAb C2 significantly enriched synaptopodin, a postsynaptic dendritic protein, and neural cadherin, a brain-enriched transmembrane protein that mediates presynaptic to postsynaptic adhesion. These data indicate that some CSF-expanded B cell populations in COVID-19 patients with neurologic symptoms are reactive to SARS-CoV-2 antigen, self-antigen, or both.</p>

<title>Intrathecal humoral autoimmunity in COVID-19 patients with neurologic symptoms</title>
<p id="P16">The emergence of inflammatory and hum.oral autoimmune disorders of the nervous system during the para- or post-infectious period in COVID-19 is increasingly recognized and includes: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), autoimmune encephalitis associated with known autoantibodies, transverse myelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome and one of its variants, Miller Fisher syndrome(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Given this literature, and the autoreactivity of CSF-derived monocloncal antibodies from case 1, we hypothesized that our other COVID-19 cases might harbor intrathecal autoantibodies. To test this, we screened our cohort of COVID-19 cases for intrathecal anti-neural antibodies using a suite of complementary autoantigen detection platforms: anatomic mouse brain tissue immunostaining, immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS), and pan-human proteome phage display immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).

<p id="P18">To screen for the neural protein targets of intrathecal autoantibodies, we immunoprecipitated whole mouse brain lysate using CSF and plasma, trypsinized precipitated proteins, and analyzed the resulting peptides by MS. IPs were performed in technical replicate, by different individuals, using different mice as input. First we searched resulting spectra against the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (Uniprot SARS-CoV-2 reference proteome, 06/2020). SARS-CoV-2 proteins were not detected. We then searched for human proteins.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P22">In this exploratory study, we performed a comprehensive set of immunologic investigations to assess for CNS-specific immune responses in a series of COVID-19 patients with neurologic symptoms(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). While systemic multi-organ dysfunction is almost certainly a driver of neurologic complications in a proportion of COVID-19 patients, here we identified both innate and adaptive anti-viral immune responses, as well as humoral autoimmunity that appears to be unique to the CNS, and may therefore contribute to COVID-19 neuropathology.</p>
<p id="P23">CSF, while not identical to brain, is produced by the choroid plexus and bathes the CNS. It is the only CNS tissue surrogate readily sampled in living humans. Analysis of CSF immune cells has shed light on immune mechanisms of neuronal injury during other infections, including HIV, neurosyphilis, and neuroborreliosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). By assessing CSF and blood in patients with acute COVID-19 and neurological symptoms, we find evidence for a compartmentalized CNS immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Through transcriptional and cytokine analyses, we find an increase in CSF but not plasma IL-12 and IL-1b, factors that are central for coordinating innate and adaptive immune responses to invading pathogens. Notably, mouse CoV neuroinvasion also leads to IL-12 production by astrocytes and microglia(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).</p>
<p id="P24">Our data identified increased and divergent humoral responses within the CNS. This humoral response included indirect evidence for neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 through the presence of anti-viral antibodies in the CNS during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, using an animal model, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS is necessary for stimulating the production of intrathecal SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as isolated systemic viral infection is associated with little to no antibody in CSF. These data therefore suggest that the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody in the CSF of COVID-19 patients may similarly reflect viral infection of the CNS. Further supporting this contention, we generated a monoclonal antibody from the CSF of a COVID-19 patient (case 1) with marked B cell clonal expansion in the CSF that was specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This B cell clone was not detected in the peripheral blood of the same patient. Notably, the other CSF-derived monoclonal antibodies were variably immunoreactive to mouse brain tissue which motivated and expanded search for autoantibodies in the CSF of our other COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p id="P25">Indeed, our extended studies of the CNS humoral response suggest that a subset of COVID-19 patients with neurologic symptoms have an elevated burden of autoreactive antibodies in their CSF. By anatomic immunostaining, an unexpectedly high proportion of our COVID-19 cases harbored intrathecal autoantibodies, including anti-neural autoantibodies. Hippocampal immunostaining from three cases was primarily restricted to the CA3 region similar to a recent report of SARS-CoV-2 associated encephalitis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Other immunoreactive anatomic regions included the olfactory bulb in three cases and cerebrovasculature in two—anatomic regions with <italic>prima facie</italic> relevance to common neurologic sequelae of COVID-19 (i.e., anosmia and stroke). Subsequent unbiased protein and peptide screens of CSF identified a diversity of candidate autoantibodies, and two of these autoantigens, SNPH and IFT88, were subsequently validated by CBA. Although SNPH and IFT88 are previously undescribed autoantigens of indeterminate clinical significance, their biologic functions suggest they could be implicated in autoantibody-mediated neurologic dysfunction. SNPH is a brain-enriched transmembrane protein that inhibits SNARE complex formation and subsequent neurotransmitter release(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). IFT88 is a ciliary protein whose mutation causes a ciliopathy in humans and anosmia in mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>).</p>
<p id="P26">However, the mere presence of an intrathecal autoantibody does not mean that a patient has an autoimmune encephalitis. Indeed, the patients in our exploratory cohort lacked evidence for active inflammation on neuroimaging and/or did not have elevated conventional CSF markers of neuroinflammation (i.e., white blood cell count, IgG index, and CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands) typically, but not always, found in patients with autoimmune encephalitis. Moreover, our study is complicated by the diverse range of neurological symptoms in our study participants. Finally, a comparison group with a different systemic viral infection would help determine which aspects of the findings are specific to COVID-19. Nonetheless, our data suggest that deeper CNS phenotyping of COVID-19 patients with acute and/or chronic neurologic sequelae should be pursued. Notably, COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms appear to have immune responses to multiple autoantigens, implying that the increased compartmental humoral immune response may reflect a broader immune activation syndrome. This is particularly true given that humoral autoimmunity has been observed to target other organ systems in COVID-19, and may also contribute to neuropathology during COVID-19(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>)'(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>).</p>
<p id="P27">Taken together, our exploratory data suggest that even in COVID-19 patients with neurologic symptoms who lack overt evidence for neuroinflammation on MRI or conventional CSF testing, there is a compartmentalized immune response involving the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Future research, involving careful clinical phenotyping and timely investigations of the CSF, will help place these findings into a broader clinical context and inform whether anti-viral and/or immunomodulatory therapies might be indicated for carefully selected neurologically impaired patients with COVID-19.</p>

B cell clones in the CSF and circulation were identified using an approach described previously using hierarchical clustering implemented using the DefineClones.py function of Change-O v0.3.4 and a junctional sequence hamming dissimilarity threshold of 0.17(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). To account for the presence of light chains, heavy chain-based clones were corrected for using an approach described previously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>).</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 Serological Assay</title>
<p id="P38">Highly immunogenic linear regions of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome were isolated by ReScan and conjugated to Luminex beads as previously described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Briefly, high concentration T7 phage stocks displaying immunodominant epitopes of the S, N and ORF3a proteins were propagated and grown to high(&gt;10<sup>11</sup> PFU/mL) titer then were each conjugated to unique bead IDs according to manufacturer's Antibody Coupling Kit instructions (Luminex). Whole N protein (RayBiotech) beads were conjugated similarly using manufacturer instructions with 5μg of protein per 1 million beads. For other whole protein Luminex-based beads, MagPlex-Avidin Microspheres (Luminex) were coated with either the S protein RBD (residues 328-533) or the trimeric S protein ectodomain (residues 1-1213).</p>
<p id="P39">All beads were blocked overnight before use and pooled on day of use. 2000-2500 beads per ID were pooled per incubation with patient plasma at a final dilution of 1:500 or patient CSF at a final dilution of 1:20 for 1 hour, washed, then stained with an anti-IgG pre-conjugated to phycoerythrin (Thermo Scientific, #12-4998-82) for 30 minutes at 1:2000. Primary incubations were done in PBST supplemented with 2% nonfat milk and secondary incubations were done in PBST. Beads were processed in 96 well format and analyzed on a Luminex LX 200 cytometer. Median Fluorescence Intensity from each set of beads within each bead ID were retrieved directly from the LX200 and log transformed after normalizing to the mean signal across two intra-assay negative controls (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and tubulin phage peptide conjugated beads).</p>

<p id="P62">For IP-MS, all sample handling through protein digestion was performed in a BSL2 biosafety hood. Technical replicates were performed on the same day, by different individuals, using different tissue preps. Plasma samples were unbuffered. CSF samples were stored 1:1 in storage buffer. Samples were thawed on ice. Immunoprecipitations were performed in unblocked, thin-walled 96-well Hard-Shell® PCR plates (Bio-Rad Cat. No. HSP9641). For immunoprecipitations using patient plasma as the source ofigG, 2 μL of plasma was diluted in 200 μL of lx PBS (Gibco Cat. No. 10010-023). For CSF immunoprecipitations, 75 -200 μL of CSF (depending on the amount ofremaining biospecimen) was added to individual wells. For IgG conjugation, magnetic protein <italic>NG</italic> beads were washed once in lx PBS and suspended in an equal volume of PBS. To each well, 10 μL of washed protein A/G bead slurry was added and plates were placed on a rocker at 4C for one hour followed by incubation on a shaker at room temperature for one hour.</p>
<p id="P63">Postnatal day 40-60 mice (Fl generation ofFVB × C57blk6 cross) were used as the source of antigen. Mice anesthetized in isofluorane and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. For each set, 3 brains (two males and one female for one replicate and two females and one male for the other replicate) were rapidly dissected in ice cold PBS. For each replicate, 3 brains were homogenized in ice cold tissue lysis buffer (7 mL) using a dounce homogenizer (approximately 20 strokes). Homogenized brain lysate was transferred to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 4C for 10 minutes at 10,000 ref. The supernatant from each set of brains was pooled yielding two separately prepared stocks of brain lysate. After BCA protein concentration determination, brain lysate stocks were diluted to 5 ug / uL in lysis buffer.</p>
<p id="P64">After IgG conjugation, the plate was placed on a magnetic plate, and the supernatant aspirated and discarded into 10% bleach. To each well, 200 μL of brain lysate (5 μg / μL) was added. Plates were sealed with adhesive aluminumized plate covers (Bio-Rad, Microseal® ‘F’ PCR Plate Seal, foil, pierceable Cat. No. #MSFlO0l). Antibody-bead-lysate complexes were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature under constant gentle agitation.</p>
<p id="P65">After 1 hour, IP plates were placed on magnetic plates and the lysate was aspirated and discarded into 10% bleach. Beads and their respective immune complexes were washed with 180 μL of 2x with detergent wash buffer, then lx in high salt wash buffer, then lx in nondetergent wash buffer, followed by lx in ammonium bicarb buffer. For each well, washed beads were then resuspended in 35 μL of ammonium bicarb buffer to which 1 μL sequencing grade porcine trypsin was added (Promega, Cat. No. V5111). Immune complexes were digested on bead for 1 hr at 37°C. After digestion, plates were placed on magnetic plates and digestion reaction containing trypsinized peptides was transferred to a protein LoBind Eppendorf tube (Eppendorf, Cat.

A dynamic exclusion of 60 seconds was used. MS spectra were acquired with an isolation window of 1.2 Da, a resolution of 60,000 and a target of 4 × 105 ions or a maximum injection time of 50ms. MS/MS spectra were acquired with a resolution of 15K and a target of 1 × 104 ions or a maximum injection time of 35ms with maximum parallelizable time turned on.

<title>Data Analysis (Scaffold Proteome Software)</title>
<p id="P67">Tandem mass spectra were extracted by Proteome Explorer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific). Charge state deconvolution and deisotoping were not performed. All MS/MS samples were analyzed using X! Tandem (The GPM, thegpm.org; version X! Tandem Alanine (2017.2.1.4)). X! Tandem was set up to search the Uniprot Mouse reference proteome (1/2020, 258832 entries) and Uniprot SARS-CoV-2 Database (version 06/2020, 262 entries) assuming the digestion enzyme trypsin. X! Tandem was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of0.40 Da and a parent ion tolerance of20 PPM. Glu-&gt;pyro-Glu of then-terminus, ammonia-loss of then-terminus, gln-&gt;pyro-Glu of then-terminus, deamidated of asparagine and glutamine, oxidation of methionine and tryptophan and dioxidation of methionine and tryptophan were specified in X! Tandem as variable modifications. Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.9.0, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability by the Scaffold Local FDR algorithm. Peptide identifications were also required to exceed specific database search engine thresholds. X! Tandem identifications required at least. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 5.0% probability to achieve an FDR less than 5.0% and contained at least 2 identified peptides. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm (Nesvizhskii, Al et al Anal. Chem. 2003;75(17):4646-58). Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. Proteins sharing significant peptide evidence were grouped into clusters. For identification of significant peptides, Scaffold settings were as such: protein threshold = FDR&lt; 5%, minimum peptides = 1, peptide threshold = MRS_otlt. Mouse proteins that were significantly enriched after Benjamini-Hochberg corrected t-test (alpha= 0.05) and that were observed in both replicates were considered candidate autoantigens.</p>

<p id="P70">A 500mL culture of E. Coli BLT5403 was incubated at 37°C with shaking until log phase, defined as OD<sub>600</sub>= 0.5. The culture was then inoculated with the stock phage library with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 and incubated at 37°C for 3 hours in order for complete lysis to occur. Lysate was spun at 3500rpm for 15 minutes to remove debris.</p>
<p id="P71">Phage were precipitated by adding 20% culture volume of 5x PEG/NaCl (PEG-8000 20%, NaCl 2.5mM) and left overnight at 4°C. Phage were then spun down at 4°C for 15 minutes at 10,000g, re-suspended in storage media (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 6mM MgCh) and filtered through a 0.22uM filter.

Patient samples were stored in blocked 96-well plates and diluted in 2x storage buffer (40% glycerol, 40mM HEPES pH7.3, 0.04% NaN3 in DPBS). Blocking buffer was then replaced with 150uL of pre-prepared phage library and incubated with 2uL patient sample overnight with shaking at 4°C. Commercial antibodies were diluted at 1:50.</p>
<p id="P73">Protein A and G magnetic beads (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) were washed by magnetic separation and re-suspended in an equivalent volume of 0.1% TNP-40 (150mM NaCl, 50mM Tris-HCL, 0.1% NP-40). 10uL of <italic>NG</italic> beads were added to each IP reaction and incubated at 4°C with shaking for 1 hour to allow patient antibodies to bind to beads. Beads were then washed by magnetic separation with 150uL 0.1% TNP-40 three times. Subsequent to final wash, beads were re-suspended in 150uL of Luria broth (LB) and used to inoculate 500uL of fresh E. Coli cultures (OD<sub>600</sub>= 0.5) in 96-deep well plates for in vivo amplification. Cultures were incubated for 2 hours at 37°C with shaking and allowed to complete lysis. 96-deep well plates were then spun down at 3300prm for 10 minutes. 150uL oflysate (IPl) was saved and stored at -20°C.

<p id="P97">After PCR reaction was completed, products were immediately pooled (3uL per sample) and size selected with a 0.67x bead clean-up (SPRISelect, Beckman Coulter). Product concentration was quantified using an automated electrophoresis system (Bioanalyzer, High-Sensitivity DNA Chips, Agilent). Libraries were sequenced on the iSeq (cases 1 - 6 and controls) or NovaSeq 6000 (case 7 and controls) (Illumina) using 150nt paired-end reads.</p>

<title>PhIP-Seq Bioinformatic Analysis</title>
<p id="P98">Raw reads generated from the PhIP-Seq peptidome assay were aligned to the reference database using RAPSearch (v2.2). Peptide counts outputted from this workflow were normalized to reads per 100 thousand (RPK) for every sample by diving each peptide count by the sum and multiplying by 100,000. The resulting peptide RPK count matrices were analyzed using a custom bioinformatics pipeline written in R.</p>
<p id="P99">For the analysis, these data were divided into disease and reference groups for both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples. The disease group contained SARS-CoV-2 and A-G bead samples. The reference group contained healthy control (HC) and A-G bead samples. Peptide Fold Change (FC) was calculated for each sample. Peptide counts for Sars-CoV2 samples were divided by the mean RPK of the reference group and healthy control samples were divided by the mean RPK of the disease group. In addition, the FC for GFAP samples were calculated in the same way using the mean of all A-G bead samples.</p>
<p id="P100">To identify enriched peptides, results from each sample were filtered using a set of thresholds that, when using a commercial antibody to GFAP, consistently identified GFAP peptides while minimizing nonspecific off-target peptide identification (Agilent 2033429-2, 1:200 dilution). Each peptide was required to have a minimum of 1 RPK as well as a FC &gt; 10. In addition, thresholds were applied at the gene level. Genes were kept if at least one peptide had a FC &gt; 100 and a total (summed) RPK &gt; 20 across all peptides in the gene. A Kmer analysis was applied to amino acid sequences of all peptides that passed the previous filters. Using a sliding window algorithm, with a window size of7 and a step size of 1, all 7-mers were compared across SARS-CoV-2 and HC samples. Proteins for which peptides containing at least one 7-mer overlap with another peptide whose total rpK was ≥20 were carried forward in the analysis.</p>
<p id="P101">Additionally, proteins with nonoverlapping peptides with anindividual rpK ≥20 an FC ≥100 were also carried forward. Proteins that passed these thresholds in both technical replicates but were not enriched by reference samples were considered candidate autoantibodies. This workflow was repeated on a per sample level, and the results for each sample were stored separately.</p>
