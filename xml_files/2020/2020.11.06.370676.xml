<abstract>
<p id="P1">Combinatorial antibody libraries not only effectively reduce antibody discovery to a numbers game, but enable documentation of the history of antibody responses in an individual. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has prompted a wider application of this technology to meet the public health challenge of pandemic threats in the modern era. Herein, we used a combinatorial human antibody library constructed 20 years before the COVID-19 pandemic to discover three highly potent antibodies that selectively bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Compared to neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients with generally low somatic hypermutation (SHM), these antibodies contain over 13-22 SHMs, many of which are involved in specific interactions in crystal structures with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. The identification of these somatically mutated antibodies in a pre-pandemic library raises intriguing questions about the origin and evolution of human immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The global spread of SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus and cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), poses an unprecedented health crisis and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). To date, over 40 million individuals have been infected with over 1 million deaths (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covid19.who.int/">https://covid19.who.int/</ext-link>) with no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs yet approved. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the viral spike glycoprotein (S) have been shown to have excellent neutralization efficacy in previous treatment of SARS, MERS and Ebola infections, and therefore are of particular interest to combat the current pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the spike glycoprotein has been the main target for development of therapeutic mAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Most neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) bind to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein (6), although some also bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). NAbs have been derived from multiple sources, including memory B cells from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), previous SARS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), immunized humanized H2L2 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), alpaca nanobodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), single domain human antibodies from a preestablished library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), and phage display antibody libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).</p>
<p id="P3">Antibody generation is an evolutionary process of mutation and selection from the B cell repertoire. The combinatorial antibody library technology allows the same evolutionary process to be performed <italic>in vitro</italic> as it restores the โfossil recordโ of an individualโs antibody response in a test tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Random coupling of V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> sequences in scFv libraries greatly expands diversity, thereby allowing for selection of novel antibodies with high binding affinity and neutralization efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>โ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">Here, we report the selection and characterization of three potent SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, S-E6, S-B8 and S-D4, from a pre-pandemic human combinatorial antibody library established in 1999 that target the spike RBD and compete with <italic>h</italic> ACE2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).This study provides further evidence that a combinatorial antibody library with an unprecedented diversity can mimic the selection process of natural immunity, permit detection of rare spike-targeting antibodies with higher somatic hypermutation, and allow for selection of binding molecules with chemistries beyond those accessible during <italic>in vivo</italic> selection.</p>

<title>Selection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD</title>
<p id="P5">We constructed and overexpressed the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (S-RBD) linked to human Fc (<italic>h</italic> Fc) with a thrombin digestion site. After affinity purification, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD was biotinylated, immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, and panned against a combinatorial scFv antibody phage library containing 10<sup>11</sup> members generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 50 healthy donors in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). In the first two rounds, a pH 2.2 glycine-HCl solution was used to elute antibody-displaying phagemids bound to S-RBD. To enrich for antibodies that compete with <italic>h</italic> ACE2, a โfunction-guided enrichmentโ strategy was used in the third round, where recombinant <italic>h</italic> ACE2-ECD protein was used to elute S-RBD binding phagemids. After three rounds of panning, S-RBD-specific antibodies were enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and 22 unique antibodies were selected that specifically bound to S-RBD-<italic>h</italic> Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">Next-generation sequencing of the library revealed that 92% of human heavy-chain IGHV and 89% of the light-chain (IGLV and IGKV) germlines were covered, when aligned to the IMGT (international ImMunoGeneTics) database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), enabling screening of antibodies encoded by diverse germlines.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Selected anti-S-RBD antibodies retain binding to full-length spike</title>
<p id="P7">The scFv antibodies were then converted to full-length monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by cloning into a human IgG4e1 (S228P) vector. HEK293F cells were adapted for expression of combinatorial antibodies that were secreted into culture supernatants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Three of the best performing antibodies, S-B8, S-D4 and S-E6, were purified to homogeneity with yields of 8.1, 9.6 and 17 mg/L, respectively, whereas S-RBD-<italic>h</italic> Fc (IgG1) was 58 mg/L (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">3</xref>). To characterize interactions between the anti-S-RBD antibodies and full-length spike, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with either SARS-CoV-2 spike-P2A-EGFP or SARS spike-P2A-EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Flow cytometry (FACS) showed that all three antibodies in full-length-IgG4 format retained their ability to bind fulllength SARS-CoV-2 spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) with no cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) or non-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Antibody binding and competition with <italic>h</italic> ACE2-ECD to SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD</title>
<p id="P8">To assess neutralization potential of the mAbs, we investigated their ability to compete with ACE2-ECD for S-RBD binding by ELISA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). S-B8, S-D4 and S-E6 all competed strongly with <italic>h</italic> ACE2-ECD in a dose-dependent manner, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 12.9ยฑ1.5 nM, 7.1ยฑ0.4 nM, and 12.2ยฑ0.7 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Kinetic parameters of on-rate (<italic>k</italic> <sub>on</sub>), off-rate (<italic>k</italic> <sub>off</sub>), and dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) for the three antibodies were then determined by biolayer interferometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B โ 3E</xref>). S-B8, S-D4, and S-E6 showed K<sub>D</sub> values of 170 pM, 10 pM and 110 pM, respectively, with S-D4 displaying the highest affinity due to its greatly reduced off-rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">We also tested with natural mutants of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins that have been clinically associated with more severe illness and longer hospital stays. Three mutants, <italic>i.e</italic>. D215H (mut 1), S247R (mut 2) and D614G (mut 3), isolated from patients requiring treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), all displayed similar binding by FACS to S-B8, S-D4, and S-E6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>), indicating their therapeutic potential against natural SARS-CoV-2 spike mutants in severely affected patients.</p>

<title>Inhibition of cell-cell fusion induced by SARS-CoV-2 spike and <italic>h</italic> ACE2</title>
<p id="P10">The S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike mediates membrane fusion in <italic>h</italic> ACE2 expressing cells and is essential for virus infection. <italic>h</italic> ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV-2 is stronger than to the SARS-CoV spike (K<sub>D</sub> of 4.7 nM and 32 nM, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). To test whether these antibodies could inhibit spike-mediated membrane fusion of cells, we established a cell-cell fusion assay using Vero cells overexpressing <italic>h</italic> ACE2 as target cells, SARS-CoV-2 spike-P2A-EGFP transient transfected HEK293F cells as effector cells, and SARS-CoV spike-P2A-EGFP cells as a negative control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Spike-expressing HEK293F cells were mixed with S-B8, S-D4 or S-E6 at 10 nM or 1 nM just before adding to the Vero cells and syncytium formation observed 6 hours later. The SARS-CoV-2 spike induced significant cell-cell fusion as manifested by formation of larger EGFP positive cells, whereas the SARS-CoV spike barely induced syncytium formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). All three antibodies potently inhibited cell-cell fusion by SARS-CoV-2 at both 10 and 1 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). At 10 nM, S-D4 and S-E6 showed over 80% inhibition of cell-cell fusion, which was slightly greater than recombinant S-RBD; S-D4 and S-E6 were more potent than S-B8 at 1 and 10 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S7">
<title>Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and authentic virus</title>
<p id="P11">To test neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 virus, we assessed the antibodies in a pseudovirus (PSV) infection assay. Pseudotyped particles were pre-incubated with S-B8 and S-D4 (from 200 nM to 200 fM) and S-E6 (200 nM to 6.3 fM), followed by infection of HEK293T/<italic>h</italic> ACE2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Luciferase activity resulting from infection was determined at 60 h post transfection. All three antibodies showed potent neutralization against PSV infection in a dose-dependent manner that went to completion. The NT50 values of S-B8, S-D4, and S-E6 in pseudovirus neutralization were determined to be 2.2ยฑ0.2 nM, 0.48ยฑ0.03 nM, and 0.025ยฑ0.002 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) in a 1:1 interaction model with HillSlopes near 1.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). We next tested antibody neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus [BetaCoV/Australia/VIC01/2020; GenBank MT007544.1 (Victoria/01/2020)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Twenty hours after infection, intracellular virus was visualized and quantitated as percent infectivity. S-D4 and S-E6 were capable of fully blocking infection by authentic virus, while S-B8 was less potent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>) with NT<sub>50</sub> values for S-B8, S-D4 and S-E6 of 16 nM, 0.7ยฑ0.08 nM and 0.25ยฑ0.05 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

<title>S-B8 and S-E6 bind the RBD and sterically block ACE2 binding</title>
<p id="P12">To elucidate the molecular recognition of S-B8 and S-E6 for SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD, x-ray structures of Fab/RBD complexes were determined to 2.25 and 2.70 ร, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Fab S-B8 and S-E6 bind the receptor binding site (RBS) with different approach angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) and sterically compete with ACE2 for RBD binding, consistent with the competition assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). S-B8 interacts mainly using its heavy chain, which contributes 73% of the buried surface area (BSA, 737 of 1010 ร<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) and 12 of 16 polar contacts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). S-E6 predominately uses its light chain, which contributes 63% of the BSA (530 of 847 ร<sup>2</sup>) and 16 of 19 polar contacts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Light chain dominant interactions are less common in antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">IgBLAST analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) suggests S-B8 is derived from IGHV3-66, a germline that is highly similar to IGHV3-53 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). We previously reported that IGHV3-53 antibodies from convalescent patients, with minimal SHM and high potency, have two key germline motifs in CDRH1 and CDRH2 that are primarily used for recognition of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD, namely <sub>32</sub>NY<sub>33</sub> and <sub>53</sub>SGGS<sub>56</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).

<title>SHM residues form specific interactions with the RBD</title>
<p id="P15">Unlike most RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies isolated from COVID-19 patients which have minimal SHM, the antibodies derived from this combinatorial antibody library are more highly mutated; S-B8 and S-E6 contain 13 and 22 SHM residues, respectively, several of which are in the antibody paratope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>), including V<sub>H</sub> <sub>31</sub>LSH<sub>33</sub>, V<sub>H</sub> <sub>50</sub>IT<sub>51</sub>, V<sub>H</sub> <sub>53</sub>GD<sub>54</sub>, V<sub>H</sub> N<sub>56</sub>, V<sub>H</sub> D<sub>58</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> L94 in S-B8, and V<sub>H</sub>N <sub>33</sub>, V<sub>L</sub> V<sub>39</sub>, V<sub>L</sub> <sub>50</sub>FDYR<sub>53</sub> and <sub>65</sub>TR<sub>66</sub> in S-E6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6, C โ G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). In summary, several SHM residues appear to be critical for interaction with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, despite the antibody libraries being generated 20 years ago, implying the possibility that the eliciting antigen was structurally very similar to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD or there is rare but fortuitous cross-reactivity with another antigen.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P17">For over a century, serology has been used to document the origin and presence of infectious agents in patients. Classically, serology depends on the actual presence of specific antibody proteins in the blood. Their target is thought to be the infectious agent, and their presence indicates a relatively recent exposure. By contrast, antibody libraries are nucleic acid based, and include genetic material from memory cells. As such, they provide a record of all of the antibodies that an individual has made, irrespective of whether they are currently being produced. This โfossil recordโ enabled us to discover SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies induced either by previous infection or from other immune responses. Furthermore, combinatorial antibody libraries typically yield more diverse antibodies with the desired specificity. Here, the presence of many somatic mutations in the antibodies indicates a sustained drive of the immune response to continued presence of a foreign antigen, as occurs during virus replication. Thus, the modern serology detailed here suggests that one of the individuals from whom the library was generated could have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or a similar virus.</p>
<p id="P18">Although the antibody library used here was established in 1999 before the SARS and COVID-19 pandemics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), three potent neutralizing antibodies were discovered in this library. Wec et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) identified several S-RBD-directed antibodies that potently crossneutralize SARS-CoV (IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.004-0.06 ฮผg/mL to pseudovirus) and SARS-CoV-2 (IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.05-1.4 ฮผg/mL to pseudovirus) from memory B cells of a SARS donor. They also found over 80% of the low affinity SARS and SARS-2 cross-reactive antibodies reacted with one or more of the human coronavirus spike proteins, such as HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, etc., indicating SARS-CoV infection may have boosted a pre-existing memory B cell response induced by circulating HCoVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Interestingly, the three antibodies, S-B8, S-E6 and S-D4, identified in this study do not cross-react with the SARS spike protein. Moreover, autoreactivity assay in a HEp-2 cell ruled out that S-E6 and S-D4 originate from autoimmune responses, whereas S-B8 showed weak to moderate autoreactivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">A</xref> โ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">C</xref>), which was increased in the S-B8 putative germline antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9D</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">Our structural studies on S-E6 and S-B8 revealed several striking features of these combinatorial antibodies. The primary immune response to viral infection is followed by a secondary response that generates functionally better antibodies, where the binding energy can be refined by somatic hypermutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). The secondary immune response is for later encounter of the same antigen, and is the basis of vaccination. In cases of pandemics, such as SARS-CoV-2, avian influenza or Ebola virus, if the infection is not dealt with by the immune system in the first few days, the patient has a high probability of dying, and as a consequence, the immune system will not have enough time to refine the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Consistently, neutralizing antibodies isolated from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients contain only a few amino-acid mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>).that may be a result of weak B cell stimulation due to rapid viral clearance. Neutralizing antibodies from convalescent patients may then possibly not be fully refined (matured) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). In comparison, S-B8 and S-E6 exhibited much higher SHM, many of which are involved in specific interactions with SARS-CoV-2 RBD (S-RBD). Nine of 13 SHM residues in S-B8 and eight of 22 in S-E6 are located in the antibody-antigen interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). While some of these SHM residues only use their peptide backbone, others rely on specific side chains for S-RBD binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">E</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">G</xref>). Interestingly, SHM in CDRH1 of S-E6 generates a 33NY34 sequence that is similar to the 32NY33 motif in IGHV3-53/3-66 antibodies, which are the most frequent germlines used in targeting the S-RBD, indicative that the combinatorial antibody library and the maturation process can yield alternate antibody solutions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). However, it is unclear how these SHM residues could have been raised specifically to the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD, since the library was generated long before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Thus, these findings raise fascinating questions about the original antigen(s) that elicited S-B8 and S-E6.</p>
<p id="P20">The unnaturally paired antibodies in a combinatorial scFv antibody library also allow one to identify other alternative solutions with high binding affinity and efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Rare germline antibodies can then potentially be enriched during the iterative affinity panning, as for example for S-E6, which is an IGHV4-31 antibody rarely seen in neutralizing antibodies from convalescent patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>).</p>
<p id="P21">A general question posed by these studies is whether therapies based on the vast number of starting antibodies in combinatorial libraries could be more powerful than the antibodies generated <italic>in vivo</italic> during the limited time available for affinity-based antibody evolution and selection in the setting of an acute and potentially lethal infection. This also has direct relevance in the clinical setting, where a major concern in antibody therapy is the high mutation rate of viral spike proteins, which can render prior highly specific antibodies unable to recognize or neutralize mutant viruses. Mixtures of antibodies targeting distinct epitopes can be used to overcome such immune escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Antibodies identified from combinatorial libraries with high SHM and rare germline derivation, in combination with antibodies from convalescent patients, or with convalescent plasma, could provide yet another therapeutic option and a potential antidote to immune escape. Knowledge of the evolution of immune response in terms of the interactions of neutralizing antibodies and their binding epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 also provide a blueprint for next-generation vaccine design.</p>
<p id="P22">Since a complete antibody repertoire of an individual is the starting reservoir of all possibilities, one can also learn much more about the origins and evolution of an immune response against viral challenge when it is studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). The observation of highly potent neutralizing antibodies from a library of โhealthyโ donors before the COVID-19 pandemic could also indicate possible prior exposure of a donor(s) to a similar coronavirus 20 years ago. However, whether these antibodies are a consequence of background immunity remains to be elucidated. Notwithstanding, we are not unaware of the potential implications of such findings from libraries made decades ago concerning the origin of the virus currently circulating.</p>

The PSV was pre-incubated with an equal volume of different concentrations of selected antibodies (dilution factor: 3.16, from 200 nM to 200 fM for S-B8 and S-D4, 200 nM to 6.3 fM for S-E6) in DMEM at 37 ยฐC for 30 min. DMEM with or without PSV in the absence of antibodies were set as controls. After incubation, the PSV mixture was transferred to the culture plates containing HEK293T/<italic>h</italic> ACE2 cells. The DMEM media containing PSV and antibodies were replaced with fresh media after 16 h treatment, cells were incubated for an additional 48 h. PSV infection efficacy was evaluated by luciferase activity using Bright-Lumiโข Firefly Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay Kit (Beyotime, RG015M). Fifty microliter of luciferase substrate was added to each well, and the relative luminescence unit (RLU) values were measured on an Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer, Ensight).</p>

<title>Authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assay</title>
<p id="P35">The study was performed in the CL3 Facility of the University of Oxford operating under license from the HSE, on the basis of an agreed Code of Practice, Risk Assessments (under ACDP) and Standard Operating Procedures. A detailed protocol with supporting data will be prepared shortly (Harding, A, Gilbert-Jaramillo, J, et al., 2020). In brief, this rapid, high-throughput assay determines the concentration of antibody that produces a 50% reduction in infectious focus-forming units of authentic SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells, as follows. Quadruplicate, 0.5log<sub>10</sub> serial dilutions of antibody (11 steps from 100 nM to 1 pM) were pre-incubated with a fixed dose of SARS-CoV-2 (Victoria 01/2020 isolate) before incubation with Vero cells. A 1.5% carboxymethyl cellulose-containing overlay was used to prevent satellite focus formation. Twenty hours post-infection, the monolayers were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 2% Triton X-100 and stained for N antigen using mAb EY 2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). After development with a peroxidase-conjugated antibody and True Blue peroxidase substrate, infectious foci were enumerated by ELISPOT reader. Data were analyzed using four-parameter logistic regression (Hill equation) in GraphPad Prism 8.3.</p>

<title>Autoreactivity assay</title>
<p id="P36">The autoreactivity assay was performed using a HEp-2 anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) kit (Medical &amp; Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd, #4220-12CN) according to the manufacturerโs instructions. Briefly, 35 ฮผL of 0.1 mg/mL antibodies were loaded to the wells in a slide pre-seeded with fixed and permeabilized HEp-2 cells and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Positive serum from autoimmune patients and negative serum from healthy donors provided by the kit were used as controls. After washing twice (5 min each), the FITC-conjugated secondary anti-human antibody was incubated with the cells for 20 min at room temperature. The slide was then washed and mounted with a coverslip before observation on a fluorescent microscope (ZEISS, Axio Observer A1) with a 20ร objective.</p>

<title>Protein production and structure determination</title>
<p id="P37">The coding sequence for receptor binding domain (RBD; residues 319-541) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein was synthesized and cloned into a customized pFastBac vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), which was designed to fuse an N-terminal gp67 signal peptide and C-terminal His6-tag to the target protein. To express the RBD protein, a recombinant bacmid DNA was generated from the sequencing-confirmed pFastBac construct using the Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies). Baculovirus was generated by transfecting purified bacmid DNA into Sf9 cells using FuGENE HD (Promega), and subsequently used to infect suspension cultures of High Five cells (Life Technologies) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 to 10. Infected High Five cells were incubated at 28 ยฐC with shaking at 110rpm for 72 h for protein expression. RBD protein that was secreted into the supernatant, harvested, and then concentrated with a 10 kDa MW cutoff Centramate cassette (Pall Corporation). The RBD protein was purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN), followed by size exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare), and buffer exchanged into 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl using the same protocol as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Fabs were expressed in ExpiCHO cells and purified using CaptureSelect CH1-XL resin (ThermoFisher) and followed by size exclusion chromatography. The Fab/RBD complexes were formed by mixing the two components in an equimolar ratio and incubating overnight at 4 ยฐC before setting-up crystal trials. The Fab/RBD complexes were screened for crystallization using 384 conditions of the JCSG Core Suite (QIAGEN) on our robotic CrystalMation system (Rigaku) at The Scripps Research Institute. Crystals appeared in the first week, were harvested during the second week, and then flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen for X-ray diffraction experiments. Diffraction data were collected at cryogenic temperature (100 K) at beamline 23-ID-B of the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory with a beam wavelength of 1.033 ร and processed with HKL2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Diffraction data were collected from crystals grown in conditions: 20% PEG 3350, 0.2 M sodium sulfate, pH 6.6 for S-B8/RBD complex; 20% isopropanol, 20% PEG 4000, 0.1 M citrate pH 5.6 for S-E6/RBD complex. The X-ray structures were solved by molecular replacement (MR) using PHASER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>) with MR models for the RBD and Fab from PDB 7JMW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Iterative model building and refinement were carried out in COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) and PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), respectively. Epitope and paratope residues, as well as their interactions, were identified by using PISA program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) with buried surface area (BSA &gt;0 ร<sup>2</sup>) as the criterion.</p>
