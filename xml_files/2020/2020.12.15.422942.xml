It can cope with overplotting and noise, making it a versatile tool for comparing many observations. However, data binning goes awry if the same observations are used for binning (selection) and contrasting (selective analysis). This creates circularity, biasing noise components and resulting in artifactual changes in the form of regression towards the mean. Importantly, these artifactual changes are a statistical necessity. Here, we use (null) simulations and empirical repeat data to expose this flaw in the scope of post hoc analyses of population receptive field data. In doing so, we reveal that the type of data analysis, data properties, and circular data cleaning are factors shaping the appearance of such artifactual changes. We furthermore highlight that circular data cleaning and circular sorting of change scores are selection practices that result in artifactual changes even without circular data binning. These pitfalls might have led to erroneous claims about changes in population receptive fields in previous work and can be mitigated by using independent data for selection purposes. Our evaluations highlight the urgency for us researchers to make the validation of analysis pipelines standard practice. <fig id="F8" position="anchor"><caption><title>Graphical abstract</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS152196-f008"/></fig>

It is often applied to large datasets in order to prevent overplotting and control noise. As such, data binning has become commonplace in population receptive field (pRF) modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dumoulin and Knapen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008</xref>), where researchers are commonly interested in comparing visual field maps with thousands of observations between different (experimental) conditions. However, pRF modeling is only one out of several research areas where some form of differential data binning has been adopted (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gignac and Zajenkowski, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Holmes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kriegeskorte et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Preacher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Shanks, 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Although data binning can help us see an overall pattern in the face of an abundance of details, it goes awry if the same observations are used for <italic>binning</italic> (selection) and <italic>contrasting</italic> (selective analysis). This is because dipping into noise-tainted data (i.e., most data) more than once violates assumptions of independence, favoring some noise components over others and eventually biasing descriptive and inferential statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kriegeskorte et al., 2009</xref>). As such, double-dipping in data binning prevents us from – amongst other things – controlling for <italic>regression towards the mean</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Galton, 1886</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gignac and Zajenkowski, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Holmes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Makin and De Xivry, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Shanks, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Stigler, 1997</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Regression towards the mean is a statistical artifact occurring when two variables are imperfectly correlated (e.g., due to random noise<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">1</xref></sup>). In this case, extreme observations for one variable will on average be less extreme for the other<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">2</xref></sup> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Campbell and Kenny, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Galton, 1886</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Shanks, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Stigler, 1997</xref>). The magnitude of regression towards the mean tends to be higher the lower the correlation between the variables (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Campbell and Kenny, 1999</xref>, for systematic simulations, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Holmes 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Double-dipping and/or regression towards the mean are of particular concern in what is known as <italic>post hoc subgrouping</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Preacher et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>post hoc data selection</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Shanks, 2017</xref>), and <italic>extreme groups approach</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Preacher et al., 2005</xref>), all of which can be considered as subtypes of data binning. Post hoc subgrouping refers to collecting two measures, defining extreme subgroups post hoc using one measure (e.g., the lower and upper quantile), and then performing statistics on these measures for the extreme subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Preacher et al., 2005</xref>). Post hoc data selection is similar but involves only one extreme subgroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Shanks, 2017</xref>). Both of these practices are different from the extreme groups approach, where extreme subgroups are selected a priori based on one measure; that is, without collecting the whole range of the other measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Preacher et al., 2005</xref>). Here, we focus on a post hoc scenario where essentially all subgroups are considered, not just the extreme ones (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gignac and Zajenkowski, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Holmes, 2009</xref>). We label this procedure including its subtypes <italic>post hoc binning analysis</italic>.</p><p id="P6">An intuitive way to think about the link between double-dipping, regression towards the mean, and post hoc binning are repeat data. Assume we measure body weight in a population of adults twice – Today and Tomorrow (see endpoints of colorful lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>; 1<sup>st</sup> column). Further assume that any weight we measure involves a <italic>permanent</italic> and a <italic>transient</italic> component (true value + random noise). When determining Today’s and Tomorrow’s overall mean weight, all things being equal, the permanent component persists and the transient component cancels out (see red horizontal lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> column). However, this is not the case when we select adults with extremely high measurements for Today (relative to the overall mean) and compare these measurements to Tomorrow’s in the same adults by calculating the means (see lines and dots in dark green color, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> column). This is because we used Today’s measurements twice: for selection (binning) and selective analysis (comparing bin-wise means). We therefore favored Today’s noise components over Tomorrow’s. Why is this? The noise components of our selection criterion are not independent of the noise components of Today’s measurements. This renders the subgroup we selected Today on average heavier than it really is. This is not the case for Tomorrow’s measurements. As a result, Tomorrow’s measurements for this subgroup regress on average to Tomorrow’s overall mean (see dots in dark green color, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> column; for a similar example see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Stigler, 1997</xref>). This artifactual change in average weight might look like a real phenomenon, although – of course – it is not.</p><p id="P7">The analysis we just performed can be regarded as an instantiation of post hoc data selection involving one extreme subgroup. If we additionally select a subgroup of adults with extremely low measurements for Today (see lines and dots in dark brown color, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> column), regression towards the overall mean from below occurs for this subgroup. Such an approach would qualify as post hoc subgrouping involving two extreme subgroups. If we incorporate additional less extreme subgroups, we perform a full-blown post hoc binning analysis (see lines and dots in various colors, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> column), where the bin-wise means for Tomorrow’s measurements regress towards the overall mean to various degrees. Importantly, this regression artifact is a statistical necessity not hinging upon body weight data. Once we use Independent data for binning purposes (e.g., body weight measurements collected for the day after tomorrow), we break the circularity, and the regression artifact disappears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> column).</p><p id="P8">How does all of this relate to post hoc analyses involving pRF data? Imagine we conduct a retinotopic mapping experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008</xref>), where we estimate pRF position and pRF size for each voxel in the visual brain under a <italic>Baseline</italic> condition as well as a condition of <italic>Interest</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> for a single pRF). We can think of the Interest and Baseline conditions as repeat data (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Benson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Senden et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">van Dijk et al., 2016</xref>), different attention conditions (e.g, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">de Haas et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Klein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">van Es et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Vo et al., 2017</xref>), mapping sequences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Binda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Infanti and Schwarzkopf, 2020</xref>), mapping stimuli (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alvarez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Binda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Le et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Yildirim et al., 2018</xref>), magnetic field strengths (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Morgan and Schwarzkopf, 2020</xref>), scotoma conditions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Barton and Brewer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Binda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Haak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Prabhakaran et al., 2020</xref>), and pRF modeling techniques (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Carvalho et al., 2020</xref>) – to name but a few examples. Similarly, apart from visual scenarios, we can also interpret the Baseline and Interest condition as adaptation conditions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Tsouli et al., 2021</xref>), different finger movements (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Schellekens et al., 2018</xref>), or uni- and multisensory conditions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Holmes, 2009</xref>, for a discussion on non-pRF work).</p><p id="P9">As a pRF model, we adopt a 2D Gaussian, where pRF position represents the center of a pRF in visual space (the center of the Gaussian) and pRF size its spatial extent (the standard deviation of the Gaussian; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We then fit this model to the voxel-wise brain responses we measured in the retinotopic mapping experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008</xref>). To compare pRF positions in the Interest and Baseline condition voxel-by-voxel, we bin the pRF positions from both conditions according to the pRF positions from the Baseline condition. Subsequently, we quantify for each voxel the position shift from the Baseline to the Interest condition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> for a single pRF). Finally, we calculate the bin-wise mean shift. This is equivalent to calculating the bin-wise simple means for each condition and comparing them subsequently.</p><p id="P10">Either way, by adopting such a post hoc binning analysis, we essentially assume that binning voxels according to pRF positions from the Baseline condition and aggregating them subsequently for this condition ensures that bin-wise noise components are unbiased on average (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Shanks, 2017</xref>). This, however, is not the case. The underlying reason is the same as for our body weight analysis further above: we dipped into the Baseline condition twice, namely to define bins (selection) and to estimate bin-wise means for further comparison (selective analysis). This circularity leads to a favoring of noise components, skewing the bin-wise means in the Baseline condition and eventually resulting in regression towards the overall mean for the bin-wise means of the Interest condition.</p><p id="P11">Here, we expose and explore this flaw in the scope of post hoc analyses of pRF data using (null) simulations and empirical repeat data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Benson et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">2020</xref>). Unlike empirical data, simulations allowed us to separate true values from noise components. They also provided an excellent test bed for determining that the type of data analysis (change scores or simple scores, 1D or 2D binning, equidistant or decile binning), data properties (presence or absence of heteroskedasticity or a true effect) and additional circular selection practices (presence or absence of circular data cleaning) influence the appearance of the regression artifact. Moreover, they allowed us to pinpoint that circular data cleaning and circular sorting of change scores represent selection practices that yield artifactual changes even without circular data binning. Unlike empirical data from different experimental conditions, repeat data permitted us to assume a null effect between conditions, allowing for more straightforward conclusions about any systematic differences we might observe.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Post hoc binning using simulated data</title><p id="P12">For the post hoc binning analysis involving simulations, we used an empirical V1 visual field map of a single human participant as a basic data distribution. This map originated from a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment (fMRI) aimed at mapping pRFs under different attention conditions using a drifting bar stimulus (2 sessions each with 4 runs per condition). One of these conditions was selected for simulation purposes. The maximal eccentricity of the mapping area subtended 8.5 degrees of visual angle (dva). We fit a 2D Gaussian function to preprocessed fMRI responses projected onto the cortical surface. For each vertex (gray matter node on the cortical surface), we obtained 6 estimates: pRF position (<italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub> coordinates), pRF size (<italic>σ</italic>), pRF baseline (<italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub>), pRF amplitude (<italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub>), and goodness-of-fit (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>). We first smoothed the resulting parameter maps and delineated V1 hemifield maps manually (for more details, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary methods, 1. Retinotopic mapping experiment</xref>). We then pooled the <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub> coordinates across V1 hemifield maps and removed empty data points.</p><sec id="S4"><label>2.1.1</label><title>1D post hoc binning analysis on eccentricity</title><p id="P13">To uncover the regression artifact, we first simulated a simplified contrast scenario with a null effect. To this end, we disturbed the <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub> coordinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) 200 times with random Gaussian noise (<italic>SD</italic> = 2 dva). We repeated this to generate a <italic>Baseline, Interest</italic>, and <italic>Independent</italic> condition. We then converted the <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub> coordinates to eccentricity values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), as is often done in the pRF literature (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref> for interpretational difficulties with eccentricity when it comes to position shifts). This resulted in a gamma-like eccentricity distribution. Lastly, we binned the eccentricity values in the Baseline and Interest condition according to the eccentricity values of any of the 3 conditions using deciles and calculated the bin-wise means<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3">3</xref></sup>. A schematic workflow of this simulated 1D post hoc binning analysis can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. Bin-wise eccentricity means were visualized as a color-coded scatter plot along with individual observations per bin and marginal histograms (bin width = 0.5 dva) reflecting the simulated distributions.</p><p id="P14">Building upon the simulated null effect, we performed the 1D post hoc binning analysis on 4 more simulation cases: a null effect with condition cross-thresholding based on the Baseline condition, a null effect with condition cross-thresholding based on both the Baseline and Interest condition, a null effect with eccentricity-dependent noise, and a true effect. We use the term ’condition cross-thresholding’ to refer to the pair-wise or list-wise deletion of data points across experimental conditions (see below). The selected simulation cases reflect analysis practices and data properties we consider characteristic of pRF studies. For all simulation cases, the Independent condition consisted of a second draw (resample) of the Baseline condition. Moreover, to ensure reproducibility and comparability, all simulation cases were based on the same seed for random number generation. However, our conclusions do not depend on the choice of seed for random number generation.</p><p id="P15">For the simulation cases involving condition cross-thresholding, we removed simulated observations falling outside a certain eccentricity range (≥ 0 and ≤ 6 dva) in the Baseline or Baseline and Interest condition from all conditions (i.e., Baseline, Interest, and Independent). For the simulation case involving eccentricity-dependent noise, we used a small standard deviation (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.25 dva) of random Gaussian noise to disturb empirical observations with smaller eccentricities (≥ 0 and &lt; 3 dva) and a larger standard deviation (<italic>SD</italic> = 2 dva) to disturb empirical observations with larger eccentricities (≥ 3 dva). For the simulation case involving a true effect, we induced a radial increase in eccentricity of 2 dva in the Interest condition.</p><p id="P16">Apart from simple bin-wise means, we performed the 1D post hoc binning analysis also on change scores. The change scores were obtained by subtracting individual simulated observations or means in the Baseline condition from those in the Interest condition. Both simple means and mean change scores have been used for post hoc binning in previous pRF studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Barton and Brewer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Binda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Carvalho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Haak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Yildirim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">de Haas et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Prabhakaran et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Tsouli et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, we repeated the binning analysis using equidistant instead of decile binning. To this end, we used a constant bin width of 1.75 dva and an overall binning range of 0 to 19.25 dva eccentricity. Unlike equidistant binning, decile binning ensures a roughly equal number of data points in each bin, which facilitates the interpretation of results. However, we consider equidistant binning as the most common binning type in the pRF literature. For both the change score analysis and equidistant binning, we used the simulation case involving a null effect as a data basis.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.1.2</label><title>2D post hoc binning analysis on x<sub>0</sub> and y<sub>0</sub></title><p id="P17">Apart from the 1D binning analysis on eccentricity, we also conducted a 2D binning analysis on the simulated <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub> values.

Subsequently, we binned the eccentricity values of either condition according to eccentricity values in the Baseline condition using deciles and calculated bin-wise means. The bin-wise means from both conditions were plotted against one another along with individual observations per bin and marginal histograms reflecting the simulated distributions<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> column). Since there was no true difference between conditions, the bin-wise means should lie on the identity line. Contrary to this prediction, they systematically diverged from the identity line. Strikingly, when using the Interest instead of the Baseline condition for binning, this systematic pattern of divergence flipped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> column). This bidirectionality is a typical sign of regression towards the mean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Campbell and Kenny, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Shanks, 2017</xref>) and due to circularity. This leads to asymmetric bins (see bin-wise ranges of observations for the Baseline and Interest condition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns) and on average biases bin-wise noise components for the condition that was used for contrasting and binning (henceforth <italic>circular</italic> condition). On the contrary, for the other condition (henceforth <italic>non-circular</italic> condition), this is not the case.</p><p id="P23">The skew in average noise renders the bin-wise eccentricity means of the circular condition more extreme, especially for lower and higher decile bins. As a result, the bin-wise eccentricity means for the non-circular condition regress – by statistical necessity – to the overall mean<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN5">5</xref></sup> for this condition (red crosshair); that is, they are less extreme. This becomes clear when looking at the different ranges of bin-wise means for the circular and non-circular conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns). If the Interest condition is then contrasted to the Baseline condition, a mean increase in eccentricity for lower deciles and a mean decrease for higher deciles or vice versa occurs, depending on whether the data are binned on the Baseline or Interest condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns). This artifact arises because we did not always use independent conditions for binning and contrasting; that is, conditions with independent noise components.</p><p id="P24">Apart from simple means (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Binda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Carvalho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Haak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Yildirim et al., 2018</xref>), post hoc binning analyses have also been performed on change scores in previous pRF studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Barton and Brewer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">de Haas et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Prabhakaran et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Tsouli et al., 2021</xref>). Here, the difference between the Interest and Baseline condition is typically plotted against the binning (i.e., circular) condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, A., 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns). Consequently, the bin-wise means now regress to the overall mean of the change score distribution (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gignac and Zajenkowski, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Holmes, 2009</xref>) and bin-wise noise components are neither unbiased for the change scores nor the binning conditions. This is because the noise components of the change scores are not independent of those in either binning condition. What is more, scatter plots of change scores disguise important aspects readily available with scatter plots of simple scores. Specifically, they prevent us from directly appreciating the larger bin-wise range of eccentricity means for the circular as compared to the non-circular condition (see explanations further above and compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, A., and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns). This makes it difficult to spot the source of the problem graphically when only looking at a single plot. On the other hand, since both the <italic>x</italic>- and <italic>y</italic>-axis feature the Baseline or Interest condition and either of these conditions are used for data binning, the act of double-dipping becomes much more obvious.</p><p id="P25">Critically, scattering change scores against one of the conditions involved in change score calculation also results in a biased visualization of individual change scores. This is because the noise components of the variables on the <italic>x</italic>- and <italic>y</italic>-axis are not independent, rendering this sorting procedure circular. When plotting individual change scores against the Baseline condition, this results in a downwards sloping data cloud, suggesting an effect although there is none (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, A., 1<sup>st</sup> column). Why does this happen? Owing to noise, the change scores are more likely to be positive for lower Baseline eccentricities and negative for higher Baseline eccentricities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, A., 1<sup>st</sup> column). When plotting individual change scores against the Interest condition, the reverse is true (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, A., 2<sup>nd</sup> column). This means visualizing or analyzing the data using such a circular sorting procedure is misleading irrespective of circular data binning (for more details on circular data sorting, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Holmes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kriegeskorte et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P26">The fact that circular sorting of change scores and circular data binning are separate issues can be further appreciated by imagining what happens when we plot the individual change scores against the Baseline condition, but bin on the Interest condition (instead of the Baseline condition as before). In this case, the individual change scores are sorted in a way (downwards sloping; just like in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, A., 1<sup>st</sup> column) that is opposite to the trend implied by the bin-wise means (upwards sloping).</p><p id="P27">How the regression artifact induced by circular data binning manifests can change when data are thresholded across conditions, that is, deleted in a pair- or list-wise fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, B. and C., 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns). In fact, in the event of condition cross-thresholding, noise components are reshaped and might thus not necessarily be unbiased on average even for the non-circular condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, B., 2<sup>nd</sup> column as well as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, C., 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns). Condition cross-thresholding is common practice in the pRF literature where data are cleaned across conditions according to eccentricity, goodness-of-fit (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>), pRF size, missing data or other criteria from one or multiple conditions.</p><p id="P28">Here, we cross-thresholded the eccentricity values in the Interest and Baseline condition using the eccentricity values from the Baseline condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, B., 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns) or both the Baseline and Interest condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, C., 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns). This cross-thresholding procedure is circular whenever the noise components of the data used for cross-thresholding are not independent of the noise components of the data involved in contrasting. This is evidently true even without circular data binning. As such, the reason why the noise components in our cross-thresholding scenarios are sometimes biased even for the non-circular condition<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN6">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, B., 2<sup>nd</sup> column as well as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, C., 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns) is because we introduced another layer of circularity.</p><p id="P29">The fact that circular cross-thresholding and circular data binning are somewhat distinct but also highly similar issues can, for instance, be appreciated when comparing the overall instead of the bin-wise means. Without circular cross-thresholding, the overall mean in both the Baseline and Interest condition amounts to 4.66 dva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, A., 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns). With circular cross-thresholding based on the Baseline condition, the overall mean in the Baseline condition amounts to 3.40 dva, whereas it amounts to 3.97 dva in the Interest condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, B., 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns). Here, the introduced bias for the Baseline condition can be appreciated by directly comparing the overall means in the Baseline and Interest condition. With circular cross-thresholding based on both the Baseline and Interest condition, the overall means in the Baseline and Interest condition amount to 3.24 dva and 3.25 dva, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, C., 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns). Here, the introduced bias for the Baseline and Interest condition can be appreciated by comparing the overall means in these conditions to the overall mean of an Independent condition (retest of the Baseline condition) that was cross-thresholded based on both the Baseline and Interest condition. This overall mean amounts to 3.66. We will return to the usefulness of such an Independent condition further below (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">3.2. Potential mitigation strategies</xref>). In any case, circular cross-thresholding biases the overall means as compared to when no such thresholding is performed.</p><p id="P30">Importantly, however, only circular cross-thresholding based on the Baseline condition results in artifactual differences between the overall means. Why is this? Given that the level of noise in the Interest and Baseline condition was equivalent (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S3">2.1. Post hoc binning using simulated data</xref>), circular cross-thresholding based on both the Baseline and Interest condition on average skewed the noise components for these conditions similarly, resulting in biased overall means, but a valid difference of around 0 between them. However, as for empirical data, the assumption of equivalent noise levels can probably only be safely made for repeat data (and even then, this needs to be justifiable). In any case, conceptually, circular cross-thresholding without data binning can be regarded as a single bin or region-of-interest analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kriegeskorte et al., 2009</xref>), essentially constituting another subtype of a post hoc binning analysis.</p><p id="P31">The appearance of the regression artifact arising from circular data binning can further-more change when the level of noise depends on eccentricity – a property better known as <italic>heteroskedasticity</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, A., 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Holmes, 2009</xref>). In fact, the case of eccentricity-dependent noise shows that the artifact can include some clear regression <italic>away</italic> from the mean – a phenomenon referred to as <italic>egression</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN7">7</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, A., 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns; see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Campbell and Kenny, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Schwarz and Reike, 2018</xref>). Eccentricity-dependent noise might arise from fitting errors that differ across visual space. This could be due to partial stimulation of pRFs (especially near the edge of the stimulated mapping area), higher variability in pRF position estimates for wider pRFs as well as fluctuations in the signal-to-noise ratio of brain responses from the central to the peripheral visual field or as a result of manipulating attention.</p><p id="P32">The regression artifact due to circular data binning also manifested when simulating a true effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, B., 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns). The same was true for equidistant binning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, C., 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns), which is frequently applied in the pRF literature. However, unlike decile binning (which we used further above), equidistant binning resulted in a lower number of observations for higher equidistant bins (due to the gamma-like eccentricity distribution; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, C., 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns). Consequently, for higher equidistant bins, the skew in average noise for the circular condition was generally larger here (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, C., and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns). Similarly, for higher equidistant bins, noise components were not always unskewed on average for the non-circular condition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, C., 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns, where the pattern of bin-wise means is not entirely mirror-symmetric). This is because for random noise to be unskewed on average, the number of observations needs to be sufficiently large.</p><p id="P33">Critically, both true effects and equidistant binning can substantially modify the appearance of the regression artifact. Along with circular condition cross-thresholding and eccentricity-dependent noise, this teaches us an important lesson: the regression artifact can take pretty much <italic>any</italic> form<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P34">For all presented simulation cases (null effect, null effect with cross-thresholding or eccentricity-dependent noise, and true effect), the regression artifact likewise manifested for another kind of binning analysis, namely, when binning the <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub> values according to both eccentricity and polar angle (i.e., 2D segments) and computing shift vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2-S5</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> row). Here, the bin-wise means regressed towards and away from the overall means of the <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub> distribution. The calculation of shift vectors is not uncommon in pRF studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Klein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">van Es et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Vo et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P35">Notably, for empirical repeat data from the HCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Benson et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">2020</xref>), both kinds of binning analyses produced patterns consistent with the regression artifact (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6-S13</xref>). This establishes its practical relevance. Moreover, some of us recently retracted an article on attention-induced differences in pRF position and size in V1-V3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">de Haas et al., 2014</xref>) because an in-house reanalysis suggested that circular post hoc binning along with circular condition cross-thresholding and heteroskedasticity yielded artifactual results in the form of egression from the mean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">de Haas et al., 2020</xref>). In this case, the apparent significant effect was an increase in eccentricity and pRF size in the Interest vs Baseline condition (expressed as change scores) for eccentricity bins (based on the Baseline condition) in the middle of the tested range. Importantly, the inferential statistical analysis in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">de Haas et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">2020</xref>) was based on unbinned data, and thus the overall means.

It is also possible that only one but not the other produces artifactual changes. This potential divergence adds another layer of complexity to the issues we discussed here.</p><p id="P37">Taken together, the heterogeneity in manifestation we exposed here makes it hard to spot the regression artifact by visual inspection alone and highlights its dependency on the type of analysis, additional circular selection practices as well as exact distributional properties of the data at hand (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Campbell and Kenny, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Holmes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Schwarz and Reike, 2018</xref>, for similar points). Importantly, circular data binning is only but one pitfall resulting in artifactual changes. Other pitfalls, such as circular sorting of change scores and circular cross-thresholding are equally problematic.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><label>3.2</label><title>Potential mitigation strategies</title><p id="P38">How can we omit double-dipping and control for regression towards the mean? We could, for instance, use an Independent condition for binning (such as repeat data or odd or even runs for the Baseline condition; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, A.-C., 3<sup>rd</sup> column as well as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2-S5</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> row) or an anatomical criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kriegeskorte et al., 2009</xref>), such as cortical distance or anatomical atlases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Benson et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">2014</xref>). This way, noise components should be unbiased on average in both the Baseline and Interest condition.</p><p id="P39">Unbiased bin-wise noise components are of course less likely for sparsely populated bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, C., 3<sup>rd</sup> column as well as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2-S5</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> row), which can be captured by quantifying uncertainty. Critically, however, for scatter plots of change scores, bin-wise noise components are not unbiased for the Independent binning condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, A., 3<sup>rd</sup> column). The reason for this is the same as before: non-independence of noise components. Thus, only the bin-wise change scores can be readily interpreted here. Moreover, given that cross-thresholding reshapes noise components, they might not be unbiased when binning on an Independent condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, B. and C., 3<sup>rd</sup> column as well as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2-S3</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> row). The same can evidently also happen with an anatomical criterion if the Baseline and/or the Interest condition are subjected to cross-thresholding. Consequently, unless cross-thresholding can be omitted or demonstrated to be unbiased (see below for further considerations), an Independent condition might not be a safe option.</p><p id="P40">Of note, for the discussed cross-thresholding case where circular cross-thresholding was performed based on both the Interest and Baseline condition, binning on the Independent condition ensured that the bin-wise noise components for the Interest and Baseline condition are similarly biased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, C., 3<sup>rd</sup> column). As mentioned earlier, this is because cross-thresholding of this sort biases the noise components in the Baseline and Interest condition similarly (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">3.1. The many faces of regression towards the mean and other problems</xref>) and binning on an Independent condition introduces no further biases. Moreover, given that the noise components of both the Interest and Baseline condition were independent of those in the Independent condition, cross-thresholding did not bias the noise components in the Independent condition. As such, although the simple bin-wise means in the Baseline and Interest condition are biased, the difference between those amounts to around 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, C., 3<sup>rd</sup> column).</p><p id="P41">Apart from binning on an Independent condition, we could use analyses without binning that control for circularity and regression artifacts or effects could be evaluated against appropriate null distributions that take into account all statistical dependencies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Holmes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kriegeskorte et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, errors-in-variables models (e.g., Deming regression) might be an option. Such models account for the noise in both the Baseline and Interest condition as well as for the fact that we often have no clear separation between independent and dependent variables in post hoc analyses of pRF data. However, as with any statistical approach, the underlying assumptions need to be checked carefully.</p><p id="P42">Just like circular data binning, circular sorting of change scores can be counteracted by plotting individual change scores against an Independent condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, A., 3<sup>rd</sup> column). Similarly, one way to deal with circular cross-thresholding might be to cross-threshold all data according to an Independent condition/the Independent binning condition. However, condition-specific systematic errors, such as artifacts and outliers, might survive such independent data cleaning. As such, the usage of robust estimators might be advisable. Future research is necessary to evaluate this point more comprehensively.</p><p id="P43">A combination of the discussed approaches might prove most fruitful. Regardless of the specific mitigation strategy, we believe that in light of the many layers of complexity in our analysis pipelines, we need to make it common practice to perform sanity checks using (null) simulations and empirical repeat data. This is because such sanity checks provide a means for us researchers to ensure the validity of our analysis procedures.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><label>3.3</label><title>The bigger picture</title><p id="P44">Circular post hoc binning analyses come in many flavors (e.g., centroids, shift vectors, eccentricity differences, <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub> differences, and 1D or 2D bins) and cannot be assumed to be restricted to pRF position estimates. For instance, partial stimulation of pRFs likely results in heteroskedasticity and positively correlated errors for pRF size and position. This would, for instance, bias bin-wise pRF size vs pRF position or pRF size vs pRF size comparisons where binning is based on non-independent eccentricity values. Likewise, fitting errors due to partial stimulation should be more pronounced whenever pRF size is larger, leading to stronger artifactual effects (for simulations using different levels of noise see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Holmes, 2009</xref>). The same is to be expected based on a higher variability in pRF position estimates for wider pRFs. These factors might potentially explain why changes in pRF position and/or size have been reported to be tendentially larger in higher-level areas where pRFs are wider (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Barton and Brewer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">de Haas et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Klein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">van Es et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P45">Moreover, the distribution of errors likely depends on the toolbox that was used for fitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Lerma-Usabiaga et al., 2020</xref>), making it hard to generalize across studies. And lastly, delineations of visual areas in post hoc binning analyses should ideally also be based upon independent criteria as this is where selection starts. Importantly, the intricacies we just discussed do not only apply to circular data binning, but also circular sorting of change scores and circular condition cross-thresholding.</p><p id="P46">The application of circular data binning, circular sorting of change scores, and/or circular cross-thresholding in the pRF literature might have led to spurious claims about changes in pRFs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">de Haas et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">2020</xref>, for an example). Consequently, we encourage researchers who used such procedures to check for the severity of biases in their analyses by running adequate simulations and reanalyzing the original data wherever possible.

For the present purposes, it appeared important to settle on a level allowing for clear exposition. Moreover, as alluded to further above (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">1. Introduction</xref>), unless there is a perfect correlation between two variables (and thus no random noise), double-dipping and/or regression towards or away from the mean likely pose issues to post hoc analyses involving a range of selection procedures, such as data binning, cleaning, and sorting.</p><p id="P48">To fully parallel our simulations, the analyses of the HCP data would have benefited from binning on an Independent condition, that is, a second set of repeat data.

Our analyses do not capture these specificities. However, there is no reason to believe that they would alleviate the expression of the regression artifact. The primary component that might change when applying such procedures is the location of the overall mean and the shape of the data distribution and thus how exactly the artifact manifests (for preliminary analyses, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Stoll et al., 2022</xref>). Of course, if data points are not mirrored based on an Independent condition but, for instance, the Baseline condition, data mirroring in combination with post hoc binning and/or circular cross-thresholding might favor noise components in multiple ways. Importantly, circular data mirroring is also problematic for analyses that do not involve any circular data binning and/or circular cross-thresholding, as are other procedures, such as circular data weighting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kriegeskorte et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="conclusions"><label>4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P50">Without doubt, circularity and regression towards the mean are thorny and omnipresent problems that can manifest subtly and diversely (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ball et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Barnett et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Campbell and Kenny, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Eriksson and Häggström, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gignac and Za jenkowski, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Holmes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kilner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kriegeskorte et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Preacher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Shanks, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Stigler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Vul et al., 2009</xref>).
