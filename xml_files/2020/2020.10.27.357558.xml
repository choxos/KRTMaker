<abstract>
<p id="P3">During the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in humans a D614G substitution in the spike (S) protein emerged and became the predominant circulating variant (S-614G) of the COVID-19 pandemic<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. However, whether the increasing prevalence of the S-614G variant represents a fitness advantage that improves replication and/or transmission in humans or is merely due to founder effects remains elusive. Here, we generated isogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants and demonstrate that the S-614G variant has (i) enhanced binding to human ACE2, (ii) increased replication in primary human bronchial and nasal airway epithelial cultures as well as in a novel human ACE2 knock-in mouse model, and (iii) markedly increased replication and transmissibility in hamster and ferret models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our data show that while the S-614G substitution results in subtle increases in binding and replication <italic>in vitro</italic>, it provides a real competitive advantage <italic>in vivo</italic>, particularly during the transmission bottle neck, providing an explanation for the global predominance of S-614G variant among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses currently circulating.</p>

<p id="P4">In late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup> and rapidly developed into the COVID-19 pandemic. By the end of September 2020, the worldwide death toll had passed one million people with more than 37 million infections<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. Symptoms are usually mild; however in more vulnerable groups, such as aged individuals or people with comorbidities, SARS-CoV-2 can cause life-threatening pneumonia<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the interaction of the spike glycoprotein (S) and the host cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. S is a homotrimeric class I fusion protein consisting of two subunits S1 and S2, which are separated by a protease cleavage site. The S1 forms a globular head and is essential for receptor binding, while S2 is responsible for fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes. During the entry process, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) within the S1 subunit binds ACE2, generating conformational changes in the S2 subunit, which facilitates virus internalization<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. S-D614G is a protein variant containing a substitution in the S protein outside of the RBD and is thought to cause a conformational change. It is believed to weaken the interprotomer latch in the S protein trimer between the S1 and S2 domains and causes a more “open” conformation that improves ACE2 binding and increases the probability of infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup> Over the course of the pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 S-614G variant rapidly superseded the parental S-614D variant in frequency to become globally dominant. Such a shift in genotype frequency might be caused by a founder effect following introduction into a highly interconnected population. However, there are multiple lines of evidence suggesting that the S-614G variant may confer a fitness advantage compared to S-614D: increased frequency of S-614G in distinct geographical regions, initial experimental evidence with pseudotyped lentiviruses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup> or vesicular stomatitis viruses <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>, and reports of the S-614G variant being associated with higher viral loads<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. To better address the role that the S-D614G substitution has played in the dissemination and predominance of this SARS-CoV-2 variant during the COVID-19 pandemic, we characterized S protein binding to human ACE2 (hACE2) and replication kinetics <italic>in vitro</italic>, and evaluated infection and transmission dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic> using three different animal models. The data show that the S-D614G substitution confers increased binding to the hACE2 receptor and increased replication in primary human airway epithelial cultures. Moreover, comparison of recombinant isogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants demonstrates that S-614G substitution provides competitive advantage in a hACE2 knock-in mouse model, and markedly increases replication and transmission in Syrian hamster and ferret models.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 S-614G binds to hACE2 more efficiently</title>
<p id="P5">To determine whether the S-D614G substitution directly affects the binding between the S and hACE2, we first used the biolayer interferometry (BLI) technology to quantify their biding affinity. Because the S1 component of the S is the domain that interacts with receptor, a reductionist approach was used to determine if the D614G played a role in hACE2 binding by monomeric S1 proteins. Pre-biotinylated polyhistidine-tagged S1 proteins with 614D or 614G (S1-614D and S1-614G, respectively) both bind efficiently to hACE2; however, S1-614G (KD = 1.65 nM) showed about 2-fold higher affinity than S1-614D (KD = 3.74 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). When the full-length monomeric spike ectodomain was used in the assay, the S-614G protein also showed higher affinity to hACE2 than S-614D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Figure 1A</xref>). The enhanced binding to hACE2 protein rendered by the S-D614G substitution also resulted in enhanced S1 binding to Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells expressing exogenous hACE2 (BHK-hACE2) in a different binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Figure 1B</xref>). We incubated polyhistidine-tagged S1-614D or S1-614G proteins with BHK-hACE2 and analyzed the binding efficiency of S1 to the cells using flow cytometry. At the same S1 concentration, more S1-614G bound to the BHK-hACE2 cells than S1-614D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Figure 1B</xref>). Recombinant S1 constructs that express two S1 molecules attached to an IgG carboxyl-terminus were generated to further evaluate the impact the S-D614G substitution. An even more striking difference was observed with the pair of Fc(IgG)-tagged S1-614D or S1-614G proteins used for binding studies instead of polyhistidine-tagged S1 constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Increased replication of SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> virus in primary human epithelial cells</title>
<p id="P6">To assess the impact of S-614G in the context of virus infection we generated an isogenic D614G virus pair based on our reverse genetics system for SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. The molecular clone is based on the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate possessing the S-614D variant (SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614D</sup>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. The sequence of the isogenic S-614G variant was engineered to have an A to G nucleotide change at position 23,403 to encode a glycine at the S protein position 614. The identity of the resulting recombinant SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> variant was confirmed by full-length sequencing from the passage 1 virus stock that was used for subsequent experiments. Replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614D</sup> and SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> in Vero E6 cells marginally differed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). We assessed replication kinetics in primary human nasal epithelial (hNE) and primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NhBE) cultures that were grown under air-liquid interface conditions and resemble the pseudostratified epithelial lining of the human respiratory epithelium. No significant difference in the primary hNE cells following infection of SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614D</sup> or SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> at 33°C, the temperature of the nasal epithelium was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> displayed elevated titers in primary NhBE cells at temperatures of 33°C, 37°C and 39°C, that resemble temperatures of the upper and lower respiratory tract, or fever, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Similarly, infection kinetics of NhBE cells with natural isolates SARS-CoV-2/USA-WA1/2020 (USA-WA1, S-614D) or SARS-CoV-2/Massachusetts/VPT1/2020 (MA/VPT1, S-614G) revealed increased titers for the S-614G variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Figure 1C</xref>). To refine this analysis, we performed competition experiments by infecting hNE and NhBE cultures with a mixture of both viruses, SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614D</sup> and SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup>, at defined ratios. In both primary human respiratory culture systems, the ratio of 614G:614D shifted in favor of SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> during five or eight days of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Figure 1D</xref>). Collectively, these results show that the D614G change in the S protein is associated with enhanced hACE2 binding and increased replication in primary human airway epithelial models of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. To evaluate the relative fitness of the SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> variant <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated knock-in mice expressing the authentic SARS-CoV-2 human receptor <italic>hACE2</italic> under the endogenous regulatory elements of the mouse <italic>Ace2</italic> gene (hACE2-KI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 2A</xref>). Eight heterozygous female mice were inoculated intranasally (i.n.) in a competition experiment with a mixture of both viruses, SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614D</sup> and SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup>, using 1x10<sup>5</sup> plaque forming unit (PFU) of each variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Viral RNA loads were monitored daily in oropharyngeal swabs and in various organs and tissues by real-time PCR at days 2 and 4 post infection (p.i.). No significant body weight loss in hACE2-KI mice up to day 4 p.i. were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 2B</xref>). Longitudinal analysis of daily oropharyngeal swabs revealed efficient virus replication in the upper respiratory tract of hACE2-KI mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Accordingly, tissue samples collected at day 2 and 4 p.i. revealed high viral RNA loads in the nasal conchae, lungs and olfactory bulbs and at lower levels in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 2C</xref>). Low to undetectable levels of virus were observed in spleen, small intestine, kidneys and feces (data not shown). No overt pathological lesions were found in the lungs of hACE2-KI compared to wild-type mice at day 2 and 4 p.i. (Extended Data Table 1, 2). Sequencing analysis of the oropharyngeal swabs revealed a net advantage for the SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> variant over SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614D</sup> variant in most animals and time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). In the organs, a similar replication advantage was found for the SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate increased replication of SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of the expression of the authentic human receptor <italic>hACE2</italic>.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> displays increased replication and transmissibility in hamsters and ferrets</title>
<p id="P8">Hamsters are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and develop disease that closely resembles pan-respiratory, fulminant COVID-19 disease in humans<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>

However, both animal models efficiently reflect transmission events by direct contact. By using a competition experimental approach <italic>in vivo</italic>, as shown for the hACE2-KI mice, numerical dominance of one recombinant variant should be the result of relevant advantages.</p>
<p id="P9">Therefore, direct “one-to-one” transmission experiments were conducted. Six donor Syrian hamsters were inoculated i.n. at equal ratios with SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614D</sup> and SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> using 1x10<sup>4.77</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/animal (calculated from back titration of the original material). Analysis of the mixed inoculum by amplicon sequencing and absolute quantification using allele specific locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes confirmed similar viral RNA ratios of both variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). At 24 hours after inoculation, each donor was cohoused with one naive hamster. Weight changes, as well as clinical signs were monitored and nasal washes were collected daily. Viral RNA load in nasal washings, and changes in body weight, were congruent to previously published data<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">B</xref>). Analysis of the viral RNA sequence composition of nasal washings revealed a prominent shift towards SARS-CoV-2S-614G within 48 hours post inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Transmission efficiency was one hundred percent, and analysis of the RNA sequence composition showed that the SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> variant represented &gt;90% of the viral RNA in the contact animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In summary, hamsters inoculated with both variants, SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614D</sup> and SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup>, in an equal ratio, transmit primarily SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup>.</p>
<p id="P10">To exclude possible differences in hamster’s affinity to one variant or divergence of kinetics of the replication cycle six hamsters were inoculated i.n. with either SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614D</sup> (1x 10<sup>5.1</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/animal, calculated from back titration of the original material), or SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> (10<sup>4.5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/animal, calculated from back titration of the original material) and were monitored for four consecutive days. No marked differences in body weights, titers of shed virus, or viral loads in respiratory tract tissue were observed between the two groups in the acute phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figure 3C</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">E</xref>). For both variants, highest genome loads were found in the nasal conchae, followed by pulmonary tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figure 3E</xref>). These observations confirm that in the case of SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614D</sup> or SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> infections, the S-D614G substitution does not seem crucial for clinical outcomes, which again underscores the hamster as a highly sensitive disease model. Rather, the advantage of the SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> variant over the SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614D</sup> has to be adequately large to fully suppress the latter variant within a single <italic>in vivo</italic> replication cycle, which accurately reflects the evolution of SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> in humans during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p id="P11">Since ferrets are a good transmission model <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>, we performed a direct “one-to-one” transmission experiment using an equal mixture of the isogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants. Six animals were intranasally inoculated with the mix of SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614D</sup> and SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> (10<sup>5.4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/animal calculated from back titration of the original material). For all six inoculated ferrets SARS-CoV-2-infection could be confirmed, and both body weight changes and viral RNA loads in nasal washings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">B</xref>) reflected published data<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. In five of the six inoculated ferrets, SARS-CoV-2’ became the dominant variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurred in four of the six ferret pairs, and in each pair with successful transmission the S-614G variant prevailed over S-614D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). All amplicon sequencing data of the ferret samples were also retested by absolute quantification using allele specific locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes and digital PCR analysis.</p>
<p id="P12">Notably, the donor of pair one with the dominance of SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614D</sup> did not transmit despite a high viral genome peak load of more than 10 million copies per ml. In contrast, the lack of transmission in pair 4 where SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> became the dominant variant is connected to peak viral loads of below 500,000 genome copies per ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). In summary, the competition experiment in ferrets revealed that the SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> variant preferentially infected and replicated in five out of six inoculated animals, and transmission events succeeded exclusively with the SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> variant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P13">SARS-CoV-2 evolution in humans has been proposed to be a non-deterministic process and virus diversification results mainly from random genetic drift, suggesting that there is no strong selective pressure on SARS-CoV-2 in its adaptation to humans<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. However, since the introduction of the S-D614G change in early 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 S-614G variant has become globally prevalent<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. A founder effect and a structural change of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been proposed as driving forces establishing the S-614G prevalence. Previous structural studies and the use of pseudotyped viruses have put forward the idea that the S-614G variant may confer increased infectivity, which could be a result of increased “open” RBD conformation for receptor binding as suggested by one study or increased S stability as suggested by another study<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. In contrast to those studies that used recombinant trimeric S, we used a reductionist approach to eliminate the complications due to the “open” or “closed” RBD conformations in trimeric S. We found the S1 or the monomeric S ectodomain with D614G substitution had increased affinity to hACE2, which may be another mechanism underlying the increased replication and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant.</p>
<p id="P14">Studies that employed isogenic SARS-CoV-2 D614G variants to assess the phenotype in the context of a SARS-CoV-2 infection were only very recently reported in preprints <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. Both studies conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 S-614G variant shows increased replication <italic>in vitro</italic> and one study observed earlier transmission in a hamster model. We extended these studies by exploiting various <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> infection models of SARS-CoV-2, including primary NhBE and hNE cultures, a novel hACE2 knock-in mouse model, a hamster model, and a ferret model. Importantly, throughout these experimental systems we consistently observed an increased fitness of SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> over SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614D</sup> by applying amplicon sequencing techniques as well as allele specific absolute quantification for confirmation. The advantage provided by the D614G change becomes most prominent in competition and transmission experiments in hamsters and ferrets and must therefore be considered as a driving force leading to the global dominance of the SARS-CoV-2 614G variant.</p>
<p id="P15">Our data are also in agreement with reported functional changes conferred by the D614G substitution in the S protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup> and infections studies using pseudotyped viruses demonstrating increased infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. Although our studies establish a phenotype of increased replication and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 S-614G variant, there is no evidence for a phenotypic change in pathogenicity in an animal model. This is important to state, because infection with the SARS-CoV-2 S-614G variant is not associated with the development of severe COVID-19 in humans<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P16">The ongoing pandemic will likely give rise to additional SARS-CoV-2 variants that may display phenotypic changes and further adaptations to humans. The ability to rapidly trace the genetic variability of emerging variants using whole-genome sequencing, reconstructing emerging virus variants, and assessing their phenotypes will allow rapid response to their emergence with appropriate countermeasures. The development, improvement and characterization of suitable animal models that recapitulate SARS-CoV-2 replication, transmission and pathogenicity in humans will provide a platform to assess the potential implications of these emerging variants. The novel mouse model based on hACE2 expression under the endogenous regulatory elements of the mouse <italic>Ace2</italic> gene will be a valuable tool and will complement existing animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, as we have shown here, to demonstrate increased replication and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup>, the phenotypic assessment of future pandemic variants will likely require several complementing animal models that together reflect aspects of SARS-CoV-2 replication, transmission and pathogenicity in humans.</p>

<p id="P35">Mouse tissue samples collected in RA1 lysis buffer supplemented with 1% β-mercaptoethanol were homogenized using a Bullet Blender Tissue Homogenizer (Next-Advance). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at 18,000 g and stored at -70°C until processing. Total RNA was extracted from homogenates using the NucleoMag VET kit for viral and bacterial RNA/DNA from veterinary samples (Macherey Nagel, Ref: 744200) and the KingFisher Flex automated extraction instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific) following manufacturers’ instructions. RNA purity was analyzed with a NanoDrop 2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific). A 25 μl RT-PCR for the viral E gene was carried out using 5 μl of extracted RNA template using the AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR (Applied Biosystems). Samples were processed in duplicate. Amplification and detection were performed in a Applied Biosystem 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems under the following conditions: an initial reverse transcription at 45 °C for 10 min, followed by PCR activation at 95 °C for 10 min and 45 cycles of amplification (15 seconds at 95 °C, 30 seconds at 56 °C and 30 seconds at 72 °C). Relative quantification of virus load in swabs and mouse tissues was based on β2 microglobulin expression measured by TaqMan qPCR according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Assay mM00437762_m; ThermoFisher).</p>
<p id="P36">Fixed mouse tissue samples were processed, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) at the COMPATH core facility (University of Bern). Histopathological lung slides of hACE2-KI mice and wild-type mice (infected and mock) were examined and scored by a board-certified veterinary pathologist (SdB), who was blinded to the identity of the samples. Scoring criteria are detailed in Extended Data Table 2.</p>

<title>Hamster study</title>
<p id="P37">Six Syrian hamsters, <italic>Mesocricretus auratus</italic>, (Janvier Labs, France) were infected intranasally under a short-term inhalation anesthesia with 70 μl of SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614D</sup> and SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> at equal ratios using 10<sup>4.77</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/animal (calculated from back titration of the original material). After 24 hours of isolated housing in individually ventilated cages (IVCs), six pairs, each with one directly inoculated donor hamster and one sham-inoculated contact hamster were co-housed. The housing of each hamster duo was strictly separated in individual cage systems to prevent spill-over between different pairs. For the following seven days (day 2 until day 8 after infection) and on day 12 after infection, viral shedding was monitored in addition to a daily physical examination and body weighting routine.</p>
<p id="P38">To evaluate viral shedding, nasal washes were individually collected from each hamster under a short-term isoflurane anesthesia. Starting with the pair’s contact hamster, each nostril was rinsed with 100 μl PBS (1.0x phosphate-buffered saline) and reflux was immediately gathered. A new pipet tip for every nostril and hamster was used to prevent indirect spill-over transmission from one animal to another. Furthermore, in-between the respective pairs, a new anesthesia system was used for each pair of animals. At day 8 post infection, one contact hamster was found dead. Although having lost up to almost 20% of their body weight, every other hamster recovered from disease. Under euthanasia, serum samples were collected from each hamster.</p>
<p id="P39">For a second experimental setup seven hamsters each were infected via the intranasal route with 10<sup>5.1</sup> TCID50/animal of SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614D</sup>, or 10<sup>4.5</sup> TCID50/animal SARS-CoV-2<sup>S-614G</sup> (calculated from back titration of the original material). From day 1 onwards to day 4 nasal washes were obtained from these hamsters and body weight changes recorded. A tissue panel from respiratory organs, including nasal conchae, tracheal tissue, cranial, medial, and caudal portions of the right lung, and the pulmonary lymph node, were collected after euthanasia from these hamsters.</p>

<sec id="S21">
<title>Ferret study</title>
<p id="P40">In accordance with the hamster study, twelve ferrets <italic>(Mustela putorius furo)</italic> from in-house breeding, were divided into six groups of two individuals. Ferret pairs were of equal age between four and 18 months. In total, four ferrets were female (two pairs) and eight ferrets were male or neutered male (four pairs). The housing of each ferret duo was strictly separated in individual cage systems, to prevent spill-over between different pairs. Per separate cage, one individual ferret was inoculated intranasally, by instillation of 125μl of the aforementioned inoculum (1x10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/animal; calculated from back titration of the original material) into each nostril under a short-term isoflurane-based inhalation anesthesia. Time points and sampling technique corresponded to the methods used for the hamsters, albeit ferret nasal washing was performed using two times 700μl PBS per animal. The contact-ferret was not inoculated.</p>

<title>Specimen work-up, viral RNA detection, sequencing and quantification analyses</title>
<p id="P41">Organ samples were homogenized in a 1 ml mixture of equal volumes composed of Hank’s balanced salts minimum essential medium (MEM) and Earle’s balanced salts MEM containing 2 mM l-glutamine, 850 mg l–1 NaHCO3, 120 mg l–1 sodium pyruvate and 10% FCS (supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin) at 300 Hz for two minutes using the Tissuelyser II (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and centrifuged to clarify the supernatant. Nucleic acid was extracted from 100 μl of the nasal washes after a short centrifugation step or organ sample supernatant using the NucleoMag Vet kit (Macherey Nagel, Düren, Germany). Viral loads in these samples were determined using the nCoV_IP4 RT-PCR<sup>28</sup> including standard RNAs that where absolute quantified by digital droplet PCR with a sensitivity of 10 copies/reaction. The extracted RNA was afterwards subjected to MinION sequencing and digital droplet PCR. For MinION sequencing, amplicons were produced with primers (WU-21-F: AATCTATCAGGCCGGTAGCAC; WU-86-R: CAACAGCTATTCCAGTTAAAGCAC) using SuperScript IV One-step RT-PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA USA). Amplicons were sequenced on a MinION system using from Oxford Nanopore using Native Barcoding 1-12 (EXP-NBD104) and 13-24 (EXP-NBD114), respectively with Ligation Kit SQK-LSK109 (Oxford Nanopore; Oxford, UK). Libraries were loaded on R9.4.1 Flow Cells (FLO-MIN106D) on a MinION coupled to a MinIT. Realtime high accuracy basecalling, demultiplexing and barcode and adapter trimming was performed with MinKnow v20.06.17, running Guppy vs4.0.11. Downstream analysis was done in Geneious 2019 vs2.3. Read length filtered eliminated reads &lt; 800 and &gt; 1100 nt and remaining reads were mapped in subsets of 10,000 reads to the amplicon reference undergoing two iterations, with custom sensitivity allowing a maximum of 5% gaps and maximum mismatch 30%. Variants were analyzed on specific position with calculating p-values for every variant. Ratio fraction A/G was calculated from numbers of reads as fraction=Areads/(Areads+Greads).</p>
<p id="P42">For rare mutation and sequence analysis based on digital PCR, the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA) was used. For RT-PCR, the One-Step RT-ddPCR Advanced Kit for Probes (Bio-Rad) was applied according to the supplier’s instructions. For the amplification of an 86 bp fragment of both variants of the spike protein gene, the forward primer SARS2-S-1804-F (5’-ACA AAT ACT TCT AAC CAG GTT GC-3’) and the reverse primer SARS2-S-1889-R (5’-GTA AGT TGA TCT GCA TGA ATA GC-3’) were used. For the detection of the D and G variants in one sample, two allele specific locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes were applied: SARS2-S-v1D-1834FAM (5’-FAM-TaT cAG gat GTt AAC-BHQ1-3’) and SARS2-S-v3G-1834HEX (5’-HEX-T cAG ggt GTt AAC-BHQ1-3’). The LNA positions are depicted in lower case. The concentration of the primers and probes was 20μM and 5μM, respectively. For data analysis, the QuantaSoft Analysis Pro software (version 1.0.596) was used.</p>

<p id="P44">(<bold>a</bold>) Design and generation of humanized ACE2 knock-in mice (hACE2-KI). The hACE2 cDNA was inserted in frame with the endogeneous initiation codon of mouse Ace2 in exon 2, which was deleted. The hACE2 cDNA was flanked 5’ with a loxP site (black triangle) and 3’ with a FRT-neomycin-FRT-loxP cassette. The targeting construct included a negative selection cassette (PGK-DTA) to improve selection of clones with homologous recombination. Chimeric male mice transmitting the targeted locus were crossed with Flp-deleter female mice to generate the floxed hACE2 knock-in allele. This allele can be used : (1) without further cre-mediated recombination, as shown here, to study humanized ACE2 mice (hACE2-KI), where the hACE2 cDNA is expressed in place of mouse Ace2; (2) after crossing with a cre-deleter mouse line to generate constitutive <italic>Ace2</italic> knock-out mice; (3) after crossing with tissue-specific cre line. Ubiquitous and tissue-specific knock-out mice can be crossed with conventional hACE2 transgenic mice to remove the endogenous mouse ACE2, which could confound pathogenesis studies that may occur due to heterodimerization of ACE2.
