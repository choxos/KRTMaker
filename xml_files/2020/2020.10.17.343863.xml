<abstract>
<p id="P1">In the current global emergency due to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, passive immunotherapy emerges as a promising treatment for COVID-19. Among animal-derived products, equine formulations are still the cornerstone therapy for treating envenomations due to animal bites and stings. Therefore, drawing upon decades of experience in manufacturing snake antivenom, we developed and preclinically evaluated two anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal equine formulations as potential alternative therapy for COVID-19. We immunized two groups of horses with either S1 (anti-S1) or a mixture of S1, N, and SEM mosaic (anti-Mix) viral recombinant proteins. Horses reached a maximum anti-viral antibody level at 7 weeks following priming, and showed no major adverse acute or chronic clinical alterations. Two whole-IgG formulations were prepared via hyperimmune plasma precipitation with caprylic acid and then formulated for parenteral use. Both preparations had similar physicochemical and microbiological quality and showed ELISA immunoreactivity towards S1 protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD). The anti-Mix formulation also presented immunoreactivity against N protein. Due to high anti-S1 and anti-RBD antibody content, final products exhibited high <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralizing capacity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 80 times higher than a pool of human convalescent plasma. Pre-clinical quality profiles were similar among both products, but clinical efficacy and safety must be tested in clinical trials. The technological strategy we describe here can be adapted by other producers, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) is a recent pandemic disease caused by the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. It has generated millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covid19.who.int/">https://covid19.who.int/</ext-link>), and has become a serious threat to global public health and economies worldwide. General symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, severe respiratory illness, dyspnea, and pneumonia, with additional possible complications such as multiple-organ dysfunction or failure, that compromises the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, and central nervous systems, and can lead to septic shock<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">Like other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus, with a virion composed of at least four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. Protein S is implicated in cellular recognition, fusion, and entry<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>, making it the most attractive target for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic development.</p>
<p id="P4">Although contagion by this emerging virus continues to increase across the globe, more time is needed to develop and validate vaccines, drugs, and therapies to counteract the disease. Immunoglobulin-based therapies, such as treatment with human convalescent plasma, formulations of immunoglobulins purified from plasma of convalescent patients or hyperimmunized animals, or recombinant monoclonal antibodies, arise as a feasible option that may be achievable on a shorter time scale<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. Treatment of COVID-19 with convalescent plasma seems to be well-tolerated, reduces mortality, and has the potential to improve clinical outcomes, based on several case series studies, matched-control studies, and small randomized clinical trials<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. However, these results must be confirmed by large and ongoing controlled clinical trials.</p>
<p id="P5">Formulations of immunoglobulins purified from plasma of convalescent patients have also been used to treat severe respiratory illnesses with viral etiology, but to a lesser extent<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. These formulations are advantageous over unpurified convalescent plasma because they are safer and have higher activity, polyvalency, and product consistency<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. However, this strategy is donor-dependent, requires strict donor screening for both human pathogens and high levels of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and relies on well-established blood bank systems that may be scarce in developing countries<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">On the other hand, formulations of animal-derived immunoglobulins, such as anti-SARS-CoV F(ab´)<sub>2</sub>-equine formulations, have shown neutralizing efficacy in cell culture and in <italic>in vivo</italic> murine and hamsters models, as well as in both prophylactic and therapeutic experimental settings<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. Similarly, Zhao et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup> demonstrated effective <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> neutralization of MERS-CoV by IgG and F(ab’)<sub>2</sub>-formulations obtained from horses immunized with MERS-CoV virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing MERS-CoV proteins. More recently, two independent groups obtained F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> preparations through immunization of horses with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD (receptor binding domain; located at S1 subunit), and demonstrated preclinical efficacy as a potential therapy for COVID-19 both <italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in a murine model<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. Also, a F(ab´)<sub>2</sub> formulation with high <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralizing potency was developed by immunizing horses with recombinant pre-fusion trimers of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, comprising S1 and S2 subunits<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P7">In light of these favorable outcomes, and harnessing our experience in manufacturing equine snake antivenom<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>, we developed two formulations of whole-IgG from plasma of horses immunized with one of two types of SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins: S1 (anti-S1) or a mixture of S1, SEM mosaic, and N proteins (anti-Mix). We detail the manufacturing procedure, quality and safety profiles, and <italic>in vitro</italic> preclinical efficacy of the final formulations with the aim of providing an effective, safe, and affordable potential treatment for COVID-19.</p>

<title>Immunization of horses</title>
<p id="P11">Two groups of three Ibero-American and mixed breed horses, ranging from 3 to 15 years old and 350 to 450 kg, were immunized with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The first group (anti-S1) was immunized with the S1 protein alone, while the second group (anti-Mix) was immunized with a mixture of equal parts of S1, N, and Spike-E-M mosaic proteins (SEM). In brief, horses were injected subcutaneously at two weeks intervals according to the scheme summarized in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Freund’s complete adjuvant (F5881, Sigma-Aldrich; Missouri, USA), Freund’s incomplete adjuvant (F5506-Sigma-Aldrich), and Emulsigen-D adjuvant (MVP adjuvants; Nebraska, USA) were included to enhance the antibody response of horses. Samples of serum were collected before and during immunization with each booster and stored at -20 °C until use. Antibody responses of horses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins was monitored via ELISA as described below.</p>

<title>Bleeding of horses and plasma separation</title>
<p id="P12">We bled horses 19 days after the last injection of viral proteins using a closed system of blood collection bags. In total, three blood collections of 6 L each were performed across three consecutive days. The first day, blood was collected and stored overnight at 2–8 °C to allow erythrocyte sedimentation. The second day, plasma from the first day was separated from erythrocytes, preserved by the addition of 0.005 % thimerosal, and stored at 2–8 °C until use. Erythrocytes were suspended in saline solution and warmed to 37 °C. Then, following the second collection of blood, tempered erythrocytes from the first day were transfused back to the same animal. The third day, we repeated the same procedure as on the second day<sup>

During and at the end of the incubation period, media were examined for macroscopic evidence of microbial growth. Sterility compliance was dependent on the absence of microbial growth.</p>

Samples were heat-inactivated for 30 minutes at 56 °C, and then diluted to appropriate concentrations in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (VWRL0102-500, VWR Life Sciences; Pennsylvania, USA), supplemented with 5 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine essence (FBE) (VWR10803-034, VWR Life Sciences), 1 % Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S) (15-140-122, Gibco Thermo Scientific) and 1 % L-Glutamine (VWRL0131-0100, VWR Life Sciences).

<title>SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins</title>
<p id="P31">Structural SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S1, N, and SEM mosaic proteins were used as immunogens for the preparation of equine formulations. S1 forms part of the transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein homotrimer located at the viral surface. S is composed of S1 and S2 subunit domains, and is the main protein responsible for recognition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor via the receptor binding domain (RBD) at the N-terminal S1 subunit<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. Thus, S is the most suitable target for immunoglobulin-based therapy for COVID-19<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>. Both S1 and S2 subunits of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, specially conformational epitopes at S1, and particularly at RBD<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup>, have served as targets for developing neutralizing antibodies to disable receptor interactions and block viral entry to host cells. Also, during SARS-CoV infection, it was demonstrated that protective humoral and T-cellular immunity is induced by S protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P32">Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) plays an essential role in genome packaging, virion assembly, replication, and transcription<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup>. This protein is highly expressed during infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>

<p id="P33">Membrane (M) protein is the most abundant of the structural proteins in the virus. This transmembrane protein coordinates virus assembly by interacting with the other structural proteins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>

<p id="P34">Here, we used SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S1 protein (produced in baculovirus insect cells), N protein (expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>), and SEM mosaic (an <italic>E. coli</italic> derived recombinant protein containing the S, E, and M immunodominant regions) as immunogens to produce two formulations of equine immunoglobulins: anti-S1 (towards S1 protein) and anti-Mix (towards a mixture of S1, N, and SEM mosaic proteins).

<p id="P35">Before immunization, we verified the purity of viral protein preparations with SDS-PAGE analysis (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and found that S1 protein was represented by a ~85 kDa band of high purity (94%).

RBD protein showed a 34 kDa band that represented 95% of the preparation. The identity of all recombinant proteins was confirmed by mass spectrometry (nESI-MS/MS; results not shown).

<title>Immunization, antibody response, and clinical evaluation of horses</title>
<p id="P36">An ideal design for an adequate immunization strategy takes into consideration several factors. For example, the immunogenicity of proteins is closely related to their structural characteristics such as molecular mass, tertiary and quaternary structure, and post-translational modifications. Similarly, optimal immunization procedures can vary depending on the animal model, administration route, use of immunological adjuvants, dose, and frequency of boosters. After the first injection of foreign proteins, naïve lymphocytes are recruited and activated by antigen-presenting cells, leading to the proliferation and creation of memory T and B cells. In turn, plasma B cells produce specific antibodies, whose affinity and specificity most likely mature after each booster<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>
</sup>. In this experiment, immunization of horses followed the scheme summarized in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. During immunization, antibody responses varied among individual horses. In general, antibody titers started to increase 15 days after priming, and reached a plateau at the maximum anti-viral antibody level around 7 weeks (52 days; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Others have reported maximum antibody responses 6–7 weeks after immunizing horses with SARS-CoV particles<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>, and 4-6 weeks after immunizing horses with SARS-CoV-2 RBD<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup> and trimeric S protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. In this study, horses in anti-S1 and anti-Mix groups showed similar dynamics in their development of plasma concentrations of antibodies towards S1 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), which is not surprising because both groups received the S1 immunogen at the same dosage, schedule, and method of administration. Antibodies towards N protein were only developed by horses in the anti-Mix group (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P37">Because RBD is a domain of S1<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>, we anticipated and observed that both groups would show similar responses towards RBD, even though it was not used as an immunogen (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Also, despite the fact that only the anti-Mix group was immunized against the SEM mosaic, both groups of horses developed a similar antibody response towards this immunogen (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>); presumably, the S immunodominant region contained in the mosaic masked the responses to E and M proteins.</p>
<p id="P38">Throughout the immunization schedule, animals used for hyperimmune plasma production should be under rigorous veterinary care, ensuring that the health and welfare of each animal are closely monitored, and ethical guidelines are appropriately met. During this process, the stimulation of a local inflammation is expected for the production of a cellular infiltrate, which at the beginning is mainly composed of neutrophils and at the end by antigen-presenting cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P39">In our study, horses developed local inflammation and signs of minor pain and discomfort such as lameness or abnormal gait, which lasted in most cases two days after each booster. However, the use of an anti-inflammatory drug was necessary for pain relief in two horses in the anti-Mix group. The complete and incomplete Freund´s adjuvants produced fistulation with minor pus-like discharge between 2 and 3 weeks after each injection. In spite of their proven adjuvant efficacy and depot effect, it is recommended to limit the use of these adjuvants to the beginning of the immunization protocol because they are known to cause local injuries<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, for the third booster, we selected Emulsigen-D adjuvant, which only produced some ventral edema on anti-Mix horses.</p>
<p id="P40">At the end of the immunization scheme, the immunogen dose was reduced from 1 mg to 0.5 mg of each immunogen to reduce inflammatory effects and to ration immunogen use. Overall, milder inflammation was observed in the anti-S group than in the anti-Mix group. This difference may result from protein interactions in the anti-Mix preparation and/or the fact that the anti-Mix group received 3 mg of total immunogen versus only 1 mg in the anti-S1 group. Nonetheless, further studies are necessary to confirm these hypotheses.</p>
<p id="P41">Hematological parameters were analyzed regularly throughout the immunization scheme, and before bleeding (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Slight decreases in hematocrit and hemoglobin were observed in some horses, but were not statistically significant (F= 0.550, df= 5, P= 0.606; F= 1.179, df= 5, P= 0.291, respectively). Nonetheless, the veterinary team treated horses with an antianemic vitamin complex (Complemil500®, Kyrovet Laboratories; Bogotá, Colombia) to ensure a safe blood extraction process.</p>
<p id="P42">In general, biochemical analysis of horse serum showed normal values, although some measures varied significantly during hyperimmune plasma production (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; P &lt; 0.05). Pre-bleeding analysis revealed a significant increase in total protein and globulins and a decrease of albumin as a direct consequence of hyperimmunization and production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Potassium values decreased below the normal range, an observation also reported by Angulo et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup> in horses injected with snake venoms for antivenom manufacture. Although there was a slight rise in the levels of gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) and creatine kinase (CK) enzymes, which may reflect some hepatic and tissue damage. Nonetheless, those changes were not significantly different than baseline serum values (P &gt; 0.05). Results suggest a possible effect of virus proteins or adjuvants on the electrolyte profile and protein balance of plasma producing animals.</p>

<title>Bleeding for hyperimmune plasma collection</title>
<p id="P43">We bled horses when the maximum anti-viral antibody level against all immunogens reached a plateau (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). First, horses underwent physical examination, including evaluation of body condition, auscultation of cardiorespiratory and digestive systems, and hematological tests. Strict veterinary surveillance was maintained throughout bleeding, self-transfusion, and post-bleeding.</p>
<p id="P44">Bleeding was performed across three consecutive days. Horses had access to water and food <italic>ad libitum</italic>. By the end of the process, an average of 9.2 ± 1.0 L plasma was collected from each horse. Bleeding and plasma separation were performed by specialized technicians. Laboratories, equipment, and a closed system of blood collection bags were designed to operate with refined aseptic technique. All the plasma bags tested negatively to endotoxins, containing less than 1.5 EU/mL, and met all the specifications required to be included in the plasma pools for the immunoglobulin purification process.</p>
<p id="P45">Bleeding resulted in no adverse acute or chronic physiological alterations. Some minor shifts were observed in serum biochemical parameters, but within accepted ranges (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) as reported by Cunha et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. Horses showed an expected decrease in total protein and globulins concentration after bleeding, as a consequence of the removal of plasma proteins. After a 2-month rest period, animals recovered to normal status, and were ready to initiate a new cycle of immunization and bleeding.</p>

<title>Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin purification</title>
<p id="P46">To prepare antisera, hyperimmune plasma was pooled by immunization group (28.9 kg anti-S1 plasma and 26.5 kg anti-Mix plasma), and subsequently fractionated by caprylic acid precipitation. This method is routinely used at the Instituto Clodomiro Picado of the University of Costa Rica for the manufacture of whole-IgG antivenoms, and produces satisfactory yield and adequate purity of preparations<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. The antivenoms generated using this fractionation protocol have proven safe and effective in clinical trials in patients suffering snakebite envenomings<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P47">Caprylic acid has the advantage of precipitating non-IgG proteins from plasma, while leaving the pharmacologically active ingredient – the immunoglobulins – in solution<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. The advantage of this method is that IgG aggregation is circumvented. After precipitation, insoluble material was removed by filtration, producing a clarified solution enriched in plasma immunoglobulins.</p>
<p id="P48">Once purified, whole-IgG preparations were properly formulated in compliance with quality control specifications (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Solutions were dialyzed and concentrated to remove caprylic acid (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; ≤ 250 mg/L), and to reach final protein concentration. Additionally, pH, osmolality, and ionic strength were adjusted to values compatible with parenteral administration, and phenol was added as a preservative (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P49">Finally, a 0.22 μm-filtration was performed prior to aseptic filling of vials as a final sterilization step to avoid contamination with potential pathogens such as bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. After downstream processing of the formulations, we filled 612 and 479 vials containing 10 mL of purified and concentrated anti-S1 and anti-Mix products, respectively. In other words, we obtained approximately 20 vials/L plasma.</p>
<p id="P50">Because heterologous formulations are animal plasma-derived products, there is a theoretical concern regarding transmission of viral infectious agents. To prevent this possibility, viral risk assessment needs to be performed via rigorous control of the viral load of the raw material, as well as evaluation of both existing and intentionally introduced antiviral steps during production<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>
</sup>. The use of caprylic acid in the production of snake antivenoms also works as an antiviral step for enveloped viruses, reducing viral loads by up to 5 log<sub>10</sub> for several model viruses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>
</sup>. Previously, we have found that precipitation of equine plasma with 6 % caprylic acid reduces infectivity of human herpesvirus (HSV-1) in Vero cells by more than 5 log<sub>10</sub> within 5 minutes of adding the precipitating agent (our unpublished data). Moreover, 0.25 % phenol has been reported as an efficient virucidal agent of enveloped viruses when added to final formulations of snake antivenoms<sup>

<title>Immunoreactivity</title>
<p id="P53">The ELISA antibody response of anti-S1 and anti-Mix formulations towards the four recombinant proteins used as immunogens was significantly different (F= 797.529, df= 2;24, P&lt;0.0001; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Such immunoreactivity agrees with that seen during horse immunization, as the anti-S1 formulation recognized both S1 and RBD and the anti-Mix formulation recognized S1, N, and RBD. Anti-RBD immunoreactivity was higher with the anti-Mix formulation (P &lt; 0.05), whereas the SEM mosaic was poorly recognized by both anti-S1 (ẍ= 0.118 [0.101 – 0.146] 95% Bca) and anti-Mix (ẍ= 0.198 [0.191 – 0.203] 95% Bca) formulations.</p>
<p id="P54">The ELISA titers of the final products towards S1 and N was calculated in reference to a normal equine immunoglobulin preparation (NEI) (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The anti-S1 formulation presented a higher titer against S1 than the anti-Mix formulation, whereas only anti-Mix showed immunoreactivity towards the nucleocapsid viral protein.</p>
<p id="P55">The Western blot results (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) agree with the ELISA findings, i.e. anti-S1 formulation immunoreacted with several bands of S1, particularly at 85 kDa band, and with RBD; while anti-Mix formulation immunoreacted with bands of S1, N and RBD proteins. It is worth mentioning that when compared to the electrophoretic profile of viral proteins (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), more immunodetected bands appeared in S1 and N, suggesting the presence of other proteins in the recombinant preparations, probably remnants of the upstream process. Because we used proteins that were expressed in non-human cells, there is no risk that immunization could have resulted in the production of equine antibodies towards human proteins that could induce adverse effects.</p>

</sup> showed that immunization of horses with a trimeric spike protein (comprised of both S1 and S2 subunits) generated a formulation with potent <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralizing ability.</p>
<p id="P57">Here, we demonstrated that immunization of horses with recombinant S1 elicited a strong humoral response. Such a strong neutralizing capacity is most likely due to the presence of anti-RBD antibodies and other antibodies directed towards S protein epitopes such as th<italic>e N-</italic> terminal domain (NTD)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup>. During the pre-incubation phase of the PRNT assay with both anti-S1 and anti-Mix formulations, a similar potency of anti-S1 antibodies recognized and bound S1 on the viral surface, neutralizing the infection capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup> (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
<p id="P58">Given that N protein is an internal antigen, its interaction with specific antibodies in a PRNT assay is unlikely. Thus, we could not assess the contribution of anti-N antibodies to viral neutralization in this study. However, vaccines that have been developed against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with targets other than the S protein did not successfully protect animals from infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>
</sup>. The contribution of anti-N antibodies to the control of COVID-19 requires further study.</p>
<p id="P59">In terms of the total protein of the formulations required to neutralize 50 % of the viral infection capacity (total protein/ED<sub>50</sub>), the anti-S1 formulation required 2.3 μg/mL and the anti-Mix formulation required 2.5 μg/mL. Another formulation tested by Pan and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup> required 8.8 μg/mL, whereas a formulation reported by Zylberman et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup> reached titer values of 1:10240 with 3 g/dL of total protein. An anti-trimeric S-formulation resulted in a PRNT<sub>50</sub> of 1:32000 at 9 g/dL total protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. However, because different methodologies were used to assess the neutralizing ability of the above noted formulations, it would be more appropriate to compare our formulations with convalescent plasma as a control. In this study, ED<sub>50</sub> (95% CI) of convalescent plasma was 1:339 (1:295-1:386). In other words, anti-S1 and anti-Mix formulations were 80 times more potent than the convalescent plasma pool (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), and a 10-mL vial of equine-derived formulation would be equivalent to 800 mL of human convalescent plasma from donors pre-selected for having a high anti-SARS-CoV-2 titer. These findings are consistent with previous reports<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P60">Although the neutralizing potency of the formulations in cell culture is a useful characteristic, it does not necessarily predict clinical efficacy, which also depends on whether antibodies can reach compartments in which the antigen is distributed. Therefore, only properly designed clinical trials can demonstrate the clinical efficacy of heterologous formulations against COVID-19. Once the potency specification of the formulations is established via clinical studies, then cell culture assays can verify consistency and specification compliance within batches in an industrial line.</p>

<title>Anti-SARS-CoV-2 equine IgG-mediated activation of human Fcγ receptors (FcγRs)</title>
<p id="P61">A surrogate assay was used to evaluate the <italic>in vitro</italic> capacity of equine formulations to trigger the activation of human FcγRIIIA (CD16) (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). This assay comprised the co-cultivation of anti-viral IgG, previously incubated with S1 and N proteins, with mouse BW:FcγRIIIA-ζ reporter cells expressing the extracellular portion of chimeric human FcγRIIIA. Activation of FcγRIIIA via recognition of the IgG-Fc portion was then determined by measuring IL-2 secretion as a marker<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>. When compared to normal equine IgG (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, bar 4), both anti-S1 and anti-Mix formulations induced the secretion of IL-2 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, bars 1 and 2). According to their immunoreactivity, both formulations interacted with S1 protein, and only the anti-Mix formulation reacted to N protein. A pool of anti-SARS-CoV-2 high-titer convalescent human plasma showed significantly higher IL-2 secretion than equine formulations against both S1 and N viral proteins (P &lt; 0.005; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, bar 3).</p>
<p id="P62">Interestingly, our results evidence some capacity of equine IgG to interact and activate human FcγRIIIA <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting the possibility of being able also to activate human FcγRs <italic>in vivo</italic>. This finding has several implications in terms of the antiviral mechanism of action and the safety profile of the formulations.</p>
<p id="P63">Under this scenario, in addition to neutralizing the viral proteins, anti-viral immunoglobulins may also mediate downstream effector functions via interaction with Fc-receptors in immune cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>
</sup>. Such an interaction could lead to the killing of virus-infected cells by effector mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). For example, FcγRIIIA could interact with natural killer cells, or, if equine IgG are able to interact with other human FcγRs, through stimulation of antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>
</sup>. Overall, the activation of human FcγRs may represent a clinical advantage of non-digested formulations over F(ab)´<sub>2</sub> formulations, although this hypothesis remains to be tested in clinical studies.</p>
<p id="P64">At the same time, there are theoretical safety concerns related with the possibility that antiviral hyperimmune immunoglobulin formulations could induce an immune enhancement of the viral disease. Non-neutralizing, low-affinity, or sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibodies that may engage functional responses from human FcγRs, could lead to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) or antibody-enhanced immunopathology<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>
</sup>. Even though ADE and acute lung injury have been reported during SARS-CoV infection in non-human models and cell culture studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>
</sup>, there is still no compelling clinical, epidemiological or histopathological evidence to support ADE or antibody-enhanced immunopathology of COVID-19 infection or re-infection in humans<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>
</sup>, or during human plasma convalescent therapy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. However, both phenomena should be considered as latent risks. Therefore, further studies to elucidate the pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as strict vigilance during passive immunotherapy with antiviral immunoglobulin formulations are crucial.</p>
<p id="P65">In contrast to our protocol, other anti-viral heterologous formulations for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndromes have included an enzymatic digestion of IgG with pepsin to generate divalent F(ab′)<sub>2</sub> preparations. Generally, the rationale for Fc removal is to prevent the development of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup> and early adverse reactions mediated by the Fc fragment of horse immunoglobulins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. However, in the particular case of equine antivenoms, similar incidences of early adverse reactions have been reported for F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> antivenoms and whole IgG preparations produced by caprylic acid precipitation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>
</sup>, suggesting that the presence of Fc fragment in the preparation is not the main culprit for these reactions. Additionally, immunoglobulin fragments have shorter half-lives than whole IgG preparations, which confers an advantage to non-digested formulations in terms of active ingredient residence time during administration<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>
</sup>. Clarification of the relative efficacy and safety of F(ab´)<sub>2</sub> and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 formulations is an important task that must be addressed in the near future.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p id="P66">Taking advantage of our experience with manufacturing snake antivenom, we developed two equine-IgG formulations (anti-S1 and anti-Mix) by immunizing horses with SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins S1, N, and SEM mosaic. Formulations were prepared with a simple, cost-effective, and scalable methodology, and showed high physicochemical and microbiological quality. We demonstrated that horses can produce large quantities of antibodies with high neutralizing potency of the virus <italic>in vitro</italic>, due to the presence of anti-S1 and anti-RBD immunoglobulins in the final products, which demonstrated to be 80 times more potent than a pool of human convalescent plasma. Both formulations have similar pre-clinical quality, safety, and efficacy profiles, but are yet to be validated with proper clinical trials. We suggest that the technological platform presented here could be adapted by other equine immunoglobulin producers worldwide to provide this potential treatment of COVID-19 in other regions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

<p id="P85">Endotoxin limit was calculated as the quotient K/M, where K is the threshold pyrogenic dose of endotoxin per kilogram of body weight (5 EU/kg), and M is the maximum total dose administered to a 70 kg-patient for 1 h. Based on our results, the recommended dose for anti-S1 and anti-Mix formulations is 10 mL. Therefore, the acceptable endotoxin limit for this formulation is: (5 EU/kg)/(10 mL/70 kg) = 35 EU/mL.</p>
