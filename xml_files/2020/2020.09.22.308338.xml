<abstract>
<p id="P1">As the COVID-19 pandemic escalates, the need for effective vaccination programs, therapeutic intervention, and diagnostic tools increases. Here, we identified 11 unique nanobodies (Nbs) specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) of which 8 Nbs potently inhibit the interaction of RBD with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the major viral docking site. Following a detailed epitope determination and characterization of the binding mode by structural analysis, we constructed a hetero-bivalent Nb targeting two different epitopes within the RBD:ACE2 interface. This resulted in a high-affinity binder with a viral neutralization efficacy in the picomolar range. Using the bivalent Nb as a surrogate, we established a competitive multiplex binding assay (“NeutrobodyPlex”) for detailed analysis of the presence and performance of neutralizing RBD-binding antibodies in the serum of convalescent or vaccinated patients. As demonstrated, the NeutrobodyPlex enables high-throughput screening and detailed analysis of neutralizing immune responses in infected or vaccinated individuals, helping to monitor immune status or guide vaccine design. This approach is easily transferrable to diagnostic laboratories worldwide.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">By the end of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused the death of more than 1.6 million people worldwide and the current lack of a cure or established vaccine comes with severe lockdowns and dramatic economic losses. Neutralizing antibodies targeting the causative agent of the disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are of substantial interest for prophylactic and therapeutic options and help to guide vaccine design<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. These antibodies bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the homotrimeric transmembrane spike (spike) and prevent viral entry via the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) expressed on human epithelial cells of the respiratory tract<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, a constantly growing number of neutralizing antibodies has been identified from COVID-19 patients, underlining the importance of RBD-specific antibodies in blocking the RBD:ACE2 interaction site for the development of a protective immune response<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. A promising alternative to conventional antibodies (IgGs) are single-domain antibodies (nanobodies, Nbs) derived from the heavy-chain antibodies of camelids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. Due to their small size and compact fold, Nbs show high chemical stability, solubility and fast tissue penetration. Nbs can be efficiently selected against different epitopes on the same antigen and can be easily converted into multivalent formats<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. The potential of Nbs to address SARS-CoV-2 has been impressively demonstrated by the recent identification of several RBD specific Nbs from naïve/ synthetic libraries<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup> or immunized animals<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">Since the pandemic outbreak multiple serological SARS-CoV-2 assays have been established to monitor seroconversion in individuals and estimate the level of endemic infection in the general population. However, most available serological tests measure the full immune response and can therefore not differentiate between total binding and neutralizing antibodies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. Detection of the latter is still mostly performed by conventional virus neutralization tests (VNTs), which are both time consuming (2 - 4 days) and require work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions in a specialized biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. To overcome these limitations, we aimed to employ Nbs as antibody surrogates and developed a competitive binding approach to screen for neutralizing antibodies on a high-throughput basis in samples from patients or vaccinated individuals.</p>
<p id="P4">Here we describe the selection of 11 unique Nbs derived from an alpaca immunized with glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Employing a multiplex <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay, detailed epitope mapping and structural analysis, we identified 8 Nbs that effectively block the interaction between RBD, S1-domain (S1) and the homotrimeric spike protein (spike) with ACE2 and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection in a human cell line. Generation of a hetero-bivalent Nb (bivNb) simultaneously targeting different epitopes within the RBD:ACE2 interface results in a potent antibody surrogate with substantially improved binding affinities and functional IC50 values in the low picomolar range. To monitor the presence and performance of neutralizing antibodies addressing the RBD:ACE2 interface in convalescent patient samples, we implemented the bivNb in a competitive multiplex binding assay, termed NeutrobodyPlex. Based on the data presented in this study, the NeutrobodyPlex provides a versatile high-throughput approach to screen for a neutralizing immune response in infected or vaccinated individuals, helping to monitor immune status of large populations, outcome of vaccination campaigns and to guide vaccine design.</p>

<title>Selection of SARS-CoV-2-specific Nbs</title>
<p id="P5">To generate Nbs directed against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 we immunized an alpaca (<italic>Vicugna pacos</italic>) with purified RBD<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup> and established a Nb phagemid library comprising ∼4 x 10<sup>7</sup> clones representing the full repertoire of variable heavy chains of heavy-chain antibodies (V<sub>H</sub>Hs or Nbs). After two rounds of phage display on passively adsorbed or biotinylated RBD immobilized on streptavidin plates, we analyzed 492 individual clones in a solid-phase phage ELISA and identified 325 positive binders. Sequence analysis of 72 clones revealed 11 unique Nbs which cluster into eight families displaying highly diverse complementarity determining regions (CDR) 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 a</xref>). Individual Nbs were produced and purified from <italic>Escherichia coli (E.coli)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 b</xref>) and affinity measurements revealed K<sub>D</sub> values ranging from ∼1.3 nM to ∼53 nM indicating the selection of 10 high affinity monovalent binders, whereas NM1225 displaying a binding affinity in the micromolar range was not considered for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Next, we analyzed whether the selected Nbs can block the interaction between the isolated receptor-binding domain (RBD), S1 domain (S1) or homotrimeric spike protein (spike) of SARS-CoV-2 to the human ACE2 receptor. To this end, we utilized a multiplex ACE2 competition assay employing the respective SARS-CoV-2 antigens coupled to paramagnetic beads (MagPlex Microspheres)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup> and incubated them with biotinylated ACE2 and dilutions of purified Nbs before measuring the residual binding of ACE2. Additionally, we included a non-specific Nb (GFP-Nb) as negative control and two inhibiting mouse antibodies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup> as positive controls. Data obtained through this multiplex binding assay showed that 8 of the 10 analyzed Nbs inhibit ACE2 binding to all tested SARS-CoV-2 antigens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Notably, IC<sub>50</sub> values obtained for the most potent inhibitory Nbs NM1228 (0.5 nM), NM1226 (0.85 nM) and NM1230 (2.12 nM) are highly comparable to IC<sub>50</sub> values measured for the mouse IgGs (MM43: 0.38 nM; MM57: 3.22 nM).</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Epitope Identification</title>
<p id="P6">To identify the relative location of Nb epitopes Nbs within the RBD, we firstly performed epitope binning experiments of Nb combinations using biolayer interferometry. For this, sensors, pre-coated with biotinylated RBD, were loaded with a Nb from one family followed by a short dissociation step and subsequent loading of a second Nb from a different family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3 a</xref>). As expected, Nbs displaying similar CDR3 sequences (NM1221, NM1222 and NM1230, Nb-Set2) were unable to bind simultaneously as they recognize identical or highly similar epitopes. Interestingly, we noticed that Nbs with highly diverse CDR3s such as NM1228, NM1226, NM1227 and NM1229 also could not bind simultaneously, suggesting that these Nbs also recognize similar or overlapping epitopes. Consequently, we clustered these diverse Nbs into Nb-Set1. In total, we identified five distinct Nbs-Sets, comprising at least one candidate targeting a different epitope within the RBD compared to any member of a different Nb-Set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3 b</xref>). For detailed epitope mapping, we performed Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) using the most potent inhibitory Nbs selected from the different Nb-Sets. Both members of Nb-Set1, NM1226 and NM1228, interacted with the RBD at the back/ lower right site (Back View, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The highest exchange protection for NM1226 was found in the amino acid (aa) region N370 – L387 which is also covered by NM1228. Additionally, NM1228 binds to aa Y489 - S514, being part of the RBD:ACE2 binding interface. NM1230 (Nb-Set2) shows the highest exchange protection ranging from C432 - L452 covering two amino acids involved in ACE2 binding (G446, Y449). Additionally, a second protected region was found covering aa N487 - G496 with overlap to the RBD:ACE2 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In accordance to our binning studies, the main epitope regions differ from both Nb-Sets. As expected, NM1221 and NM1222 (both Nb-Set2) addressed similar RBD regions compared to NM1230 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>) while NM1224 (Nb-Set4) showed an interaction distinct from all other Nbs, covering both its main binding region located at the lower right side (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>, Front View) and residues in the ACE2:RBD interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, Front View, upper left corner). Additionally, the non-inhibitory NM1223 (Nb-Set3) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>) was shown not to contact any amino acid residues involved in the RBD:ACE2 interface but rather binds to the opposite side (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>, Front View).</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Crystal structure of RBD:NM1230 complex</title>
<p id="P7">To obtain a deeper insight into the binding mode of one of the most potent inhibitory Nbs, we solved the crystal structure of NM1230 in complex with RBD at a resolution of 2.9 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Analysis of the RBD:NM1230 complex revealed that the main contact is formed by residues located in the CDR3 of NM1230 (residues P99, R102 E107, R108, K109, D110, V111, W112). Additionally, the N-terminus (Q1), framework region 2 (FR2, residues N35, Y37, Q39, G42, K43, A44, A49, L45 and L47) and FR3 (residue E61) of NM1230 form contact sites. On the RBD site residues that interact with NM1230 are Y351 and the loop region formed by residues 437 - 503 including Y453, Y449, N450, L468, T470, E484, Y489, F490, L492, N493, and S494) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 a</xref>). The RBD:NM1230 interface RBD is mainly formed by polar contacts and one salt-bridge (R<sub>NM1230</sub>102 to E<sub>RBD</sub>484), but π-π stackings (W112<sub>NM1230</sub> and F490<sub>RBD</sub>, R108<sub>NM1230</sub> to Y489<sub>RBD</sub>) are also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 b</xref>). In total it buries a surface area of ∼830 Å<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>, which is comparable (∼860 Å<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>) to the contact interface in recently reported structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bound to neutralizing Nb-Ty1<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. Superposition of the RBD:NM1230 complex structure with the spike protein in the complex with Nb-Ty1 reports a C<sub>α</sub>-rmsd deviation of 1.2 Å for all three RBD domains showing that the binding sites of Nbs NM1230 and Nb-Ty1 partially overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 c</xref>). Nevertheless, subtle changes establish an alternative binding epitope for NM1230 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5 a</xref>). Next, we compared the RBD:NM1230 structure with the recently reported RBD:ACE2 receptor complex<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup> to structurally validate the neutralizing potential of NM1230. Closer inspection of the binding site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5 b</xref>) showed that NM1230 only partially overlaps with the ACE2 binding interface and that the neutralizing effect can be isolated to a limited set of residues within the RBD (K417, Y449, F456, Y489, Q493, S494) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). However, NM1230 does not only block binding to ACE2 via its interaction to the RBD on the same protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 c</xref>, <bold>clash I</bold>), but also impairs ACE2 binding through steric collision on the neighbouring RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 c</xref>, <bold>clash II</bold>). Based upon our structural data, we propose that NM1230-mediated blocking of two out of three RBDs would suffice to abolish ACE2 binding to a trimeric spike molecule.</p>

<title>Nanobodies show a high potency in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2</title>
<p id="P8">For functional analyses, we screened the Nbs for their virus-neutralizing potencies. For a viral neutralization test (VNT), human Caco-2 cells were co-incubated with the SARS-CoV-2-mNG infectious clone and serial dilutions of NM1223, NM1224, NM1226, NM1228, NM1230 or GFP-Nb as negative control. 48 h post-infection neutralization potency was determined via automated fluorescence-microscopy of fixed and nuclear-stained cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). The infection rate normalized to a non-treated control was plotted and IC<sub>50</sub> values were determined via sigmoidal inhibition curve fits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). NM1226 and NM1228 (both Nb-Set1), showed the highest neutralization potency with IC<sub>50</sub> values of ∼15 nM and ∼7 nM followed by NM1230 (Nb-Set2; ∼37 nM) and NM1224 (Nb-Set4; ∼256 nM). As expected, NM1223 (Nb-Set3) was not found to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Overall, these findings are highly consistent compared to our results obtained from the multiplex ACE2 competition assay, thus demonstrating high potencies of ACE2-blocking Nbs to neutralize viral infection.</p>

<sec id="S7">
<title>Generation of a hetero-bivalent Nb with improved efficacies</title>
<p id="P9">Having identified a range of Nbs with high potency, inhibiting and neutralizing characteristics, we proposed that the most potent of these candidates derived from Nb-Set1 (NM1226) and Nb-Set2 (NM1230) might act synergistically. To examine this, we genetically fused the coding sequences head-to-tail by a flexible Gly-Ser linker and generated a hetero-bivalent Nb (bivNb) named NM1267 (NM1230/NM1226). Following production and purification from mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 a</xref>), we determined the affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 b, c</xref>) and analyzed its performance in our multiplex ACE2 competition assay. The bivNb showed a considerably improved affinity and revealed an outstanding inhibition of ACE2 binding to RBD, S1 and spike with an IC<sub>50</sub> in the low picomolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 b, d</xref>). Additionally, we observed an increased potency for viral neutralization indicated by an IC<sub>50</sub> of ∼0.9 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 b, e</xref>), demonstrating that the bivalent NM1267 simultaneously targeting two different epitopes within the RBD:ACE2 interaction site, embodies a substantially refined tool which is highly beneficial for viral neutralization and competitive binding studies.</p>

<title>NeutrobodyPlex – Using Nbs to determine a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing immune response</title>
<p id="P10">Currently available serological assays provide data on the presence and distribution of antibody subtypes against different SARS-CoV-2 antigens within serum samples of infected and recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients<sup>

</sup>. However, they do not differentiate between total and neutralizing RBD binding antibodies, which sterically inhibit viral entry via ACE2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. To address this important issue, our bivNb NM1267 might be a suitable surrogate to monitor the emergence and presence of neutralizing antibodies in serum samples of patients. We speculated that NM1267 specifically displaces such antibodies from the RBD:ACE2 interface, which can be monitored as a declining IgG signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6 a</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we generated a high-throughput competitive binding assay, termed NeutrobodyPlex, by implementing the NM1267 in a recently developed, multiplexed serological assay<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. We co-incubated antigen-coated beads comprising RBD, S1 or spike with serum samples from 5 patients and a dilution series of NM1267. Mean fluorescent intensities (MFI) derived from antigen-bound IgGs in the presence of bivNb were normalized to the MFI values of IgGs in the serum-only samples, illustrated as MFI (% control). When analyzing IgG binding to RBD, we detected a complete displacement in the presence of ∼63 nM NM1267. Similarly, a distinct signal reduction for S1 binding IgGs became observable reaching a plateau upon addition of ∼63 nM NM1267 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6 b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Notably, we observed only minor signal reduction when analyzing spike binding IgGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6 b</xref>) indicating that the majority of serum IgGs bind this large antigen at epitopes beyond the RBD:ACE2 interaction site. From this data, we concluded, that all 5 tested individuals comprise a substantial fraction of neutralizing IgGs, which can be detected by competitive bivNb binding using RBD or S1 as antigens. To demonstrate that the NeutrobodyPlex further determines the presence of neutralizing IgGs in detailed resolution, we highlight the results from monitoring the displacement of S1-binding IgGs in two selected patient samples #289 and #265. Upon addition of increasing concentrations of NM1267, we observed a prominent signal reduction of ∼ 85% in patient #289 whereas samples of patient #265 only revealed ∼ 53% displacement of S1-binding IgGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6 c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">Next, we compared the NeutrobodyPlex on RBD with the cell-based VNT by analyzing a set of 18 serum samples from convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients, collected on days 19 - 57 following a positive PCR test result, and 4 control samples from healthy donors. To detect differences within the overall immune response and to qualify the neutralizing capacity of the serum samples, we performed the NeutrobodyPlex using two concentrations of NM1267 previously shown to completely (1 µM) or partly (1 nM) displace IgGs binding the RBD:ACE2 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6 b</xref>). Both assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) revealed the presence of neutralizing antibodies in all serum samples from convalescent individuals, as seen when using the highest (1:40) serum dilution in the viral infection assay or upon the addition of 1 µM NM1267 in the NeutrobodyPlex. Notably, neutralizing IgGs were not detected in any of the control serum samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). When further analyzing the displacement of RBD binding IgGs using the lower NM1267 (1 nM) concentration, substantial variations in individual neutralizing capacities became visible. While some patient samples comprised potent, high affinity neutralizing IgGs which were able to outcompete NM1267 for binding to the RBD:ACE2 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7 a</xref>, high MFI (% control), light-colored squares), a continuous bivNb-mediated displacement of IgGs was detectable in other samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7 a</xref>, low MFI (% control) dark-colored squares) indicating the presence of IgGs with a lower neutralizing potency. In parallel, the VNT using higher serum dilutions also revealed substantial differences in the individual neutralizing potencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7 b</xref>). To confirm the validity of the NeutrobodyPlex, we calculated the mean percent of infection (% Infection) of all individual serum dilutions and plotted these values against the respective MFI (% control) obtained from the NeutrobodyPlex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7 c</xref>). The observed negative correlation (high MFI (% control) vs low mean % Infection) strongly suggests that the NeutrobodyPlex allows the detection of individual neutralizing immune responses and assessment of their potency.</p>
<p id="P12">For final validation, we screened a serum sample set of 112 convalescent SARS-CoV-2-infected and 8 uninfected individuals in the NeutrobodyPlex. In addition to RBD, S1 and spike, we included the S2 domain (S2) and the nucleocapsid (N) of SARS-CoV-2 as controls. Incubation with the higher amount of NM1267 (1 µM) revealed the presence of neutralizing IgGs in all serum samples from convalescent patients as shown by an effective replacement of IgGs from RBD, S1 and partially from spike, but not from S2 or N (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7 a</xref>). In line with the findings from the initial patient sample set, differences in the potencies of neutralizing IgGs present in the individual serum samples became detectable upon addition of the lower concentration of NM1267 (1 nM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7 b</xref>). As observed previously, non-infected individuals did not display any detectable antibody signal against the presented SARS-CoV-2 antigens and experienced no alteration upon NM1267 addition (data not shown). We further analyzed if the total level of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgGs correlates with the amount of neutralizing IgGs. As a marker for total IgGs we defined MFI values measured for spike-binding IgGs and plotted them against normalized MFI values from IgGs binding to RBD in the presence of both concentrations (1 µM, 1 nM) of NM1267 (MFI RBD (%control)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). We found high variability of total IgGs (MFI: ∼3500 – ∼47000) in the tested serum samples. Upon addition of the higher concentration of NM1267 (1 µM), we observed a complete displacement of IgGs binding the RBD:ACE2 interface independent of the amount of total IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Notably, no measurable correlation between the total IgG and the displaced IgG signal was detected in the presence of the lower amount of bivNbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). According to our data, there might be an increased likelihood for the presence of neutralizing antibodies in patients showing an overall high SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG level, however as illustrated in two examples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, highlighted in green) this cannot be generally assumed. While sample #36 comprises only a minor amount of total IgGs (MFI spike (control) ∼3700) we measured a high neutralizing potency, as displayed by the displacement of only ∼25% of RBD binding IgGs in the presence of NM1267 (1 nM). In contrast, a high amount of total IgGs was detected in sample #250 (MFI spike (control) ∼32,000) but ∼70% of RBD-specific IgGs were continuously displaced by NM1267 (1 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>) indicating the presence of low levels and/or low affine neutralizing IgGs in this individual. In summary, these findings show how the NeutrobodyPlex can provide detailed information not only on the presence of neutralizing antibodies in patient samples, but also enable a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the individual immune response.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P13">Indisputably, advanced diagnostic tools and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 infection are desperately needed. Several studies have demonstrated that humoral immune responses giving rise to antibodies targeting the interaction site of RBD and the ACE2 receptor exposed on human epithelial cells of the respiratory tract result in a strong viral neutralizing effect<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. Consequently, there is a strong demand to expand currently applied acute serological diagnostics measuring the overall immune response against SARS-CoV-2, towards a more differentiated analysis to specifically monitor and classify the emergence and presence of neutralizing antibodies in tested individuals. To monitor the presence of neutralizing antibodies addressing the RBD:ACE2 interface in serum samples, we developed a set of RBD-specific Nbs and screened for effective surrogates of RBD-binding IgGs. Of these, we selected high-affinity binding candidates which blocked the interaction between RBD and ACE2 in the context of different SARS-CoV-2 spike-derived antigens and additionally displayed a high viral neutralizing potency. Following detailed epitope mapping and structural analysis, we identified two binders which target different epitopes within the RBD:ACE2 interface and converted them into a hetero-bivalent Nb (NM1267). The bivalent NM1267 showed excellent performance in our multiplex ACE2 competition assay and the viral infection test with IC<sub>50</sub> values in picomolar range. Notably, data from our biochemical analyses and the viral neutralization test are in good accordance, which strongly suggests that the multiplex ACE2 competition assay as presented is highly relevant and suitable to identify virus-neutralizing binders. For detecting a neutralizing immune response in serum samples of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, we implemented the bivalent NM1267 as a most potent neutralizing IgG surrogate in our previously described multiplex immunoassay (MULTICOV-AB<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>) and developed a novel diagnostic test called NeutrobodyPlex. Using NM1267 to specifically displace IgGs from binding to the RBD:ACE2 interface, we provide an in-depth analysis of the neutralizing immune response in a large patient cohort. The NeutrobodyPlex was successful in not only detecting the overall presence of neutralizing IgGs targeting the RBD:ACE2 interface, but could also categorize them according to their potencies. Additionally, the NeutrobodyPlex enables the comparison between neutralizing IgGs and the total level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which will be an important parameter for determining the success of a vaccine.</p>
<p id="P14">In comparison to recently described assays directly measuring antibody-derived displacement of ACE2 in order to determine a neutralizing immune response<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup> a distinct lower binding affinity of ∼15 nM of RBD to ACE2 has to be considered. As a result, a neutralizing immune response may be detected even in the presence of weak RBD-binding antibodies, which could lead to a false statement of a protective immune response. The use of small-sized antibody surrogates exclusively binding to the RBD:ACE2 interface lowers the possibility of a non-targeted and non-reproducible displacement of ACE2 e.g. mediated by Fc regions of non-specifically binding IgGs. Finally, as demonstrated, the NeutrobodyPlex is performed in a bead-based multiplex setting, thus allowing to easily expand the antigen panel to accommodate e.g. novel, relevant RBD mutants occurring during the pandemic and which are highly relevant to be included in advanced vaccination strategies.</p>
<p id="P15">To our knowledge, the NeutrobodyPlex employing high-affinity bivNb blocking the RBD:ACE2 interaction site demonstrates for the first time a multiplex, antigen-resolved analysis of the presence of neutralizing human IgGs in convalescent individuals suffering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared to other tests analyzing a neutralizing immune response, the NeutrobodyPlex can be performed fully automatable and in high-throughput and can readily be applied for large cohort screening. As it requires only non-living and non-infectious viral material, costs and safety conditions can be substantially decreased<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. Furthermore, the NeutrobodyPlex is highly sensitive as low serum dilutions (tested dilution: 1:400) are sufficient for analysis which significantly reduces patient material compared to standard assays. Considering our findings, it is highly conceivable that the NeutrobodyPlex will open unique possibilities for a detailed classification of the individual immune status with regard to the development of protective antibodies and to monitor the efficiency of desperately needed vaccination campaigns.</p>

For immobilization, a magnetic particle processor (KingFisher 96, Thermo Scientific, Schwerte, Germany) was used. Bead stocks were vortexed thoroughly and sonicated for 15 seconds. Subsequently, 83 µL of 0.065% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1 mL of bead stock containing 12.5 x 10<sup>7</sup> beads of one single bead population were pipetted into each well.

Samples were analyzed using a two-step 20 min linear gradient with a flow rate of 50 µL/min. Solvent A was 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and solvent B was 80% acetonitrile (v/v) with 0.1% formic acid (v/v). After 3 min desalting at 10% B, a 9 min linear gradient from 10 to 25% B was applied followed by an 8 min linear gradient from 25 to 68.8%. Experiments were performed using a Q Exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) with 70,000 resolutions instrument configurations as follows: sheath gas flow rate of 25; aux gas flow rate of 5; S-lens RF level of 50, spray voltage of 3.5 kV and a capillary temperature of 300 °C.</p>

<title>HDX Data Analysis</title>
<p id="P26">A peptic peptide list containing peptide sequence, retention time and charge state was generated in a preliminary LC-MS/MS experiment. The peptides were identified by exact mass and their fragment ion spectrum using protein database searches by Proteome Discoverer v2.1.0.81 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) and implemented SEQUEST HT search engine. The protein database contained the RBD and the pepsin sequences. Precursor and fragments mass tolerance were set to 6 ppm and 0.05 Da, respectively. No enzyme selectivity was applied, however, identified peptides were manually evaluated to exclude peptides originated through cleavage after arginine, histidine, lysine, proline and the residue after proline <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. FDR was estimated using q-values calculated by Perculator and only peptides with high-confidence identification (q-value ≤ 0.01) were included to the list. Peptides with overlapping mass, retention time and charge in Nb and antigen digest, were manually removed. The deuterated samples were recorded in MS mode only and the generated peptide list was imported into HDExaminer v2.5.0 (Sierra Analytics, Modesto, CA, USA). Deuterium uptake was calculated using the increase of the centroid mass of the deuterated peptides. HDX could be followed for 79% of the RBD amino acid sequence. The calculated percentage deuterium uptake of each peptide between RBD-Nb and RBD-only were compared. Any peptide with uptake reduction of 5% or greater upon Nb binding was considered as protected.</p>

<p id="P27">The RBD domain was produced and purified as described previously<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. As a variation to the established protocol, the production of the RBD (residues 319-541) was performed in the Expi293F™ GntI-expression system. Expi293F™ GntI-cells were cultivated (37 °C, 125 rpm, 8% (v/v) CO<sub>2</sub>) to a density of 5.5x10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. The cells were diluted with Expi293F expression medium to a density of 3.0x10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL, followed by transfection of RBD plasmid (1 µg per mL cell culture) with Expifectamine dissolved in Opti-MEM medium, according the manufacturer’s instructions. 20 h post transfection, the transfection enhancers were added as documented in the Expi293F™ GntI-cells manufacturer’s instructions. The cell suspension was cultivated for 5 days (37 °C, 125 rpm, 8% (v/v) CO<sub>2</sub>) and centrifuged (4 °C, 23900x g, 20 min) to clarify the supernatant. The supernatant was supplemented with His-A buffer stock solution (final concentration in the medium: 20 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.4), before the solution was applied to a HisTrap FF crude column. The column was extensively washed with His-buffer-A (20 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.4) before the RBD was eluted with 280 mM imidazole from the column. The RBD was dialyzed against PBS and concentrated to 2 mg/ml. The nanobody complex was formed by mixing the RBD with the purified NM1230 in a molar ratio of 1:1.1, followed by incubation for 3 h at 4°C. For crystallization, the complex was treated with EndoHf to truncate the oligosaccharide chain of the RBD. Therefore, EndoHf (300 U per mg RBD) was added to the RBD:NM1230 complex and incubated for 2 days at 8°C. EndoHf was removed by passing the sample through a MBP-Trap column. Finally, a size-exclusion chromatography using a SD200 16/60 column exchanged the buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and separated the RBD:NM1230 domain from aggregates and the nanobody excess.</p>

Initial crystals appeared overnight in crystallization buffer (200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20% (w/v) PEG 3350, pH 5.9) and grew to a final size of 30x30x120µm<sup>

To generate icSARS-CoV-2-mNG stocks, 200.000 Caco-2 cells were infected with 50 µl of virus in a 6-well plate, the supernatant was harvested 48 hpi, centrifuged, and stored at -80°C. For MOI determination, a titration using serial dilutions of the mNeonGreen (icSARS-CoV-2-mNG) was conducted. The number of infectious virus particles per ml was calculated as the (MOI x cell number)/ (infection volume), where MOI = -ln(1 - infection rate).</p>

Caco-2 cells were co-incubated with the SARS-CoV-2 strain icSARS-CoV-2-mNG at a MOI=1.1 and Nbs or serum samples in serial dilutions in the indicated concentrations. 48 hpi cells were fixed with 2% PFA and stained with Hoechst33342 (1 µg/mL final concentration) for 10 minutes at 37°C. The staining solution was removed and exchanged for PBS. For quantification of infection rates, images were taken with the Cytation3 (Biotek) and Hoechst+ and mNG+ cells were automatically counted by the Gen5 Software (Biotek). Infection rate was determined by dividing the number of infected cells through total cell count per condition. Data were normalized to respective virus-only infection control.

<title>Generation of nanobodies blocking the SARS-CoV-2 RBD:ACE2 interface</title>
<p>Nanobodies (Nbs) are genetically engineered from heavy-chain only antibodies of alpacas. The interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 homotrimeric spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 can be blocked by receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific Nbs in the monovalent or bivalent format. Protein structures adapted from PDB 3OGO (Nb)<sup>

<title>Specificity of the NeutrobodyPlex in determining individual neutralizing immune responses</title>
<p>Serum samples of 18 convalescent SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals were analyzed using the NeutrobodyPlex and the viral infection assay. (<bold>a</bold>) For the NeutrobodyPlex on RBD, two concentrations of NM1267 (1 µM and 1 nM) were applied. Light-colored squares (high MFI(%control)) are indicative for IgGs outcompeting NM1267 from the RBD:ACE2 interface, dark-colored squares (low MFI (%control) show a continuous displacement of IgGs from serum samples in the presence of NM1267. (<bold>b</bold>) For the viral infection assay, serial dilutions of the serum samples (1:40 - 1:5120) were applied. Dark colored squares are indicative for a low infection level (low % Infection), light colored squares show a high infection rate (high % Infection). (<bold>c</bold>) The mean percent of infection (% Infection) derived from all individual serum dilutions obtained by the viral infection assay was calculated and plotted against the respective MFI (% control) obtained from the NeutrobodyPlex on RBD in the presence of NM1267 (1 nM). The Pearson correlation determined a negative correlation with r = -0.77 and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.59 (p &lt;0.05).</p>

<title>NeutrobodyPlex enables a differentiated analysis on neutralizing IgGs compared to total SARS-CoV-2 binding IgGs in individuals</title>
<p>To investigate neutralizing capacities in relation to total levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgGs in individuals, serum samples of 112 convalescent SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals were analyzed using the NeutrobodyPlex. As a marker for total IgGs we defined MFI values measured for spike-binding IgGs (MFI Spike (control)) and plotted them against normalized MFI values from IgGs binding to RBD (MFI RBD (%control)) in the presence of both concentrations of NM1267 (1 µM, left panel; 1 nM, right panel). Two patient samples (#36 and #250) displaying strikingly different neutralizing potencies are highlighted as green circles.</p>
