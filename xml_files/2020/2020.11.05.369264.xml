<abstract>
<p id="P1">The widespread occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 has had a profound effect on society and a vaccine is currently being developed. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the primary host cell receptor that interacts with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Although pneumonia is the main symptom in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the expression levels of ACE2 in the lung is low, suggesting the presence of another receptor for the spike protein. In order to identify the additional receptors for the spike protein, we screened a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from the lung cDNA library. We cloned L-SIGN as a specific receptor for the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The RBD of the spike protein did not bind to L-SIGN. In addition, not only L-SIGN but also DC-SIGN, a closely related C-type lectin receptor to L-SIGN, bound to the NTD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Importantly, cells expressing L-SIGN and DC-SIGN were both infected by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, L-SIGN and DC-SIGN induced membrane fusion by associating with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Serum antibodies from infected patients and a patient-derived monoclonal antibody against NTD inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of L-SIGN or DC-SIGN expressing cells. Our results highlight the important role of NTD in SARS-CoV-2 dissemination through L-SIGN and DC-SIGN and the significance of having anti-NTD neutralizing antibodies in antibody-based therapeutics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel human coronavirus, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus and requires specific cellular receptors to infect cells in a manner similar to that observed in other enveloped viruses such as the influenza virus and herpesviruses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 associates with ACE2 on host cells and mediates membrane fusion with the host cell membrane during infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. The spike glycoprotein is organized as a homotrimer and each chain is composed of two main segments, the S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit is responsible for receptor binding, whereas the S2 subunit mediates membrane fusion<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. Within the S1 subunit are two domains known as the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD). The RBD is recognized as the main domain that interacts with the ACE2 receptor on the host cells and antibodies against RBD block infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. Although the function of surface-exposed NTD that is structurally coupled with the RBD of the neighboring chain still remains unclear, certain human anti-NTD monoclonal antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. This suggests that NTD as well as RBD play a pivotal role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P3">Pneumonia is the primary complication associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe cases<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. Although ACE2 is highly expressed in the intestine and kidney, the expression of ACE2 in the lung is limited, and relatively low levels of ACE2 expression are observed only in type-II alveolar cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, it has remained unclear how the low levels of ACE2 in the lung are involved in pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, a single-cell RNA sequencing study of bronchoalveolar-lavage samples revealed that viral RNA could be detected in cell populations that did not express ACE2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. Taken together, this evidence indicates that ACE2 expression alone cannot explain the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and alternative entry receptors might be involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection of ACE2-low or deficient cells. Besides, SARS-CoV-2 is also detected in multiple non-pulmonary organs such as the intestine, liver, kidney, and blood vessels of COVID-19 patients<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. Based on these observations, we sought to identify a potential alternative receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using a lung cDNA library and discuss the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 dissemination within the host.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Lung cDNA library screening identified L-SIGN as a receptor for NTD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SCoV2-NTD)</title>
<p id="P4">In order to identify a receptor in the lung for the SCoV2-spike protein, we used expression cloning with a lung retrovirus cDNA library. Cells transfected with a lung cDNA library were stained with SCoV2-NTD human IgG-Fc fusion protein (SCoV2-NTD-Fc) as well as RBD-Fc fusion protein (SCoV2-RBD-Fc) and the stained cells were enriched using a cell sorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). After two rounds of enrichment, 83.7% of the cells were stained with SCoV2-NTD-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) while we could not obtain cells stained with SCoV2-RBD-Fc even after three rounds of enrichment. We obtained single-cell clones that were stained with SCoV2-NTD-Fc and amplified the genes derived from the library using PCR. Notably, L-SIGN (CD299) was identified from all the clones that were stained with SCoV2-NTD-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Following this observation, the cell clones were stained with antibodies against L-SIGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). These data suggested that L-SIGN is a major molecule that interacts with SCoV2-NTD in the lung. Although L-SIGN is mostly expressed in the liver, the lung has the second-highest expression of L-SIGN according to the RNA-seq tissue data obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTE) project (Suppl. Fig. 1).</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>NTD of the spike facilitates the binding of SCoV2 to L-SIGN and DC-SIGN via unique glycans</title>
<p id="P5">L-SIGN shares a high amino acid sequence homology and functional similarity with DC-SIGN that is also present in the lung (Suppl. Fig. 1). On the other hand, CD147 has been reported to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Accordingly, we transfected L-SIGN, DC-SIGN, ACE2, and CD147 into HEK293T cells and evaluated the binding of NTD- or RBD-Fc fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We observed that the NTD-Fc bound to both surface-expressed L-SIGN and DC-SIGN transfectants but not to ACE2 and CD147 transfectants. The RBD-Fc fusion protein bound to ACE2 but not L-SIGN, DC-SIGN, or CD147 transfectants. This indicates that the binding of NTD-Fc to L-SIGN or DC-SIGN is mediated by NTD and not the Fc portion. Anti-DC-SIGN mAb blocked the binding of NTD-Fc to DC-SIGN transfectants but not to L-SIGN transfectants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). L-SIGN and DC-SIGN have been shown to bind to intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3) through sugar chain recognition. In addition, mannan is known to be a ligand of both L-SIGN and DC-SIGN. When DC- or L-SIGN transfectants were preincubated with mannan, the binding of NTD-Fc to DC-SIGN and L-SIGN was drastically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). These data indicate that unique glycans on NTD of SARS-CoV-2 are involved in the interaction with L-SIGN and DC-SIGN.</p>
<p id="P6">The SCoV spike protein has a high sequence similarity (approximately 76%) to the SCoV2 spike protein. However, SCoV-NTD-Fc fusion protein did not bind to DC-SIGN or L-SIGN transfectants unlike the SCoV2-NTD-Fc fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Similarly, DC-SIGN-Fc and L-SIGN-Fc fusion proteins bound to flag-tagged SCoV2 spike transfectants, but bound weakly to SCoV spike transfectants although both transfectants were well stained with anti-flag mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Likewise, DC-SIGN-Fc and L-SIGN-Fc fusion proteins did not bind to the human coronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1 (Suppl. Fig. 2). These results also suggested that the NTD of the SCoV2 spike protein is specifically modified by unique glycans that mediate the binding of NTD to L-SIGN and DC-SIGN.</p>
<p id="P7">There are seven and eight N-glycosylation sites located on the NTD of SCoV and SCoV2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The protein sequence alignment of both NTDs revealed that there are two unique glycosylation sites, i.e., N74 and N149, on the SCoV2-NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Interestingly, both glycosylation sites are in the most variable region within the NTD. To identify which glycosylation sites interact with DC-SIGN, we substituted SCoV2-NTD glycosylation site Asn (N) with Gln (Q) and analyzed the binding to DC-SIGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">c</xref>). The mutation at N149Q diminished the NTD binding to DC-SIGN, while N74Q and N282Q mutation resulted in a substantial reduction of the NTD binding to DC-SIGN. These data suggest that unique glycans on N149 of NTD are responsible for the interaction with SIGNs.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>L-SIGN and DC-SIGN mediate SCoV2 infection by inducing membrane fusion</title>
<p id="P8">It has been reported that L-SIGN and DC-SIGN are involved in infection by several viruses such as HIV, HCV, and SARS-CoV. To determine whether L-SIGN and DC-SIGN are involved in SCoV2 infection, we used SCoV2 spike-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (SCoV2-PV) carrying a luciferase reporter gene to infect HEK293T cells stably transfected with L-SIGN or DC-SIGN and analyzed the outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, Suppl. Fig. 2). L-SIGN and DC-SIGN transfectants were considerably infected with SCoV2-PV. Furthermore, bona fide SCoV2 also infected L-SIGN and DC-SIGN transfectants. This indicated that DC-SIGN and L-SIGN serve as receptors for SCoV2 infection.</p>
<p id="P9">Being an enveloped virus, membrane fusion between the viral envelope of SCoV2 and the host cell membrane is a critical step in viral infection. To understand the function of L-SIGN and DC-SIGN in membrane fusion during SCoV2 infection, we used a cell-cell fusion assay using a T7 promoter-based luciferase reporter system<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. In this system, we cocultured effector cells (transfected with SCoV2 spike and T7 polymerase) with target cells (transfected with DC-SIGN or L-SIGN with luciferase gene regulated by a T7 promoter) and the luciferase gene is expressed only when cell-cell fusion between effector cells and target cells is induced. Interestingly, cell-cell fusion activity occurred when effector cells were cocultured with target cells expressing L-SIGN or DC-SIGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Additionally, when effector cells expressing SCoV2 spike protein and red fluorescence protein were cocultured with target cells expressing DC-SIGN and green fluorescence protein, fused cells expressing both red and green fluorescence proteins were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). These data suggest that L-SIGN or DC-SIGN mediate membrane fusion during SCoV2 infection of SIGN-expressing cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>moDCs facilitate SCoV-2 dissemination in trans via DC-SIGN</title>
<p id="P10">We then sought to establish the function of endogenously expressed L-SIGN or DC-SIGN. Since L-SIGN has been reported to be expressed in type II alveolar cells, L-SIGN is likely involved in the SARS-CoV-2 infection of lungs. However, we could not find any cell lines expressing endogenous L-SIGN. On the other hand, DC-SIGN is expressed on monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). For that reason, we isolated CD14<sup>+</sup> cells from human PBMC and differentiated them into DCs in the presence of cytokines, IL-4 and GM-CSF. The moDCs expressed DC-SIGN, low CD14, high MHC-II, and CD74 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). As observed with DC-SIGN transfectants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), SCoV2-NTD-Fc fusion protein bound to moDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibodies and mannan prevented the binding of NTD-Fc to moDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). These results indicated that DC-SIGN was expressed on primary cells associated with the NTD of the SCoV2 spike protein. However, moDCs were not infected with SCoV2-PV, but with the VSV-G PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Recently, CD74 induced by CIITA has been reported to inhibit the membrane fusion of SCoV2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. The considerable expression of CD74 by moDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>) may confer resistance to SCoV2 infection. Therefore, there is likely that L-SIGN or DC-SIGN expressed in CD74 negative cells could play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P11">NTD-Fc has been observed to bind well to moDCs; therefore, SCoV2 virions bound to DC-SIGN on moDCs may be infectious to other cells. We incubated moDCs with SCoV2-PV followed by extensive washing. Thereafter, moDCs incubated with SCoV2-PV were cocultured with Vero cells. Significant infection was observed in Vero cells and the infection was completely blocked by anti-DC-SIGN antibodies or mannan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Due to the general circulation of DCs in the body, SCoV2 bound to DCs via DC-SIGN may be involved in the spread of SCoV2 throughout the body.</p>

<sec id="S7">
<title>Neutralization of SIGN-mediated SCoV2 infection by antibodies</title>
<p id="P12">Antibodies are of importance in host defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The function of antibodies in SIGN-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated. 4A8 and 4A2 are COVID-19 patient-derived anti-NTD mAbs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup> and C144 is an anti-RBD mAb<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup> (Suppl. Fig. 3). Both 4A8 and C144 have been reported to neutralize SCoV2 infection. Surprisingly, anti-RBD C144 mAbs as well as anti-NTD 4A8 blocked SCoV2-PV infection of HEK-L-SIGN and HEK-DC-SIGN. In contrast, the 4A2 mAb did not block infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">b</xref>). These data indicate that RBD as well as NTD are involved in SCoV2 infection of SIGN-expressing cells. The effect of antibodies derived from SCoV2-infected patients was investigated; their sera contain antibodies against NTD and RBD (Suppl. Fig. 4). SCoV2-PV infection of DC-SIGN transfectants was hindered by the sera from two SCoV2-infected patients but not from healthy control serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). On the other hand, the sera could not neutralize VSV-G PV infection. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). This shows that SIGN-mediated infection is counteracted by serum antibodies against spike proteins similar to ACE2-mediated infection. In addition, our data imply that antibodies against NTD as well as RBD are useful in blocking SCoV2 infection<sup>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P13">SCoV2 is more widespread than its closest human coronavirus, SCoV<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>, and therapeutic interventions are yet to be identified. ACE2 is the primary receptor that interacts with the SCoV2 spike glycoprotein (i.e., RBD) and consequently facilitates viral entry<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. However, the understanding of the pathogenesis of SCoV2 remains incomplete, including the mechanism of pneumonia, thrombosis, endothelitis, and cytokine storm, which are often associated with severe cases of the disease<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>â€“<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. It is unclear how SCov2 causes pneumonia since the expression of ACE2 in the lung is relatively low and limited to type-II alveolar cells and some (&lt;2%) of the respiratory epithelial cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. Additionally, the presence of SCoV2 in non-pulmonary organs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup> as well as the detection of viral DNA in non-ACE2 expressing cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup> point to an alternative receptor for SCoV2 entry and an unknown virus-spreading mechanism within the host. Recently, neuropilin has been reported to be involved in the SCoV2 cell entry by associating with the proteolytically processed spike protein. However, transfection of neuropilin alone to HEK293 cells did not mediate the SCoV2 infection, and the coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with neuropilin was required for the SCoV2 infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. On the other hand, L-SIGN, cloned from lung cDNA library as an NTD binding receptor, and DC-SIGN mediated SCoV2 infection in the absence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Indeed, L-SIGN is expressed in lung type-II alveolar cells and endothelial cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. Furthermore, DCs or specialized macrophages expressing DC-SIGN can be found in the lung<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. Their localization in the lung further strengthens the increasingly likely role of L-SIGN and DC-SIGN as receptors of SCoV2 and may therefore be important in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.</p>
<p id="P14">The interaction of the SCoV2-NTD with L-SIGN and DC-SIGN is specific and glycan dependent. Despite the NTD of SCoV being a highly glycosylated domain, our analyses indicate that the interaction between NTD and DC-SIGN or L-SIGN is apparently unique to the current SCoV2 because L-SIGN-Fc or DC-SIGN-Fc hardly bound to the spike protein of SCoV as well as human coronavirus OC43 and HKU1. Previous findings have shown that SCoV spike protein interacts with DC-SIGN and L-SIGN albeit with a low binding efficiency<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. Similarly, we observed a very weak binding of DC- and L-SIGN-Fc to SCoV spike protein, whereas the binding to the SCoV2 spike was stronger. The overall glycosylation profile of the SCoV2 spike protein is quite different from that of SCoV<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup> with the N-linked glycan at residue 149 being the major glycan involved in the DC-SIGN and NTD interaction. The N-linked glycosylation site at residue 149 of SCoV2-NTD is absent in SCoV-NTD, although other N-linked glycosylation sites are conserved in SCoV-NTD. This may be the reason why L- and DC-SIGN interactions with NTD are more apparent in the current SCoV2. Indeed, both L-SIGN and DC-SIGN recognize a pentasaccharide motif (GlcNAc2Man3)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup> that is also present in the glycans at N149 of SCoV2-NTD<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P15">We demonstrated that L-SIGN and DC-SIGN mediate both the pseudotyped and bona fide SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, both L-SIGN and DC-SIGN induce cell-cell fusion via their association with the spike protein. SCoV2 requires proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein by the host proteases (e.g., TMPRSS2) after binding to an entry receptor<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. Besides, the lysosomal protease, cathepsin L was shown to proteolytically activate the SCoV spike protein during viral entry thereby facilitating membrane fusion with the host cell membrane<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. Recent research revealed that the thyroglobulin domain (cathepsin L inhibitor) of the CD74 p41 isoform blocks the cathepsin L-mediated viral entry of SCoV2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. CD74 is an essential molecule for the proper assembling of MHC class II molecules and its expression is regulated by CIITA, a principal transcription factor for MHC class II expression<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>. Because moDCs express both CD74 and MHC class II molecules favorably, CD74 appears to be responsible for the resistance of moDCs to SCoV2 infection. However, expression of CD74 is largely limited to immune cells such as B cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells, while most cells including endothelial cells do not express CD74. Therefore, L-SIGN or DC-SIGN expressing cells that lack CD74 expression appear to be susceptible to SCoV2 infection.</p>
<p id="P16">We also show that moDCs facilitate pseudotyped SCoV2 infection in Vero cells in trans. Trans-infection by DCs is well reported in HIV infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. Due to their migration in the body, DCs may function as transporters of SCoV2 by associating with the virus via DC-SIGN to infect cells expressing ACE2 or L-SIGN, which in turn facilitates virus dissemination in the host. This might explain the presence of viral protein in other organs, including the liver<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>, where L-SIGN is highly expressed in human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells that do not express CD74<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>. Furthermore, infection of the endothelial cells of blood vessels may consequently lead to thrombosis, which is frequently linked to severe disease conditions<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. Several human tissues express similar mRNA expression levels of L-SIGN as those of the lung, making them likely targets of SCoV2 infection.</p>
<p id="P17">The presence of neutralizing antibodies for DC-SIGN-mediated SCoV2 infection in COVID-19 patients implies the relevance of NTD as a therapeutic target besides RBD. Notably, the majority of the isolated mAb from SCoV2 patients did not recognize RBD and those mAbs that neutralize SCoV2 failed to prevent binding of the spike to ACE2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. In our study, the NTD-specific mAb, 4A8, neutralized SIGN-mediated infection of SCoV2, suggesting the therapeutic potential of anti-NTD antibodies against SIGN-mediated infection. More importantly, anti-RBD mAb also inhibited the SCoV2-PV infection of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN expressing cells. Although HEK293 cells do not express ACE2, certain molecules on HEK293 cells may interact with RBD becoming involved in infection of SIGN-expressing cells. This may suggest that L-SIGN or DC-SIGN is required for the infection of ACE2-low or ACE2-negative cells, where levels are not enough to mediate SCoV2 infection. Further analysis of L-SIGN or DC-SIGN-mediated infection would be important to understand the etiology of SARS-CoV-2-related diseases. Also, targeting SIGN-mediated infection as well as ACE2-mediated infection would be important for effective vaccine development.</p>

Asterisks indicate statistical significance derived from an unpaired T-test; **<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001. <bold>c,</bold> Blocking of SCoV2-NTD-Fc binding to moDCs by two specific anti-DC-SIGN mAbs, isotype antibody, and mannan. The percentage of binding is calculated based on the MFI value of non-blocking control. Asterisks indicate statistical significance derived from unpaired T-test; **<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001. <bold>d,</bold> SCoV2-PV and VSV-G PV infection on moDCs. Asterisks indicate statistical significance derived from unpaired T-test; *<italic>P</italic> = 0.0021. <bold>e,</bold> SCoV2-PV infection in trans on Vero E6 cells facilitated by moDCs. moDCs was incubated with SCoV2-PV in the presence or absence of anti-DC-SIGN antibody or mannan, and cocultured with Vero E6 cells after extensive washing. Infectivity was calculated based on the luciferase activity of a non-blocking control. Asterisks indicate statistical significance derived from unpaired T-test; *<italic>P</italic> = 0.005. Data are representative of three independent experiments.</p>

<title>Neutralizing potency of SCoV2 convalescent patientsâ€™ sera and anti-NTD antibodies to L-SIGN and DC-SIGN mediated infection.</title>
<p>Neutralization assay of pseudotyped SCoV2 infection on HEK-L-SIGN, HEK-DC-SIGN, and Vero cells by human anti-SCoV2-NTD mAbs <bold>(a)</bold> and human anti-SCoV2-RBD (C144) specific mAb <bold>(b)</bold>. SCoV2-PV preincubated with mAbs was used to infect the cells. Neutralization assay of SCoV2-PV <bold>(c)</bold> and VSV-G PV <bold>(d)</bold> infection of L-SIGN or DC-SIGN transfectants by serum from SCoV2-infected patients or healthy control. SCoV2-PV or VSV-G PV preincubated with sequentially diluted serum was used to infect L-SIGN or DC-SIGN transfectants and luciferase activity was measured. The percentage of infectivity was calculated based on the luminescence value of no serum or mAb control. Data are representative of three independent experiments.</p>
