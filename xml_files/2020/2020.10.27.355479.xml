Determining how quickly viruses are inactivated to mitigate health risks is not always feasible due to biosafety restrictions or difficulties with virus culturability. Therefore, methods that would rapidly predict kinetics of virus inactivation by UV<sub>254</sub> would be valuable, particularly for emerging and difficult-to-culture viruses. We conducted a rapid systematic literature review to collect high-quality inactivation rate constants for a wide range of viruses. Using these data and basic virus information (e.g., genome sequence attributes), we developed and evaluated four different model classes, including linear and non-linear approaches, to find the top performing prediction model. For both the (+) ssRNA and dsDNA virus types, multiple linear regressions were the top performing model classes. In both cases, the cross-validated root mean squared relative prediction errors were similar to those associated with experimental rate constants. We tested the models by predicting and measuring inactivation rate constants for two viruses that were not identified in our systematic review, including a (+) ssRNA mouse coronavirus and a dsDNA marine bacteriophage; the predicted rate constants were within 7% and 71% of the experimental rate constants, respectively. Finally, we applied our models to predict the UV<sub>254</sub> rate constants of several viruses for which high-quality UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation data are not available. Our models will be valuable for predicting inactivation kinetics of emerging or difficult-to-culture viruses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Viruses can cause diverse and costly illnesses in humans and other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). A variety of approaches have therefore been developed to decontaminate food, water, air, and surfaces that may contain infective viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). UV<sub>254</sub> treatment, in particular, is gaining popularity as an alternative to more traditional chemical disinfection strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Viruses can have highly variable UV<sub>254</sub> susceptibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). For example, two dsDNA viruses, adenovirus type 40 and bacteriophage T6, are inactivated by UV<sub>254</sub> at the widely varying rates of ∼ 0.06 cm<sup>2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) and ∼ 5.4 cm<sup>2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), respectively.</p><p id="P3">Viruses have diverse genome types, including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). UV<sub>254</sub> inactivates by primarily targeting viral genetic material, and the different biochemical structures associated with these viral genome types result in distinct sensitivities to UV<sub>254</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Nucleic acid primary structure, or nucleotide base sequence, also affects UV<sub>254</sub> genome reactivity – pyrimidine bases, for instance, are about an order of magnitude more reactive with UV<sub>254</sub> than purine bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Different replication modes among viruses can also impact susceptibility to UV<sub>254</sub>. For example, the reverse transcriptase enzymes involved in generation of retrovirus mRNA may have different fidelities to photochemical modifications in nucleic acid compared to the RNA dependent RNA polymerase enzymes used by other RNA viruses to synthesize mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Additional differences in viral infection cycles impact virus sensitivity to UV<sub>254</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). dsDNA virus genomes, for example, can undergo nucleic acid repair once inside host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). This means that a virus may be inactivated by UV<sub>254</sub> treatment through base modification, only to be repaired and thus rendered infectious again when such repair mechanisms are available. We note these differences in virus genome type and mode of mRNA generation are utilized in the Baltimore virus classification system (e.g., Group 1: dsDNA viruses, Group IV: (+) ssRNA viruses) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Virus disinfection methods are evaluated by enumerating infective viruses before and after treatment, typically with virus culture systems. Relying on culture-based approaches to evaluate inactivation kinetics is often problematic. Most notably, many human viruses that are spread through the environment are not readily culturable. For highly pathogenic viruses that are culturable, disinfection experiments are complicated by biosafety restrictions. Disinfection experiments with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2), for example, are limited to biosafety level 3 laboratories and work with ebolaviruses require biosafety level 4 facilities. Alternative approaches for determining virus inactivation kinetics would be valuable, especially for difficult-to-culture and emerging viruses. Earlier studies have worked towards a predictive manner of evaluating UV<sub>254</sub> virus inactivation based on virus attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Recently developed modeling strategies, an improved understanding of virus UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation mechanisms, and additional high-quality inactivation data published in recent years provide the necessary tools and information to expand upon these initial predictive approaches.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we develop models to predict rate constants for virus inactivation with UV<sub>254</sub> treatment in aqueous suspension using variables that are expected to play a role in inactivation, such as genome sequence composition and genome repair information. We conducted a rapid systematic review to gather high quality virus inactivation data from the literature and used the resulting data set to train and validate the predictive performance of four different models (i.e., multiple linear regression, elastic net regularization, boosted trees, and random forests). The models developed in this research will facilitate rapid evaluation of UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation rate constants for a broad class of virus types based solely on virus genome sequence and genome repair information.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Numerous UV<sub>254</sub> rate constants are available, but only for a limited subset of viruses</title><p id="P6">We conducted a rapid systematic review to collect UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation rate constants and used them for the training and validation of models developed to predict virus inactivation kinetics. Of 2,416 initial studies, 531 underwent full text review, and 103 studies were included in the final data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">SI Appendix, Fig. S1</xref>). Only data from studies passing a set of experimental criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">SI Appendix, Supplementary Text</xref>) were included to ensure collection of high-quality rate constants. These studies produced 224 experimental inactivation rate constants for 59 viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix, Table S1</xref>). Viruses of different strains and types were considered unique.</p><p id="P7">More than 350 studies from the full text review that reported conducting UV virus inactivation in aqueous suspension were not included in the final data set. Data were excluded most commonly because the article did not address UV<sub>254</sub> attenuation in the experimental solution and it could not be ruled out based on details in the materials and methods. Nearly 50% of the extracted rate constants represented only five different viruses. For example, there were 62 different experimental inactivation rates for bacteriophage MS2; in contrast, several viruses, including hepatitis E virus, only had one reported inactivation rate constant, and there were many human viruses with no data that met the review criteria (e.g., influenza viruses, ebolaviruses, coronaviruses, herpesviruses). Ultimately 13, 84, 111, 4, and 12 experimental inactivation rate constants were extracted for ssDNA, dsDNA, (+) ssRNA, (-) ssRNA, and dsRNA viruses, respectively, representing 3, 26, 22, 2, and 5 unique viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). No rate constants met the inclusion criteria for retroviral (+) ssRNA viruses, referred to as RT-ssRNA viruses. The inactivation rate constants spanned ∼2.5 orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and ranged from 0.021 to 7.6 cm<sup>2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup>. The (-) ssRNA viruses had the largest rate constants on average (k = 3.6 cm<sup>2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup>), while dsRNA viruses had the lowest average rate constants (k = 0.15 cm<sup>2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup>). dsDNA virus constants exhibited the widest range of rate constants, spanning from 0.021 to 5.4 cm<sup>2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup> with a mean of 0.55 cm<sup>2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup>.</p><p id="P8">Individual models were developed for the (+) ssRNA and dsDNA virus classes. The limited data sets for viruses in the other Baltimore classifications made it infeasible to develop individual predictive models for the other groups. The data sets used for (+) ssRNA and dsDNA model training and validation included 19 (+) ssRNA viruses with 93 experimental inactivation rate constants and 16 dsDNA viruses with 50 inactivation rate constants, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix, Table S1</xref>). The model developed with all viruses from the systematic review included 43 viruses with 168 experimental inactivation rate constants.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Rate constants predicted using common modeling approaches</title><p id="P9">We used the data collected in the rapid systematic literature review to develop linear regression, elastic net regularization, random forests, and boosted trees models for predicting inactivation rate constants based on several predictors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">SI Appendix, Table S2</xref>).

Various subsets of genomic variables were included in multiple linear regression development. Because these genomic variables are highly collinear, we used principal components that incorporated various genomic variable subsets as predictors in the regression models. Ultimately, the multiple linear regression model with one principal component that incorporated the numbers of cytosines (Cs), uracils (Us), uracil doublets (UUs), and uracil triplets (UUUs) resulted in the lowest RMSrPE (0.22 ± 0.23; RMSrPE ± standard error; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">SI Appendix, Table S3</xref>). Other multiple linear regressions performed similarly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">SI Appendix, Table S4</xref>). The optimized elastic net regularization and boosted trees models resulted in slightly higher RMSrPEs than the top performing multiple linear regression model (RMSrPE<sub>elastic net</sub> = 0.28 ± 0.26, RMSrPE<sub>boosted trees</sub> = 0.32 ± 0.28; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">SI Appendix, Table S3</xref>), and the random forests model had the largest RMSrPE of the (+) ssRNA virus models (RMSrPE<sub>random forests</sub> = 0.95 ± 0.48; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">SI Appendix, Table S3</xref>). Model performance was significantly reduced in the elastic net and random forests models as compared to the multiple linear regression model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">SI Appendix, Table S5</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Predicted (+) ssRNA virus rate constants from the top performing model were within 51% of the mean experimental virus inactivation rate constants obtained from the systematic review, with the exception of the rate constant for Atlantic Halibut Nodavirus (percent error = 182%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">SI Appendix, Fig. S2a</xref>). The RMSrPE from the top performing linear regression model was lower than the estimated relative inter-experimental error of viruses with multiple rate constants in the literature (RMSrPE = 0.22 ± 0.23; relative inter-experimental error = 0.33; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). In other words, the predicted rate constants for new (+) ssRNA viruses would be at least as accurate as the rate constants determined through experimental studies.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>dsDNA virus model</title><p id="P12">The genomic variables used in dsDNA model development were equivalent to the (+) ssRNA models, with the exception that thymines (Ts) were substituted for Us (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix, Table S1</xref>). A major distinction of dsDNA viruses is that their genomes can undergo repair in host cells and this impacts their susceptibility to UV<sub>254</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).

We included categorical predictors for genome repair mode (i.e., host cell mediated, virus-gene controlled using one repair system, or virus-gene controlled using multiple repair systems) and host cell type (i.e., prokaryotic host, eukaryotic host with wild type repair, or eukaryotic host with reduced repair) in the dsDNA virus inactivation rate constant models. Genome repair mode and host cell type were assigned based on available information and are described in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">SI Appendix</xref>.</p><p id="P13">The RMSrPE of the four optimized dsDNA model classes ranged from 0.31 to 1.6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">SI Appendix, Table S3</xref>), and the optimized multiple linear regression model outperformed the three other optimized model classes (RMSrPE = 0.31 ± 0.28; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">SI Appendix, Table S3</xref>). The optimized elastic net and boosted trees RMSrPEs were slightly higher (RMSrPE<sub>elastic net</sub> = 0.79 ± 0.46, RMSrPE<sub>boosted trees</sub> = 0.70 ± 0.43), though the difference in model performance was not significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">SI Appendix, Table S5</xref>), and the random forests model performed significantly worse (RMSrPE<sub>random forests</sub> = 1.6 ± 0.66). The top linear regression model included the genome repair mode and host cell type predictors, as well as one principal component comprising the three genomic variables numbers of thymine doublets (TT), thymine quintuplets (TTTTT), and Cs. As with the top-performing (+) ssRNA model, many of the regressions tested with different genomic variable subsets had similar prediction performance, making it difficult to identify which genomic variables were critical for predicting dsDNA virus rate constants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">SI Appendix, Table S4</xref>). A point estimate comparison of the regression coefficients for the standardized principal component (β<sub>PC1</sub> = 0.46), genome repair mode (β<sub>genome repair mode</sub> = 2.7), and host cell type (β<sub>host cell type</sub> = −0.37) predictors indicates that the genome repair mode predictor is approximately 5.9 times more important than the principal component predictor (β<sub>genome repair mode</sub>/β<sub>PC1</sub> = 2.7/0.46). Host cell type was comparable in importance to the genomic variable contribution, collectively represented by the principal component. Prediction performance dropped significantly without genome repair mode as a predictor (RMSrPE<sub>opt</sub> = 0.31 ± 0.28, RMSrPE<sub>no repair</sub> = 1.0 ± 0.52; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">SI Appendix, Table S5</xref>), further highlighting the importance of genome repair in UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation.</p><p id="P14">The multiple linear regression model accurately predicted inactivation rate constants across the wide range of dsDNA virus susceptibilities to UV<sub>254</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>).

Predictions were poorest for T7M, B40-8, and lambda predicted (percent error = 62%, 63%, and 62%, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">SI Appendix, Fig. S2b</xref>), which are bacteriophages with the same form of genome repair mode. The poor prediction of viruses from this group indicates that some of the rate constants in the training data for viruses with these attributes may be inaccurate, leading to worse performance for bacteriophages with host mediated repair.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>All-virus model</title><p id="P15">Larger data sets generally add predictive power to models, though the increased signal from additional data can be attenuated or negated by increased heterogeneity. We therefore compared the performance of the separate (+) ssRNA and dsDNA virus models with a model that incorporated data from all Baltimore classes. In addition to the genomic variables and repair-related predictors (i.e., genome repair mode and host cell type) included for (+) ssRNA and dsDNA viruses, a categorical predictor for nucleic acid type (i.e., double-stranded or single-stranded) was included. Boosted trees models were the top performing models using all viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">SI Appendix, Table S3</xref>); these performed significantly worse than the models trained using only (+) ssRNA viruses (RMSrPE<sub>(+) ssRNA</sub> = 0.22 ± 0.23, RMSrPE<sub>all</sub> = 0.45 ± 0.33; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">SI Appendix, Table S5</xref>) or only dsDNA viruses (RMSrPE<sub>dsDNA</sub> = 0.31 ± 0.28 vs RMSrPE<sub>all</sub> = 0.45 ± 0.35; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">SI Appendix, Tables S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S5</xref>). This suggests that using our modeling approach and combining viruses with diverse genome types and infection cycles into one model can negatively impact performance of virus predictions, possibly owing to insufficient data from less studied classes. Based on these results, we used the separate (+) ssRNA and dsDNA models for subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Predicted rate constants align with new experimental rate constants</title><p id="P16">We applied the optimized (+) ssRNA and dsDNA models to predict the rate constants of one (+) ssRNA virus and one dsDNA virus for which experimental data were not available and then measured the rate constants experimentally. Specifically, we predicted and measured the rate constants for MHV, a (+) ssRNA mouse coronavirus, and HS2, a dsDNA marine bacteriophage. Based on its large genome size (i.e., ∼ 270% longer than the largest (+) ssRNA virus genome included in the training and validation set) MHV provided an opportunity to assess the (+) ssRNA model’s predictive power using a virus with attributes outside those in the training and validation set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">SI Appendix, Fig. S3</xref>). HS2 bacteriophage has similar genomic attributes to many of the other viruses in the data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">SI Appendix, Fig. S3</xref>), and genome repair-related predictors are the same as those for most of the phages. Bacteriophage MS2 was included in each experimental solution to confirm UV<sub>254</sub> doses; the measured MS2 rate constants were in line with those in the literature (0.12 to 0.14 cm<sup>2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">SI Appendix, Fig. S4</xref>and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P17">The predicted inactivation rate constant for MHV (k<sub>pred</sub> = 2.05 ± 0.88 cm<sup>2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup>; mean ± 95% margin of error) was not significantly different than the experimental rate constant (k<sub>exp</sub> = 1.92 ± 0.17 cm<sup>-2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup>), with a percent error of only 7% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). The prediction accuracy the model achieved despite MHV’s elevated UV<sub>254</sub> sensitivity compared with other (+) ssRNA viruses in the data set highlights how linear regression approaches are capable of extrapolating predictions to values distinct from those used in training and validation. In comparison, the MHV inactivation rate constant predicted with the top performing nonlinear approach, boosted trees, was 79% different the experimental value, with a rate constant of 0.40 ± 0.25 cm<sup>2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup>. The accuracy of the MHV rate constant prediction and the relatively low RMSPE obtained for the top performing (+) ssRNA virus model provide confidence that the (+) ssRNA model can effectively predict UV<sub>254</sub> rate constants for emerging or difficult-to-culture (+) ssRNA viruses.</p><p id="P18">The experimental HS2 inactivation kinetics exhibited significant tailing beyond UV<sub>254</sub> fluences of 50 mJ cm<sup>-2</sup>; we therefore modeled the first ∼5-log<sub>10</sub> of inactivation to obtain a rate constant from the first-order portion of the curve. The resulting dsDNA HS2 bacteriophage experimental rate constant of k<sub>exp</sub> = 0.28 ± 0.08 cm<sup>2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup> was 71% lower than the predicted rate constant of k<sub>pred</sub> = 0.48 ± 0.29 cm<sup>2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). Although the error of this dsDNA estimate was larger than that of the (+) ssRNA estimate, the HS2 predicted and experimental constants are not significantly different. This result, in combination with the cross-validation results, suggest that the dsDNA model can effectively predict if a dsDNA virus is particularly resistant to UV<sub>254</sub> treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Predictive models estimate inactivation of several emerging and difficult-to-culture viruses</title><p id="P19">Our systematic review identified a number of important human viruses that lack published high quality UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation rate constants in the literature.

These predictions resulted in a range of inactivation rate constants, from 0.28 for human norovirus to 3.0 cm<sup>2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup> for human cytomegalovirus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">Through evaluation of a large set of models from four distinct model classes developed with the best currently available data, we identified effective models for predicting UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation rate constants of (+) ssRNA and dsDNA viruses using simple virus attributes as model predictors. UV<sub>254</sub> primarily targets viral nucleic acid during irradiation. Pyrimidine bases are more photoreactive than purines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), and pyrimidine dimers, in particular, cause a large portion of the UV-induced damage to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Limited research centered on ssRNA photolysis suggests pyrimidine hydrates are the primary lesions inducing UV damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Photochemical damage to nucleic acids can stall or inhibit enzymes required for productive viral infection of host cells (46– 48). Based on this <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge, we included several combinations of pyrimidine bases as predictors in our (+) ssRNA and dsDNA models, namely the numbers of U, UU, UUU, UUUU, UUUUU, C, UC, and CU in (+) ssRNA models and the numbers of T, TT, TTT, TTTT, TTTTT, C, TC, and CT in dsDNA models.</p><p id="P21">Ultimately, the top performing (+) ssRNA virus model employed one principal component incorporating multiple genomic variables (i.e., numbers of C, U, UU, and UUU), and the top performing dsDNA virus model employed repair mode, host cell type, and one principal component representing three genomic variables (i.e., numbers of C, TT, TTTTT). The relative importance of variables in our top performing predictive models may provide insight into the mechanisms driving UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation of viruses. Among the (+) ssRNA models, many of the multiple linear regression models that included distinct subsets of genomic variables performed similarly. This is likely because these genomic variables are so highly correlated that different variable combinations resulted in a similar set of principal components as predictors in modeling, ultimately yielding similar performance among different models. Separating the effects of individual genomic variables was therefore difficult in the (+) ssRNA model. Although the top performing model incorporated multiple genomic variables, several linear regression models using as few as one genomic variable as a predictor resulted in similar model performance. This finding demonstrates that simple aspects of the (+) ssRNA genome provide all the necessary information to accurately predict rate constants for this class of viruses. In the dsDNA model, performance was significantly improved when genome repair predictors were included in addition to principal components incorporating genomic variables. The importance of genome repair was expected. For example, the two dsDNA bacteriophages T2 and T4 have similar genome sizes and composition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">SI Appendix, Fig. S3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>) but dissimilar UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation rate constants (5.1 cm<sup>-2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup> for T2 and 1.7 cm<sup>-2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup> for T4; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Appendix, Table S1</xref>). T4 phage’s UV<sub>254</sub> resistance is due to an additional virus-controlled repair gene in the T4 genome not present in the T2 genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). Interestingly, the relative contribution of genomic variables in the dsDNA model was significantly less than the genome repair predictors, which suggests that genome repair is a more important factor in dsDNA UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation than genomic variables.</p><p id="P22">Including genome repair as a model predictor presented some limitations. First, the mode and extent of genome repair is not known for many viruses and has not been well-studied across virus families. A single predictor encompassing the contribution of genome repair was therefore not possible. We instead applied multiple categorical predictors. With this approach, only viruses that shared a particular genome repair mode or host cell type with at least one other virus in the dsDNA data set could be used in cross-validation. Ultimately, the data set used for dsDNA model development and validation lacked numerous forms of dsDNA viruses with distinct repair modes and host cell types, resulting in uncertainty in model performance for certain dsDNA viruses not represented in the training and validation set. To improve future dsDNA virus models, it is critical to have a better understanding of genome repair mechanisms and how they affect UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation.</p><p id="P23">Our top performing UV<sub>254</sub> virus prediction models provide improvements over earlier prediction approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). On average, the (+) ssRNA and dsDNA virus models predicted rate constants to within ∼0.2x and ∼0.3x of experimental constants, respectively. A previous approach using genome length to determine genome size-normalized sensitivity values for a number of virus families expected uncertainties in predicted values of ∼2x (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). A more recent approach developed predictive models for ssRNA and dsDNA UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation using genome dimer formation potential, a value that incorporated pyrimidine doublets, genome length, and purines with adjacent pyrimidine doublets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Their reported error as a coefficient of determination (i.e., R<sup>2</sup>) was 0.67 for ssRNA viruses compared to 0.74 (adjusted R<sup>2</sup>) for our model, and an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.62 for dsDNA viruses compared to 0.99 (adjusted R<sup>2</sup>) for our model. Several factors can be attributed to the improved performance of our models, including extensive curation of data based on quality and the incorporation of genome repair into dsDNA modeling.</p><p id="P24">In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the need for effective decontamination strategies, our predictive models provided an opportunity to predict rate constants for a critical group of viruses with very little published inactivation data. Limited data on UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation for coronaviruses in aqueous suspension are available and the published information did not pass the inclusion criteria of our rapid systematic review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). This paucity of information on the susceptibility of coronaviruses to UV<sub>254</sub> is of critical importance for developing effective decontamination strategies. Our predicted rate constants for SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS, and our measured rate constant for the mouse coronavirus MHV, suggest that coronaviruses are much more susceptible to UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation than other (+) ssRNA viruses. A recent estimate of SARS-CoV-2 UV<sub>254</sub> susceptibility using the previously developed Lytle and Sagripanti approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) is ∼ 1.7x greater than our estimate indicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). Discrepancies in new experimental coronavirus data still persist, likely stemming from a lack of checks on UV<sub>254</sub> attenuation of suspensions.</p><p id="P25">More robust models are possible with larger data sets that consist of more diverse viruses. Unfortunately, a large portion of UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation data found during the rapid systematic review did not pass our inclusion criteria. The most common reason for excluding data from our systematic review was a failure to report solution UV<sub>254</sub> attenuation. An earlier study of SARS-CoV-1 inactivation by UV<sub>254</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>), for example, did not account for UV<sub>254</sub> attenuation in the experimental DMEM suspension. The reported inactivation rate constant of 0.003 cm<sup>2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup> was nearly three orders of magnitude lower than our predicted rate constant for SARS-CoV-1 and our measured value for MHV, likely in part due to solution attenuation. We estimate that their rate constant would be closer to 0.35 cm<sup>2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup> after accounting for solution attenuation. This value more closely aligns with our coronavirus values. Similarly, several studies reported UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation of viruses in blood products without describing how attenuation was considered in their reported doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Although these doses are likely representative for these fluids, they cannot be extrapolated to other matrices. More stringent reporting of UV<sub>254</sub> experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>), including matrix solution transmission at 254 nm, will facilitate future modeling efforts. We note when UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation rate constants are known for a solution with 100% transmittance (e.g., purified virus in buffer solution), the rate constant can be adjusted to account for a solution with significant attenuation (e.g., blood products) based on the Beer-Lambert law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>).</p><p id="P26">The developed models allow us to predict the effectiveness of current UV<sub>254</sub> treatment strategies on viral pathogens that are difficult or impossible to culture. For example, human norovirus, which causes gastrointestinal disease, is a major target of UV<sub>254</sub> disinfection processes in water treatment and food processing. Our (+) ssRNA virus model predicts an inactivation rate constant of 0.28 cm<sup>2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup> for human norovirus GII.4, which is similar to our recently reported rate constant of k = 0.27 cm<sup>2</sup> mJ<sup>-1</sup> for human norovirus GII.4 Sydney using RT-qPCR data coupled with a full-genome extrapolation approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). This finding indicates that current water treatment guidelines for adequate UV<sub>254</sub> virus inactivation, which are defined to treat adenovirus 41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>), are more than sufficient to inactivate human norovirus to acceptable levels. In fact, none of the viruses for which we predicted rate constants had UV<sub>254</sub> resistance greater than viruses in the <italic>Adenoviridae</italic> family.</p><p id="P27">The limited and unbalanced data set that we obtained from the systematic review and used in modeling efforts created challenges in our modeling work. Of primary concern, we could not take a commonly used approach to evaluating models, in which a portion of data is held back during model development to assess performance. Holding back the typical 10 – 20% of data would correspond to holding back only two to four viruses from the (+) ssRNA or dsDNA classes for testing. This could result in high variance estimates of prediction performance that would also be highly dependent on the viruses withheld during training. We consequently used leave-one-virus-out cross-validation to more efficiently estimate prediction performance on out of sample data. Another limitation of our models is that they were developed and validated for only (+) ssRNA and dsDNA viruses. Although many human viruses are in these two classes, many emerging and noteworthy human viruses belong to other classes. In particular, the (-) ssRNA virus class includes several important human pathogens, such as lassa virus, nipah virus, influenza virus, and ebolavirus. Since only two (-) ssRNA viruses were included in our data set, we were unable to assess whether inactivation rate constants for viruses in this group could be accurately predicted with our (+) ssRNA model. More high quality UV<sub>254</sub> experimental inactivation data for a broader set of viruses would facilitate the holdout approach for validating models and the development of models for other virus Baltimore classification groups.</p><p id="P28">This research demonstrates the value of predictive models for estimating virus fate in various settings. Using readily available viral genome data, we developed models to predict UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation of (+) ssRNA and dsDNA viruses. The benefits of predictive models are underlined by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic: access to the biosafety level 3 laboratories required to work with SARS-CoV-2 has been limited and, as a result, few experimental inactivation studies have been performed. Our approach can rapidly determine virus susceptibility to UV<sub>254</sub> using available genomes, but without relying on culture systems that are often unavailable or difficult to access. Other potential applications of our models including identifying outlier UV<sub>254</sub> data that are published and predicting potential worst-case scenarios for viruses and their susceptibility to UV<sub>254</sub>. Ultimately, we expect that this predictive modeling approach can be applied to estimate inactivation of microorganisms with other disinfectants and in different settings, such as on surfaces or in air.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Rapid systematic review of UV<sub>254</sub> virus inactivation data</title><p id="P29">We used a rapid systematic literature review to capture high quality UV<sub>254</sub> virus inactivation data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>).

For publications that contained valuable data, but for which not all criteria could be evaluated, corresponding authors were contacted when possible to inquire about the criteria. For studies that reported multiple UV<sub>254</sub> inactivation experiments for the same virus (e.g., in different solutions, with multiple UV<sub>254</sub> sources), we combined all data to determine a single inactivation rate constant with linear regression analysis.

We therefore conducted principal component analysis (PCA) on the genomic variables prior to linear modeling to reduce variable dimensionality and eliminate collinearity. The predictors nucleic acid type, genome repair mode, and host cell type were not included in the PCA. We then developed linear regression models containing either the first, first and second, or first, second, and third principal components, as well as the other predictors. Only the first through third principal components were assessed for inclusion in the linear regression models, because they cumulatively explained 97% of the variation in genomic variables. Genomic variables were standardized to unit variance prior to PCA to eliminate dissimilarities in the magnitude of variable values. Linear regression can include one or more predictors that can affect model accuracy.
