<abstract>
<p id="P1">The SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein mediates viral entry into cells expressing the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S protein engages ACE2 through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), an independently folded 197-amino acid fragment of the 1273-amino acid S-protein protomer. The RBD is the primary SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing epitope and a critical target of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Here we show that this RBD conjugated to each of two carrier proteins elicited more potent neutralizing responses in immunized rodents than did a similarly conjugated proline-stabilized S-protein ectodomain. Nonetheless, the native RBD expresses inefficiently, limiting its usefulness as a vaccine antigen. However, we show that an RBD engineered with four novel glycosylation sites (gRBD) expresses markedly more efficiently, and generates a more potent neutralizing responses as a DNA vaccine antigen, than the wild-type RBD or the full-length S protein, especially when fused to multivalent carriers such as an <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> ferritin 24-mer. Further, gRBD is more immunogenic than the wild-type RBD when administered as a subunit protein vaccine. Our data suggest that multivalent gRBD antigens can reduce costs and doses, and improve the immunogenicity, of all major classes of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.</p>

<p id="P2">Coronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded, positive-strand RNA viruses of the family <italic>Corornaviridae</italic> (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</italic>). At least seven coronaviruses infect humans: the α-coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, and the β-coronaviruses SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), HCoV-NL63, CoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the recently described SARS-CoV-2, a β-coronavirus closely related to human SARS-CoV-1 (79.0% nucleotide identity) and to SARS-CoV-like variants isolated from bats (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</italic>). SARS-CoV-2 infection causes flu-like symptoms in many patients, but in other cases develops into an acute pulmonary syndrome (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</italic>). SARS-CoV-1 causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), whereas disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 has been named COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV-1, requires expression of the cellular receptor ACE2 to infect cells (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</italic>).</p>
<p id="P3">Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into ACE2-expressing cells is mediated by its spike (S) protein (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</italic>). The coronavirus S protein is a type I viral entry protein similar to influenza hemagglutinin and the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</italic>). Like these latter entry proteins, the S protein is processed into two domains, S1 and S2 (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</italic>). S1 binds ACE2, whereas S2 anchors the S protein to the viral membrane. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein has an efficient furin cleavage site at its S1/S2 boundary, and this site is processed in virus-producing cells (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</italic>). In contrast, the SARS-CoV-1 S1/S2 junction is cleaved by extracellular or target-cell proteases including TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</italic>). Both S proteins require processing at a second site, S2’, within the S2 domain to mediate fusion of the viral and target cell membranes (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</italic>).</p>
<p id="P4">The receptor-binding domains (RBDs, also described as S<sup>B</sup>) of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 directly bind ACE2 (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</italic>). These RBDs are structurally and functionally distinct from the remainder of the S1 domain, and express and fold as independent domains (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</italic>). Both RBDs are highly stable and held together by four disulfide bonds. Structural studies of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound to ACE2 have identified a variable region, termed the receptor-binding motif (RBM), which directly engages ACE2 (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</italic>). This region is divergent between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, although both RBD bind ACE2 in the same orientation and rely on conserved, mostly aromatic, residues to engage this receptor. The divergence between the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBM domains suggest that this region is subject to ongoing positive selection from the humoral response in various hosts. However, some ten months into the pandemic, changes in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD remain exceedingly rare, consistent with a relatively slow overall rate of viral mutation throughout the genome.</p>
<p id="P5">Because the S protein is the major protein exposed on the virion, and because its activity can be impeded with antibodies, it is likely the major target of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Soluble trimeric S proteins, including those stabilized through various mechanisms, have been tested as SARS-CoV-1 vaccines, and similar approaches are now being taken against SARS-CoV-2 (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</italic>). In fact, all of the vaccines likely to be available in the first half of 2021 express or deliver a fulllength or ectodomain S protein, typically engineered with a pair of prolines designed to enhance the stability of these constructs (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</italic>). Nonetheless, the neutralizing activity of these vaccines correlates with RBD recognition, and the vast majority of potent neutralizing antibodies described to date, including those in late-stage clinical trials, target the RBD (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</italic>).</p>
<p id="P6">A different approach, immunizing with the RBD alone, has been shown to raise potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 in rodents (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</italic>). Although the RBD presents fewer epitopes than the S-protein trimer, this approach may have key advantages. First, a much larger fraction of RBD epitopes, essentially all RBD epitopes exposed on the native trimer, are neutralizing. Thus the RBD has fewer decoy epitopes and a greater fraction of the antibodies elicited will be neutralizing. Second, the 197-amino-acid RBD (S-protein residues 331-527) is much easier to produce than the full S-protein trimer. Thus the costs of production of a subunit vaccine will be lower, and expression from an mRNA or adenoviral vaccine will be greater, allowing dose sparing and limiting side effects. Third, an RBD-based vaccine is less likely to include linear or conformational epitopes that, in rare cases, might promote autoimmune disorders through molecular mimicry. Similarly, fewer epitopes reduce residual concerns about antibody-dependent enhancement, observed with other coronaviruses and primarily mediated through non-neutralizing epitopes. Finally, multivalent antigens are typically more immunogenic than dimeric or trimeric vaccines, and multivalency is much more easily obtained with RBD-based vaccines compared with those based on S-protein trimers.</p>
<p id="P7">Here we show that when equal amounts of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein ectodomain or the RBD alone were conjugated to each of two carrier proteins, the RBD generated neutralizing responses equal to or greater than those of the S-protein. We nonetheless noted that the RBD expressed inefficiently, especially as a fusion protein with a range of multivalent carrier proteins. We therefore engineered the RBD to correct this deficiency and showed that this modified RBD, fused to five different multivalent carrier proteins and expressed as DNA vaccines, elicited a more potent neutralizing antibody responses than the wild-type RBD or the full-length proline-stabilized S-protein antigen used in several prominent COVID-19 vaccines. Finally we show that our modified RBD is more inherently immunogenic than the wild-type RBD when administered at equal dosage as a subunit protein vaccine. These data suggest that future vaccines against COVID-19 should include multivalent forms of engineered RBD antigens.</p>

<title>The SARS-CoV-2 RBD can elicit potent neutralizing antisera</title>
<p id="P8">The SARS-CoV-2 RBD, like that of SARS-CoV-1, is exposed in both known states of the S-protein trimer, namely a closed state where each RBD contacts symmetrically its analogues on the other protomer, and an open state in which at least one RBD domain is extended to contact ACE2. We have previously shown that the SARS-CoV-1 RBD folds independently and expresses efficiently, and that an immunoadhesin form of this RBD bound ACE2 more efficiently than constructs based on the S1 domain (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</italic>). This construct, RBD-Fc, also efficiently raised antibodies in mice capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-1 variants, including those with distinct RBD sequences (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</italic>). Moreover, the vast majority of well characterized neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, including those in late-stage clinical trials, target the RBD. These data suggest that an RBD-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could be effective against virus throughout the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p id="P9">To initially evaluate this possibility under optimal conditions, we evaluated the immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD fused to the Fc domain as an expedient for rapid purification. RBD-Fc was chemically conjugated to a Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) carrier protein and mixed with the AS01 adjuvant formulation now used in at least two human vaccines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). This antigen/adjuvant combination was inoculated intramuscularly into four female Sprague-Dawley rats with a schedule of seven increasing (2.5-fold) doses, one each day, ultimately administering a total of 500 μg of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc. Thirty days after the first administration, RBD fused to a 4-amino acid C-tag was purified with a C-tag affinity column and administered as before. Blood was harvested from each of the four rats (R15, R16, R17, R18) immediately before inoculation (day 0) and 40 days after the first inoculation. Serial dilutions of day-0 and day-40 sera were measured for their ability to neutralize retroviruses pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (SARS2-PV). To estimate neutralization potency, these sera were also compared with a mixture of all four day-0 preimmune sera, further combined with an immunoadhesin form of ACE2 (ACE2-Fc) at concentrations of 10, 100, and 1000 μg/ml before dilution. As anticipated, some baseline inhibition could be observed in heat-inactivated rat sera (grey lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). However day-40 serum from each rat, obtained after two sets of immunizations, potently neutralized SARS2-PV entry with an efficiency comparable to or greater than day-0 preimmune sera mixed with ACE2-Fc at a 100 μg/ml concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD can elicit a neutralizing response in vaccinated rats comparable to a 100 μg/ml (1 μM) concentration of an inhibitor with a 1 nM IC<sub>50</sub>. To confirm that sera from vaccinated rats neutralized SARS2-PV by recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we used each pooled serum to prevent binding of an ACE2-Fc variant bearing a rabbit Fc domain (ACE2-rIg) from cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The ability of pooled serum to compete with ACE2-rIg indicates that these antisera neutralized SARS2-PV entry by blockading ACE2 association with the S protein. Thus, under ideal conditions, immunization with SARS-CoV-2 RBD elicits antibodies that very potently neutralize SARS2-PV, and these antibodies do so by preventing S-protein association with ACE2.</p>
<p id="P10">One concern associated with coronavirus vaccines is the possibility that anti-S-protein antibodies could promote infection of cells, such as alveolar macrophages, expressing Fc receptors, for example FcγRI (CD64) or FcγRII (CD32). This undesirable antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has been well characterized in tissue-culture studies of several flaviviruses including Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</italic>). To evaluate this possibility for SARS-CoV-2, SARS2-PV were mixed with pooled day-0 or day-40 serum at the indicated serial dilutions, and the resulting virus/sera mixtures were incubated with HEK293T cells transfected to express rat FcγRI. These cells did not express ACE2 and no infection was observed with day-0 preimmune sera nor day-40 immune sera (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). In contrast, rat anti-ZIKV antisera, or day-0 preimmune sera incubated at the same dilutions with ZIKV virus-like particles (VLP) promoted robust ADE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). ADE activity peaked at approximately a 3000-fold dilution, consistent with competition between ADE and neutralizing activities of these antisera. Moreover, no SARS2-PV ADE was observed in the presence of ACE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">D</xref>) or with K562 cells that endogenously express FcγRII (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">F</xref>) (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</italic>). Thus anti-RBD antisera do not mediate SARS2-PV ADE in the presence or absence of ACE2 under the described conditions.</p>

<title>The RBD is more immunogenic than the S-protein ectodomain</title>
<p id="P11">To directly compare the immunogenicity of the RBD and a proline-stabilized S-protein ectodomain, both proteins were fused at their C-termini to a SpyTag and conjugated to one of two carrier systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). First, each was conjugated by isopeptide bond formation to SpyCatcher-mi3 60-mer particles (RBD-mi3 and S-mi3) (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</italic>). Second, the same proteins were conjugated chemically to KLH as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> (RBD-KLH and S-KLH). Four rats were vaccinated with each antigen/carrier combination as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> except that one-fifth the total antigen (100 μg) was administered for each vaccination round. Sera collected at day 0 and day 45 from each rat was characterized for neutralization with SARS2-PV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>) and the results were averaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). We observed that, with both carrier proteins, RBD conjugates elicited more potent neutralizing responses at day 45 than did S-protein conjugates. We further observed that conjugates to the mi3 60-mer elicited more potent responses than conjugates to the KLH carrier protein. Thus RBD-mi3 was significantly more immunogenic than S-mi3, RBD-KLH and S-KLH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). We conclude that, when equal amounts of the RBD and the S-protein ectodomain are conjugated to a carrier and administered with a potent adjuvant, the RBD elicits a more potent neutralizing response. We also conclude that the mi3 carrier protein elicited more potent responses to both antigens than did KLH.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>A glycan-modified RBD, gRBD, administered as a protein, elicits a more potent neutralizing response than does the wild-type RBD</title>
<p id="P12">Conjugates of the sort produced for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> cannot readily be used with genetic vaccines such as those delivered as DNA, or as mRNA, or through viral vectors. However fusion proteins that express both the antigen and the carrier as a single polypeptide chain can be used in these formats. Such fusion proteins also simplify the production of subunit protein vaccines. We therefore undertook to produce fusion proteins with the RBD in various formats but observed that these constructs were not efficiently produced in cells and were not efficiently secreted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). To solve this problem, we developed a screening procedure whereby the expression levels of engineered RBD variants, expressed as dimers, were monitored by flow cytometry. We observed that one such variant, modified with four additional glycosylation sites in an RBD region occluded in S-protein trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, A to C</xref>), expressed and secreted markedly more efficiently as a fusion with the mi3 60-mer than did the unmodified RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Each of three of these newly engineered glycans – those engineered at residues 370, 428, and 517 – markedly increased RBD expression when fused to a multivalent carrier (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>), with the engineered glycosylation motif at residue 517 contributing most to gRBD expression. A fourth glycan, at residue 394, did not contribute to higher RBD expression, but it was included to further limit RBD aggregation.</p>
<p id="P13">We then investigated whether these additional glycans would alter immune responses to the RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, B to E</xref>). Because fusions of the wild-type RBD with higher-order multivalent carrier proteins proved difficult to express and purify, we produced RBD and gRBD as fusion proteins with Fc domains of human IgG1 (wtRBD-Fc and gRBD-Fc). Two doses of 25 μg of RBD-Fc antigen with 25 μg MPLA and 10 μg QuilA adjuvants, separated by 14 days, were administered intramuscularly to five mice per group. Anti-sera were harvested 21 days after the first vaccination, and analyzed for its ability to neutralize SARS2-PV or control pseudoviruses expressing the entry (GP) protein of the lymphocytic choriomengingitis virus (LCMV-PV). Sera from inoculated mice was mixed and compared with pre-immune sera and pre-immune sera mixed at an initial concentration of 200 μg/ml ACE2-Fc. We observed, somewhat unexpectedly, that gRBD-Fc elicited a more potent neutralizing response than did wtRBD-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>). Consistent with this observation, sera from gRBD-Fc inoculated mice more efficiently bound cell-expressed S protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>) and more efficiently blocked binding of fluorescently labeled ACE2-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>) than did sera from wtRBD-Fc-inoculated mice. Thus the engineered glycans of gRBD do not interfere with, and may enhance its ability to raise anti-RBD antibodies in mice. We speculate that gRBD glycans better focus the B-cell response to neutralizing RBD epitopes (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</italic>). Alternatively, aggregation of the wild-type RBD may impede access to these epitopes. Collectively these data suggest that multivalent antigens based on gRBD will be easier to produce and at least as immunogenic as their wild-type RBD analogues.</p>

In each case, the gRBD fusion protein expressed more efficiently than its wild-type RBD analogue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>). We also evaluated a plasmid expressing the full-length proline-stabilized 1273 amino-acid S protein (S1273-PP, the full-length S protein with prolines introduced at residues 986 and 987) which expressed efficiently on the surface of HEK293T cells, more so than the otherwise identical construct lacking these stabilizing prolines. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4C</xref>). Five mice per group were electroporated with 120 μg plasmid (60 μg per hind leg) encoding either wtRBD or gRBD antigen fused to each of the aforementioned multivalent scaffolds, or with plasmid expressing the S1273-PP full-length S protein. Mice were again electroporated 14 days later with the same plasmds. Sera were harvested 21 days after the first inoculation. Combined sera for each group were evaluated for its ability to neutralize SARS2-PV or LCMV-PV and compared with preimmune sera or preimmune sera mixed with ACE2-Fc at an initial concentration of 200 μg/ml. In each case, sera from gRBD-fusion constructs neutralized SARS2-PV more efficiently than their wtRBD analogues, and more efficiently than sera from mice electroporated with S1273-PP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Among the various scaffolds, the <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> ferritin 24-mer elicited the most potent neutralizing antisera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>). We conclude that gRBD consistently and significantly (<italic>P</italic>=0.0089, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>) improves the immunogenicity of multivalent fusion proteins relative to the same construct fused to the wildtype RBD.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P15">For several reasons, a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 should be easier to develop than those against many other viruses (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</italic>). First, coronaviruses have exceptionally large genomes compared to other RNA viruses, and, to avoid error catastrophe, their viral polymerase has acquired a proofreading function. Thus any individual gene, for example that of the S protein, is likely to retain its original sequence over multiple replication cycles. Indeed now 9 months into the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, few mutations in the S protein, and no dominant mutations in its RBD, have yet been described. Second, coronaviruses in general, and clearly SARS-CoV-2 in particular, transmits to a new host more rapidly than an adaptive immune response can emerge. A likely consequence of this strategy is that one of its most critical epitopes, namely its RBD, is exposed on the virion (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</italic>), favoring transmission efficiency over antibody resistance. Finally, the stability and compactness of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD suggests that it can be easily manufactured and presented to the immune system using many production technologies, presentation scaffolds, and delivery systems (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</italic>). Here we repeat studies of the SARS-CoV-1 RBD showing that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is sufficient to raise potent neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), and that it does so more efficiently than the SARS-CoV-2 S protein ectodomain when conjugated to a KLH or mi3 carrier and administered as a protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">However, the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 RBD suffers from one major deficiency. When expressed as a fusion protein in multivalent scaffold or carrier, it is expressed inefficiently in cells, it secretes poorly, and it tends to aggregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>). This tendency to aggregate appears to impair its immunogenicity, even when administered as a reasonably well-behaved Fc dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Through trial-and-error screening of RBD variants modified in a region normally occluded on the S-protein trimer, we identified a construct with four novel glycosylation motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>), that substantially improved or rescued expression of all five multivalent protein carriers assayed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>). Each of these glycosylation motifs improved expression or RBD solubility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). The resulting engineered RBD, which we call gRBD to reflect its additional glycans, elicited more potent neutralizing sera when administered as an adjuvanted protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, B to E</xref>) or when electroporated as a DNA vaccine expressing each of five carrier proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5, A to C</xref>). Importantly, these gRBD fusion proteins were more immunogenic than proline-stabilized S proteins used as antigens in most prominent SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">Our data therefore show that (1) the SARS-CoV-2 RBD can be more immunogenic than the S protein, (2) an RBD engineered with four glycans can be more immunogenic than the wild-type RBD, and (3) multivalent forms of the RBD and gRBD, and in particular those fused with the <italic>H</italic>.<italic>pylori</italic> ferritin 24-mer, can be more immunogenic than dimeric or trimeric constructs. Why is the RBD more immunogenic than the S protein? The answer appears straightforward: the RBD is the dominant neutralizing epitope. Expression of the remainder of the protein taxes cellular resources and exposes potential decoy epitopes. Why is gRBD more immunogenic than the wildtype RBD? We speculate that poor folding or solubility of the wild-type RBD help occlude its major neutralizing epitopes or limit its access to the lymph nodes (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</italic>). It is also possible that the glycans of gRBD mask dominant but non-neutralizing RBD epitopes. Finally, why is the ferritin 24-mer more immunogenic than the other scaffolds? Immunogenicity is likely improved by multivalency, by higher expression, and by pre-existing T cell help (<italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</italic>). The mi3 60-mer is maximally multivalent, but it expresses relatively poorly and may include fewer epitopes recognized by established memory T cells. The NAP 12-mer expresses much more efficiently, but its size or the arrangement of gRBD domains may be sub-optimal. The Fc dimer and foldon trimer may also be insufficiently multivalent, and again include fewer T-cell epitopes. The <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> ferritin 24-mer combines high expression, a larger particle and high valency, and it provides T-cell epitopes similar to those in many bacterial antigens. Further work identifying and engineering high-expressing multivalent scaffolds capable of presenting gRBD may yield even more potent antigens.</p>
<p id="P18">In short, we have engineered a SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen that expresses more efficiently than the wild-type RBD as a fusion with multivalent carrier proteins, and these fusion proteins are more immunogenic as protein or DNA vaccines than commonly used S protein antigens. We propose therefore that multivalent gRBD fusion proteins could improve production efficiencies of proteinbased SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and limit the doses necessary for all vaccine classes.</p>

<title>Production of SARS-CoV-2 and LCMV pseudoviruses and Zika-virus virus-like particles</title>
<p id="P19">Retroviruses pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein or lymphocytic choriomenginitis virus GP protein (SARS2-PV, LCMV-PV) were produced as previously described (Moore et al., 2004) with modest modifications as described. HEK293T cells were transfected by polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection at a ratio of 5:5:1 with a plasmid encoding murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag/pol proteins, a retroviral vector pQCXIX expressing firefly luciferase, and a plasmid expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank YP_009724390) or LCMV GP (GenBank AHZ55917.1). Cells were washed 6 hours later, and the culture supernatant containing pseudoviruses was harvested at 48-72 hours post transfection. Zika virus virus-like particles (ZIKV-VLP) were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells by the calcium phosphate transfection method with a ZIKV replicon (strain FS13025, GenBank KU955593.1), whose expression is controlled by tetracycline, a plasmid encoding ZIKV capsid, prM, and E proteins (strain FSS13025, GenBank KU955593.1), and the pTet-On plasmid expressing a reverse Tet-responsive transcriptional activator (rtTA) at a ratio of 2:1:1. Cells were washed 6 hours later and replenished with fresh media containing 1 μg/ml doxycycline. The VLP-containing culture supernatant was harvested 48 h post transfection. ZIKV replicon was generated by replacing the region spanning 39<sup>th</sup> through 763<sup>rd</sup> amino acids of the polyprotein of a ZIKV molecular clone we previously generated (<italic>

This construct contains the tetracycline-responsive P<sub>tight</sub> promoter that drives ZIKV RNA transcription. The pseudovirus- or VLP-containing culture supernatants were cleared by 0.45-μm filtration. SARS2-PV and ZIKV-VLP titers were assessed by RT-qPCR targeting the CMV promoter in the retroviral vector pQCXIX and ZIKV NS3 gene, respectively. In some cases, clarified pseudovirus and VLP stocks were stored at -80°C for long-term storage and reuse.</p>

<title>Generation of human ACE2 expressing cell lines</title>
<p id="P20">HEK293T cells expressing human ACE2 (hACE2) were generated by transduction with murine leukemia virus (MLV) pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein and expressing myc-hACE2-c9, as previously described (Wicht et al., 2014). Briefly, HEK293T cells were cotransfected by PEI with three plasmids, pMLV-gag-pol, pCAGGS-VSV-G and pQCXIP-myc-hACE2-c9 at a ratio of 3:2:1, and medium was refreshed after overnight incubation of transfection mix. The supernatant with produced virus was harvested 72-hours post transfection and clarified by passing through 0.45μm filter. 293T-hACE2 cells transduced with MLV vectors were selected and maintained with medium containing puromycin (Sigma). hACE2 expression was confirmed by SARS1-PV and SARS2-PV entry assays and by immunofluorescence staining using mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing c-Myc.</p>

<p id="P21">Expi293 cells (Thermo-Fisher) were transiently transfected using FectoPRO (Polyplus) with plasmids encoding SARS-CoV2 RBD with a human or rabbit-Fc fusion or a C-terminal C-tag (-EPEA). After 5 days in shaker culture, media were collected and cleared of debris for 10 min at 3,000 g and filtered using 0.45-μm flasks (Nalgene). Proteins were isolated using MabSelect SuRe (GE Lifesciences) or CaptureSelect C-TagXL (Thermo-Fisher) columns according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Eluates were buffer exchanged four times with PBS and concentrated using Amicon ultra filtration devices (Millipore Sigma), except for S-protein-Spytag, which was buffer exchanged by dialysis (Pierce) 3 times, and concentrated. For wtRBD-Fc and gRBD-Fc used in mouse protein immunizations, further purification was performed by SEC on a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-400 HR column connected to an ÄKTA FPLC. Fractions were isolated with PBS buffer, verified by SDS-PAGE gels, pooled, and concentrated. All purified proteins were stored at 4°C prior to use.</p>
<p id="P22">For RBD-multimer fusion proteins, supernatant pH was adjusted to 8.5 by addition of 1/20 volume 1M Tris pH=9.0 (G-Biosciences, 786-476), and the supernatant was filtered by 0.45 μm filter prior to purification on CaptureSelect™ C-tagXL Columns. In the case of RBD-ferritin fusions, 0.5% Tween-20 was also added to supernatants prior to filtration, and supernatants were mixed with anti-flag M2 agarose affinity gel (1 mL slurry for 25mL culture, Sigma-Aldrich, A2220-10ML), and incubated on a rotary shaker overnight at 4°C. The mixture was packed into columns (Agela Technologies, AZ-IC-1T). Columns (C-tag or M2) were washed with 10 CV TBS (25 mM Tris 8.5, 150 mM NaCl), and eluted with 5 CV Gentle Ag/Ab Elution Buffer, pH 6.6 (Thermo Scientific Pierce, 21027). Buffer was exchanged 4 times with TBS 8.5 for yield studies, or 3 times with TBS 8.5, and one time with PBS for subsequent SEC polishing.</p>

<title>Immunization with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD elicits potently neutralizing antibodies.</title>
<p>Four female Sprague Dawley rats (R15, R16, R17, R18) were immunized with two sets of escalating doses of RBD conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. (<bold>A</bold>) The indicated dilutions of preimmune sera (day 0, gray) were compared to dilutions of sera harvested from immunized rats at day 40, and to the same dilutions of preimmune sera mixed to achieve the indicated ACE2-Fc concentrations before dilution. Each serum and serum-ACE2-Fc mixture was compared for its ability to neutralize S-protein-pseudotyped retroviruses (SARS2-PV), by measuring the activity of a firefly-luciferease reporter expressed by these pseudoviruses. Figure shows entry of SARS2-PV as a percentage of that observed without added rat serum. Error bars indicate the range of two neutralization studies. (<bold>B</bold>) The data from each rat of panel A are averaged for clarity. Error bars indicate s.d., with each rat considered a different experiment. Differences between day-0 and day-40 serum are significant at all dilutions (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; two-way ANOVA). (<bold>C</bold>) Pooled sera and pooled preimmune sera mixed with the indicated concentrations of ACE2-Fc were further combined with an ACE2-Fc variant bearing a rabbit-derived Fc domain. Binding of the ACE2-Fc was monitored with an antirabbit Fc secondary antibody as determined by flow cytometry. Error bars indicate the range of two such measurements. Differences between day-0 and day-40 serum are significant (P &lt; 0.001; two-way ANOVA) at all dilutions.</p>

The indicated dilutions of preimmune sera (day 0) were compared to dilutions of sera harvested from immunized rats at day 40. Each serum was compared for its ability to neutralize S-protein-pseudotyped retroviruses (SARS2-PV), by measuring the activity of a firefly-luciferease reporter expressed by these pseudoviruses.

<title>gRBD expresses efficiently as an mi3 fusion protein and is more immunogenic than wild-type RBD as adjuvanted protein.</title>
<p>Expression: (<bold>A</bold>) RBD-mi3 60-mer fusion proteins were expressed in Expi293 cells, after 5 days, supernatants and cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE anti-CTag western blot. Note that no wtRBD-mi3 could be detected in the supernatant. Immunogenicity: Five mice per group were inoculated with 25 μg of protein A/SEC purified wtRBD-Fc or gRBD-Fc adjuvanted with 25 μg of MPLA and 10 μg Quil-A. Immunizations were conducted day 0 and day 14, and serum was collected and pooled on day 21. Pooled preimmune sera, and pooled preimmune sera doped with 200 μg/mL of ACE2-Fc were used as negative and positive controls. Pooled sera were used to neutralize (<bold>B</bold>) SARS-CoV2 pseudovirus or (<bold>C</bold>) LCMV pseudovirus control. In parallel, HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 μg / well in a six well plate and stained the next day with pooled preimmune and day-21 sera and then stained with either (<bold>D</bold>) anti-mouse-FITC or (<bold>E</bold>) ACE2-Fc-DyLight650. Error bars indicate SEM.</p>

<title>gRBD based DNA vaccines more efficiently raise neutralizing antibodies than those based on wild-type RBD.</title>
<p>
<bold>(A)</bold> Five mice per group were electroporated in each hind leg with 60 μg plasmid DNA expressing wtRBD or gRBD fused to human Fc dimer, foldon trimer, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> NAP 12-mer, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> ferritin 24-mer, and mi3 60-mer. An additional control group was electroporated with plasmid expressing the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with two stabilizing prolines (S1273-PP). Electroporations were conducted day 0 and day 14, and serum was collected and pooled for neutralization assays on day 21. Pooled preimmune sera, and pooled preimmune sera doped with 200 μg/mL of ACE2-Fc were used as negative and positive controls. (<bold>B</bold>) Neutralizing potency of gRBD varied by platform. (<bold>C</bold>) IC<sub>50</sub> calculations for wtRBD and gRBD were calculated (Prism 8) against normalized values by least squares fit. P-value was calculated by 2-tailed paired t test between wtRBD and gRBD pairs.</p>
