In the current pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 has accumulated diverse genomic mutations including in nsp14. Here, to clarify whether amino acid substitutions in nsp14 affect the genomic diversity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, we searched for amino acid substitutions in nature that may interfere with nsp14 function. We found that viruses carrying a proline-to-leucine change at position 203 (P203L) have a high evolutionary rate and that a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 virus with the P203L mutation acquired more diverse genomic mutations than wild-type virus during its replication in hamsters.

Generally, RNA viruses have a high mutation rate because they replicate their genome by using an error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) so that nucleotide incorporation errors are not corrected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). In contrast, coronaviruses have lower mutation rates because they possess nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14), which contains an exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain that provide a proofreading function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Nonetheless, in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in China at the end of 2019 and caused the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous variants have emerged by acquiring multiple mutations in a short period of time. Some of these variants have been a cause for concern due to their increased infectivity, transmissibility, pathogenicity, and/or reduced sensitivity to vaccines and therapeutic agents. These variants, classified as ‘variants of concern (VOCs)’ by the World Health Organization (WHO), include Alpha (PANGO ID B.1.1.7), Beta (PANGO ID B.1.351), Gamma (PANGO ID P.1), Delta (PANGO ID B.1.617.2), and most recently Omicron (PANGO ID B.1.1.529). To control COVID-19 and bring the pandemic to an end, it is important to understand the mechanism of the emergence of these diverse variants and the genomic evolution of SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="P3">Coronaviruses possess a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that is one of the largest among known RNA viruses, ranging from 26 to 32 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). There are two large open reading frames (ORFs) at the 5′ proximal end, ORF1a and ORF1b, which comprise approximately two-thirds of the genome, and encode two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, that are cleaved into about 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). Some of the processed nsps assemble to form the replication-transcription complex, which contains an RdRp (nsp12), the helicase (nsp13), processivity factors (nsp7 and nsp8), and the proofreading ExoN complex (nsp14 and nsp10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). During genome replication, nsp14 ExoN activity plays a role in the RNA proofreading machinery by efficiently removing mismatched 3’-endnucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Experiments in which the nsp14 of SARS-CoV was functionally inactivated revealed 10–20 times higher mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), indicating that nsp14 may be essential for maintaining the virus genome.</p><p id="P4">In this study, to clarify whether amino acid substitutions in nsp14 affect the genomic diversity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, we searched for amino acid substitutions in nature that may interfere with the function of nsp14 in SARS-CoV-2. First, to obtain functionally important sites in nsp14, we examined 62 representative coronaviruses belonging to the family <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> and found that 99 of the 527 amino acid sites of nsp14 were evolutionarily conserved. We then examined nsp14 sequences obtained from 28,082 SARS-CoV-2 genomes available in the GISAID EpiCoV database, which includes not only sequencing data but also sampling date, country, and institution information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), and identified an additional 6 amino acid changes in nsp14 mutants that were not detected in the 62 representative coronaviruses. We examined the genome mutation rates of these mutants and found that the amino acid replacement of proline (P) for leucine (L) at position 203 of nsp14 could be involved in increasing the nucleotide mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. To investigate the biological significance of the nsp14 P203L substitution, we generated recombinant SARS-CoV-2 viruses possessing wild-type nsp14 or mutant nsp14 with P203L and characterized them in a hamster model. We found that the nsp14-P203L mutant grown in the lungs of hamsters acquired significantly more diverse genomic mutations than did the wild-type virus. These results indicate that substitutions in nsp14, such as P203L, could accelerate the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Conserved regions of nsp14 proteins among coronaviruses</title><p id="P5">We first generated a phylogenetic tree of the amino acid sequences of the nsp14 gene obtained from 62 representative coronaviruses (the viruses used in this analysis are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The phylogenetic tree clearly showed the relationship among the four genera of coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), consistent with results obtained by using the partial amino acid sequences of ORF1ab described in a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Our results suggest that the nsp14 gene is broadly conserved among coronaviruses, and that the conserved amino acid sites could be important for its molecular function.</p><p id="P6">Next, we examined the conserved amino acid sites of the nsp14 gene among the 62 coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The amino acid positions of nsp14 were based on the SARS-CoV three-dimensional structure (PDB ID: 5C8S); SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both belong to the subgenus <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> in the genus <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>. For nsp14, the number of identical amino acids was 482/527 (91.5%) in 8 representative coronaviruses belonging to the subgenus <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>, and 359/527 (68.1%) if we included the nsp14 of the Bat Hp-betacoronavirus/Zhejiang2013 (GenBank ID: NC_025217.1) belonging to the subgenus <italic>Hibecovirus,</italic> an outgroup of <italic>Sarbecovirus.</italic> Moreover, 200/527 (38.0%) positions were conserved among 29 viruses of the genus <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, and 108/527 (20.5%) positions were conserved among the 61 coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). If we included an unclassified coronavirus found in <italic>Tropidophorus sinicus</italic> (Chinese waterside skink) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), the conserved amino acid positions were 99/527 (18.8%). These results suggest that these amino acid sites of the nsp14 gene are conserved among diverse coronaviruses because they may be functionally important. We further validated this hypothesis by calculating nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitution rates on a per-site basis for the nsp14 sequences of the 62 coronaviruses by using the SLAC program (see Materials and Methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). For the dN/dS analysis, we removed 23 amino acid sites that contained insertions and deletions out of the total 527 amino acid sites in the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 of 61 coronaviruses (excluding the Chinese waterside skink coronavirus that contains a mixture of nucleotides at these positions). Thus, 504 amino acid sites of the 61 coronavirus nsp14 multiple alignment were calculated for the dN/dS ratios; no positive selection sites were found in nsp14, whereas 379 of the 504 codon sites were under negative selection (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). In total, 91 amino acids were unchanged and under negative selection in the nsp14 of the 62 representative coronaviruses.</p><p id="P7">We then investigated whether the amino acids that are known to be important for the error-correcting function of nsp14 are conserved. Coronavirus nsp14 possesses both ExoN and N7-MTase activities. The ExoN domain of coronavirus nsp14 was originally identified based on its sequence similarity to distant cell homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) and has been assigned to the DEDD exonuclease superfamily, which includes the proofreading domains of many DNA polymerases and other eukaryotic and prokaryotic exonucleases. The nsp14 proteins have four conserved active site residues distributed in three standard motifs of the primary structure: residues 90D/92E (motif I), 191E (motif II), and 268H/273D (motif III) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). We found that the five active sites of nsp14 were conserved among the 62 coronaviruses examined in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Moreover, there were three zinc fingers that were essential for nsp14 function: zinc finger 1 (ZF1) comprising 207C, 210C, 226C, and 229H; zinc finger 2 (ZF2) comprising 257H, 261C, 264H, and 279C; and zinc finger 3 (ZF3) comprising 452C, 473C, 484C, and 487H. S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-binding motif I includes residues 331D, 333G, 335P, and 337A (or 337G), which are involved in the (N7 guanine)-methyl transferase reaction by nsp14. We found that all these residues were conserved among the nsp14 sequences of the 62 coronaviruses examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). These results suggest that the amino acids of nsp14 that are functionally important are conserved among the diversified coronaviruses.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Diversity of nsp14 in SARS-CoV-2</title><p id="P8">Amino acid comparisons of nsp14 in the 62 representative coronaviruses revealed that several sites are strongly conserved and that some substitutions may have deleterious effects on the survival of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in humans in 2019 and has spread rapidly all over the world in a short period of time. Therefore, some nsp14 mutations that impair its error-correcting function may remain in the SARS-CoV-2 population. Accordingly, we attempted to identify such deleterious mutations in the current SARS-CoV-2 population.</p><p id="P9">We downloaded the aligned nucleotide sequences of SARS-CoV-2 (87,625 sequences) from the GISAID database as of September 7, 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from humans were extracted (87,304 sequences), and the sequences containing undetermined and/or mixed nucleotides were removed; the remaining 28,082 sequences were used in subsequent analyses. The coding region of nsp14 was translated and compared. The results showed that 25,913 nsp14 amino acid sequences (92.27%) were identical to that of the reference sequence, whereas 2169 sequences contained at least one amino acid substitution in nsp14 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The top 20 variants possessing nsp14 with amino acids that were different from the major sequence (shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Note that frameshift mutants were excluded from the table because they may affect downstream genes as well. Notably, among the 20 amino acid nsp14 mutants, six amino acids (177F, 377L, 369F, 501I, 203L and 297S) were not found in the 62 nsp14 proteins of the representative coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). We further analyzed the evolutionary selection pressures of these 6 amino acid sites by using 73 coronaviruses belonging to the genus <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic> that includes SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). We confirmed that the six amino acid variants were not found in any of the 73 Beta-coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The six conserved positions (177, 203, 297, 369, 377, and 501) were also found to be under negative selection (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that the conserved amino acid sites of nsp14 are also evolutionarily selected in the genus <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Correlation between the amino acid sequences of nsp14 and nucleotide mutation rates in the viral genome</title><p id="P10">To examine whether any of the six amino acid substitutions in the nsp14 of SARS-CoV-2 variants could affect its proofreading function, we looked for a correlation between the amino acid variants of nsp14 and the genetic diversities of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. For this purpose, we roughly estimated evolutionary rates of SARS-CoV-2 possessing mutated nsp14, compared to that of SARS-CoV-2 with wild-type nsp14. Sequences for which sampling date information (year, month, and day) was not available were excluded from this analysis. Nucleotide mutations per year were calculated based on the regression coefficient using hCoV-19/Wuhan/Hu-1/2019 (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_402125) as the reference sequence (see Materials and Methods). Note that the estimated evolutionary rates of each nsp14 mutant were not phylogenetically corrected; the estimated rates were used only to obtain nsp14 mutation candidate(s) that may affect evolutionary rates.</p><p id="P11">We found that SARS-CoV-2 containing wild-type nsp14 had 19.8 nucleotide mutations in its whole genome per year (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> for the regression coefficient). Conversely, seven SARS-CoV-2 variants containing nsp14 with amino acid substitutions showed 27.3 (L177F), 59.8 [L177F/T372I (<italic>i.e</italic>., L177F and T372I)], 35.9 (P203L), 17.1 (P297S), 26.2 (S369F), 13.0 (F377L), or 21.9 (M501I) nucleotide mutations per year (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Although the substitution rates of the L177F/T372I and F377L variants were found to be unreliable because of limited time ranges, those of the other variants were correlated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 variants possessing nsp14 with the L177F, P203L, S369F, or M501I substitution may have a higher genomic mutation rate than that of SARS-CoV-2 carrying wild-type nsp14. In particular, the P203L variant of nsp14 (nsp14-P203L), which showed the highest mutation rate (35.7 nucleotide mutations per year), is a strong candidate that enhances the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.</p><p id="P12">We then verified the substitution rates of the nsp14-P203L variants for each single cluster in which the maximum number was observed: 6 genomes for the nsp14-203L mutant and 194 genomes for the nsp14-203P wildtype in the B.1.1.33 lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> with GISAID IDs). We found that nsp14-P203L variants in the B.1.1.33 lineage forming a single clade showed a high nucleotide evolutionary rate (58.8 nucleotide mutations/year) compared with those with the nsp14-203P (<italic>i.e</italic>., wildtype) strains in the same lineage (16.5 nucleotide mutations/year) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Although the number of variants was limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), a correlation was clearly observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). In addition, six other nsp-P203L variants in a different cluster (B.1) also showed a relatively high nucleotide mutation rate (28.0 nucleotide mutations/year), assuming that variants were in the same clade if their PANGO IDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and GISAID clades were identical (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref> for regression coefficients). With the same assumption, we did the same calculation for the other nsp14 mutants in the lineages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>) and found that nsp14-P203L in the B.1.1.33 lineage exhibited the highest substitution rate. These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 variants containing nsp14-P203L are strong candidates for variants that readily accumulate mutations in the viral population.</p><p id="P13">The frequency of nucleotide mutations of coronaviruses may be affected not only by the nsp14 proofreading mechanism but also by the characteristics of other proteins, such as the fidelity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nonstructural protein 12; nsp12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). It is possible that amino acid substitutions in other proteins involved in genome replication affect the nucleotide mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we examined amino acid substitutions among nsp14-203L variants involving the following genes that participate in gene replication: nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, nsp15, and nsp16. The results showed that a proline-to-leucine substitution at position 323 (P323L) of nsp12 frequently occurred (20/25) in sequences of SARS-CoV-2 possessing nsp14-203L (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). However, the P323L mutation in nsp12 (nsp12-P323L) is known to accompany an aspartate-to-glycine substitution at position 614 (D614G) of S protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). The S-D614G mutant was first reported at the end of January 2020 in China and Germany, and by March 2020, this mutant was a major variant in various regions all over the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). The P323L mutation in nsp12 was found in nsp14-203L variants as well. Indeed, the genomic mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 with the P323L amino acid substitution in nsp12, was found to be 17.7 nucleotide mutations per year (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that P323L in nsp12 directly affects the genomic mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 viruses carrying the P203L amino acid substitution in nsp14.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The nsp14-P203L variant in the SARS-CoV-2 population</title><p id="P14">The nsp14-P203L variants have been isolated from 26 patients mainly in Europe and North America, with the first being reported on March 5, 2020 in The Netherlands (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_454756, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Considering their PANGO lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and GISAID clades (shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>), the nsp14-P203L variants appeared at least 10 times. In fact, the nsp14-P203L substitution was observed in both Spike D614 strains and G614 variants, which have enhanced infection efficiency and have spread worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). However, we also found that the prevalence of nsp14-P203L variants did not increase steadily over time; the largest number of nsp14-P203L variants found in the B.1.1.33 and B.1 lineages was only six for each (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The nsp14-P203L mutation effect on protein structure</title><p id="P15">To assess the effect of the P203L mutation of nps14, we first investigated the location of residue 203 by using a tertiary structure model of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 (PDB ID: 7EGQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). The residue 203 is exposed on the surface of the protein and is in the loop stretching from residues 200 to 214, which is in the interstices of the zinc and magnesium binding sites (positions 207 and 191). We found that the loop is located at the edge of an interaction surface for binding to the co-factor SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7A</xref>). The interaction with nsp10 has been shown to greatly increase the nucleolytic activity of SARS-CoV nsp14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Therefore, to investigate the possibility that residues at or around position 203 play an important role in the nsp10-nsp14 interaction, we calculated the change in binding free energy (ΔΔGbind) induced by nsp14-P203L by using the BeQtMuSicC program.

To attempt to answer this question, we generated recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (based on hCoV-19/Japan/TY-WK-521/2020) viruses possessing wild-type nsp14 or P203L nsp14 by using a recently established circular polymerase extension reaction (CPER) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).

Mutations with a read depth of at least 1000 times and an allele frequency of at least 0.5% were compared between the wild-type and nsp14-P203L mutant viruses. The nsp14-P203L mutant grown in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 had 51.33 (±10.96) mutations and the wild-type virus had 46.33 (±9.46) mutations, which was not significantly different (<italic>P =</italic> 0.65) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).

We also observed clinical symptoms, including weight loss for 6 days post-infection. We found that hamsters infected with the nsp14-P203L virus showed similar weight loss to hamsters infected with the wild-type virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>).

In this study, we examined mutations that occurred in nsp14, and found that SARS-CoV-2 possessing nsp14 with a proline to leucine substitution at position 203 showed a relatively higher substitution rate than SARS-CoV-2 possessing wild-type nsp14 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Protein structure prediction analysis of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 suggested that the P203L replacement in nsp14 decreases the binding affinity of nsp10, possibly reducing the proofreading activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Moreover, we demonstrated that a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 possessing this P203L substitution in nsp14 acquired significantly more diverse genomic mutations than the wild-type virus did during its replication in a hamster model, suggesting that mutations in nsp14, such as P203L, could accelerate the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p id="P22">The nsp14-P203L mutant virus grown in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells did not have significantly diverse genomic mutations compared to the wild-type virus, whereas the nsp14-P203L mutant virus grown in hamster lungs had significantly diverse mutations in its genome compared to the wild-type virus. One reason for this difference may be the number of genome copies of each virus in the experiments. Viruses grown in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were sampled to examine genomic mutations at 2 days post-infection, whereas viruses grown in hamster lungs were assessed at 6 days post-infection. Therefore, the viruses may have replicated more in the hamsters’ lungs due to the longer incubation time. In addition, in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, the nsp14-P203L mutant virus showed slightly reduced growth efficiency compared to the wild-type virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Therefore, the wild-type virus may replicate more frequently in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells compared to the nsp14-P203L mutant virus, resulting accumulation of genomic mutations. In contrast, in hamster lungs, the replication efficiency of the nsp14-P203L mutant virus was similar to that of the wild-type virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Therefore, since the genome replication frequency is almost the same between the wild-type and the nsp14-P203L mutant viruses, the reduced proofreading activity due to nsp14-P203L can be correctly detected. Overall, our findings suggest that amino acid substitutions in nsp14-P203L might affect viral properties such as genome mutation proofreading and genome replication efficiency.</p><p id="P23">Alanine substitution of an amino acid that is important for the proofreading activity of the nsp14 of SARS-CoV has been shown to increase viral genomic mutations in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). In addition, Graham et al. reported that SARS-CoV is also attenuated by such a substitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The effects of amino acid substitutions in nsp14 on coronavirus infections in nature have not been investigated. In our study, candidates that might affect nsp14 function were sought by focusing on amino acid substitutions in the nsp14 of epidemic viruses and comparing genomic mutation rates. However, the molecular mechanism of how amino acid mutations in nsp14 are involved in proofreading activity is not clear. In addition, the number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, including nsp14-203L variants, was limited in our study, which limited our statistical analysis. Since the number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in the GISAID has increased (14,535,971 genomes, as of January 11, 2023), further molecular evolutionary analyses with phylogenetic correction may reveal more nsp14 mutations that affect its proofreading activity. Nevertheless, our findings demonstrate that rare amino acid substitutions (particularly leucine at amino acid 203) in coronavirus nsp14 may increase the rate of genomic mutations.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Coronavirus sequence data</title><p id="P24">The amino acid sequences of open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) of the 62 representative coronaviruses (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) were obtained from NCBI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) and the GISAID EpiCoV database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gisaid.org">https://www.gisaid.org</ext-link>) as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).
