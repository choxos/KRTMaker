<title>Summary</title>
<p id="P1">Antigenic imprinting, which describes the bias of antibody response due to previous immune history, can influence vaccine effectiveness and has been reported in different viruses. Give that COVID-19 vaccine development is currently a major focus of the world, there is a lack of understanding of how background immunity influence antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. This study provides evidence for antigenic imprinting in <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>, which is the subgenus that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to. Specifically, we sequentially immunized mice with two antigenically distinct <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> strains, namely SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We found that the neutralizing antibodies triggered by the sequentially immunization are dominantly against the one that is used for priming. Given that the impact of the background immunity on COVID-19 is still unclear, our results will provide important insights into the pathogenesis of this disease as well as COVID-19 vaccination strategy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic is an ongoing global public health crisis and has imposed a huge burden on the world economy. The causative agent of COVID-2019, SARS-CoV-2, belongs to the subgenus <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> of the genus <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> and has nearly 80% sequence identity with another <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>, SARS-CoV, which caused a global epidemic in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Peiris et al., 2003</xref>). While many SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates are being actively developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Funk et al., 2020</xref>), the influence of immune history on vaccine effectiveness remains elusive. In fact, it is now well recognized that the effectiveness of a given influenza vaccine varies among people with different influenza immunization or infection histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Henry et al., 2018</xref>). Such phenomenon is known as antigenic imprinting, which describes immunological memory induced by primary innate and adaptive immune responses to the first encounter with a microbial pathogen or vaccination that can be retained over a person's life time. Antigenic imprinting has also been reported in dengue virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Mongkolsapaya et al., 2003</xref>), HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Klenerman and Zinkernagel, 1998</xref>) and influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Gouma et al., 2020</xref>). Since SARS-CoV-2 may become a seasonal human coronavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Kellam and Barclay, 2020</xref>) and other zoonotic <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> strains continue to post a pandemic threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Menachery et al., 2015</xref>), it is important to understand how antigenic imprinting may affect the antibody response to <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>. In this study, we explored the antigenic imprinting effect of <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> by characterizing the antibody response from mice that were sequentially immunized two antigenically distinct <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> strains, namely SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p id="P3">Balb/c mice (6-8 weeks of age) were intraperitoneally (i.p.) immunized twice, with viruses plus adjuvant Addavax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Four immunization schemes were explored: 1) two rounds of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV homologous prime-boost); 2) first round with SARS-CoV and second round with SARS-CoV-2 (heterologous SARS-CoV-prime, SARS-CoV-2-boost); 3) two rounds of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 homologous prime-boost); and 4) first round with SARS-CoV-2 and second round with SARS-CoV (heterologous SARS-CoV-2-prime, SARS-CoV-boost). Plasma samples were collected and antibody immune responses were measured at day 14 after the second round of immunization. Compared to round one of immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Lv et al., 2020</xref>), the second round homologous boost induced higher homologous binding and neutralizing antibody titers (p &lt;0.05, two tailed t test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1a-d</xref>). These results suggest that SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 specific memory B cells can be recalled and produce neutralizing antibodies during the second round of immunization.</p>
<p id="P4">While all our four prime-boost vaccination schemes resulted in cross-reactive RBD-binding antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a-d</xref>), the virus that was used for priming seemed to dictate the neutralizing antibody response after boosting, regardless of the virus that was used for the boost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e-h</xref>). For example, no matter whether SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 was used for boosting, the neutralizing antibody response was much stronger against SARS-CoV if SARS-CoV was used for priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e-f</xref>), and stronger against SARS-CoV-2 if SARS-CoV-2 was used for priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g-h</xref>). Interestingly, while one round of SARS-CoV immunization was sufficient to elicit a detectable SARS-CoV neutralization response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1c</xref>), a SARS-CoV neutralization response was undetectable when SARS-CoV was used as a heterologous boost after priming with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref>). A simliar observation was made for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f and S1d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the host receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 entry. Previous study has shown that neutralizing activity of sera correlates with the ACE2-competition activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Tan et al., 2020</xref>). ACE2-competition assay was then performed for four groups of plasma samples. Briefly, the binding of plasma samples were tested against RBD and RBD/ACE2 complex. Plasma samples with a stronger ACE2-competition activity should show a greater reduction in binding to RBD/ACE2 complex compared to RBD alone. When binding to SARS-CoV RBD was tested, plasma samples from mice that were primed with SARS-CoV had stronger ACE2-competition activity than did plasma samples from mice that were primed with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Similarly, when binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD was tested, plasma samples from mice that were primed with SARS-CoV-2 had stronger ACE2-competition activity than did plasma samples from mice that were primed with SARS-CoV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). These results indicate that the heterologous boost predominantly induces antibodies to conserved regions outside of the ACE2-binding site that have minimum neutralizing activity. One such example is CR3022, which has strong cross-reactive binding activity to a conserved epitope on RBD, but has weak neutralization activity to SARS-CoV and undetectable neutralization activity to SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Yuan et al., 2020b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">Overall, our results suggest that antigenic imprinting can impact the antibody response against <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>. Specifically, the antibody response to a <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> strain can be suboptimal if there exists a prior immune history against an antigenically distinct or drifted <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> strain. This study has important implications for vaccine development against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as for <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> and other coronaviruses in general.</p>

<title>RBD protein expression and purification</title>
<p id="P9">The receptor-binding domain (RBD) (residues 319-541) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (GenBank: QHD43416.1) and RBD (residues: 306-527) of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein (GenBank: ABF65836.1) were cloned into a customized pFastBac vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ekiert et al., 2011</xref>) and fused with an N-terminal gp67 signal peptide and C-terminal 6×His-tag(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Yuan et al., 2020b</xref>). A recombinant bacmid DNA was generated using the Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies). Baculovirus was generated by transfecting purified bacmid DNA into Sf9 cells using FuGENE HD (Promega), and subsequently used to infect suspension cultures of High Five cells (Life Technologies) at an MOI of 5 to 10. For protein expression, the infected High Five cells were incubated at 28°C for 72h with shaking at 110r.p.m. The supernatant was then concentrated using a 10 kDa MW cutoff Centramate cassette (Pall Corporation). The RBD protein was purified by Ni-NTA, followed by size exclusion chromatography, and buffer exchanged into 20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 and 150mM NaCl.</p>

<title>ACE2 protein expression and purification</title>
<p id="P10">The expression of human ACE2 was as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Yuan et al., 2020a</xref>). Briefly, the human ACE2 (residues 19 to 615, GenBank: BAB40370.1) was codon optimized and cloned into phCMV3 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Yuan et al., 2020a</xref>).The construct was fused with a C-terminal 6xHis tag. The plasmid was transiently transfected into Expi293F cells using ExpiFectamine 293 Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's manual. At 6 days post-transfection, the supernatant was harvested and then was then washed and eluted with 10 mM and 300 mM Imidazole containing PBS, respectively. The ACE2 eluent was purified by size exclusion chromatography.</p>

<sec id="S11">
<title>Mouse immunization</title>
<p id="P11">6-8 weeks Balb/c mice were immunized with two rounds 10<sup>5</sup> pfu of viruses in 150 μL PBS mixing with 50 μL Addavax, including: 1) two rounds of homologous SARS-CoV immunization, 2) two rounds of heterologous immunization with SARS-CoV-prime and SARS-CoV-2-boost, 3) two rounds of homologous SARS-CoV-2 immunization, and 4) two rounds of heterologous immunization with SARS-CoV-2-prime and SARS-CoV-boost, via intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. The plasma samples were collected using heparin tubes on day 35 after the second round of immunization. The experiments were conducted in The University of Hong Kong Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) facility. This study protocol was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations and was approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research of the University of Hong Kong (CULATR 4533-17).</p>

<title>ELISA binding assay</title>
<p id="P12">ELISA plates (96-well, Nunc MaxiSorp, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated overnight with 100 μl of purified recombinant protein in PBS buffer at 1 ng/μl. The plates were then blocked with 100 μl Chonblock buffer (Chondrex Inc, Redmon, US) at room temperature for 1 hours. Each mouse plasma sample was 1:100 diluted in Chonblock buffer, added to the coated ELISA plates, and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. After three extensive washes with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, each well was incubated with the HRP goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:5000, Beyotime Biotechnology) for 1 hour at 37°C. The ELISA plates were then washed five times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Subsequently, 100 μl of TMB buffer (Ncm TMB One; New Cell &amp; Molecular Biotech Co., Ltd) was added into each well. After 15 minutes incubation, 50 μl of 2 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution was added to stop the reaction and the plates were analyzed on a Sunrise absorbance microplate reader (Tecan, Malnnedorf, Switzerland) at 450 nm wavelength.</p>

<title>Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)</title>
<p id="P15">Plasma samples were two-fold diluted starting from a 1:10 dilution and mixed with equal volumes of 120 plaque-forming units (pfu) of SARS-CoV-2 as determined by Vero E6 cells. After 1 hour incubation at 37°C, the plasma-virus mixture were added onto Vero E6 monolayers seated in a 24-well cell culture plate and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The plasma-virus mixtures were then discarded and infected Vero E6 cells were immediately covered with 1% agarose gel in DMEM medium. After incubation for 3 days at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, the plates were formalin fixed and stained by 0.5% crystal violet solution. Neutralization titers were determined by the highest plasma dilution that resulted in &gt;90% reduction in the number of pfus. The test was performed in a BSL3 facility in the University of Hong Kong.</p>

<title>Epitope mapping of the neutralizing and non-neutralizing group</title>
<p>SARS-CoV RBD <bold>(a)</bold> or SARS-CoV-2 RBD <bold>(b)</bold> protein was used as antigen to coat on the 96 well ELISA plate. Four groups of mice plasma samples were added into the plate as primary antibody after with or without 100 ng hACE2 protein blocking. The ∆OD<sub>450</sub> values were calculated as WT OD<sub>450</sub> value minus hACE2 blocking OD<sub>450</sub> value. Each data point in the figure represents the mean of two replicates. P-values were calculated using two-tailed t-test (*P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.005, ***P&lt;0.001, ****P&lt;0.0001). Error bars represent standard deviation. Of note, while SARS-CoV-2-SARS-CoV has a stronger ACE2-competition activity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD than SARS-CoV-SARS-CoV, the large standard deviation in SARS-CoV-SARS-CoV makes the difference statistically insigifncant.</p>
