<abstract>
<p id="P1">Enveloped viruses, including influenza A viruses (IAVs) and coronaviruses (CoVs), utilize the host cell secretory pathway to synthesize viral glycoproteins and direct them to sites of assembly. Using an image-based high-content screen, we identified two thiopurines, 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and 6-thioguanosine (6-TGo), that selectively disrupted the processing and accumulation of IAV glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Selective disruption of IAV glycoprotein processing and accumulation by 6-TG and 6-TGo correlated with unfolded protein response (UPR) activation and HA accumulation could be partially restored by the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA). Chemical inhibition of the integrated stress response (ISR) restored accumulation of NA monomers in the presence of 6-TG or 6-TGo, but did not restore NA glycosylation or oligomerization. Thiopurines inhibited replication of the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), which also correlated with UPR/ISR activation and diminished accumulation of ORF1ab and nucleocapsid (N) mRNAs and N protein, which suggests broader disruption of coronavirus gene expression in ER-derived cytoplasmic compartments. The chemically similar thiopurine 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) had little effect on the UPR and did not affect IAV or HCoV-OC43 replication. Consistent with reports on other CoV Spike (S) proteins, ectopic expression of SARS-CoV-2 S protein caused UPR activation. 6-TG treatment inhibited accumulation of full length S0 or furin-cleaved S2 fusion proteins, but spared the S1 ectodomain. DBeQ, which inhibits the p97 AAA-ATPase required for retrotranslocation of ubiquitinated misfolded proteins during ER-associated degradation (ERAD) restored accumulation of S0 and S2 proteins in the presence of 6-TG, suggesting that 6-TG induced UPR accelerates ERAD-mediated turnover of membrane-anchored S0 and S2 glycoproteins. Taken together, these data indicate that 6-TG and 6-TGo are effective host-targeted antivirals that trigger the UPR and disrupt accumulation of viral glycoproteins. Importantly, our data demonstrate for the first time the efficacy of these thiopurines in limiting IAV and HCoV-OC43 replication in cell culture models.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Enveloped viruses encode integral membrane proteins that are synthesized and post-translationally modified in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) prior to transport to sites of virion assembly. When ER protein folding capacity is exceeded, the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER causes activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) whereby activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), inositol requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1) and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) sense ER stress and trigger the synthesis of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors that initiate a transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). UPR gene expression causes the accumulation of proteins that attempt to restore ER proteostasis by expanding ER folding capacity and stimulating catabolic activities like ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). ERAD ensures that integral membrane proteins that fail to be properly folded are ubiquitinated and retrotranslocated out of the ER for degradation in the 26S proteasome. There is accumulating evidence that bursts of viral glycoprotein synthesis can burden ER protein folding machinery, and that enveloped viruses subvert the UPR to promote efficient viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p>
<p id="P3">Influenza A viruses (IAVs) encode three integral membrane proteins: hemagglutinin (HA) neuraminidase (NA) and matrix protein 2 (M2). HA adopts a type I transmembrane topology in the ER, followed by addition of N-linked glycans, disulfide bond formation, and trimerization prior to transport to the Golgi and further processing by proteases and glycosyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>); NA adopts a type II transmembrane topology in the ER, is similarly processed by glycosyltransferases and protein disulfide isomerases, and assembles into tetramers prior to traversing the secretory pathway to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). The small M2 protein also forms disulfide-linked tetramers in the ER, which is a prerequisite for viroporin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). IAV replication causes selective activation of the UPR; IRE1 is activated, but PERK and ATF6 are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), although the precise mechanisms of regulation remain unknown. Furthermore, chemical chaperones and selective chemical inhibition of IRE1 activity inhibit IAV replication, suggesting that IRE1 has pro-viral effects. HA is sufficient to activate the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) and is subject to ERAD-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). By contrast, little is known about how NA and M2 proteins affect the UPR.</p>
<p id="P4">Several coronaviruses (CoVs) have been shown to activate the UPR, including infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) and SARS-CoV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). However, proximal UPR sensor activation does not always elicit downstream UPR transcription responses during CoV replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), which suggests complex regulation of the UPR by certain CoVs. The coronavirus structural proteins Spike (S), Envelope (E) and Membrane (M) are synthesized in the ER as transmembrane glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). S is heavily modified by N-glycosylation in the ER, which promotes proper folding and trimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Ectopic expression of S proteins from MHV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), HCoV-HKU1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) and SARS-CoV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) have all been shown to be sufficient for UPR activation in cell culture. Additional transmembrane CoV proteins have been shown to be sufficient to induce the UPR, including SARS-CoV-1 non-structural protein 6 (nsp6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), ORF3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) and ORF8ab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) proteins. CoVs rearrange ER membranes into a complex reticulovesicular network that includes double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Precise roles for these compartments remain incompletely understood, but multispanning transmembrane proteins nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 are thought to physically anchor CoV replication/transcription complexes (RTCs) to these membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), and the N-glycosylation of nsp3 and nsp4 indicates the ER origin of DMVs. The observation of UPR gene products ER degradation-enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like protein 1 (EDEM1) and osteosarcoma amplified 9 (OS-9) in DMVs provides additional linkage between CoV RTCs and ER proteostasis mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Following replication, CoVs complete the assembly and egress process by budding into the ER-Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC) and traversing the secretory pathway. Thus, multiple stages of CoV infection are dependent on the ER.</p>
<p id="P5">Viral mRNAs are decoded by the host protein synthesis machinery, which could make them vulnerable to stress-induced regulation of protein synthesis. In addition to ER stress-mediated activation of PERK, three other sentinel kinases (protein kinase R (PKR); heme-regulated translation inhibitor (HRI); general control non-derepressible-2 (GCN2)) respond to diverse stresses by phosphorylating eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha (eIF2α) and enforcing a translation initiation checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). The assembly of the ternary complex, comprised of eIF2, GTP and tRNAi<sup>met</sup> is essential for incorporation of tRNAi<sup>met</sup> into the 40S ribosomal subunit during translation initiation. Phosphorylated eIF2α binds to the eIF2B guanine nucleotide exchange factor and prevents it from exchanging GTP for GDP and recharging the ternary complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). This integrated stress response (ISR) stalls bulk protein synthesis at the initiation step and causes the accumulation of 48S preinitiation complexes and associated mRNAs that are bound by aggregation-prone RNA-binding proteins, including Ras-GAP SH3 domain-binding protein (G3BP), T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1), and TIA-1 related protein (TIAR). These complexes nucleate cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs), sites where stalled messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes are triaged until stress is resolved and protein synthesis can resume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Thus, ISR activation threatens efficient viral protein synthesis and causes the formation of antiviral SGs that impede efficient viral replication. Many viruses have acquired the means to prevent translation arrest and SG formation, and thereby limit the negative impact of ISR on viral protein synthesis.</p>
<p id="P6">We previously demonstrated that IAV suppresses SG formation in infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) and encodes three proteins with SG-suppressing activity; non-structural protein 1 (NS1), nucleoprotein (NP) and polymerase acidic X (PA-X) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Treatment of IAV infected cells with protein synthesis inhibitors Pateamine A and Silvestrol caused SG formation and impeded IAV replication by inhibiting accumulation of viral proteins and downstream viral genome replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). However, these inhibitors triggered SG formation and cytotoxic effects in uninfected cells as well, limiting their potential utility as antivirals. Because SG formation correlates with antiviral activity, we conducted an image-based high-content screen to identify molecules that selectively induce SG formation in IAV infected cells. We identified two FDA-approved thiopurine analogs, 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and 6-thioguanosine (6-TGo), that blocked IAV and HCoV-OC43 replication in a dose-dependent manner. Unlike Pateamine A and Silvestrol, these thiopurines selectively disrupted the processing and accumulation of viral glycoproteins, which correlated with UPR activation. Synthesis of viral glycoproteins could be partially restored in 6-TG treated cells by the chemical inhibition of the UPR or ISR. Our data suggest that UPR-inducing molecules could be effective host-targeted antivirals against viruses that depend on ER processes to support efficient replication. Induction of UPR by 6-TG and 6-TGo represents a novel host-directed antiviral mechanism triggered by these drugs and reveals a previously unrecognized unique mechanism of action that distinguishes them from other closely related thiopurines and nucleoside analogues.</p>

<title>Thiopurine analogs 6-TG and 6-TGo selectively induce SGs in IAV infected cells.</title>
<p id="P7">To identify molecules that selectively induce antiviral SG formation in IAV infected cells without inducing SGs in uninfected cells, we developed an image-based high-content screen. Clonal A549[EGFP-G3BP1] cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) that stably express the core SG protein G3BP1 fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were selected because they display rapid and uniform SG formation in response to known SG-inducing molecules (e.g. Silvestrol). We screened &gt;50,000 small molecules from the Prestwick, Sigma LOPAC, and Chembridge DiverSet collections. After seeding on 96-well plates overnight, cells were infected with IAV strain A/Udorn/1972(H3N2) (IAV-Udorn) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. At 4 hours post-infection (hpi) cells were treated with small molecules for four additional hours prior to fixation and staining with Hoechst 33342 to label nuclei. Images were automatically acquired from two channels (to detect Hoechst and EGFP-G3BP) per field and 15 fields per well of each 96-well plate using a Cellomics Array Scan VTI microscope and processed to yield values for punctate EGFP-G3BP1 intensity that reflected SG formation.</p>
<p id="P8">Through this screen, we identified two thiopurines, 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and 6-thioguanosine (6-TGo) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), that triggered dose-dependent SG formation in IAV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Specifically, SGs formed in approximately 10 % of 6-TG-treated or 6-TGo-treated infected cells; no SGs were detected in mock infected cells treated with either drug at the highest concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). These findings were confirmed in parental A549 cells infected with IAV strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1; IAV-CA/07); 6-TG treated cells displayed the formation of foci that contained SG constituent proteins G3BP1 and poly A binding protein (PABP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). These foci also contained canonical SG proteins TIAR and eIF3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), supporting their identity as <italic>bona fide</italic> SGs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Thiopurine analogs inhibit IAV replication</title>
<p id="P9">Next, we wanted to determine whether thiopurine-mediated SG formation indicated a disruption of viral replication. A549 cells were infected with IAV strain A/PuertoRico/8/1934 (H1N1; IAV-PR8) and treated with 6-TG, 6-TGo or controls at 1 hpi. Cell supernatants were harvested at 24 hpi and infectious virions enumerated by plaque assay. Despite SG induction in only a fraction of virus-infected cells, we observed a sharp dose-dependent decrease in virion production following treatment with either thiopurine analog. Treatment with 2 μM 6-TG reduced virion production by ∼10-fold, whereas 2 μM 6-TGo reduced virion production by ∼100-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Furthermore, treatment of IAV infected cells with 10 µM concentrations of either 6-TG or 6-TGo led to even greater inhibition of IAV production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). This suggests that SG formation correlates with the disruption of the viral replication cycle. However, the sharp decrease in infectious virion production in 6-TG/6-TGo-treated cells suggests that SG formation is not required for their antiviral effect. The nucleoside analog 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) had no effect on IAV replication at 2 μM and 10 μM doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Using an alamarBlue assay, we observed a ∼30% reduction in A549 cell viability in the presence of 10 μM doses of 6-TG/6-TGo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Compared to SG-inducing translation inhibitor Silvestrol, which causes apoptosis in A549 cells upon prolonged exposure, we did not observe significant disruption of cell monolayer by 6-TG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>) or induction of apoptosis as measured by PARP cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). This is consistent with a recent report of 6-TG-mediated cytostatic rather than cytotoxic effects on A549 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). In Vero cells, 6-TG treatment partially protected cellular monolayers from IAV-induced cell death over 72-h incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that 6-TG and 6-TGo elicit a broad dose-dependent antiviral effect against IAV that was not shared by the nucleoside analog 5-FU.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>6-TG treatment inhibits HA and NA glycoprotein processing and accumulation without affecting viral transcription</title>
<p id="P10">Next, we compared accumulation of viral proteins in control cells and cells treated with thiopurines and 5-FU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We previously observed that SG-inducing eIF4A inhibitors broadly affected synthesis of IAV proteins and blocked progression through the replication cycle by preventing the ‘switch’ of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from transcription to genome replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). By contrast, treatment of IAV-PR8 infected cells with 6-TG and 6-TGo selectively blocked the processing and accumulation of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins without affecting the accumulation of nucleoprotein (NP). Accumulation of matrix protein 1 (M1) was affected by higher doses of 6-TG and 6-TGo, but to a much lesser extent than HA and NA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). For NA, 6-TG and 6-TGo caused a dose-dependent accumulation of faster-migrating species, reminiscent of treatment with the inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, tunicamycin (TM). For HA, 6-TG and 6-TGo likewise caused dose-dependent accumulation of faster-migrating, presumably un-glycosylated species, but these were difficult to visualize as they migrated to the same position as NP on immunoblots probed with polyclonal anti-IAV antibodies that concurrently detect NP, M1 and HA. 5-FU, which had no effect on viral replication over the 24 h time course in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), likewise had no effect on the accumulation of these IAV proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Consistent with the notion of selective inhibition of IAV glycoprotein synthesis and maturation, we observed that 6-TG had no effect on the accumulation of IAV-PR8 <italic>HA</italic> or <italic>NA</italic> transcripts or function of the RdRp in genome replication, as 6-TG had little effect on the accumulation of HA and NA genome segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Taken together, these data support a novel mechanism of action for thiopurine analogs in selectively inhibiting processing and accumulation of IAV glycoproteins and significantly impairing IAV replication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>6-TG and 6-TGo activate the UPR and chemical mitigation of ER stress restores synthesis of HA glycoproteins</title>
<p id="P11">By inhibiting N-linked glycosylation, TM impedes proper processing of secreted and transmembrane proteins in the lumen of the ER, which elicits ER stress and activates the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Indeed, we observed that TM treatment of A549 cells caused accumulation of XBP1s and the ER chaperone binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). BiP upregulation is an excellent measure for UPR activation because it requires both ATF6(N)-dependent transcription of <italic>BiP</italic> and PERK-mediated activation of the ISR and uORF-skipping-dependent translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). We observed that both 6-TG and 6-TGo caused BiP and XBP1s accumulation in A549 cells, whereas the chemically similar thiopurine 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) did not. Nucleoside analogs 5-FU and ribavirin also did not affect BiP or XBP1s levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). These data demonstrate that 6-TG and 6-TGo, but not all thiopurines, activate the UPR in A549 cells.</p>
<p id="P12">To determine whether thiopurines could activate the UPR during IAV infection, A549 cells infected with IAV-PR8 were treated with 6-TG. We observed that 6-TG caused strong accumulation of BiP which coincided with diminished accumulation of HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). By contrast, co-administration of 6-TG and the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>) diminished accumulation of BiP and partially restored HA levels in infected cells, without affecting levels of NP and M1 proteins. This suggests that thiopurine-mediated activation of the UPR/ISR is at least partially responsible for the diminished accumulation of HA glycoproteins in infected cells.</p>
<p id="P13">To corroborate our observation of 6-TG-mediated UPR activation, A549 cells were mock infected or IAV-PR8 infected, and treated with 6-TG, 6-MP, or TM for 24 h before harvesting RNA for RT-qPCR analysis of UPR gene expression. We analyzed transcripts produced from target genes linked to each arm of the UPR; ATF4 target gene <italic>CHOP</italic>, XBP1s target genes <italic>EDEM1</italic> and <italic>ERdj4</italic>, and ATF6(N) target genes <italic>BiP</italic> and <italic>HERPUD1</italic>. As expected, TM treatment caused strong induction of all 3 arms of the UPR and increased transcription of all five target genes in mock-infected cells and infected cells alike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). This strong and consistent transcriptional output between mock-infected and infected cells suggests that the UPR remains largely intact during IAV-PR8 infection. Treatment with 6-MP had little effect on UPR gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). By contrast, 6-TG treatment caused statistically significant increases in transcription from all five UPR target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). These observations confirm that 6-TG activates all three arms of the UPR, whereas the chemically similar thiopurine 6-MP does not.</p>

<title>Inhibition of the integrated stress response does not restore NA processing and oligomerization in 6-TG treated cells</title>
<p id="P14">IAV glycoproteins are translocated into the ER, where they are modified with N-linked glycans and organize into oligomeric complexes. Upon synthesis in the ER, the type II transmembrane protein NA is glycosylated and forms dimers linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds in the stalk region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) that then assemble into tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). We investigated the effect of 6-TG on NA processing and oligomerization using SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting procedures in the presence or absence of the disulfide bond reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT). Since NA tetramers are known to dissociate into dimers during electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>) we annotated the ∼120 kDa band as dimers/tetramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). We observed intact glycosylated NA dimers/tetramers and monomers in mock-treated IAV-PR8-infected cells, which were resolved into ∼60 kDa glycosylated NA monomers in the presence of DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Unglycosylated NA monomers were undetectable in mock-treated cells at steady state, confirming that N-glycosylation is a rapid initial step in NA processing in the ER. TM treatment eliminated NA dimers/tetramers, leaving a minor fraction of unglycosylated NA monomers. The 6-TG treatment diminished accumulation of all forms of NA, yielding a distinct residual band that migrated closer to the size of the unglycosylated NA monomers from TM-treated cells; this suggests that 6-TG treatment interferes with proper N-glycosylation of nascent NA. Treatment with Integrated Stress Response Inhibitor (ISRIB), which prevents ISR-mediated translation arrest by maintaining eIF2B activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>), rescued accumulation of NA monomers in both TM- and 6-TG-treated cells. However, ISRIB was not able to restore NA glycosylation and oligomerization. These data provide further evidence that 6-TG inhibits IAV glycoprotein accumulation via UPR/ISR activation and extends our understanding by demonstrating that ISR suppression does not fully reverse these effects. This is further supported by our observations that administration of ISRIB alone had no impact on IAV replication while co-administration of ISRIB with TM- or 6-TG failed to restore virion production in single-cycle infection assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>

<title>6-TG and 6-TGo inhibit HCoV-OC43 replication</title>
<p id="P15">
<italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that thiopurines 6-TG and 6-MP can reversibly inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV papain-like cysteine proteases PL(pro) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>); however, whether these thiopurines could inhibit viral replication was not assessed. Our observations of UPR activation and selective inhibition of IAV HA and NA processing and accumulation by low micromolar doses of 6-TG and 6TGo, but not 6-MP, suggest a distinct antiviral mechanism of action for these thiopurines. If true, the antiviral activity of 6-TG and 6-TGo may be broadly applicable to other viruses with envelope glycoproteins like coronaviruses. To test this directly, we performed HCoV-OC43 replication assays in human colorectal tumor-8 (HCT-8) cells in the presence of 2 μM and 10 μM doses of 6-TG, 6-TGo and 6-MP, with TM serving as a strong UPR-inducing positive control. At 24 h, cell-free and cell-associated virus was collected and combined and titered by TCID50 in Baby Hamster Kidney-21 (BHK-21) cells. We observed strong, dose-dependent inhibition of HCoV-OC43 replication in the presence of 6-TG and 6-TGo resulting in a &gt;10-fold reduction in viral titre, whereas 6-MP had minimal effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). As expected, TM also potently inhibited HCoV-OC43 replication. Similar to A549 cells, HCT-8 cell viability was minimally affected by the thiopurines at concentrations at or below 10 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Consistent with the strong effect on infectious virion production, we also observed significant, dose-dependent reductions in viral protein accumulation due to 6-TG and 6-TGo treatment in HCoV-OC43-infected HCT-8 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>, the main band recognized by the anti-OC43 antibody is consistent with the size of the nucleocapsid N protein). Treatment with higher dose of 6-MP caused detectable decline in N protein levels in HCoV-OC43-infected cells, but not to the levels observed with 6-TG or 6-TGo treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). In HCoV-OC43-infected HCT-8 cells, BiP and CHOP expression was upregulated following thiopurine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). This is consistent with the significant induction of BiP proten and <italic>CHOP</italic> mRNA levels that was observed in thiopurine-treated A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). To test the effects of 6-TG on CoV replication, we analysed HCoV-OC43 mRNA synthesis by harvesting RNA from infected cells treated with 6-TG or vehicle control. We observed that 6-TG treatment caused significant decreases in steady-state levels of (+) genomic RNA (ORF1ab) as well as (+) subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) that encodes N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). Thus, despite the previously reported effects of 6-TG and 6-MP on HCoV cysteine protease activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, we observed that 6-MP had only modest effects on HCoV-OC43 replication whereas 6-TG and 6-TGo had clear antiviral effects similar to our previous observations of inhibition of IAV replication. Thiopurine antiviral activity in our HCoV-OC43 infection assays correlated with UPR activation and hampered viral genome synthesis and viral protein production.</p>

<title>6-TG inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein accumulation via UPR activation</title>
<p id="P16">Because 6-TG activates the UPR/ISR and inhibits the processing and accumulation of IAV glycoproteins, we reasoned that coronavirus glycoproteins would be similarly affected by 6-TG treatment. Due to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, numerous reagents and constructs have been rapidly developed to study this virus, including expression plasmids. We therefore sought to determine if SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein is sensitive to 6-TG in ectopic expression experiments. S is first translated as full-length S0 proprotein, before cleavage to S1 and S2 domains by cellular proprotein convertases like furin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). We observed that the S protein co-localised with the ER marker calnexin when expressed alone or co-expressed with M protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). M also caused some of the S protein to accumulate in distinct regions of the cytoplasm proximal to, but not overlapping with, calnexin-stained ER, which likely represents the ERGIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). Ectopic expression of S led to accumulation of ∼230 kDa full-length N-glycosylated S0 monomers; detection of ∼110 kDa S1 ectodomains demonstrated efficient S N-glycosylation and trimerization in the ER and transport to the Golgi for furin cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). We observed that ectopic S expression was sufficient to activate the UPR/ISR, as indicated by accumulation of BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>), consistent with previous reports of SARS-CoV-1 S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). 6-TG causes a loss of membrane-bound S0 and S2, but spared the cleaved S1 subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7B</xref>). Co-expression of S with M altered S processing leading to different accumulation of S1 protein species, possibly due to altered S trafficking by M and retention at the ERGIC compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). PNGase F treatment of the lysates to remove N-glycosylations confirmed that M and 6-TG altered glycosylation of S, but did not affect cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). Treatment with either the chemical chaperone 4PBA or DBeQ, a selective chemical inhibitor of the p97 AAA-ATPase, led to partial restoration of S0 and S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7D</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that like IAV glycoproteins, SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein is vulnerable to 6-TG mediated activation of the UPR/ISR and suggest a mechanism involving accelerated turnover of membrane-anchored S0 and S2 proteins by ERAD.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P17">Compared to current direct-acting antiviral drugs, effective host-targeting antivirals may provide a higher barrier to the emergence of antiviral drug-resistant viruses. However, it remains challenging to identify cellular pathways that can be targeted to disrupt viral replication without causing adverse effects on bystander uninfected cells. Here, we report that two chemically similar FDA-approved thiopurine analogues, 6-TG and 6-TGo, have broad antiviral effects that result from activation of UPR and disruption of viral glycoprotein synthesis and maturation. Importantly, our data demonstrate for the first time that 6-TG and 6-TGo are effective antivirals against influenza virus and coronavirus and may be effective against other glycoprotein-containing viruses. 6-TG is currently used in clinical settings to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other hematologic malignancies, with the main mechanism of action involving conversion into thioguanine nucleotides and subsequent incorporation into cellular DNA, which preferentially kills cycling cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Furthermore, the active 6-TG metabolite, 6-thioguanosine 5′-triphosphate, was shown to inhibit small GTPase Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>), which is believed to be largely responsible for anti-inflammatory effects of 6-TG in treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). Finally, 6-TG and closely related thiopurine 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) were demonstrated to have in vitro effects against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV as reversible, slow-binding inhibitors of papain-like cysteine protease PL(pro) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that 6-TG and 6-TGo, but not 6-MP or other nucleoside analogues (5-FU, ribavirin), induce the UPR in human cell lines. Selective disruption of viral glycoprotein accumulation in IAV-infected cells with minimal effects on other viral proteins suggests that UPR induction by 6-TG and 6-TGo is the main antiviral mechanism. Indeed, chemical chaperones and the ISR inhibitor ISRIB partially restored IAV HA, NA, and SARS-CoV-2 S protein accumulation in cells treated with 6-TG. Inhibition of the ERAD pathway with DBeQ also restored accumulation of ER membrane-anchored subunits of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (uncleaved precursor S0 and cleaved S2) in 6-TG-treated cells. This indicates that the 6-TG-induced UPR causes both the phospho-eIF2a dependent decrease in viral glycoprotein mRNA translation and the ERAD-mediated degradation of newly synthesized ER-anchored proteins. In the case of IAV which replicates in the nucleus of infected cells, depletion of viral envelope glycoproteins blocks infectious virion production but minimally affects replication of viral nucleic acids. By contrast, synthesis of coronavirus genomic RNA is inhibited by thiopurine-induced UPR. This reduction could be due to inhibition of PL(pro) activity as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>); however, we suggest that thiopurines likely inhibit viral replication due to its occurrence on the multivesicular network generated from virus-rearranged ER membranes which may be highly sensitive to UPR-induced alterations.</p>
<p id="P18">Our analyses of IAV-infected cells did not detect induction of UPR when high levels of viral glycoproteins HA and NA accumulated at later times post-infection. Many viruses have mechanisms to interfere with different arms of the UPR, presumably to maximize the production and trafficking of viral glycoproteins, and IAV was shown to inhibit activation of PERK and ATF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Downstream, IAV blocks new host mRNA processing and protein synthesis through host shutoff mechanisms mediated by viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and polymerase acidic X (PA-X) proteins. Despite these viral mechanisms of suppression of host stress responses, 6-TG treatment elicited similar levels of UPR in both infected and uninfected cells, as measured by transcriptional induction of genes downstream of all three arms of UPR and accumulation of BiP protein. Thus, in our system it appears that 6-TG circumvents viral mechanisms of UPR suppression.</p>
<p id="P19">Despite multiple mechanisms deployed by IAV to block SG formation, 6-TG and 6-TGo treatment induced SGs in infected cells, which allowed us to identify these molecules in our image-based screen. We previously reported that in A549 cells, IAV inhibited SG formation triggered by treatment with thapsigargin, a potent inducer of ER stress, with only 9% of infected cells forming SGs compared to 35% of mock-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Thus, induction of SGs in approximately 10% of infected cells by 6-TG and 6-TGo treatment appears consistent with our previous observations. However, unlike thapsigargin, 6-TG and 6-TGo did not trigger SG formation in uninfected cells. The levels of UPR induction by these drugs were similar between infected and uninfected cells, highlighting that in IAV-infected cells SG formation may not be triggered exclusively by ER stress and PERK activation and may only partially contribute to antiviral effects of thiopurines. Indeed, SGs formed in a fraction of infected cells while accumulation of viral glycoproteins HA and NA was nearly completely blocked by 6-TG and 6-TGo.</p>
<p id="P20">Consistent with previous reports, ectopic expression of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was enhanced during M co-expression and S alone was sufficient to trigger ER stress. In this system, 6-TG treatment further potentiated UPR responses, as measured by increased BiP accumulation. Our data also highlight the sensitivity of membrane anchored viral proteins to 6-TG treatment. It is currently unknown if host glycoproteins will be similarly affected by 6-TG treatment, but this is an important question to answer due to the prevalent use of thiopurines clinically. While we suspect that 6-TG and 6-TGo will be effective against a wide-range of enveloped viruses, our future studies will investigate if SARS-CoV-2 replication can be negatively impacted following thiopurine treatment. In the midst of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, repurposing FDA-approved medications as host-targeted antivirals has the potential to positively impact our treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, further studies in cell culture models of SARS-CoV-2 infection are necessary prior to considering clinical studies.</p>
<p id="P21">What is the mechanism of UPR induction by 6-TG and 6-TGo? Our results suggest that the effects are unlikely to be mediated through DNA or RNA incorporation of 6-TG because 1) replicative stress does not specifically induce UPR; 2) among viral proteins, glycoprotein accumulation and processing was preferentially disrupted; 3) messenger RNA levels of HA and NA were not affected. Furthermore, the closely related thiopurine 6-MP that can be converted into 6-thioguanosine triphosphate and incorporated into nucleic acids did not induce UPR and had no effect on IAV glycoproteins or OC43 replication. Another nucleoside analogue, 5-FU, that is also incorporated into nucleic acids and can even trigger SG formation upon prolonged 48-hour incubation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>), was similarly inactive in our assays. The second previously described antiviral mechanism of action of 6-TG and 6-MP that involves direct inhibition of viral cysteine proteases is similarly unlikely to have major contribution to the observed phenotypes because UPR induction was triggered in both infected and uninfected cells and because, as mentioned above, 6-MP was not active in our assays. Thus, by process of elimination, we speculate that the mechanism of UPR induction by 6-TG and 6-TGo could involve GTPase inhibition. Numerous GTPases regulate ER homeostasis, including Rab GTPases that govern vesicular trafficking events and dynamin-like GTPases that regulate homotypic ER membrane fusion events required for the maintenance of branched tubular networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). Future studies will focus on identifying specific molecular targets of these UPR-inducing thiopurines using orthogonal biochemical and genetic screens.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p id="P33">Statistical analysis was performed using PRISM graph pad 8, using a one-way ANOVA multiple comparison test (Tukey) or Two-way ANOVA using the multiple comparison test using Dunnett’s correction. Significance is indicated with * (p-value of &lt;0.05), ** (p-value of &lt;0.01), *** (p-value of &lt;0.001), **** (p-value of &lt;0.0001).</p>

<title>Importance</title>

<p>Secreted and transmembrane proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are folded and modified prior to transport. During infection, many viruses burden the ER with the task of creating and processing viral glycoproteins that will ultimately be incorporated into viral envelopes. Some viruses refashion the ER into replication compartments where viral gene expression and genome replication take place. This viral burden on the ER can trigger the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), which attempts to increase the protein folding and processing capacity of the ER to match the protein load. Much remains to be learned about how viruses co-opt the UPR to ensure efficient synthesis of viral glycoproteins. Here, we show that two FDA-approved thiopurine drugs, 6-TG and 6-TGo, induce the UPR in a manner that impedes viral glycoprotein accumulation for enveloped influenza viruses and coronaviruses. These drugs may impede the replication of viruses that require precise tuning of the UPR to support viral glycoprotein synthesis for the successful completion of a replication cycle.</p>
