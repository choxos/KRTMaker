<abstract>
<p id="P1">The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly spreads across worldwide and becomes a global pandemic. Remdesivir is the only COVID-19 treatment approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, its effectiveness is still under questioning as raised by the results of a large WHO Solidarity Trial. Herein, we report that the parent nucleotide of remdesivir, GS-441524, potently inhibits the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Vero E6 and other cells. It exhibits good plasma distribution and longer half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>=4.8h) in rat PK study. GS-441524 is highly efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 in AAV-hACE2 transduced mice and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) in mice, reducing the viral titers in CoV-attacked organs, without noticeable toxicity. Given that GS-441524 was the predominant metabolite of remdesivir in the plasma, the anti-COVID-19 effect of remdesivir may partly come from the effect of GS-441524. Our results also supported that GS-441524 as a promising and inexpensive drug candidate in the treatment of COVID-19 and future emerging CoVs diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in December 2019.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup> SARS-CoV-2 is a novel single-stranded RNA virus belonging to beta coronavirus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup> Although most coronavirus infections cause only mild respiratory symptoms, infection with SARS-CoV-2 could progress to acute severe respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and be lethal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup> Since the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), infection and mortality rapidly increased worldwide. As of 24 October 2020, more than 42,000,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and &gt;1,100,000 associated deaths were reported worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 global case dashboard. Effective therapies and drug candidates to treat COVID-19 are urgently needed.</p>
<p id="P3">Although several virus-based and host-based therapeutics agents have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, such as lopinavir/ritonavir,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup> immunoglobulin, hydroxychloroquine,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup> EIDD-2801,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup> baricitinib,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup> and AT-527.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup> Currently, only remdesivir, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) inhibitor, recently received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for COVID-19 treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup> However, its effectiveness to reduce hospital stay and risk of death of COVID-19 patients is still under questioning, as revealed by WHO solidarity trial.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup> In addition, the broad applicability of remdesivir, especially accessibility in the developing country will be limited by its difficulty to synthesize and expensiveness. Structurally, remdesivir (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) is a nucleotide McGuigan prodrug presuming to be intracellularly metabolized into an active analog of triphosphate (GS-443902).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup> The anionic phosphate moiety on remdesivir is masked by phenol and L-alaninate ethylbutyl ester, which is supposed to be enzymatically cleaved-off inside cells. However, pharmacokinetics (PK) study in nonhuman primates and healthy human subjects showed that remdesivir is rapidly metabolized to be GS-704277, GS-441524 (parent nucleoside), and GS-443902 in plasma following intravenous administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup> The major metabolite GS-441524 demonstrated a more persistent plasma exposure, a longer half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub> ~ 27 h for GS-441524 vs. t<sub>1/2</sub> ~ 1h for remdesivir) and a larger AUC value (AUC = 2230 h’ng/ml for GS-441524 vs. AUC = 1590 h`ng/ml for remdesivir).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup> The contribution of its metabolites especially GS-441524, to clinical outcomes is not fully understood.</p>
<p id="P4">
<italic>In vitro</italic> studies revealed that GS-441524 was significantly less potent against Ebola virus (EBOV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), as compared to remdesivir.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup> The activation of nucleoside analogs needs two enzymatic phosphorylation steps to convert to the pharmacologically active triphosphate (GS-443902). The conversion of GS-441524 to monophosphate is considered a rate-limiting step in the activation of GS-441524. The prodrug remdesivir is considered to be superior to GS-441524 by bypassing the perceived rate-limiting first phosphorylation step and also by improving cell permeability.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup> However, GS-441524 exhibited good <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy against human coronaviruses (CoV), such as SARS-CoV, middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and zoonotic coronaviruses. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) was caused by feline coronaviruses (FCoV) infection and has long been considered a fatal feline disease. A 96% cure rate was observed in GS-441524 treated cats with feline coronavirus infection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup> These early studies indicate the potential of GS-441524 for the treatment of coronavirus diseases as well as COVID-19.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup> Herein, we investigated and compared GS-441524 with remdesivir for their <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, PK profile and <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and MHV. Our results provided further experimental insights to emphasize GS-441524 as a potential antiviral for COVID-19 and future emerging CoVs diseases.</p>

<title>GS-441524 and remdesivir potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication</title>
<p id="P5">Initially, we compared the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of GS-441524 and remdesivir in Vero E6 (African green monkey kidney cells), calu-3 (human lung adenocarcinoma cell) and caco-2 cells (colorectal adenocarcinoma). Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05 and treated with varying concentrations of remdesivir or GS-441524. Antiviral activities were evaluated by qRT-PCR quantification of viral copy number in the supernatant at 48 h post infection. GS-441524 and remdesivir potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner, as showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. In Vero E6 cells, GS-441524 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.70 μM) inhibited SRAR-COV-2 one-fold more potent than remdesivir (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.35 μM). The determination of intracellular viral RNA load in Vero E6 showed a similar trend to that in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D-E</xref>). In calu-3 and caco-2 cells, remdesivir exhibited better efficacy. The IC<sub>50</sub> values of remdesivir in these two cells were 0.65 μM and 0.58 μM, and the IC<sub>50</sub> values of GS-441524 in these two cells were 3.21 μM and 3.62 μM, respectively. Our results are consistent with the previously reported studies that the relative potencies of GS-441524 and remdesivir are cell type dependent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup> Cytotoxicity of the compounds in Vero E6, calu-3 and caco-2 cells were determined by the CCK8 assay. GS-441524 did not inhibit cell growth at high concentrations up to 50 μM, indicating its good safety profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-C</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>The PK profile of GS-441524 in rat</title>
<p id="P6">The PK profile of remdesivir and its metabolites was studied with intravenous (iv) administration of remdesivir in cynomolgus monkey and human subjects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup> However, there is no reported PK about GS-441524 itself. Next, we determined the pharmacokinetics of GS-441524 in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats <italic>via</italic> iv and intragastric (ig) injection with a dose of 30 mg/kg. GS-441524 exhibited encouraging iv PK parameters with a long half-life (t1/2) of 4.8 h and a high C<sub>max</sub> of 163616.6 μg/L. Although the bioavailability (~5 %) of GS-441524 is not ideal, the C<sub>max</sub> in ig administrated mice was 2708 μg/L (9.3μM), higher than the concentration required for &gt; 50% SARS-CoV-2 inhibition, indicating that GS-441524 might be able to achieve in vivo efficacy relevant doses following an oral dosing regimen. Our results were consistent with the clinical PK study of remdesivir, which showed GS-441524, as a metabolite, has improved plasma stability as compared to that of remdesivir.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>GS-441524 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in AAV-hACE2 transduced mice</title>
<p id="P7">We next proceeded to study the <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy of GS-441524. Although mice are the convenient animal for <italic>in vivo</italic> assessing the anti-COVID-19 activity of drugs, they are resistant to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter cells, but mouse ACE2 does not sensitize cells for infection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup> We established the transduction mice with adenovirus associated virus (AAV) vector expressing hACE2 in Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory. AAV-hACE2 mice support SARS-CoV-2 replication and exhibit pulmonary inflammation and lung injury.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup> In this study, 1×10<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup> plaque forming unit (PFU) SARS-CoV-2 were intranasally inoculated to AAV-hACE2 mice and mice body weights were monitored over a 10-day time course. Ip administration with GS-441524 one day prior to infection and continued dosing of 25 mg/kg/day for 8 days. SARS-CoV-2 infection of AAV-hACE2-sensitized mice were characterized by significant weight loss (more than 20%), severe pulmonary pathology and high-titer virus replication in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). GS-441524 demonstrated a significant virus clearance in lung at 2 dpi and protection of mice from body weight loss. Compared with mice treated with GS-441524, the lung tissues of untreated mice showed multiple injuries, including inflammatory cell infiltration from the trachea, peri-alveolar to interstitium. These data in sum were the first solid demonstration of the <italic>in vivo</italic> potency of GS-441524 against SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>The efficacy of GS-441524 in the treatment of mice MHV infection</title>
<p id="P8">MHV belongs to the coronavirus RNA viruses, sharing a common genus to SARS-CoV-2.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup> MHV-A59 (A59 strain of MHV) infection caused hepatitis in mice, which could serve as a rapid experimental model to evaluate anti-CoVs agents. GS-441524 is known to be efficacious against MHV replication <italic>in vitro</italic> through RdRP inhibition.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup> However, whether it was able to reach the target organ and have <italic>in vivo</italic> effect was not known. To gain insight into the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of GS-441524, mice were intranasally inoculated with MHV-A59 and the infection caused 87.5% of animal dead at 7 dpi (day post inoculation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, group A). Administration of GS-441524 via ig (B1 group) or ip (intraperitoneal injection, B2 group) began at 0.5 hpi, with a dose of 100 mg/kg once (dose doubled) for the first day and 50 mg/kg/day for the following four days. The potent anti-MHV activities of GS-441524 was illustrated by the significant improvement of animal survival. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The survival rate at the end of the experiment was 100% in group B1and B2 compared to 12.5% in group A.</p>
<p id="P9">To analysis the viral titration in the liver, RNA was extracted from lung tissue for qRT-PCR analysis at 3 dpi of the MHV infected mice (A, B1and B2 groups). GS-441524 treatment was able to significantly inhibit virus replication in the lung by more than 99.9% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, drug treatment (C1 and C2 group) without virus inoculation did not significantly affect the body change, as compared to blank control (group D), indicating the excellent safety profile of GS-441524 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). The body weight loss of the virus inoculated mice (groups A, B1 and B2) might cause by the virus infection. These results were readily reproduced in a repeating experiment (Figure S2). Although the bioavailability of GS-441524 was low (about 5%), the current ig dosage was able to achieve <italic>in vivo</italic> therapeutic concentration and exhibited similar efficacy to other treatments, indicating the potential of GS-441524 as an oral drug.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P10">The COVID-19 pandemic associated with high contagiousness, morbidity and mortality, emphasizing the imperative need for anti-viral agents. RdRP inhibitor remdesivir was the only anti-COVID-19 drug that accelerated the recovery in adults who were hospitalized with COVID-19 in a large randomized clinical trial, but controversy still remains.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup> Due to the synthesis complexity, expensiveness of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) and obligatory intravenous administration, the application and accessibility of remdesivir will be limited. The parent nucleotide GS-441524 is superior to remdesivir in several aspects. First of all, GS-441524 is a structurally simple molecule and is easier to synthesize than remdesivir. Secondly, pre-clinical and clinical PK study of remdesivir revealed that GS-441524 was the predominant and persistent metabolite in circulation. Although other metabolites, such as alanine metabolite GS-704277, triphosphorylated GS-443902 was also detected in the plasma, these compounds are highly negative charged and have poor cell membrane permeability, which will then inevitably convert to GS-441524 or excrete from the body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Thirdly, GS-441524 showed potent anti-viral activity against several stains of coronaviruses. However, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 in cultured primary human airway epithelial (HAE) is much more sensitive to remdesivir than GS-441524 with a selectivity index of more than 1,000, questioning the efficacy of GS-441524 in lung tissue and COVID-19.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup> Herein, we reported the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of GS-441524. GS-441524 effectively inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 replication in all three cell lines (Vero E6, calu-3 and caco-2). It was able to rescue mice from death and reduce the viral load in the liver, either administrated ip, or ig. Importantly, GS-441524 showed significant efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection in mouse AAV-hACE2 model. We showed that GS-441524 potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and alleviates lung inflammation and injury, suggesting the antiviral activity in human lung tissue and effectiveness against COVID-19 and highlighting the differences in <italic>in vitro</italic> HAE cultures and intact respiratory epithelial cells. Moreover, GS-441524 showed limited cytotoxicity and <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity, demonstrating its remarkable safety profile together with the cytotoxicity screening as reported by Gilead and others.<sup>

</p>
<p id="P11">The potent <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of GS-441524 against SARS-CoV-2 and MHV in mice model we reported here, together with the previous anti-FIP activity, demonstrate its broad application against zoonotic and human CoVs, its broad distribution and effectiveness to convert into the active GS-443902 across different tissues. Our results in sum indicated that part of remdesivir’s therapeutic effect resulted from the active metabolite GS441524 and the unnecessariness of the structural complexity of remdesivir. It was estimated that the pandemic of COVID-19 will be lasting for a long time. As zoonotic relative of CoVs repeatedly evolves to fatal CoVs, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, identification and evaluation of anti-viral therapies are urgently needed in the present and in the future. Our results supported GS-441524 is a promising drug candidate in the treatment of COVID-19 as well as future emerging coronavirus infection diseases, which might be helpful to address the current urgent need for safe and cheap antiviral treatment besides remdesivir.</p>

<title>qRT-PCR analysis</title>
<p id="P14">For SARS-CoV-2 supernatant RNA quantification, RNA was isolated by E.Z.N.A.®Viral RNA Kit (OMEGA). SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kit (Daan Company) is used to detect the virus. For the detection of cellular viruses and tissue viruses, total RNA was isolated from cells or tissue samples with TRIzol reagent under the instruction of the manufacturer. The mRNAs were reverse transcribed into cDNA by PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (Takara). The cDNA was amplified by a fast two-step amplification program using ChamQ Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd). GAPDH was used to normalize the input samples via the ΔΔCt method. The relative mRNA expression level of each gene was normalized to GAPDH housekeeping gene expression in the untreated condition, and fold induction was calculated by the ΔΔCT method relative to those in untreated samples.</p>

The 50 <italic>μ</italic>L AAV solution was then aerosolized at a rate of about 15 <italic>μ</italic>L/second using a microsprayer under fiberoptic laryngoscope. The mouse was further maintained anesthesia for 5 min to promote delivery of the vector deep into the lungs before transferring back to the cage. Thirty days post transduction, mice were intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2 (1 × 10<sup>5</sup> PFU) in a total volume of 50 <italic>μ</italic>L DMEM. Immediately, they were randomly divided into two groups (each group had 9 mice). A dosage of 25mg/kg/day of GS441524 or vehicle was ip administrated to the mice beginning at -1 dpi for a consecutive 8 days. Mice were monitored and weighed daily. 4 mice of each group were dissected at 2 dpi to collect lung tissues for virus titer detection and HE staining. All protocols were approved by the Animal Welfare Committee and all procedures used in this study complied with the guidelines and policies of the Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>

Control groups (Group C1, C2 and D, each group have 3 mice) were mock treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Mice in B1 and B2 group received GS-441524 via ig (Group B1) or ip (Group B2) at 0.5h pi at a dose of 100 mg/kg respectively and mice in A group received PBS instead. Mice in control groups (Group C1, C2 and D) received GS-441524 or PBS in the same way. GS-441524 were administered 50 mg/kg once a day in the following four days. Group A and D administered 0.2 mL of PBS. Mice were monitored daily for symptoms of disease: including body weights, clinical symptoms and death for14 days. 4 mice of group A, B1 and B2 were dissected at 3 dpi to collect liver tissues for virus titration detection.

The viral yield in the cell supernatant was then quantified by qRT-PCR. Data represented are the mean value of % inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 on cells. At the same time, the cytotoxicity at different concentrations of drugs was tested. Vero-E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.05 and treated with different doses (0, 5, 10 μM) of the indicated compounds for 48 h. The viral RNA in the cell supernatant (<bold>D</bold>) and intracellular (<bold>E</bold>) was then quantified by qRT-PCR.</p>
