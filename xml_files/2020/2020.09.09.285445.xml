<abstract>
<p id="P1">We report the development and evaluation of safety and immunogenicity of a whole virion inactivated SARS-COV-2 vaccine (BBV152), adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide gel (Algel), or a novel TLR7/8 agonist adsorbed Algel. We used a well-characterized SARS-CoV-2 strain and an established vero cell platform to produce large-scale GMP grade highly purified inactivated antigen, BBV152. Product development and manufacturing were carried out in a BSL-3 facility. Immunogenicity was determined at two antigen concentrations (3μg and 6μg), with two different adjuvants, in mice, rats, and rabbits. Our results show that BBV152 vaccine formulations generated significantly high antigen-binding and neutralizing antibody titers, at both concentrations, in all three species with excellent safety profiles. The inactivated vaccine formulation containing TLR7/8 agonist adjuvant-induced Th1 biased antibody responses with elevated IgG2a/IgG1 ratio and increased levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IFN-γ+ CD4 T lymphocyte response. Our results support further development for Phase I/II clinical trials in humans.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel human coronavirus<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>, has spread to almost every country in the world. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to β-genus of serbecovirus and is a close relative of SARS-CoV with close to 80% sequence identify. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID19), a pandemic in March 2020. So far, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 25 million people causing close to 850,000 deaths. It is, therefore, imperative to develop effective prophylactic and therapeutic countermeasures to prevent and treat COVID19.</p>
<p id="P3">The development of a safe and effective vaccine has become a top priority globally to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pandemic. Numerous vaccine candidates are in the preclinical and clinical trial stages. However, meeting the global need for billions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines will require collective effort to identify, evaluate, validate, and manufacture effective vaccines. Inactivated vaccines for viral diseases have been licensed for decades with well-established safety profiles<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. The availability of well-characterized vero cell manufacturing platform with proven safety in other licensed, live, and inactivated vaccines have aided in rapid vaccine development<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. Prior experience in developing inactivated had given us the confidence to develop a fully inactivated with an intact virion, imperative for obtaining an antigen that will yield high immunogenicity. Therefore, to facilitate the development of an effective COVID19 vaccine, we have used a well-characterized SARS-CoV-2 strain and an established vero cell (CCL-81) platform to produce large-scale GMP grade highly purified BBV152 vaccine candidate. It has to be mentioned here that there are several vaccine candidates at different stages of clinical development, such as adenovirus-vectored vaccines, recombinant protein-based, and inactivated vaccines. The inactivated vaccine (PiCoVacc) and the recombinant vaccine (CoV-RBD219N1), which are aluminium adjuvant formulations, have been shown to generate high levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) to the S-protein, which could play an important role in vaccine efficacy. Hence, the development of inactivated vaccines for COVID-19 disease prevention appears to be a rational approach, while recognizing the fact that such inactivated vaccines with alum adjuvant specifically induce T helper 2 cells.</p>
<p id="P4">While the development of safe and effective coronavirus vaccines is a priority, vaccine-induced disease enhancement observed in preclinical animal models due to Th2-like immunity is a concern. To circumvent the Th-2 bias and to develop a safe vaccine, we formulated a new adjuvant that contains an imidaquizoquinoline class TLR7/8 agonist adsorbed to Algel. TLR7/8 agonists induce strong type I interferon responses from dendritic cells and monocyte-macrophages that facilitate the development of Th1 biased immunity instead of a pathogenic Th2-biased immunity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">Here, we report the immunogenicity and safety evaluation of the whole virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate BBV152, which was evaluated at three antigen concentrations (3,6, and 9μg) and two adjuvants in three animal models, i.e., mice, rats, and rabbits. Our results show that these vaccine formulations induced significantly elevated titers of antigen binding and neutralizing antibodies in all animal models tested without any safety concerns. We also show that the vaccine was formulated with Algel-adsorbed TLR7/8 agonist-induced Th1 biased immunity with significantly elevated SARS-CoV-2 specific IFN□+ CD4 T cell response. Collectively these results demonstrate that the BBV152 vaccine candidate induces protective and durable NAb and T cell responses. As a result, BBV152 vaccine candidate has been considered for phase I clinical trials.</p>

<title>Isolation and selection of SARS-CoV-2 strain for vaccine candidate preparation</title>
<p id="P6">During the initial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in India, specimens from 12 infected patients were collected and sequenced at the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV), India, a WHO Collaborating Center for Emerging Viral Infections<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. The SARS-CoV-2 strain (NIV-2020-770) used in developing the BBV152 vaccine candidate was retrieved from tourists who arrived in New Delhi, India<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. The sample propagation and virus isolation were performed in the Vero CCL-81. The SARS-CoV-2 sequence was deposited in the GISAID (EPI_ISL_420545). The BBV152 vaccine candidate strain is located in the (G clade), also represented as ‘20A’ clade that is the most prevalent strain in India (followed by ‘19A’) as per data represented in the Next strain analysis of the Indian analysis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. In terms of the overall divergence of SARS-CoV-2, this strain is 99.97% identical to the earliest strain Wuhan Hu-1<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. The multiple passages done in the Vero CCl-81 demonstrated the genetic stability of the virus. The next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads generated from the nucleotide sequences of the BBV152 vaccine candidate strain and its passage one at PID-3 was found to be comparable with the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan Hu-1 strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). A maximum difference of 0.075% in the nucleotides was observed, indicating negligible changes in the different batches of the samples analyzed—these results showed genetic stability of the NIV-2020-770 strain for further vaccine development. The seed virus (NIV 2020-770 strain) was transferred from ICMR-NIV to Bharat Biotech, India. Samples from different drug Substance batches of BBIL, along with the original virus, clustered into a single group and indicate an origin from previous passages.</p>

<title>Vaccine candidate preparation</title>
<p id="P7">GMP production of virus bulk was standardized in bioreactors. The seed virus was adapted to a highly characterized GMP vero cell platform, amplified to produce the master and working virus bank. The master virus bank was characterized based on WHO Technical Report Series guidelines (identity, sterility, mycoplasma, virus titration, adventitious agents, hemadsorption, virus identity by Next Generation Sequencing. The viral RNA isolated from the master virus bank (MVB) was sequenced using NGS the platform at ICMR-NIV and Eurofins Bangalore, India. The sequence reconfirmed the identity of MVB as the NIV 2020-770 strain of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="P8">Vero cells and virus were propagated in the bio-safety level-3 (BSL-3) facility using bioreactors. Growth kinetics analysis showed that the stock replicated to 7.0 log10 TCID<sub>50</sub> between 36- and 72-hours protection. ß-propiolactone was utilized for the inactivation of the virus by mixing the virus stock between 2-8°C. During the inactivation kinetics experiments with varying conditions and concentrations, samples were collected at various time points (between 0 to 24 hours, at 4-hour intervals) to evaluate the cytopathic effect of live virus. Three consecutive inactivation procedures were performed to ensure complete viral inactivation without affecting the antigen stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed that the inactivated and purified virus particles were intact, oval-shaped, and were accompanied by a crown-like structure representing the well-defined spike on the virus membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) Inactivated and purified virus was also characterized by western blot for its identity with SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies using various stages of vaccine candidate development such as cell harvest, clarified supernatant, post-inactivation, and purification. Western blot analysis showed distinct bands of all proteins. Purified and inactivated whole virion antigen produced from three production batches were probed with anti-Spike (S1 &amp; S2), anti-RBD, and anti-N protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results showed that the final purified inactivated bulk of the vaccine candidate is highly pure and contains S (S1, S2), RBD, and N protein bands with their corresponding equivalent molecular weight.</p>

<title>Vaccine formulations with adjuvants</title>
<p id="P9">BBV152 vaccine candidates were formulated with two alum adjuvants: Algel (aluminium hydroxide gel) and Algel-IMDG, an imidazoquinoline class molecule (TLR7/TLR8 agonist abbreviated as IMDG) adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide gel. The agonist molecule for Algel-IMDG was licensed from ViroVax LLC, USA. Three vaccine formulations were prepared with 3μg and 6μg with Algel-IMDG (BBV152A and BBV152B, respectively) and 6μg with Algel (BBV152C). To determine the stability of the vaccine formulations, inactivated antigen plus adjuvant preparations were stored at 37°C and 2-8°Ctemperature for seven days. These vaccine formulations were evaluated in Balb/C mice to estimate Nab titer by microneutralization test (MNT<sub>50</sub>). Our results demonstrated that the vaccine formulations are relatively stable at 37°C for 7 days, as shown by equivalent Nab titer compared to formulation stored at temperature 2-8°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). There is no significant difference between the two formulations (BBV152A &amp; BBV152B)</p>

<title>Safety</title>
<p id="P10">All the three BBV152 formulations, the pure antigens at 3 different concentrations, and the two adjuvants have been evaluated for safety in three animal models (mice, rats, and rabbits) following the required regulatory guidelines<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> summarizes the key tests completed and the observations thereof. Safety has been established in repeat-dose toxicity studies in Balb/C mice (female, 6-8weeks old) which were vaccinated intraperitoneally (<italic>i.p</italic>) with 1/20<sup>th</sup>of the intended human single dose (HSD, 3 or 6 or 9 μg) of inactivated vaccine candidate with or without adjuvant on day 0, 7 and 14. In contrast, New Zealand white rabbits, Swiss Albino mice, and Wistar rats were vaccinated intramuscularly (<italic>i.m</italic>. Algel-IMDG alone was further evaluated for safety by mutagenicity assay (bacterial reverse mutation). No substantial increase in revertant colony numbers in any of the tested strains was observed following treatment with Algel-IMDG alone at any dose level, in both the plate-incorporation and pre-incubation methods in the presence or absence of metabolic activation (S9 mix). The positive controls (Sodium azide, 4-Nitro-o-phenylenediamine, Methyl methane sulfonate, and 2-Aminoanthracene) used for various strains showed a distinct increase in induced revertant colonies in both the methods. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>)</p>
<p id="P11">In the Maximum Tolerated dose study performed with Algel-IMDG, the test item was tolerated at the tested dose (200 μg/animal) in mice and rats as demonstrated by lack of erythema, edema, or any other macroscopic lesions at the site of injection. Algel is a well-known adjuvant having been used in a large number of vaccines globally, we evaluated the safety profile of the novel adjuvant used in this study. Histopathology examination of the injection site showed active inflammation, as demonstrated by mononuclear cell infiltration, which is likely a physiological local inflammatory reaction caused by aluminium salt in the vaccine adjuvant preparation. In any of the studies conducted, there were no mortality or no changes observed in clinical signs, body weight gain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>), body temperature, or feed consumption in the treated animals.</p>

<title>Clinical pathology investigations</title>
<p id="P12">In all the animal models, haematology, clinical biochemistry, coagulation parameters, and urinalysis treated with adjuvanted vaccine candidates or adjuvants/antigen alone were comparable to control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). The following exceptions were noticed as Alpha 1-acid glycoprotein values were increased on day 2 with Algel-IMDG in male rats when compared to day 0, which reduced to normal levels by day 21. Evidence of an acute phase response was indicative of reactogenicity to the vaccine formulation, and the increase was noticed in the adjuvanted vaccine with the Algel-IMDG group alone. These findings correlate with the inflammatory reaction at the injection site in this group. The absolute and relative neutrophil counts were increased in female rats of groups (Antigen 6 μg + Algel 300 μg), and (Antigen 9 μg + Algel-IMDG 300 μg) on day 2 as compared to control. However, these values were noticed and were comparable to control on Day 21. This transient increase may be due to inflammation at the injection site after administration of the first dose.</p>

<title>Necropsy, organ weight, and histopathology</title>
<p id="P13">There were no treatment-related microscopic findings observed in antigen alone by intramuscular (<italic>i.m</italic>) route. In groups treated with adjuvants alone and adjuvanted vaccine with Algel &amp; Algel-IMDG, local reaction at the site of injection (quadriceps muscles of the hindlimb) was observed. In animals treated with Algel alone or adjuvanted vaccine with Algel, inflammatory changes characterized by mild infiltration of mononuclear cells and the presence of macrophages containing bluish material (interpreted to be aluminium in Algel) were observed. On day 21, animals treated with Algel-IMDG alone showed inflammation around homogeneous bluish material (interpreted to be test item) characterized by the infiltration of mononuclear cells. Additionally, macrophages containing bluish stained material understood to be aluminium in the test item (Algel-IMDG) were also observed. Algel produced a milder reaction when compared to Algel-IMDG. On day 28, reduction of inflammation was observed in both the adjuvants, and the number of macrophages containing bluish stained material was also observed less in the recovery groups when compared to day 21 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4 &amp; S5</xref>). No microscopic findings were observed in any of the organs examined, including spleen and lymph nodes, any of the animal models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6 &amp; S7</xref>). Organ weights across groups were comparable.</p>

<title>Immunogenicity studies</title>
<p id="P14">We assessed the immunogenicity of BBV152 formulations in BALB/c mice and New Zealand white rabbits]. All immunization studies were conducted based on a three-dose IM regimen conducted on days 0, 7, and 14. Pooled or individual serum samples collected on days 0, 7, 14, and 21 post-immunization/boost were evaluated for antibody binding (ELISA) and Nab by plaque reduction neutralizing titer (PRNT<sub>90)</sub>or MNT<sub>50</sub>against live SARS-CoV-2 strain.</p>
<sec id="S10">
<title>Immunogenicity inBAlb/c Mice</title>
<p id="P15">To assess the immunogenicity of the candidate vaccines, BALB/c mice (n=10) were injected via i.p route with three concentrations of antigen at 1/20<sup>th</sup>of the intended human single dose (i.e., 3μg, 6μg, and 9 μg/mouse). Vaccine formulations adjuvanted tested at three antigen concentrations elicited high levels of binding and Nab titer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A &amp; B</xref>). Antigen alone and adjuvants alone were included in these studies as controls (data not presented for brevity). Further, to assess the immunogenicity and safety of clinical batch samples, Balb/C mice (n=10/group, 5 Male and 5 Female) were vaccinated via IP route with three adjuvanted formulations with Algel and Algel-IMDG at 1/10<sup>th</sup> human intended single dose (3, and 6 μg/dose with Algel or Algel-IMDG). All adjuvanted vaccine formulations elicited antigen-specific binding antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Further, sera collected on Day 21 were analyzed by ELISA to determine S1, RBD, and N specific binding titer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Analysis of PRNT<sub>90,</sub> performed with individual mice sera, showed high Nab’s in all adjuvanted vaccines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref> depicts the effect of dose sparing of Algel-IMDG. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref> depicts the 8-fold increase in vaccine potency, when dosing was in day 14 intervals. Additionally, dosing with antigen alone was found to be immunogenic. However, the responses were significantly lower than the adjuvanted vaccine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>).</p>

<title>Immunogenicity in New Zealand White Rabbits</title>
<p id="P16">Rabbits (n=8) were immunized with antigen concentrations for humans (3 and 6 μg/dose) on days 0, 7, and 14. The groups that received BBV152A &amp; B showed a slightly higher binding antibody response compared to BBV152C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), though not statistically significant. Examination of neutralizing antibody titers revealed high PRNT<sub>90</sub>titers on day 21 are also reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Further, NAb’s performed by MNT<sub>50</sub> were compared with Nabs from a panel of human convalescent sera from recovered symptomaticCOVID-19 patients.

<title>BBV152 adjuvanted with TLR7/8 adsorbed algel induces Th1 biased immune response</title>
<sec id="S13">
<title>Immunoglobulin Subclasses</title>
<p id="P17">Antibody isotyping (IgG1 &amp; IgG2a) was analyzed on day 21 serum samples to evaluate the Th1/Th2 polarization by vaccination with the two adjuvants. The average ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 was higher in all antigen concentrations with Algel-IMDG when compared to Algel, indicative of Th1 bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Additionally, antigen immunized with 6mg Algel-IMDG samples induced significantly higher responses of interferon-γ(IFNγ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). These results suggest that Algel-IMDG adjuvant that contains TLR7/8 agonist induces Th1 biased protective immunity and thus is a promising adjuvant for further development.</p>
<p id="P18">To further evaluate whether adjuvanted vaccine formulations (with Algel &amp; Algel-IMDG) induced Th1 response or not, we performed intracellular staining using vaccinated mice splenocytes after stimulation with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 antigen and determined IFNγ producing T lymphocytes. Interestingly, we found that the adjuvanted formulation with Algel-IMDG (BBV152A &amp; B) showed elevated levels of IFNγ producing CD4 cell population, compared to those with Algel. These results indicate that antigen formulated with Algel-IMDG skewed towards Th1 mediated response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) and induced strong T cell immunity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P21">Here, we report the development of a whole virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (BBV152). The strain used for this candidate is pathogenic in humans and has shown extensive genetic stability and appropriate growth characteristics for the selection of a vaccine candidate. Preclinical toxicity and safety evaluation of the three formulations showed minimal to no adverse events. Our results show that the vaccine formulations induced significantly elevated antigen-binding antibody and Nab responses in the animals immunized, with a distinct Th1 bias observed with Algel-IMDG adjuvanted vaccines. Although the neutralizing antibody titers are not statistically different between the antigen concentration (3μg and 6μg) or the nature of adjuvant, all the formulations tested have exhibited excellent immunogenicity. Our potency results compare quite favorably with those reported in the literature for similar COVID-19 vaccines. Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (BBIBP-CorV) has been shown to induce high levels of Nab titers in mice and rats to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. A purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc) has also been shown to induce SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb in mice and rats. These antibodies potently neutralized 10 representative SARS-CoV-2 strains, indicative of a possible broader neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P22">The risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a serious concern for COVID-19 vaccine development<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. A few animal studies from animal SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV inactivated or vectored vaccines adjuvanted with alum have shown correlation to Th2 responses resulting in eosinophilic infiltration in the lungs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. Alum is the most frequently used vaccine adjuvant with an extensive safety record. It is desired to have a COVID-19 vaccine that can generate both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The response generated from alum is primarily Th2-biased with the induction of strong humoral responses via neutralizing antibodies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. It is not clear if alum alone can stimulate T-cell responses. Complicating adverse events may be associated with the induction of weakly or non-neutralizing antibodies that lead to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) or enhanced respiratory disease (ERD), thus warranting COVID-19 vaccines to induce CD4 Th1(interferon-γ, interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factorα) response with minimal Th2 response<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. Preclinical studies in mice reported that inactivated vaccine-induced eosinophil immunopathology in the lungs upon SARS-CoV infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup> could be avoided using TLR agonist as or in adjuvant formulations. Although current understanding of the risk of COVID-19 vaccine-associated ADE/ERD is limited, the use of TLR7/8 agonists in an adjuvant in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulation will minimize Th2 response, if any.</p>
<p id="P23">Over many decades it has shown that vaccination is generally a safe and well-tolerated procedure. Nevertheless, toxic actions of vaccines can result from any of the following, drug substance and drug product, including excipients used for formulation. The current preclinical studies conducted with BBV152, adjuvanted with the two adjuvants, did not indicate any undesirable pathological changes and systemic toxicity. Local reactogenicity to adjuvants used in vaccine formulation were the only findings noted. Algel (Alum) is the most commonly used agent as an adjuvant. It has been shown to act by depot formation at the site of injection, allowing for a slow release of antigen. Further, it converts soluble antigens into particulate forms, which are readily phagocytosed<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. The microscopic findings at the site of injection in the present studies showed the infiltration of macrophages and mononuclear cells. The other adjuvant, Algel-IMDG, contained TLR7/8 in addition to Algel, which was added to augment innate and adaptive immunity, induced slightly higher reactogenicity. IM injection induces a depot effect followed by the passive trafficking of algel particles via lymphatic flow from the interstitial space to the draining lymph nodes, as revealed by IFN-β/luciferase reporter mice (unpublished). The lymph node-targeting of Algel-IMDG ensures high adjuvant activity in the target organ (lymph nodes) by enabling the induction of a strong, specific, adaptive immune response while minimizing systemic exposure. The local reaction in the studies conducted was consistent with those available in the literature for these adjuvants, which is a physiological reaction to injection rather than any adverse event<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P24">Collectively, both the adjuvanted vaccines (with Algel and Algel-IMDG), Antigen and Adjuvant alone did not reveal any treatment-related findings, except local reactions when administered through the human intended route (intramuscular) on days 0, 7, and 14 (n+1) with full Human single dose (HSD) or higher than HSD in rodents and non-rodents, thereby establishing the vaccine safety. In our preclinical studies, we demonstrated that all the three inactivated whole virion SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates showed 100% seroconversion with high titers of antigen binding and neutralizing antibody responses. Further, the adjuvanted formulation, BBV152B, when immunized in Balb/C mice, showed 10 times higher dose sparing effect compared to antigen alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Moreover, these formulations induced immunity that is biased towards Th1 mediated response, as demonstrated by the ratio between IgG2a and IgG1 (greater than 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Additionally, secretion of anti-viral cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-alpha, IFNγ was observed on days 7 and 14(7 days after the 1<sup>st</sup>&amp;2<sup>nd</sup> dose) of vaccination with Algel-IMDG adjuvanted formulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Further, the tendency to secrete anti-viral cytokines, IFN-alpha (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>), might contribute to the activation of the first line of defense mechanisms, which lead to enhanced activation of antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells or macrophages<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. It is reported that TLR recognition in innate cell population drives early type I IFN production, thereby promotes viral clearance and the early production of proinflammatory cytokines<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. Though the mechanism of action is yet to be investigated, we hypothesize that this elevated production of IFNα in the Algel-IMDG based Adjuvanted vaccine may provide better protection in the Hamster and NHP homologous challenge study with SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>
<p id="P25">A combination of high neutralizing antibody titers elicited against inactivated antigen alone and the presence intact spike protein on the surface of the virus confirms that the antigen is in the right confirmation and can itself may act as a Th1 inducer with its surface glycoproteins, intracellular viral proteins.</p>
<p id="P26">A major limitation of this paper is the lack of protective efficacy results conferred from BBV 152. Additional live challenge studies in hamsters and non-human primates are completed at NIV, India, and results will be published shortly. With no established correlate of protection, we also evaluated human convalescent sera from recovered symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients.Samples were collected 21 days after virological confirmation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, two other SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccines (BBIBP-CorV and PiCoVacc) from China have entered late-stage human clinical trials with published data on the preclinical immune response.

<title>Mutagenicity Assay (Bacterial Reverse Mutation)</title>
<p id="P51">The mutagenic potential of the Adjuvant, Algel-IMDG, was evaluated by Bacterial Reverse Mutation assay through plate incorporation and pre-incubation methods using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 1535, TA 1537, TA 98, TA 100, and TA 102 following OECD Guidelines for Testing of Chemical<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>

<title>Maximum Tolerated Dose Test or Single Dose Toxicity Study</title>
<p id="P52">Two animals (Swiss Albino mice and Wistar Rats) species were tested with Algel-IMDG with a single maximum dose (containing 200mg Algel and 20mg TLR7/8 agonist molecule). Animals (Swiss Albino mice and Wistar Rats) were administered via an intramuscular route with Algel-IMDG on day 0 and observed for clinical signs, mortality, and changes in body weight if any up to 14 days. The site of injection was also observed for erythema and edema at 24, 48, and 72 hours after dosing to detect the local tolerance (local reactogenicity) of Algel-IMDG. All animals were necropsied and examined macroscopically. Histopathology was performed for the site of injection.</p>

<sec id="S37">
<label>18</label>
<title>Repeated dose toxicity</title>
<p id="P53">Studies were performed following both national and international guidelines in compliance with OECD principles of GLP<sup>

</sup>. Three animal models (Mice, Rats &amp; Rabbits) were administered via an intramuscular or intraperitoneal with three doses (N+1) of antigen or adjuvanted vaccine at different concentrations. All animals were observed for mortality during the experimental period. Blood collected on day 2 and 21 from the main groups and day 28 from the recovery group were analyzed for detailed clinical pathology investigations. Animals were euthanized either on day 21 (main groups) or on day 28 (recovery groups) and necropsied, and organs were evaluated for macroscopic and microscopic findings.</p>
<sec id="S38">
<title>Test system</title>
<p id="P54">The test system <italic>viz</italic>., Swiss albino mice (SA), BALB/c mice, Wistar rats, and New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits (<italic>in vivo</italic> models) were sourced from CPCSEA approved vendor and strains of <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (Moltox, Switzerland) for <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, and these test systems were selected as per the recommendations of WHO guidelines<sup>

</sup> and Schedule Y (2019)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. The studies were conducted in an equal number of adult males and females except in the BALB/c mice study, where only females were used. The control group was administered with PBS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S39">
<title>Treatment regimen</title>
<p id="P55">The adjuvanted vaccines or adjuvants alone were administered intramuscularly (IM) in quadriceps muscles of the hindlimb on days 0, 7, and 14 (n+1) with full Human single dose (HSD) to NZW rabbits and SA mice and higher dose than HSD to Wistar rats and full HSD to. In BALB/c Mice, 1/20<sup>th</sup> HSD was administered intraperitoneally. The animals were observed up to 14 days, post last dose.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S40">
<title>Experimental Design - Adjuvant alone</title>
<p id="P56">Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) studies were conducted using Wistar rats and Swiss Albino mice with ten animals in each study. The animals were treated with a single dose of Algel-IMDG at the dose of 200 μg /animal and observed for 14 days. Two repeated dose toxicity studies with Algel and Algel-IMDG in Wistar rats and Swiss Albino mice were performed. Control and reversal groups were maintained. The site of injection was observed for erythema and edema at 24, 48, and 72 hours after dosing to detect the local tolerance (local reactogenicity) of Algel-IMDG. All animals were necropsied and examined macroscopically. Histopathology was performed for the site of injection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S41">
<title>Experimental Design - Adjuvanted Vaccines</title>
<p id="P57">Four repeated dose toxicity studies were performed with Adjuvanted vaccines in Wistar Rats, New Zealand White Rabbits, BALB/c Mice, and Swiss Albino Mice.</p>
<p id="P58">Algel alone, Antigen alone, Adjuvanted Vaccine with Algel, and adjuvanted vaccine with Algel-IMDG along with control and recovery groups were assigned. We have tested adjuvants in the highest concentration of 300ug and antigen at the concentration of 9ug, to evaluate safety.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S42">
<title>In-life Observations</title>
<p id="P59">All animals were observed twice daily for mortality. Clinical signs were recorded twice a day from day 0 to 2 and once daily thereafter. The cage side observations included changes in the skin, fur, eyes, and mucous membranes and clinical signs observed for edema, erythema, alopecia, irritation, necrosis, locomotor activity, lacrimation, hyperthermia, and hypothermia, etc. The body weight of each animal was recorded once daily after the first dose for a week and weekly once thereafter. Mean body weights and mean body weight gain was calculated for the corresponding intervals. The amount of feed consumed by each cage of animals was recorded once daily after the first dose for a week and weekly once thereafter. Body temperature was recorded for rats and rabbits on day 0, 3 hours, and 24 hours after each dose, and on the day of sacrifice</p>

<title>Clinical Pathology Investigations</title>
<p id="P60">Detailed clinical pathology was performed using automated equipment as per referred guidelines following validated procedures<sup>145,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>

<sec id="S44">
<title>Necropsy, Organ Weight and Histopathology</title>
<p id="P61">Animals were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation and necropsied. Organs, as per WHO guidelines, which included spleen, thymus, and draining lymph nodes (inguinal for IM), were collected from all terminally sacrificed animals, and macroscopic abnormalities were recorded. Wet weights for organs such as brain, thymus, spleen, ovaries, uterus, heart, kidneys, testes, liver, adrenals, lungs, epididymides, and prostate with seminal vesicles and coagulating glands were recorded.</p>

<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p id="P62">Statistical Analysis was performed in R 4.0.1. We used two-sided one sample t-test with 5% level of significance for continuous variables which followed a normal distribution. To test the significance of the sample, mean and for the variables that do not satisfy the normality assumption, we used the Mann-Whitney test with 5% level of significance to test the significance of median.</p>
