<abstract>
<p id="P2">The search for vaccines that protect from severe morbidity and mortality as a result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a race against the clock and the virus. Several vaccine candidates are currently being tested in the clinic. Inactivated virus and recombinant protein vaccines can be safe options but may require adjuvants to induce robust immune responses efficiently. In this work we describe the use of a novel amphiphilic imidazoquinoline (IMDQ-PEG-CHOL) TLR7/8 adjuvant, consisting of an imidazoquinoline conjugated to the chain end of a cholesterol-poly(ethylene glycol) macromolecular amphiphile). This amphiphile is water soluble and exhibits massive translocation to lymph nodes upon local administration, likely through binding to albumin. IMDQ-PEG-CHOL is used to induce a protective immune response against SARS-CoV-2 after single vaccination with trimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the BALB/c mouse model. Inclusion of amphiphilic IMDQ-PEG-CHOL in the SARS-CoV-2 spike vaccine formulation resulted in enhanced immune cell recruitment and activation in the draining lymph node. IMDQ-PEG-CHOL has a better safety profile compared to native soluble IMDQ as the former induces a more localized immune response upon local injection, preventing systemic inflammation. Moreover, IMDQ-PEG-CHOL adjuvanted vaccine induced enhanced ELISA and <italic>in vitro</italic> microneutralization titers, and a more balanced IgG2a/IgG1 response. To correlate vaccine responses with control of virus replication <italic>in vivo</italic>, vaccinated mice were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 virus after being sensitized by intranasal adenovirus-mediated expression of the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene. Animals vaccinated with trimeric recombinant spike protein vaccine without adjuvant had lung virus titers comparable to non-vaccinated control mice, whereas animals vaccinated with IMDQ-PEG-CHOL-adjuvanted vaccine controlled viral replication and infectious viruses could not be recovered from their lungs at day 4 post infection. In order to test whether IMDQ-PEG-CHOL could also be used to adjuvant vaccines currently licensed for use in humans, proof of concept was also provided by using the same IMDQ-PEG-CHOL to adjuvant human quadrivalent inactivated influenza virus split vaccine, which resulted in enhanced hemagglutination inhibition titers and a more balanced IgG2a/IgG1 antibody response. Enhanced influenza vaccine responses correlated with better virus control when mice were given a lethal influenza virus challenge. Our results underscore the potential use of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL as an adjuvant to achieve protection after single immunization with recombinant protein and inactivated vaccines against respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019, also known as COVID-19, is a beta-coronavirus which belongs to the family of <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> and is currently responsible for the third human coronavirus outbreak in the past 20 years, after SARS (now often referred to as SARS-CoV-1) in 2002/03 and MERS (Middle east respiratory syndrome) in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). This COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented morbidity, mortality and global economic instability. SARS-CoV-2 is highly pathogenic and is believed to spread mainly through respiratory droplets and aerosols. The current preventive measures include quarantine, isolation and physical social distancing. Thus far, therapeutic drugs are of limited use in the clinic, and no specific vaccine is available yet, therefore calling for an urgent need for development of effective vaccines to restrict disease as well as viral spread.</p>
<p id="P4">More than hundred candidate vaccines, consisting of multiple vaccine types such as recombinant viral epitopes (surface glycoprotein), adenovirus-based vectors (e.g. recombinant replication incompetent HAdV-C5), purified inactivated or live-attenuated virus, virus like particles (VLPs) and DNA or RNA based vaccine formulations, are currently being investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). At present mRNA-based vaccines formulated in lipid nanoparticles, recombinant protein-based and inactivated virus-based vaccines as well as viral vector-based vaccines have reached late stage of clinical development, entering phase 3 testing. For these vaccines, pre-clinical data in animal models has also been generated supporting the hypothesis that these vaccines can effectively prevent viral infection. However, little is known about whether recombinant protein vaccines are capable of conferring protective immunity. In contrast to the aforementioned mRNA and viral vector-based vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines are simpler as they consist of a single entity antigen and – in contrast to viral vectors – do not require antigen expression in the vaccinees. Compared to mRNA vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines do not require complex (lipid) nanoparticle formulations to overcome the formidable barrier of the endosomal membrane before reaching the cytoplasm which is the subcellular target compartment for the antigen-expressing mRNA. Moreover, thus far no mRNA-based vaccine has been licensed, which might pose additional hurdles in view of mass manufacturing in world-wide immunization campaigns.</p>
<p id="P5">Hence, exploring the viability of a recombinant protein COVID-19 vaccine might be of considerable relevance. SARS-CoV-2 consists of over 30 kb single-stranded positive strand RNA genome which encodes four major structural proteins, spike (S), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and envelope (E). The spike protein comprises a homotrimeric structure which is present on the surface of the virus and facilitates the viral attachment and entry into the host cells. Like SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 S protein gains entry into host cells via human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2) receptors on the host cell surface via its receptor-binding domain (RBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Subsequently, membrane-associated serine proteases such as transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) or endosomal-associated proteases such as cathepsins cleave the S protein, thereby promoting efficient fusion of the viral membrane to the host cell membrane, followed by release of viral content into the cell cytoplasm, where the virus subsequently replicates. The viral infection usually begins in the oral/nasal cavity and once released, it gradually establishes itself in type-II pneumocytes of the lower respiratory air tract and enterocytes in the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">Due to its involvement in viral entry, the S protein is a major target for current vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Therefore, in this study we explored the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein as a potential vaccine candidate. As recombinant protein antigens are poorly immunogenic and are incapable of mounting antigen-specific immunity of sufficient quality, amplitude and duration, co-administration of adjuvants that shape B cell and T cell responses are indispensable. Adjuvants like alum and oil-in-water emulsions can act through a multitude of mechanisms. More defined small molecule adjuvants that potently activate innate immune cells by triggering specific innate immune receptors might be more relevant for anti-viral vaccine design. The Toll-like receptors 7 and 8 (TLR7/8) are widely distributed amongst innate immune cell subsets over a broad range of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Akin to be an endosomal pattern recognition receptor for viral RNA, triggering of these receptors provokes robust type I interferon production that can skew a Th1-type adaptive immune response against co-administered antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The latter are characterized by robust antibody titers capable of inducing viral neutralization through a variety of mechanisms, including Fc-mediated innate immune killing as well as inducing CD4- and CD8 T-cell based immunological memory. Moreover, vaccines adjuvanted with TLR7/8 ligands have been shown to confer enhanced protective immunity in both mouse and non-human primate models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">Being well-defined small molecules, imidazoquinolines are a class of TLR7/8 agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) that hold a massive technological advantage in terms of production and physicochemical stability. However, their pharmacokinetic profile is characterized by rapid systemic dissemination upon local (e.g. subcutaneous or intramuscular) administration, thereby causing unwanted innate immune activation at multiple distal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), which is currently a strong limitation for applying imidazoquinoline TLR7/8 agonists in mass immunization campaigns. We and others have reported on strategies to alter the bio-distribution of imidazoquinolines through chemical conjugation to a synthetic carrier that limits systemic circulation but confers robust translocation to immune-inducing sites in sentinel lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). In the present work, we report on a novel amphiphilic carrier for imidazoquinoline (IMDQ) TLR7/8 agonists with high translational potential, based on conjugation of a single imidazoquinoline to the chain end of a cholesteryl-polyethylene glycol macromolecular amphiphile (IMDQ-PEG-CHOL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). This design mediates binding to serum proteins such as albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) and in contrast to pure lipidation, the conjugate is well water-soluble. As a result, mobility in tissue is achieved without depot formation, with potential loss in adjuvant efficacy, hence avoiding the need for additional formulation.</p>
<p id="P8">Here we report that IMDQ-PEG-CHOL is a potent adjuvant candidate which can enhance vaccine efficiency and induce robust Th1 skewed antibody responses in mice when delivered as a single shot with either admixed S protein (for SARS-CoV-2) or seasonal quadrivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine (QIV, for influenza). Moreover, IMDQ-PEG-CHOL was able to infer protection in SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus (H1N1)-infected infected mice. In this context, it is noteworthy to mention that a major limitation in COVID19-vaccine development is the lack of susceptible small animal models for pre-clinical assessment and evaluation of its efficacy. Reportedly, in contrast to human ACE-2, murine ACE-2 is not targeted by wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus because of species-specific variations in ACE-2 receptors between mouse and human. Here we made use of a mouse model where hACE-2 was introduced through an adenoviral vector (Ad5-hACE2), which allows for subsequent replication of SARS-CoV-2 upon infection in the airways of transduced mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p>

<title>IMDQ-PEG-CHOL induces potent innate immune activation in lymph nodes</title>
<p id="P9">The imidazoquinoline 1-(4-(aminomethyl)benzyl)-2-butyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine (IMDQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) was conjugated to cholesteryl-poly(ethylene glycol) (CHOL-PEG), yielding IMDQ-PEG-CHOL. As a control, non-amphiphilic IMDQ-PEG was synthesized. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) PEG with a molecular weight of 3 kDa was chosen as an optimal compromise between water solubility and drug load. Characterization of the conjugate was performed by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization – time of flight (MALDI-ToF) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>) analysis whereas high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>) proved absence of free soluble non-conjugated IMDQ. Both IMDQ-PEG-CHOL and IMDQ-PEG were water-soluble, but only IMDQ-PEG-CHOL showed affinity towards albumin as measured by biolayer interferometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). On the <italic>in vitro</italic> level, the presence of the CHOL motif dramatically improved cellular uptake by DC2.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-C</xref>; note that for imaging purpose, IMDQ was replaced by the fluorescent probe Cynanine5), a murine model mouse dendritic cell line, and was more potent in inducing NF-κB activation in a reporter cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), while being non-toxic within the tested experimental window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). We attribute this to the ability of the cholesterol motif to interact with the phospholipid cell membrane.</p>
<p id="P10">On the <italic>in vivo</italic> level, using a transgenic luciferase-reporter mouse model for IFN β-production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), we found that local administration (i.e. subcutaneous injection into the footpad) of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL, in contrast to unformulated IMDQ, dramatically reduced systemic innate immune activation, while focusing its activity to the site of injection and the draining (popliteal) lymph node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). For quantification of the luminescence imaging data we refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>. Interestingly, the CHOL motif appeared crucial for mediating lymphatic translocation as the IMDQ-PEG control induced very limited activity in the draining lymph node. To further support this, we performed microscopic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B1</xref>) and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B2</xref>) analysis of popliteal lymph nodes of mice that received fluorescent Cyanine5-PEG-CHOL or Cyanine-PEG, respectively. These experiments revealed a dramatic increase in fluorescence when the conjugates contained the CHOL motif. A more detailed analysis of immune cells subsets in the draining lymph node revealed that vast percentages of lymphocytes, notably over 50% of dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (Mf), as well as 40% of B cells, were targeted by Cyanine5-PEG-CHOL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In a similar experimental setting, IMDQ-PEG-CHOL induced recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D1</xref>) and robust activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D2</xref>) of immune cells. Taken together, these data support our hypothesis that IMDQ-PEG-CHOL is a potent adjuvant that focuses its activity to draining lymphoid tissue, combined with a promising safety profile.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>IMDQ-PEG-CHOL induces a balanced neutralizing antibody response to influenza virus vaccine</title>
<p id="P11">We evaluated the potential of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL to adjuvant a licensed vaccine, i.e. the quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV), in a well-established preclinical vaccination-infection model. Hereto we vaccinated BALB/c mice with each of 1.5 μg of QIV with or without 100 μg of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL or PEG-CHOL as a control. The study protocol is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>. Six mice in each group received a total of 100 μl vaccine-adjuvant mixture, intramuscularly, divided over both hind legs and the blood was collected 3 weeks post vaccination, followed by serological assays. For detection of influenza-specific antibodies induced by the QIV vaccines, we used vaccine antigen to coat enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. The total IgG antibody titers in mice which received QIV only or QIV+ PEG-CHOL were very low as compared to the mice vaccinated with QIV+ IMDQ-PEG-CHOL (also shown as area under curve (AUC) in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Unadjuvanted QIV and PEG-CHOL admixed QIV resulted mainly in vaccine-specific IgG1 antibodies, whereas IMDQ-PEG-CHOL resulted in a balanced IgG1/IgG2a response as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>. Interestingly, QIV + PEG-CHOL resulted in even lower antibody responses than QIV alone, an observation we confirmed in an independent vaccination experiment (data not shown). Four out of six mice that received QIV + IMDQ-PEG-CHOL could efficiently inhibit hemagglutination of chicken red blood cells (RBC) <italic>in vitro</italic>, by A/Singapore/gp1908/2015 IVR-180, the H1N1 virus component in QIV, with hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers outperforming those of the other immunized groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">Next, the immunized mice were challenged with a hundred-fold half-lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) of IVR-180 (H1N1) virus to examine the magnitude of protection against viral infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. The lungs were harvested from three mice in each group 5 days post challenge to determine lung virus titers. Consistent with the ELISA and HI data, mice immunized with QIV + IMDQ-PEG-CHOL exhibited best reduction in viral lung titers as evidenced by an almost negligible number of plaques when compared to other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). This was also reflected in the optimal protection from body weight loss of QIV + IMDQ-PEG-CHOL mice after viral challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). In conclusion, our novel adjuvant IMDQ-PEG-CHOL was able to offer excellent control of viral infection and therefore, in combination with the right antigen, might also hold promise to confer protective immunity against other respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>IMDQ-PEG-CHOL induces a balanced neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 immunization</title>
<p id="P13">We next investigated the potential of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL to adjuvant recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein. For this purpose, BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with 6 μg of recombinant trimeric spike protein either unadjuvanted or adjuvanted with IMDQ-PEG-CHOL or with equivalent amounts of MF59-like water-in-oil vaccine AddaVax as a control established vaccine adjuvant. The recombinant vaccine consisted of the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from which the polybasic cleavage site was removed. Stabilizing prolines were added at positions 986 and 987 and trimerization was promoted by fusion to a T4 trimerization domain (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">methods</xref> section for more details). The study protocol is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>. Serum was collected after 21 days post immunization and analyzed for Spike protein specific IgG titers. Whereas non-immunized mice evidently did not show any detectable Spike protein-specific titers in their sera, immunization with S protein induced Spike protein-specific titers in all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), also shown as area under the curve (AUC) titers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 54</xref>. The total S protein-specific IgG titers were found to be the highest in the IMDQ-PEG-CHOL adjuvanted group. Additionally, Spike protein + IMDQ-PEG-CHOL immunization resulted in a higher IgG2a/IgG1 ratio, suggesting a more potent Th1 immune response and more efficient class switching towards IgG2a as compared to spike protein only or spike protein + AddaVax immunization.</p>
<p id="P14">Next, the sera from vaccinated mice were used to test the ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection <italic>in vitro</italic>. Although immunization with non-adjuvanted S protein was able to induce some IgG titers, it was found ineffective in neutralizing viral infection of Vero E6 cells <italic>in vitro</italic> in a microneutralization assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C1-2</xref>). By contrast, serum of mice immunized with spike protein + IMDQ-PEG-CHOL was able to neutralize &gt;50% of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in this assay, which was also significantly higher than the serum of mice immunized with spike protein + AddaVax.</p>

<title>IMDQ-PEG-CHOL induces protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in a mouse model</title>
<p id="P15">Finally, we investigated to what extent S protein + IMDQ-PEG-CHOL immunization is able to confer protection against a SARS-CoV-2 viral challenge. As mice do not express the hACE-2 receptor that is needed for the virus to infect the host, we first transduced immunized mice with an adenoviral vector encoding for hACE-2 by intranasal installation. Four days later, mice we challenged with SARS-CoV-2 virus and again 4 days later, lungs were harvested, and the residual viral infection was quantified by a plaque assay. Interestingly, whereas non-adjuvanted Spike protein could not confer any protection, relative to the non-immunized group, Spike protein + IMDQ-PEG-CHOL vaccination conferred sterilizing immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 infection with plaque numbers below the detection limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>), and performed significantly better than spike protein + AddaVax immunization, which correlates with the higher microneutralization titers observed in the Spike protein + IMDQ-PEG-CHOL group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C1-2</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="P16">In summary, we have shown in this work that IMDQ-PEG-CHOL is a potent adjuvant with enhanced safety profile that induced innate immune activation in lymphoid tissue upon local administration. Whereas IMDQ in soluble, unformulated form, rapidly enters systemic circulation, conjugation to a lipid-polymer amphiphile prevents the latter while promoting translocation to the draining lymph node, likely through binding to albumin in the interstitial flow. In mouse vaccination/challenge models for influenza and SARS-CoV-2, we have demonstrated that a single immunization with QIV or S protein adjuvanted with IMDQ-PEG-CHOL induced robust Th1 skewed antibody responses, as evidenced by higher IgG2a/IgG1 ratios. Importantly, vaccination with QIV and S protein adjuvanted with IMDQ-PEG-CHOL resulted in virus-specific neutralizing antibodies and control of viral infection after challenge with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses, respectively. Since IgG2a subclass is known to engage Fcγ receptors that are involved in antiviral protection mechanisms like antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis, IMDQ-PEG-CHOL might be beneficial to promote such responses. Whereas we are aware of the limitations of the present studies, we do believe that the overarching message that single vaccination with a properly adjuvanted recombinant S protein based vaccine is able to induce protective immunity in a mouse model, is of great relevance with regard to broadening the arsenal of emerging COVID-19 vaccines. Safe adjuvants like IMDQ-PEG-CHOL described in our study may help enhance vaccine efficiency if deemed necessary from ongoing clinical trials, similar to the recent development of MF59-adjuvanted influenza virus vaccines for the elderly. Use of efficient adjuvants may also reduce the amount of vaccine needed to induce a protective immune response, which is important in case there is vaccine shortage, as is the case during this COVID19 pandemic.</p>

<underline>Quadrivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine (QIV)</underline>
</italic> was the human Seqirus vaccine (2018-2019 formula) containing the antigens of the following influenza virus strains: A/Singapore/GP1908/2015 IVR-180 (H1N1), A/North Carolina/04/2016 (H3N2), B/Iowa/06/2017 and B/Singapore/INFTT-16-0610/2016. Vaccine was obtained from BEI resources and mixed with adjuvant as described below. Vaccine was injected once via the intramuscular route with a BD 300 μL insulin syringe in the hamstring muscles of the both hind legs (50 μL/leg). The administered vaccine dose corresponds to 1.5 μg of each hemagglutinin type in the vaccine per mouse.</p>
<p id="P21">Blood was collected twenty days post vaccination via submandibular bleeding and serum was prepared by allowing the blood to clot at room temperature. Anti-HA antibody responses were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. For quantification of HA-specific total IgG levels by ELISA, 96 well NUNC Maxisorp plates were coated with QIV (2 μg/ml HA equivalent for each HA) in bicarbonate buffer at 4 °C overnight. After washing and blocking with 4% milk for 1 h at room temperature, serum samples 3-fold diluted starting at 1/100 in PBS with 0.05% Tween20 were allowed to bind ELISA antigen for 1.5 h at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with PBS (0.05% Tween20) and incubated with sheep-derived anti-mouse total IgG (GE Healthcare, Amersham, UK), IgG1 or IgG2a (Invitrogen) serum conjugated to horse-radish peroxidase. After a final washing step, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to estimate levels of HA-specific mouse IgG by measuring the OD<sub>450</sub> with the OD<sub>650</sub> as a reference after stopping the colorimetric reaction with 1M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p id="P22">Hemagglutination inhibition was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Briefly, four volumes of receptor destroying enzyme (RDE, Vibrio cholera filtrate, Sigma Aldrich, San Diego, CA, USA) were added to each volume of mouse serum. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, sera were heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min in sodium citrate buffer. Four hemagglutination units of IVR-180 H1N1 virus were mixed with twofold dilutions of treated sera in a final volume of 50 μL. Mixtures of virus and diluted serum were allowed to bind for 1h at room temperature before 50 μL of 0.5% chicken red blood cell suspension was added. HI titers were read after 1h incubation on ice.</p>

These sections where fixed for 4 min in PFA 2% (v/v), and washed with PBS. Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope equipped with 488-nm, 561-nm and 633-nm lasers and with a tunable two-photon laser. Confocal imaging was done using a Leica DMI6000B microscope (10x 0.70 NA objective) coupled to an AndorDSD2 confocal scanner and a Zyla5.5 CMOS camera. Image processing was done using the ImageJ software package.</p>

<p id="P46">Luciferase reporter mice (IFNβ+/Δβ-luc) with a Balb/c background, aged 7-9 weeks, were housed in individual ventilated cages and given ad libitum access to food and water. 20 mL of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL, IMDQ-PEG or IMDQwere injected subcutaneously in the footpad (n=3) at an equivalent IMDQ dose of 2 mg. For in vivo imaging at the given time points, mice were injected subcutaneously with 200 μL D-luciferin and in vivo luminescence imaging was recorded 12 min later using the IVIS Lumina II imaging system. Local (DLN and DLN + foot pad) luminescence and full-body luminescence were quantified using the Living Image 4.4 software.</p>

<title>Analysis of <italic>in vivo</italic> lymphocyte targeting and activation</title>
<p id="P47">20 μL (containing an equivalent IMDQ dose of 2mg) of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL or Cyanine5-PEG-CHOL was injected into the footpad of female C57BL/6 WT mice. At the designated time point, mice where sacrificed and popliteal lymph nodes where isolated. A single cell suspension was prepared from the dissected popliteal lymph nodes for analysis by flow cytometery. Isolated lymph nodes were collected in ice cold PBS, smashed through 70 μm cell strainers, washed with PBS and stained for 30min at 4°C with following primary labeled antibodies: CD3, CD20, CD11c, MHCII, CD86, CD40. Live dead ratio’s where determined by staining with fixable dead/live-staining and 123count ebeads were added to determine cellularity prior to acquiring them on 123count ebeads were added to determine cellularity prior to Analysis by a BD FACS Quanto flow cytometer. Data were processed using the FlowJo software package.</p>
