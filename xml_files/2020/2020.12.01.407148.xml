<abstract>
<p id="P1">Sexual dimorphisms in immune responses contribute to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes, yet the mechanisms governing this disparity remain incompletely understood. We carried out sex-balanced sampling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from confirmed COVID-19 inpatients and outpatients, uninfected close contacts, and healthy controls for 36-color flow cytometry and single cell RNA-sequencing. Our results revealed a pronounced reduction of circulating mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in infected females. Integration of published COVID-19 airway tissue datasets implicate that this reduction represented a major wave of MAIT cell extravasation during early infection in females. Moreover, female MAIT cells possessed an immunologically active gene signature, whereas male counterparts were pro-apoptotic. Collectively, our findings uncover a female-specific protective MAIT profile, potentially shedding light on reduced COVID-19 susceptibility in females.</p>

<p id="P2">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and a death toll of more than over 1.4 million people and rising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Among reported sex disaggregated data, males are disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2, with a higher incidence of cases, mortality, and morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). This follows a similar trend toward higher case fatality rates for males in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as well as with experiments using SARS-CoV mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Sex differences in the immune response are thought to be a key contributing factor to these coronavirus disease outcomes, agreeing with the current body of knowledge that innate and adaptive immune responses are substantially altered across sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection, responses of both lymphocytes and myeloid cells were shown to be associated with COVID-19 outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Correspondingly, a recent study on sex differences in COVID-19 immune responses uncovered an association between poor disease outcomes in males and weak T cell responses in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> compartments, whereas poor outcomes in females were associated with high innate immune cytokines, tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF)-10 and interleukin (IL)-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). The sex differences elucidated in this seminal study further cement the need to better understand the mechanisms governing sex-specific susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="P3">In the current study, we carried out sex-balanced sampling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients and control subjects for 36-color flow cytometry and single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses. A total of 88 samples were analyzed from 45 individuals. Details on subject demographics and sample information are summarized in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>). Briefly, we analyzed samples from 28 patients with COVID-19 as confirmed by a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and/or IgG seroconversion. These included 9 inpatient subjects (20%), 7 requiring intensive care, henceforth referred to as “hospitalized.” An additional 19 subjects were identified in outpatient settings (42.2%), henceforth referred to as “infected”. Most of these COVID-19 confirmed cases were sampled longitudinally (a range 1-28 days) including pre- and post-anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobin (IgG) seroconversion. The dates of symptom onset for all confirmed COVID-19 subjects were recorded at enrollment, providing an illness range of 1-40 days. We also recorded symptom severity, obtained via investigator survey on 39 symptoms related to COVID-19 (see Methods). Additionally, we included 7 subjects (15.6%) henceforth referred to as “exposed,” who were also sampled at multiple timepoints. These subjects, despite being close contacts of infected individuals, remained with negligible symptom scores, were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, and did not demonstrate detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG for at least 2 months after enrollment. Lastly, we included a group of 10 “healthy” subjects (22.2%) who were enrolled prior to the pandemic in 2019 and did not show any symptoms associated with COVID-19 or other respiratory illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p>

<title>Immune Profiling of COVID-19 Patient PBMCs Reveals Sex Differences in CD8+ Lymphocytes</title>
<p id="P4">With these flow cytometry data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>), we generated a map of immune cell populations and their subsets by down-sampling to 3,000 viable CD45<sup>+</sup> singlets per sample and concatenated all data for Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) and unbiased clustering via Flow Self-Organizing Maps (FlowSOM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Unique marker expressions of respective populations facilitated our annotation of major PBMC populations, including CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> (αβ) T cells, γδ T cells, B cells, plasmablasts, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes (MO), and dendritic cells (DC), and confirmed by manual analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1, A to E</xref>). Sub-populations were also annotated in this manner, such as CD45RA<sup>+</sup> CD27<sup>+</sup> CCR7<sup>+</sup> naive, CD45RA<sup>–</sup> CCR7<sup>+</sup> central memory (CM), CD45RA<sup>–</sup> CCR7<sup>–</sup> effector memory (EM) and CD45RA<sup>+</sup> CD27<sup>-</sup> CCR7<sup>–</sup> terminally differentiated effector memory (EMRA) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, as well as CD8<sup>+</sup> CD161<sup>hi</sup> T cells and other indicated sub-populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1, A to E</xref>). We noted that a minor population of basophils (Baso) and neutrophils (PMN) primarily from hospitalized patients were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), despite using a PBMC isolation protocol.</p>
<p id="P5">We next set out to examine our flow cytometry dataset for immune populations that exhibited major quantitative changes in COVID-19. Our first strategy was to stratify the data by disease severity (i.e., healthy, exposed, infected, and hospitalized). We noted that samples from hospitalized patients had substantially fewer PBMCs suggestive of lymphopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Manual gating of all flow cytometry events was performed for this analysis. Our results showed differences in B cells (naïve, IgD<sup>+</sup> non-class switch, and plasmablasts); natural killer (NK) cells (CD56<sup>lo</sup> populations); DCs (CD141<sup>+</sup>, CD1c<sup>+</sup>, and pDCs); monocytes (classical, intermediate and nonclassical); CD4<sup>+</sup> (EM) and CD8<sup>+</sup> (EM) αβ T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Interestingly, our data also revealed a high statistical significance (<italic>p</italic>=0.0006) in CD8<sup>+</sup> CD161<sup>hi</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>) prompting us to look closer at these cells. Regarding annotation of this CD161<sup>hi</sup> cluster, because the overwhelming majority of events are low to negative for CD56 and for T-cell receptor (TCR)-γδ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), the phenotype is largely consistent with mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, but not NKT or γδ T cells. This designation is congruent with recent work in COVID-19 PBMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). We therefore conclude that the frequencies of certain myeloid and lymphocyte populations are affected in COVID-19, including a major effect on CD8<sup>+</sup> CD161<sup>hi</sup> T cells.</p>
<p id="P6">Knowing that the overwhelming majority of the CD8<sup>+</sup> CD161<sup>hi</sup> population (henceforth referred to as CD161<sup>hi</sup>) in our and others' datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) is likely comprised of MAIT cells, we performed a more focused analysis of this cluster in COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). First, we analyzed their frequencies by disease severity using the samples taken within 3 days of enrollment, the timepoint most proximal to the initial symptom score recordings. Results were displayed via UMAP contour plots, revealing a reduction in these cells in the SARS-CoV-2 settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Manual gating from all flow cytometry events revealed a significant reduction when comparing healthy (p=0.0036) or exposed (p=0.0488) subjects versus hospitalized subjects, as well as a negative correlation (p=0.0002) with disease severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>). We also characterized the frequencies of CD161<sup>hi</sup> cells stratified by time post symptom onset, including early (≤ 14 days), middle (15 to 21 days), and late (&gt;21 days) timepoints. In addition, we separated the data by sex given the known sex differences in immune responses in COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Results showed that within the CD8<sup>+</sup> compartment of healthy subjects, females had greater frequencies of CD161<sup>hi</sup> cells relative to males, whereas males had greater frequencies of CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells (combined EMRA, EM and CM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F, and G</xref>). No obvious changes of naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T were found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>). While the memory cell predominance in males was preserved at all timepoints, the greater abundance of CD161<sup>hi</sup> cells in females was lost at early and middle timepoints (albeit not in late disease). The loss of this difference was due to a precipitous drop of CD161<sup>hi</sup> cells in females at early and middle timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). Lastly, we stratified data from confirmed COVID-19 patients by seroconversion status. This showed CD161<sup>hi</sup> cells were higher in females relative to males prior to seroconversion, whereas CD8<sup>+</sup> memory cells were higher in males in seroconverted subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>). Taken together, we identified a female-specific decline in circulating CD161<sup>hi</sup> cell frequencies upon exposure/infection of SARS-CoV-2. This sex-specific reduction may be due to extravasation into airway tissues, thereby suggesting a key sex-specific role for these CD161<sup>hi</sup> cells in COVID-19.</p>

<title>scRNA-seq of PBMCs Implicates Involvement of CD161<sup>hi</sup> Lymphocyte Responses in COVID-19</title>
<p id="P7">Given the potentially important role for CD161<sup>hi</sup> cells in COVID-19, we sought to further characterize this population by scRNA-seq (10x Genomics). We analyzed 48 different PBMC samples from 24 subjects across all groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S1</xref>). Data were processed using Seurat 3 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) and subsequent transcript-based annotation was carried out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S4, A and B</xref>). Focusing on the T cells in the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S3</xref>), we were able to identify CD161<sup>hi</sup> cells in a single cluster containing high <italic>KLRB1</italic> (i.e., CD161) expression, and co-expression of <italic>CD3D</italic> and <italic>CD8A</italic>, as well as <italic>TRAV1-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S4B</xref>), which encodes the Vα7.2 invariant TCR alpha chain on MAIT cells. Grouping these data by disease severity showed that hospitalized patients had lower frequencies of T cells, including CD161<sup>hi</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), agreeing with our flow cytometry findings and consistant with reported lymphopenia in severe COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Also showing the same trend as our flow cytometry data was the high frequency of CD161<sup>hi</sup> cells in healthy females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>), although it did not reach statistical significance due to the variations between healthy females and males. Next, to address the functional role of this CD161<sup>hi</sup> cluster in COVID-19, we performed gene enrichment analysis using differentially expressed genes (DEGs). With several top ranked hits consisting of immune pathways and an estrogen-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>), our results inferred a sex-specific immune response of these CD161<sup>hi</sup> cells in COVID-19. To further characterize functional inferences, we applied the CellphoneDB package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) and analyzed ligand-receptor interactions with monocyte clusters within our data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5, A and B</xref>), given the critical link that was previously published between monocyte activation in COVID-19 outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Our results inferred unique interactions between CD161<sup>hi</sup> cells and monocytes with the following gene-pairs: <italic>KLRB1_CLEC2D</italic>, <italic>CCL5_CCR1</italic>, <italic>CXCR6_CXCL16</italic>, and <italic>IL18_IL-18R</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5, C and D</xref>). Moreover, the number of interaction-counts of monocytes was the most abundant with the CD161<sup>hi</sup> cluster relative to all major T cell populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5E</xref>). Taken together, these transcriptome findings further support a significant role for circulating CD161<sup>hi</sup> cells in the SARS-CoV-2 immune response.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Sex-Specific Differences of Circulating MAIT cells in COVID-19</title>
<p id="P8">To analyze our scRNA-seq dataset for potential sex differences in circulating CD161<sup>hi</sup> cells, we first sought to examine for phenotypic heterogeneity within this population. To do this, we performed a focused sub-cluster analysis, which generated 3 distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). However, the added resolution revealed a cluster that expressed <italic>TRDC</italic>, encoding the constant region of the δ chain expressed by γδ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>) and thereby excluded from subsequent analyses. By contrast, the other two clusters had higher <italic>KLRB1</italic> expression, as well as <italic>TRAV1-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), therefore referred to here as MAITα and MAITβ clusters. Of note, these 2 clusters make up approximately 80% of CD161<sup>hi</sup> PBMCs, which is consistent with the previous report of circulating MAIT cell frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Our results showed that the MAITα cluster possessed upregulated genes associated with cytotoxic T cells (<italic>GNLY, CD8A, CD8B</italic>), migration/adhesion (<italic>CXCR4, ITGB2</italic>), and cytokine signaling (<italic>IRF1</italic>, <italic>B2M</italic>, <italic>NFKBIA</italic>, <italic>JUNB, FOS</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S4</xref>). The MAITβ cluster was enriched for genes of ribosomal proteins, apoptosis (<italic>BAX</italic>, <italic>STUB1</italic>) and the linker histone H1 associated with apoptosis (<italic>HIST1H1C, HIST1H1D, HIST1H1E</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S4</xref>). Gene enrichment analysis further supported a functional dichotomy for α and β clusters. Whereas MAITα was enriched with several immune process pathways (e.g., IFN-γ, and IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, as well as antigen processing and presenting), MAITβ was enriched in cellular responses to external stimuli, metabolism of RNA, viral infection, and programmed cell death, but not immune processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, D and E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S5</xref>). Hence our results suggest MAIT cell heterogeneity, with the MAITα signature representing an immunologically poised/active phenotype, while the MAITβ signature represents a stressed/apoptotic phenotype.</p>
<p id="P9">Last for this series of experiments, we sought to determine the dynamics of the two phenotypically distinct clusters by sex over the COVID-19 disease course. By first grouping our data by severity, we found that MAITα was the major phenotype in healthy individuals, while MAITβ predominated in exposed and infected groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, F and G</xref>). There was a noted exception for hospitalized patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>), bearing very few cells as seen in our flow cytometry data, consistent with lymphopenia that occurs in severe COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). We then grouped our data by time post symptom onset, as we detailed earlier with our flow cytometry data. Results showed that relative to healthy subjects, MAITα percentages were lower in early, middle, and late timepoints, whereas MAITβ demonstrated the converse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>). When stratified by sex, we found that MAIT cell frequencies were higher in healthy females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, I and J</xref>), corroborating our flow cytometry results. These cells in healthy females were skewed toward the MAITα cluster, whereas the few cells present in healthy males consisted mostly of MAITβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>). However, this difference was lost in exposed/infected setting, where both sexes were comprised mostly of MAITβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J</xref>). Nonetheless, MAITβ percentages were statistically greater in females in late disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J</xref>), which reflects the increased MAIT cells during late infection in females as shown in our flow cytometry findings. Regarding expression of <italic>CD69</italic>, a T cell activation marker, we did not observe major differences across cluster or sex, but did observe elevated expression in the hospitalized group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6, A to D</xref>). This possibly suggests an altered MAIT cell response in hospitalized patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). In short, these results reveal sex specific MAIT cell differences at the quantitative and phenotypic levels in health and COVID-19.</p>

<title>Respiratory Tract MAIT Cell Responses Differ by Sex in COVID-19</title>
<p id="P10">To assess potential sex-specific differences in MAIT cells at the tissue level in COVID-19 patient airways, we utilized published scRNAseq datasets of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>) and of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Beginning our analysis with the BALF dataset, we identified the MAIT cell cluster by expression of <italic>TRAV1-2</italic>, <italic>CD3D</italic>, <italic>KLRB1</italic> and <italic>SLC4A10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, A to C</xref>). With this annotation, we found a significant increase (p=0.0188) of MAIT cells in COVID-19 patients relative to normal controls and a higher MAIT cell frequency (p=0.0332) in females relative to males among COVID-19 subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). This detection of increased MAIT cells in female BALF, along with the drop in these cells we observed in female peripheral blood, suggest a female dominant extravasation of MAITs in COVID-19.</p>
<p id="P11">To perform the same analysis with NPS samples, we integrated the T cell data from NPS with those from BALF to identify MAIT cells in NPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, E and F</xref>), since TCR genes were not aligned in the NPS dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). With this annotation, we quantified MAIT cell frequencies in the NPS dataset, again observing a significant increase (p=0.0139) in COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). We also analyzed the data across severity, observing a significant increase (p=0.0038) in moderate subjects relative to the normal and a decrease (p=0.0366) relative to critical COVID-19 subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 H, I</xref>). We could not perform the same analysis by sex due to insufficient number of female samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 I</xref>). Nonetheless, these results match the reduced circulating MAIT cell frequencies seen in our hospitalized subjects, together suggesting that a lymphopenic state which occurs in severe COVID-19 impacts MAIT cells, consistent with other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">In a final experiment, we sought to characterize MAIT cell transcriptomes by sex in the BALF and NPS datasets and determine whether these cells resembled α and β phenotypes we identified in circulating MAIT cells. Cluster analysis was not warranted here given low cell numbers in these datasets. Instead, we leveraged gene modules derived from our respective α and β clusters of circulating MAIT cells. We found that MAIT cells in BALF and NPS data were largely skewed toward the β module, with minimal sex differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A</xref>). However, when we directly examined differentially expressed genes (the DEGs between sex, we were able to detect sex differences associated with α and β phenotypes. Specifically, in BALF, we found increased <italic>IL7R</italic> expression in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4J</xref>) and other IL-7 signaling associated genes (<italic>CISH</italic> and <italic>SOCS1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4K</xref>). Given the critical role of this signaling in T cell survival, we explored additional pathway genes, finding that female MAIT cells had upregulated anti-apoptotic genes (<italic>BCL2</italic> and <italic>FOXP1</italic>) and downregulated pro-apoptotic genes (<italic>BAX</italic> and <italic>CASP3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7, B and C</xref>). Also observed in female cells was upregulated anti-proliferative genes (<italic>CDKN1B</italic> and <italic>BTG2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7D</xref>). These patterns matched MAITα gene changes in our PBMC dataset. We were able to find other sex differences, including increased expression of several transcription factors (<italic>KLF2</italic>, <italic>MYC</italic>, and <italic>CEBPD</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4L</xref>). Conversely, male cells had higher expression of <italic>CCL2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 M</xref>), which has been linked to COVID-19 immunopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). In short, our results infer sex differences at the qualitative level in COVID-19, with female MAIT cells possessing a pro-survival and immunologically active phenotype.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P13">Despite the knowledge of sex differences in the immune response as an underlying factor in COVID-19 disease outcomes, the sexual dimorphic responses of MAIT cells, an unconventional T cell population deemed important in this disease, remained unknown. We now demonstrate that MAIT cells in females are quantitatively and qualitatively more robust in the SARS-CoV-2 setting, potentially helping understand the immunological reasons for reduced COVID-19 susceptibility in females.</p>
<p id="P14">Our finding that MAIT recruitment to airway tissues may be more robust in COVID-19 females was aided first by our observation of higher circulating MAIT cell frequencies in females in the healthy setting. This difference can be explained by the rate of physiological aging-related attrition of MAIT cells that is substantially less pronounced in female blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). The resultant higher frequencies in circulation enabled us to readily uncover the precipitous percentage drop we saw with MAIT cells relative to exposed/infected females. In trying to elucidate the potential cause of this drop, we considered two possible scenarios: 1) lymphopenia and 2) extravasation, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For the former, it is accepted that lymphopenia is associated with severe COVID-19 infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), which which agrees with our observations in our hospitalized group (comprised of 77.8% intensive care patients). Similarly, lymphopenia could partially explain the reduction in MAIT cells described by Jouan <italic>et al</italic> in a study of male-dominated samples from critically ill COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), though extravasation also likely occurred. In our study, however, we demonstrated that circulating MAIT frequencies drop in our infected outpatient group. As these subjects were not critically ill, our findings point to extravasation as a major reason for the sex-specific drop in circulating MAIT frequencies. The same pattern may also exist in several other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). For example, while Parrot <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) also demonstrated that circulating MAIT cells are reduced in moderate COVID-19 patients relative to healthy subjects in aggregated data, it is possible that the healthy female frequencies contributed to reaching the statistical difference. Further supporting our conclusion, we were able to show with publicly available scRNA-seq data from COVID-19 BALF samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>) that females in that study had an increased MAIT cell percentage relative to males, allowing us to conclude that MAIT cell extravasation during COVID-19 may be quantitatively more robust in females.</p>
<p id="P15">Our results also suggest that MAIT cells may be qualitatively superior in females, with respect to anti-viral immune activity in COVID-19. Leading us to this conclusion, our scRNA-seq analysis of patient PBMCs revealed two distinct clusters of MAIT cells, referred to here as MAITα and MAITβ. The α cluster was enriched for various immune pathways, such as IFN-γ signaling, inferring a capacity for anti-viral immune function. In contrast, the β cluster was enriched for cell stress and apoptosis pathways, inferring a frail phenotype roughly similar to a previously described population of double negative MAIT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). We showed in the healthy setting that MAIT cells in females were skewed toward the α cluster, whereas males comprised the β cluster. Though from these results it could be presumed that the α cluster should be overrepresented in COVID-19 airways of females, this was not the case in the BALF. However, we reasoned that such a finding would be very difficult to make for two main reasons. First, extravasated MAIT cells with an α-phenotype would be restricted to the early wave of recruitment, since circulating cells are almost completely skewed to the β module in exposed/infected individuals. Second, a certain level of transcriptional reprogramming would occur upon immune cell extravasation into the tissue and potentially again upon accessing the alveolar space. Still, we were able to show in BALF that certain gene patterns remained consistent with the α signature in females versus males. In addition, our finding that female BALF samples had quantitatively more MAIT cells gives further credence that differences revealed in blood would likewise extend to the tissue.</p>
<p id="P16">In summary, we conclude that MAIT cells in females are quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from males and we surmise that this distinction provides a protective advantage in the SARS-CoV-2 setting. Indeed, females in general tend to have elevated frequencies of circulating MAIT cells, also gleaned by large independent studies with European (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), South Korean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) and Chinese populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Further supporting this argument, it has now been recorded that adult COVID-19 fatality rates trend less in females at all ages across 39 different countries, including in North America, Europe, and Asia where MAIT cell frequencies trend higher in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). These points also argue against the possibility that an immunologically more robust MAIT cell response has a net negative effect, for example, by immunological misfiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) or cytokine storm related immunopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). However, one open question that our findings now raise is whether males in our study, which had greater circulating CD8+ memory T cells, would instead have an advantage in the reinfection setting or following vaccination. Future studies are needed to explore this question, and to better understand sex differences in MAIT cells both in general and in COVID-19.</p>

<title>Participants in this study</title>
<p id="P18">In-patients (hospitalized) and out-patients (infected) with confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 were identified through the DUHS and enrolled into the Molecular and Epidemiological Study of Suspected Infection (MESSI, Pro00100241). The RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed at either the North Carolina State Laboratory of Public Health or at clinical laboratories of the DUHS. The exposed group, who closely contacted with COVID-19 patients, presented negative PCR test and negative serology test during longitudinally sampling from the first visit to at least 2 months after, typically 0, 7, 14, and 28 days relative to enrollment. Initial severity scores of individuals were recorded through a self-reporting survey on 38 defined symptoms related to COVID-19 plus “other” when enrolled. The exposed group (average score = 9.71) showed a lower severity scores compared with infected (out-patients) group (average score = 18.16). The hospitalized patients presented severe disease symptoms with breath difficulty, cough, fever or chest pain when enrolled, and 77.8% of them for this study required intensive care unit (ICU) care. All COVID-19 patients were also longitudinally sampled with serology test from enrollment to convalescent phase. Healthy donors were enrolled in 2019 (Duke IRB Protocol Pro00009459) with no diagnosis or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or other respiratory illness.

<title>Collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)</title>
<p id="P19">PBMC cells were prepared using Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient method. Briefly, peripheral whole blood was collected in EDTA vacutainer tubes and processed within 8 hours. Blood was diluted 1:2 in PBS then layered onto the Ficoll-Hypaque in 50 ml conical tube and centrifuged at 420g for 25 min. Buffy coat was collected and washed with D-PBS by centrifugation at 400g for 10min. Cell pellets were resuspended in D-PBS and washed again. PBMCs were assessed for viability and cell count using Vi-Cell automated cell counter (Beckman-Coulter). PBMCs were adjusted to 10x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in cryopreservation media (90% FBS, 10% DMSO) and aliquoted into cryopreservation vials on ice.

<title>Processing and quality control of scRNA-seq</title>
<p id="P25">Raw sequencing data were initially processed with 10x Genomics Cell Ranger pipelines (V3.1.0). Briefly, BCL files were demultiplexed to generate FASTQ files. FASTQ files were aligned with STAR aligner to the human genome reference GRCh38 from Ensemble database. Feature barcode processing and UMI counting were then performed according to the standard workflow. (QC summary after sequencing). The following criteria were applied as quality control of single cells from all individual samples. Cells that had fewer than 1000 UMI counts or 500 genes, as well as cell that had greater than 10% of mitochondrial genes were removed from further analysis. Genes that were expressed by fewer than 10 cells were also excluded. After filtering, a total of 424,080 cells with 18,765 gene features were kept for the downstream analysis.</p>
