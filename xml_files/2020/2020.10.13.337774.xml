<abstract>
<p id="P1">An unexpected observation among the COVID-19 pandemic is that smokers constituted only 1.4-18.5% of hospitalized adults, calling for an urgent investigation to determine the role of smoking in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we show that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) increase <italic>ACE2</italic> mRNA but trigger ACE2 protein catabolism. BaP induces an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent upregulation of the ubiquitin E3 ligase Skp2 for ACE2 ubiquitination. ACE2 in lung tissues of non-smokers is higher than in smokers, consistent with the findings that tobacco carcinogens downregulate ACE2 in mice. Tobacco carcinogens inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein pseudovirions infection of the cells. Given that tobacco smoke accounts for 8 million deaths including 2.1 million cancer deaths annually and Skp2 is an oncoprotein, tobacco use should not be recommended and cessation plan should be prepared for smokers in COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p id="P2">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected 37,808,273 individuals and caused 1,080,790 deaths as of Oct 13, 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Johns Hopkins University of Medicine Coronavirus Resource Center, 2020</xref>).

Active smoking is not associated with severity of COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Lippi &amp; Henry, 2020</xref>), but is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Vardavas &amp; Nikitara, 2020</xref>). Based on these findings, pharmaceutical nicotine administration is suggested to be a therapeutic/preventive approach for SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Miyara et al, 2020</xref>). Meta-analysis conducted by World Health Organization (WHO) showed that smokers constituted 1.4% - 18.5% of hospitalized adults, but smoking is associated with increased severity of the disease and death from COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">World Health Organization, 2020a</xref>). Therefore, the effects of tobacco smoking on SARS-CoV-2 infection should be determined by an experimental study.</p>

<title>Tobacco smoke induces dual effects on ACE2</title>
<p id="P13">SARS-CoV-2 enters target cells by binding to its receptor ACE2 and using the serine protease TMPRSS2 for viral spike (S) protein priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Hoffmann et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Wang et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Zou et al, 2020</xref>). We tested the effects of cigarette smoking on <italic>ACE2</italic> expression, and reported that treatment of human normal lung epithelial 16HBE cells with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Wang et al, 2019</xref>) at final concentrations of 5% to 10% slightly upregulated <italic>ACE2</italic> at mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), consistent with previous analyses of transcriptomic datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Cai et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Smith et al, 2020</xref>). We then tested the effects of tobacco smoking on ACE2 at protein level. Unexpectedly, we found that treatment of the cells with CSE at 5% to 20% for 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) or at 10% for 48 to 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) significantly downregulated ACE2 at protein level, revealed by Western blot assay and densitometry analysis of immunoblot bands. The discrepancy in changes in mRNA and protein levels demonstrated the complicated effects of tobacco smoking on this receptor, and modulation of ACE2 protein may underlie the effect of smoking on SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

<sec id="S14">
<title>Tobacco carcinogens trigger ACE2 degradation</title>
<p id="P14">The effects of several representative components of tobacco smoking on ACE2 were tested, and the results showed that treatment of 16HBE cells with nicotine at 2.5 to 10 μM for 48 h or at 5 μM for 24 to 72 h did not perturb ACE2 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). Of note, group 1 carcinogen (carcinogenic to humans) benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) induced downregulation of ACE2 at 0.01 to 10 μM treatment for 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Treatment of 16HBE cells with BaP at 2.5 to 10 μM for 48 h or at 5 μM for 24 to 72 h significantly downregulated ACE2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). CSE and BaP did not affect the expression of TMPRSS2 or Furin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, E</xref>). BaP downregulated ACE2 in normal human lung epithelial Beas-2B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>), human alveolar epithelial A549 cells, and human embryonic kidney 293T cells transfected with pCMV-<italic>ACE2</italic>-hygro plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). In macrophages derived from human monocytic cell line THP-1 by stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), the expression of ACE2 was low and BaP did not perturb its expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>) but upregulated cytokines <italic>interferon-γ</italic> (<italic>IFNγ</italic>), <italic>interleukin-1α</italic> (<italic>IL-1α</italic>), <italic>IL-1β</italic>, <italic>IL-2</italic>, <italic>IL-6</italic>, and <italic>tumor necrosis factor α</italic> (<italic>TNFα</italic>) that are associated with cytokine storm in COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Zhou et al, 2020</xref>). Moreover, another tobacco group 1 carcinogen nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) induced downregulation of ACE2 in 16HBE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). On the contrary, the angiotensin receptor blockers azilsartan, candesartan, olmesartan but not eprosartan, induced upregulation of ACE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Gheblawi et al, 2020</xref>). These compounds did not perturb the expression of TMPRSS2 or Furin in the cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S15">
<title>Tobacco carcinogen induces ubiquitination and degradation of ACE2</title>
<p id="P15">BaP was used as a representative compound to dissect the mechanism of tobacco smoking-induced ACE2 downregulation at protein level. We showed that BaP treatment at 2.5 – 5 μM for 48 h or at 5 μM for 48 – 72 h slightly increased <italic>ACE2</italic> mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). BaP increased <italic>ACE2</italic> promoter-driven luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). We tested ACE2 protein stability by incubation of 16HBE cells with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), and found that treatment of the cells with CHX (50 μg/mL) for 12 h did not cause significant downregulation of ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that this receptor was quite stable. However, combinatorial use of CHX and BaP led to downregulation of ACE2 at 6 to 12 h, revealed by Western blot and densitometry analysis of protein bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results suggested that BaP may induce proteolytic degradation of ACE2. Proteasome and lysosome are two critical sites for degradation of ubiquitinated substrate proteins, and we found that proteasome inhibitors epoxomicin and MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) and lysosome inhibitor chloroquine (CQ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) inhibited BaP-induced ACE2 downregulation. In cells transfected with hemagglutinin-ubiquitin (HA-Ub) plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Kamitani et al, 1997</xref>), BaP induced downregulation of ACE2 and enhanced Ub-ACE2 binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). In 16HBE cells treated with 5 μM for 24 h, BaP downregulated ACE2 and potentiated ubiquitination of ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p>

<title>Skp2 mediates carcinogen-induced ACE2 ubiquitination and degradation</title>
<p id="P16">To identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates BaP-induced ACE2 degradation, the expression of several critical E3 ligases, e.g., the F-box (40 amino acid motif)-containing E3 ligase S-phase kinase associated protein 2 (Skp2), β-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (β-TRCP), the nuclear interaction partner of ALK (NIPA), the RING finger and WD repeat domain 3 (RFWD3), and deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10) were tested in cells treated with BaP. We showed that upon BaP treatment, the expression of Skp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Zhang et al, 1995</xref>) was drastically upregulated at protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) and mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) levels. However, the expression of β-TRCP, NIPA, RFWD3, USP10, and Skp1 which is a core subunit of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein (SCF) complex, was not significantly perturbed by BaP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

By analyzing its promoter sequence, we found that <italic>Skp2</italic> harbors two xenobiotic-responsive elements (XRE), 5’-<underline>GCGTG</underline>-3’ and 5’-<underline>GCGTG</underline>-3’, in its promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that it is a target gene of AhR. We showed that BaP increased <italic>Skp2</italic> promoter-driven luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), and AhR inhibitors alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D, E</xref>) and CH223191 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F, G</xref>) suppressed BaP-induced Skp2 upregulation at both mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D, F</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E, G</xref>) levels, and inhibited BaP-induced ACE2 downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-G</xref>).</p>
<p id="P18">We showed that in 16HBE cells upon BaP treatment, Skp2 upregulation was concomitantly detected with downregulation of ACE2, and co-localization of ACE2 and Skp2 was seen within the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). In consistent with these observations, ACE2 expression was negatively associated with Skp2 expression in several cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). By co-immunoprecipitation assay, we reported that Skp2 could bind to ACE2 but not RFWD3 in 16HBE and pCMV-<italic>ACE2</italic>-transfected 293T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) cells in the absence and presence of BaP treatment, and BaP treatment enhanced ACE2-Skp2 binding affinity. By expression and purification of truncated Skp2 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), we showed that two domains (183 – 292 and 293 – 424 amino acids) in C-terminal of Skp2 were responsible for interaction with ACE2, whereas the N-terminal (1 – 182 amino acids) of this E3 ligase was unable to bind ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Exogenous Skp2 also bound ACE2 and caused enhanced ubiquitination and downregulation of ACE2 in 16HBE and 293T-ACE2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). By CHX chase experiment, we showed that ectopic expression of Skp2 induced decrease of ACE2 stability in 16HBE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Meanwhile, knockdown of Skp2 by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppressed BaP-induced proteolytic degradation as well as ubiquitination of ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F, G</xref>). Silencing of Skp2 by si<italic>Skp2</italic> attenuated BaP-induced ACE2 ubiquitination and degradation in 293T-<italic>ACE2</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>). To further determine whether Skp2 could induce ACE2 ubiquitination, an <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay was performed using Flag-ACE2 and Flag-Skp2 proteins purified from 293T cells, and the results showed that Skp2 was able to trigger ACE2 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>). In <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay using recombinant carrier free ACE2 and Skp2 proteins bought from R&amp;D Systems, we confirmed that Skp2 was able to trigger ACE2 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J</xref>), demonstrating that Skp2 is the E3 ligase for ACE2 ubiquitination and degradation.</p>

<title>Tobacco carcinogens induced ACE2 downregulation <italic>in vivo</italic>
</title>
<p id="P19">To test the <italic>in vivo</italic> effect of tobacco smoking on ACE2 expression, immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay was performed on lung biopsy samples of patients with benign diseases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The results showed that ACE2 was expressed on membrane and cytoplasm of the cells, and smokers had much lower ACE2 than non-smokers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). On the contrary, the expression of Skp2 was low in non-smokers and high in smokers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A, B</xref>), showing a negative correlation trend with ACE2 in the patients. In another setting, Western blot analysis was performed using lysates of specimens harvested from normal lung tissues 5 cm away from tumor tissues of patients with lung adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), and we reported that in smoker patients the expression of ACE2 was lower whereas Skp2 was higher than those in non-smoker patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). The relationship between ACE2 and Skp2 expression levels was analyzed by Spearman analysis, and a negative correlation between the two variables was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>
<p id="P20">To confirmed these observations, the A/J mice were exposed to cigarette smoke with filtered conditioned air of 750 μg total particulate matter per liter for 20 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Wang et al, 2019</xref>), and lung tissues of the mice were stained with anti-ACE2 and anti-Skp2 antibodies. IHC assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>) and related IRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>) showed that ACE2 was lower while Skp2 was higher in mice exposed to tobacco smoking than in mice exposed to clean air. These results were confirmed by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>) and Western blot/related densitometry assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I, J</xref>) of these lung tissues. In mice treated with BaP at 100 mg/kg twice a week for 5 weeks, the ACE2 expression in lung tissues was decreased compared with that in mice treated with vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5K, L</xref>). Treatment with NNK at 50 mg/kg twice a week for 5 weeks also caused downregulation of ACE2 in lung tissues of the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5K, L</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P22">Tobacco smoke accounts for more than 8 million deaths each year worldwide, with 7 million deaths from direct tobacco use and 1.2 million deaths of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">World Health Organization, 2020b</xref>). There is strong evidence for a causal association between smoking and 29 diseases (14 types of cancers, 7 categories of cardiovascular disease, 3 categories of respiratory disease, diabetes, renal failure, infections, intestinal ischemia, and liver cirrhosis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Carter et al, 2015</xref>). Tobacco and smoking contain more than 70 carcinogens and cause cancers via complicated mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US) et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Zhou, 2019</xref>). Therefore, great efforts should be made to reduce tobacco use and help smokers to quit.</p>
<p id="P23">Effective drugs for COVID-19 remain rare, and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are still under investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Zhou et al, 2020</xref>). CSE inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S protein pseudovirus infection, supporting the clinical findings that smokers might have a lower probability of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Miyara et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Vardavas &amp; Nikitara, 2020</xref>). Among the tobacco compounds, BaP and NNK, but not nicotine, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S protein pseudovirion from infection of the cells. These results do not suggest an efficacy of nicotine in prevention/treatment of COVID-19. Both BaP and NNK are notorious carcinogens that cause comprehensive hazardous effects on humans and induce carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Zhou, 2019</xref>). BaP also induces upregulation of Skp2, an oncoprotein that plays a pivotal role in cell cycle progression and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Liu et al, 2020</xref>). Therefore, the generalized advice to quit smoking as a measure to improve health risk remains valid, because it is the carcinogens that are responsible for ACE2 degradation.</p>
<p id="P24">ACE2 is a glycoprotein metalloprotease that exists in membrane-bound and soluble forms and has enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions. It is expressed in type II alveolar cells, myocardial cells, proximal tubule cells of kidney, ileum and esophagus epithelial cells, bladder urothelial cells, and other types of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Zou et al, 2020</xref>). We showed that tobacco carcinogens exerts dual effects on ACE2, i.e., upregulation at mRNA and downregulation at protein levels, in normal human lung epithelial cells. This discrepancy was consistent with studies into mRNA-protein relationship showing poor correlation between the two kinds of molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Xu et al, 2020</xref>). A study reports that angiotensin II (Ang-II) treatment induces ACE2 internalization into lysosomes where it is degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Deshotels et al, 2014</xref>). We show that lysosome is partially responsible for BaP-triggered ACE2 degradation, because lysosome inhibitor chloroquine partially rescues ACE2 from BaP-induced degradation. Proteasome also has a role in ACE2 catabolism, since epoxomicin and MG132 partially suppress ACE2 degradation. The fact that inhibition of either proteasome or lysosome can partially but not completely blocked the degradation of ACE2 suggests that the both organelles are critical to ACE2 catabolism, and the role of other forms of post-translational modification (e.g., phosphorylation and glycosylation) in ACE2 catabolism warrants further investigation. Currently, how NNK downregulates ACE2 remains unclear. We show that BaP induces a significant up-regulation of Skp2, which interacts with ACE2 and induces ubiquitination and degradation of the substrate. Therefore, our results partially unveil the mechanisms of action of tobacco carcinogens on ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). This receptor is required to maintain lung and cardiovascular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Gheblawi et al, 2020</xref>), whether ACE2 proteolysis is responsible for severity of patients with COVID-19 needs to be determined in the future studies.</p>
