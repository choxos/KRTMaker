<abstract>
<p id="P2">SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies represent an important component of the ongoing search for effective treatment of and protection against COVID-19. We report here on the use of a na√Øve phage display antibody library to identify a panel of fully human SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Following functional profiling <italic>in vitro</italic> against an early pandemic isolate as well as a recently emerged isolate bearing the D614G Spike mutation, the clinical candidate antibody, STI-1499, and the affinity-engineered variant, STI-2020, were evaluated for <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy in the Syrian golden hamster model of COVID-19. Both antibodies demonstrated potent protection against the pathogenic effects of the disease and a dose-dependent reduction of virus load in the lungs, reaching undetectable levels following a single dose of 500 micrograms of STI-2020. These data support continued development of these antibodies as therapeutics against COVID-19 and future use of this approach to address novel emerging pandemic disease threats.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">Global incidence of severe acute respiratory disease syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has continued to rapidly increase since the virus was first detected in December 2019 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. To date, public health agency efforts to combat the pandemic level of infection and resultant Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have relied mostly upon effective quarantine measures <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. To further protect at-risk populations, a worldwide effort has been undertaken to develop additional countermeasures, such as antiviral compounds, immunomodulatory agents, vaccines, and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">While vaccines have been among the most effective means in preventing and containing widespread infections caused by many pathogens, their development is often faced with drawbacks, including long development timelines, large clinical trial sizes, and uncertain efficacy due to the reliance on patient-generated immune responses to the antigens<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. Of note, it has been shown in the context of multiple virus infections that virus-specific antibodies can lead to exacerbation of disease symptoms through a process termed antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. This ADE of virus infection is a phenomenon in which certain virus-specific antibodies enhance the entry of virus due to engagement between IgG Fc regions and Fc-receptors on the surface of monocytes leading to productive infection of these cells rather than virus clearance <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. In addition, the presence of immunodominant epitopes, i.e. highly immunogenic sequences, in viral antigens can skew this immune response, resulting in production of antibodies that are neither neutralizing nor protective, as seen in the vaccine development against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, nAbs targeting the Spike protein have been isolated from the sera of convalescent COVID-19 patients as well as from sera donated by healthy normal patients prior to December 2019 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. While the patients‚Äô immune systems generated these nAbs, they often recognize the same region of the Spike protein or even a similar epitope due to immunodominant regions of the Spike protein <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. One way to overcome this inherent immune bias is the use of an artificial immune system in a test tube, namely phage display human antibody libraries, which allows for functional unbiased selection of Spike-binding antibodies irrespective of the underlying natural immunogenicity <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. Most antibody libraries are constructed in a way that allows for chain shuffling leading to random associations of heavy and light chain encoding genes and resulting in a vast repertoire of non-naturally occurring antigen specificities. In fact, few candidate anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAbs have been isolated from phage display libraries <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. Using Sorrento‚Äôs G-MAB‚Ñ¢ library <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>, a single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody phage display library constructed from the antibody repertoire of over 600 healthy individuals, a panel of antibodies that bind the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 subunit was identified and characterized.</p>
<p id="P5">Herein, we report on the identification, characterization, and subsequent optimization of STI-1499, a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody isolated from the G-MAB library. STI-1499 neutralized both the WA-1/2020 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 as well as isolate 2020001, a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 that encodes the G614 variant of the Spike protein. Isolates harboring the G614 Spike variant have been reported to be more infectious and occur in greater frequency than viruses such as the WA-1/2020 isolate that encode the D614 Spike variant<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. Affinity maturation of STI-1499 resulted in identification of STI-2020, an antibody with a 35-fold increased affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) leading to a greater than 50-fold increase in virus neutralization potency against live WA-1/2020 and 2020001 viruses <italic>in vitro</italic>. Importantly, both nAbs, STI-1499 and STI-2020, provided protection against the pathogenic effects and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the Syrian golden hamster virus challenge model <sup>

<title>Antibody binding ELISA</title>
<p id="P6">The S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (amino acids 16-685) bearing a C-terminal histidine tag (ACRO Biosystems, Newark, NJ) was coated at 2 Œºg/ml on a Ni-NTA plate (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After washing and blocking, 10 Œºg/ml antibody was added to the corresponding wells for 1-hour incubation. The plate was washed three times and incubated with 1:5000 dilution of HRP-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG (Fc). Color development was performed with 3,3‚Ä≤,5,5‚Ä≤-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB).

<title>Expression and purification of STI-1499 and STI-2020 monoclonal antibodies</title>
<p id="P8">STI-1499 was expressed using a two-vector transient expression protocol. Briefly, 2x10<sup>6</sup>/ml CHO-S cells were co-transfected with 1Œºg of total DNA of the heavy and light chain plasmids, at 1:4 DNA: Polyethyleneimine (PEI) ratio (Œºg/Œºg). After 24 hours of incubation with shaking (125 rpm) at 28¬∞C, the culture conditions were adjusted to incubation at 37¬∞C with shaking in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> chamber for 10-14 days. STI-1499 was purified from the CHO culture supernatants by affinity chromatography with MabSelectSureLX‚Ñ¢ protein A resin using the AktaPure platform.</p>
<p id="P9">STI-2020 was produced using a double gene vector stable pool expression protocol. Briefly, the pXC double gene vector (Lonza) encoding both the heavy and light chain genes was used to generate polyclonal pools of stably transfected CHO-S cells, according to manufacturer‚Äôs recommended transfection and selection protocols. The stable pool was cultured with shaking (140 rpm) at 37¬∞C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 14 days. STI-2020 was purified to homogeneity from the CHO culture supernatants first by affinity chromatography with MabSelectSureLX‚Ñ¢ protein A resin and then by ion exchange chromatography using SPImpres resin.</p>

<title>Cell based Spike binding assay</title>
<p id="P10">Mammalian expression vectors were constructed either by cloning of the synthesized gene encoding SARS-CoV-2 G614 Spike protein (UniprotKB, SPIKE-SARS2) or, for SARS-CoV-2 D614 Spike protein, via site-directed mutagenesis of the G614 Spike protein gene. HEK293 cells were transfected using FuGeneHD transfection reagent according to manufacturer‚Äôs protocol (Promega, Cat # E2311). 48 hours post-transfection, cells were harvested using enzyme free cell dissociation buffer (ThermoFisher, #13151014.), washed once and resuspended in FACS buffer (DPBS + 2% FBS) at 4x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. For antibody binding to the cells expressing the Spike proteins, the cells were dispensed into wells of a 96-well plate (25 Œºl per well), and an equal volume of 2x final concentration of serially-diluted anti-S1 antibody solution was added. After incubation on ice for 45 minutes, the cells were washed with 150 Œºl FACS buffer. Detection of bound antibody was carried out by staining the cells with 50 Œºl of 1:500 diluted APC AffiniPure F(ab')<sub>2</sub> Fragment (Goat Anti-Human IgG (H+L). Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat# 109-136-4098) for 20 minutes on ice. The cells were washed once with 150 Œºl FACS buffer and analyzed using flow cytometry. A sigmoidal four-parameter logistic equation was used for fitting the MFI vs. mAb concentration data set to extract EC50 values (GraphPad Prism 8.3.0 software).</p>

Protein samples (starting from 200 Œºg/ml) were 2-fold serially diluted in infection media (DMEM+2%FBS) for a total of 8 dilutions. Sixty microliters of diluted samples were incubated with 100 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID<sub>50</sub>) of SARS-CoV-2 in 60 Œºl for 1 h at 37¬∞C. One-hundred microliters of the protein/virus mixture were subsequently used to infect monolayers of Vero E6 cells grown on 96-well plates in quadruplicate. Virus supernatant was removed and replaced with fresh medium after 1 h of culture at 37¬∞C. Cytopathic effect (CPE) in each well was observed daily and recorded on day 3 post-infection. At the end of the study, the media was aspirated. Cells were fixed with 10% formalin and stained with 0.25% crystal violet. The neutralizing titers of protein that completely prevented CPE in 50% of the wells (NT<sub>50</sub>) were calculated following the Reed &amp; Muench method<sup>

<title>Hamster challenge experiments</title>
<p id="P13">Male and female Syrian golden hamsters were obtained from Charles River Laboratories at 6 weeks of age. Hamsters were inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of SARS-CoV-2 in 100 Œºl of sterile PBS on day 0. Antibody treatments were administered intravenously (i.v.) with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 Spike, or isotype control mAb in up to 350 Œºl of sterile PBS at 1 hour-post inoculation. Animals were monitored for illness and mortality for 10 days post-inoculation and clinical observations were recorded daily. Body weights and temperatures were recorded at least once every 48 hours throughout the experiment. On day 5 post-infection, 5 animals from each treatment group were sacrificed and virus titers in the lungs of these animals were measured using a SARS-CoV-2 virus TCID<sub>50</sub> assay. Average % weight change on each experimental day were compared with the isotype control mAb-treated group using 2-way ANOVA following Dunnett‚Äôs multiple comparisons test. All animals were housed in animal biosafety level-2 (ABSL-2) and ABSL-3 facilities in Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch. All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Medical Branch and were conducted according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines.</p>

<title>Determination of infectious virus titers in the lung</title>
<p id="P14">Prior to initiation of the experiment, five animals from each treatment group (n=10) were designated for virus titration in lung tissue at 5 days post inoculation. On the assigned day, animals were euthanized, lung tissue samples were collected from each animal, and a portion of the tissue (0.08-0.3g) was placed into pre-labeled microcentrifuge tubes containing 5 mm stainless steel beads (Qiagen Inc., CA). Lung samples were homogenized with DMEM + 2% FBS in a TissueLyser (Qiagen Inc., CA) operated at 25-30 Hz for four minutes. Tubes were centrifuged and clarified homogenate was serially diluted 10-fold with DMEM+2% FBS. From material representing each serial dilution step, 100 Œºl was transferred to each of four wells of a 96-well plated seeded with Vero E6 cells. Plates were then incubated for 72-96 hours at 37¬∞ C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were subsequently fixed with 10% formalin and stained with 0.25% crystal violet solution.

<title>Results</title>
<p id="P15">The G-MAB library was panned using a recombinant His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 subunit to allow for selection of candidates with high affinity to the target antigen, as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. In summary, following confirmation of S1 binding by ELISA, clonal scFv preparations were tested in a competition ELISA format for disruption of Spike S1:ACE2 binding. Candidate scFvs with high S1 binding affinity and/or the capacity to block Spike S1:ACE2 binding were converted into and expressed as full length human IgG1 antibodies.</p>
<p id="P16">In an effort to mitigate the risk of ADE resulting from administration of G-MAB-derived nAbs, the IgG1 Fc region were modified by introducing specific amino acid substitutions (L234A, L235A [LALA]) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>. The LALA Fc modification reduces binding affinity to the FcŒ≥ receptors, thus addressing the potential ADE risks associated with delivery of unmodified recombinant IgG1 neutralizing antibody or convalescent sera to COVID-19 patients, while providing a similar blockade to interactions between SARS-COV-2 and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on susceptible cells in the lung and gut epithelia <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. Partitioning of virus away from susceptible cells in this manner may allow for clearance of nAb-bound virus and a corresponding decrease in the pace and degree of COVID-19 pathogenesis in treated individuals.</p>
<sec id="S12">
<title>Functional profiling and antibody affinity maturation</title>
<p id="P17">The nAb candidate termed STI-1499 displayed potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity superior to that of other G-MAB nAb hits, with an IC<sub>50</sub> in the virus neutralization assay of 3.2 Œºg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). In parallel to STI-1499 preclinical profiling and cell line development efforts, affinity maturation of STI-1499 was undertaken, with systematic amino acid changes engineered within complementarity determination regions (CDRs) of the STI-1499 heavy and light chains. For individual CDR regions from STI-1499, a library of variants was screened for binding to the Spike S1 subunit by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Variants bearing combinations of affinity-enhancing CDR amino acid changes were then systematically engineered and expressed as IgG1 LALA antibodies. Based on Spike S1 ELISA binding results, the most potent clone of the single CDR and combination CDR variants, STI-2020, was further profiled for binding affinity using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). STI-2020 bound to the RBD region of the Spike protein with an affinity of 1.3 nM, a 35-fold affinity improvement over that of the parental STI-1499 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S13">
<title>Spectrum of activity of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies</title>
<p id="P18">STI-1499 and STI-2020 were tested for binding to full length Spike proteins derived from naturally emerging viruses including the USA/WA-1/2020 (WA-1) isolate as well as an emerging SARS-CoV-2 isolate that bears a D ‚ÜíG mutation at amino acid residue 614 in the Spike protein (D614G). Binding studies demonstrated equivalent binding affinity for both nAbs against cell surface-expressed Spike protein with the D614G mutation as well as that of the WA-1 isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">To determine the neutralizing activity of STI-1499 and STI-2020 against the aforementioned SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates (<italic>vide supra</italic>), nAbs were evaluated in the virus neutralization assay. Both nAbs exhibited equipotent neutralization of the virus isolates. In keeping with observed improved binding properties, STI-2020 neutralized both isolates with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.055 Œºg/ml and an IC<sub>99</sub> of 0.078 Œºg/ml, a greater than 50-fold enhancement of neutralizing potency over the parental STI-1499 nAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<title>Treatment with STI-1499 or STI-2020 in a hamster model of COVID-19</title>
<p id="P20">SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in the Syrian golden hamster model of infection provides a means of assessing nAb activity in a preclinical model of respiratory disease. Animals inoculated with 1x10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of SARSCoV-2 intranasally were treated with either STI-1499 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) or STI-2020 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) administered intravenously (IV) at 1 hour post-infection. Weight change as a percentage of starting weight was recorded and graphed for each animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> Panel A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> Panel A). Animals in the STI-1499 treatment groups were administered a single dose of either 50, 500, or 2000 Œºg IV. To control for effects of the virus infection on animal growth, uninfected animals (UI) were administered 2000 Œºg of the control IgG1 (IsoCtl) IV. Animals in this group displayed no clinical signs and gained weight throughout the course of the experiment. Hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 and administered 2000 Œºg of IsoCtl experienced steady weight loss over the first five days of infection, with maximal average weight loss % in this group reaching -5.7% ¬± 3.3 at 5 days-post-infection (d.p.i.). The duration and degree of weight loss in the 50 Œºg and 500 Œºg STI-1499 treatment groups were similar to that of animals administered IsoCtl mAb. Following administration of 2000 Œºg STI-1499, animals experienced transient minor weight loss over the first two days post-infection followed by steady weight gain on subsequent days. By day 4 d.p.i., and continuing on until the end of the experiment on 10 d.p.i., the effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection on the average % weight change of animals treated with 2000 Œºg STI-1499 was significantly different than that in animals treated with control IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, Panel C). Animals treated with 2000 Œºg STI-1499 began to gain weight by day 3 d.p.i. and had reached an average weight gain of 5.8% ¬± 4.1 by 10 d.p.i. while animals treated with IsoCtl mAb continued to lose weight until 5 d.p.i. and, on average, only returned to day 0 weight levels by 10 d.p.i.. At 5 d.p.i., lungs from 5 out of 10 animals (designated prior to initiation of the experiment) from each experimental group were harvested and virus titers were quantified as TCID<sub>50</sub>/g. Treatment with 2000 Œºg STI-1499 resulted in an average lung titer of 1.38 x 10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/g of tissue, an approximately 27-fold reduction compared to average lung titers in IsoCtl-treated animals. Notably, lung titers for three of the five animals from the 2000 Œºg STI-1499 group were below the limit of detection (&lt;3.6x10<sup>2</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/g). The remaining two animals displayed lung titers approximately 10-fold below that of the IsoCtl-treated group. Consistent with a partial protective effect following a dose of 500 Œºg of STI-1499, the average TCID<sub>50</sub>/g of lung tissue among animals in this treatment group were reduced 2.5-fold as compared to the IsoCtl treatment group.</p>
<p id="P21">Animals in the STI-2020 treatment groups were administered a single dose of either 30, 100, 300, or 500 Œºg IV. Administration of a 500 Œºg dose of STI-2020 resulted in maximum average percentage body weight loss of -1.9%, which occurred on 2 d.p.i.. After that, animals treated with 500 ug STI-2020 maintained an average body weight that as a percentage of day 0 weight was significantly different on days 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 than the average weight measured among IsoCtl-treated animals. As with STI-1499-treated hamsters, virus titers in the lung were measured in 5 of 10 animals from each treatment group. In IsoCtl-treated animals, an average of 1.6x10<sup>3</sup> TCID50/g of lung tissue was detected. Treatment with 500 Œºg STI-2020 resulted in reduction of lung titers below the level of detection in all animals tested, a STI-2020 -treatment-related lung titer reduction of 80-fold at minimum. In the 300 Œºg STI-2020 treatment group, the average lung titer was reduced below the level of detection in 3 of 5 animals tested, while 2 of 5 animals had lung titers of similar magnitude to those measured in IsoCtl-treated animals. Animals with undetectable lung virus titers in the 300 Œºg treatment group also experienced only moderate weight loss compared to animals with detectable lung virus titers in this group (d5 values of -11.1% and -16.7%) No changes in average lung titer compared to IsoCtl-treatment were detected in animals from the 100 Œºg STI-2020 treatment group.</p>
<p id="P22">In summary, STI-1499 demonstrated promising protective efficacy in the hamster model at a dose of 2000 Œºg. The observed overall enhancement of <italic>in vitro</italic> potency for the affinity matured nAb, STI-2020, translated into increased protection against disease in the hamster challenge model, with a greater than 4-fold increase in protective efficacy over that of STI-1499.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P23">In this study, we detail the initial discovery and profiling of a SARS-CoV-2 nAb isolated from a phage display antibody library derived from the B-cell repertoire of over 600 healthy normal individuals. This approach complements the isolation of nAbs collected from natural sources, such as convalescent patients or vaccinated healthy individuals, and allows for isolation of nAbs recognizing neutralizing epitopes developed outside the temporal and biological context of the pathogen/antigen-specific immune response. The parental nAb STI-1499 and the affinity-matured derivative STI-2020 were characterized for their biochemical and function properties <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> against prevalent clinical isolates of SARS CoV-2. Both nAbs demonstrated potent functionality in these assays, which is strongly supportive of continued preclinical and clinical development. Notably, demonstration of improvement in neutralizing potency <italic>in vitro</italic> for STI-2020 over that of STI-1499 was predictive of increased protective efficacy in the hamster challenge model following post-exposure therapeutic treatment. In addition, <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy was achieved in the presence of the ADE-mitigating LALA Fc modification, providing further confidence that this modification might add to the utility of nAbs under clinical evaluation for use in the treatment of COVID-19. Studies aimed at establishing the therapeutic and prophylactic treatment window in the hamster model as well as demonstrating efficacy following administration of nAb proteins by non-parenteral routes are currently underway.</p>
<p id="P24">In addition, introduction of nAb-encoding DNA plasmids provides a low cost, long-acting means of establishing antibody-mediated immunity, and experiments in rodents are ongoing and will determine the suitability of STI-2020 for use in this context. Treatments using STI-2020 nAb protein or DNA-encoding of nAbs in combination with other identified nAbs targeting non-overlapping epitopes on the Spike S1 subunit to constitute a nAb cocktail approach will provide a means of increasing the barrier to treatment resistance as the prevalence of naturally emerging and treatment-associated virus variants increases. This approach is under investigation and in preclinical development.</p>
<p id="P25">As emergence of novel pathogens will continue to pose a significant threat to humanity, the rapid discovery of potent nAbs against these yet-unknown microbes will remain paramount to global health efforts. The discovery and development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAbs STI-1499 and STI-2020 in less than 6 months without the need of samples from infected individuals could serve as blueprint for future rapid response efforts.</p>
<p id="P26">Panning of the G-MAB library consisting of fully human antibody sequences allowed for the expeditious progression of lead nAb candidates from initial screening to the production cell line generation stage, avoiding additional development steps such as subsequent humanization of the identified antibodies and associated immunogenicity concerns of non-human antibody-based therapeutics. This has enabled an efficient and expedited discovery and development of SARS-CoV-2 nAbs starting in March 2020, thus taking less 6 months from initiation of the project to completed IND filing. Notably, STI-1499 has recently received FDA clearance to commence first-in-human studies making it the first clinical-stage anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAb derived not from convalescent patients but from a fully human phage display antibody library, and it is anticipated that dosing of the first patients will begin in October 2020.</p>

<title>G-MAB SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Discovery Workflow.</title>
<p>The G-MAB phage display library was panned for SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 subunit-binding scFv fragments. Following confirmation of binding activity and blocking of S1:ACE2 interactions by candidate scFvs, the most potent of these candidates were converted to IgG1 antibodies bearing the LALA Fc modification. Candidate nAbs were characterized for binding of Spike S1 subunit and neutralization of related clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Affinity maturation of potent nAbs was carried out in parallel to biophysical profiling, cell line development, and evaluation of protective efficacy for the parental nAb, STI-1499.</p>
