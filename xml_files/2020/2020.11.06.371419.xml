<abstract>
<p id="P1">Expression-dependent, Spike-only vaccines have been developed, deployed, and shown to be effective in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. However, additional approaches to vaccine development may be needed to meet existing and future challenges posed by emerging Spike variant strains, as well as a likely need for different antigen-delivery systems that are safe and effective for regular, periodic re-administration. We report here the development of mRNA-loaded exosomes, demonstrate that they can mediate the functional expression of heterologous proteins <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and have fewer adverse effects than comparable doses of lipid nanoparticles. Furthermore, we applied this approach to the development of an exosome-based, multiplexed mRNA vaccine that drives expression of immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid and Spike proteins. This vaccine elicited long-lasting cellular and humoral responses to Nucleocapsid and to Spike, demonstrating that exosome-based mRNA formulations represent a previously unexplored platform in the fight against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of COVID-19 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. COVID-19 typically presents with symptoms common to many respiratory infections, including fever and cough, but in many cases progresses to more severe disease that may include acute respiratory distress, disseminated disease, and death <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 entered the human population in late 2019 as the result of a zoonotic leap and is most closely related to coronaviruses endemic to bats (Chiroptera)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 is the third recent zoonotic betacoronavirus to enter the human population, the others being responsible for the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) in 2002 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup> and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2012 (Memish et al., 2013), indicative of a generally susceptibility of human populations to coronavirus zoonoses. These zoonoses are more distantly to human endemic betacoronaviruses (OC43, HKU1, etc.) that also cause respiratory infections of milder effect <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>). While SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with lower mortality than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 initially displayed a higher rate of transmission, quickly became a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html</ext-link>)(coronavirus.jhu.edu), and has continued to evolve into numerous variant strains that display even more-elevated rates of transmission and an emerging resistance to antibody-based neutralization <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via a multistep pathway that begins with binding between the Spike protein on the virus surface and its cognate receptor proteins on the host cell surface. These include angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>, neuropilin-1 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>, and perhaps also CD147 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. Following virus-cell binding, host cell proteases (e.g. TMPRSS2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>, cathepsins <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>, etc.) cleave Spike, potentiating Spike-catalyzed fusion between the viral and cellular membranes and functional infection of the host cell. Not surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 receptors and proteases are expressed within the respiratory tract, consistent with its respiratory mode of transmission <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. However, they are also expressed in many other cell types, allowing SARS-CoV-2 to spread within the body and impact multiple organ systems (brain, heart, gastrointestinal tract, circulatory system, immune system, etc. <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>).</p>
<p id="P4">Following virus-cell membrane fusion, the viral genomic RNA (gRNA) is translated to generate two large polyproteins, open reading frame 1 (orf1a) and orf1ab, which are processed to release 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. These early proteins prime the host cell for virus replication and mediate the synthesis of subgenomic viral RNAs and their unique protein products. These include a dozen or more additional proteins, including the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins Nucleocapsid (N), Spike (S), Membrane (M), and Envelope (E). Spike, Membrane and Envelope are integral membrane proteins, co-translationally translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), that subsequently drive virion formation while also incorporating the Nucleocapsid and its bound gRNA as well as some other ancillary proteins <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>, with virus release via lysosomal exocytosis (Ghosh et al., 2020) []. The released viral particles are ~100 nm diameter, display prominent Spike protrusions from the cell surface and a lumen containing Nucleocapsid-gRNA complexes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 biogenesis also involves extensive processing of its Spike protein at a polybasic site, generating S1 and S2 forms of Spike, with the N-terminal, receptor-binding S1 fragment bound non-covalently to the fusogenic, membrane-anchored S2 fragment <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">Vaccine design should mirror, and ideally improve on, the correlates of protective immunity that arise from natural infections. It is now well-established that SARS-CoV-2 infection generates potent cellular and humoral immune responses to viral proteins that in most cases reverse the course of disease, clear the viral infection, and confer resistance to reinfection in both people and in animal models <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>. Disease-preventing vaccines have previously been developed for animal coronaviruses <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup> and have been successfully developed and deployed for SARS-CoV-2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
</sup>, a development that is likely to save millions of lives. However, these first-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines only elicit immunity to a single viral protein, Spike, the rapid evolution of which may impair vaccine efficacy <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Furthermore, the Spike-only vaccine approach ignores the fact that a primary correlate of immunity in COVID-19 patients is the array of potent immune reactions to the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">Here we describe an expression-dependent SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that combines exosome-based delivery, multiplexed mRNA formulation, induction of immunity to both Spike and Nucleocapsid, and antigen design that involves expressing Nucleocapsid in a form designed for improved antigen presentation. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) of ~30-150 nm in diameter that are made by all cells, abundant in all biofluids, and mediate intercellular transmission of signals and macromolecules, including RNAs <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>
</sup>. Allogenic exosome transplantations and transfusions have been practices in one form or another for more than a century and have never been associated with any adverse effects. Moreover, exosomes have already been shown effective for delivery of RNA-based therapeutics <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>
</sup>. The remainder of this report describes the production of engineered exosome/mRNA formulations, their ability to drive protein expression in cultured cells and animals, their improved safety relative to LNPs, and their use as a multiplexed, exosome-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that elicited immunity to multiple viral antigens, including Nucleocapsid as well as Spike.</p>

<title>Exosomes display robust ability to deliver functional mRNAs in vitro and in vivo</title>
<p id="P7">Exosomes are capable of delivering functional RNAs to target cells <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>
</sup>, but so too are synthetic lipid vesicles, often referred to as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup>. To better understand the dynamics of mRNA delivery by these two natural and synthetic forms of soluble vesicles, we generated matched formulations of mRNA-loaded exosomes and mRNA-loaded LNPs. Exosomes were purified from the culture of 293F cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), LNPs <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup> were obtained from a commercial provider, and equal amounts of each (by vesicle number) were loaded with a synthetic mRNA encoding the hybrid luciferase/fluorescent protein Antares2 (Antares2 is comprised of the luciferase teLuc fused to two copies of the fluorescent protein CyOFP1 (CyOFP1-teLuc-CyOFP1), emits far-red shift light via bioluminescent resonance energy transfer<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>). Equal amounts of these matched exo-mRNA and LNP-mRNA formulations were then incubated at low and high doses with human cells, followed by an overnight incubation to allow for Antares2 protein expression. The next day, the cells were incubated with diphenylterazine (DTZ), a cell-permeable substrate (luciferin) for Antares2, and assayed for DTZ-dependent, Antares2-catalyzed light emission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). At low-dose administration, Antares2 expression was 25% higher in cells treated with the exo-mRNA formulation than with the LNP-mRNA formulation (n = 6, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0016). The difference in Antares2 expression was even more pronounced at high-dose administration, as the exo-mRNA-treated cells expressed far more Antares2 activity than the LNP-exo-treated cells (16-fold; n = 6; <italic>p</italic> = 0.00035).</p>
<p id="P8">This large difference in particle-mediated Antares2 expression was caused by a drop in LNP-mRNA-mediated expression, raising the possibility that LNP administration is inhibitory at high levels of administration. This in turn raised the possibility of general toxicity of LNP administration, which we addressed by following the short-term consequences of exosome and LNP injections in mice. Animals were injected (i.m.) with equal numbers of either exosomes or LNPs (50 ml of ??? particles/ml), returned to their cages for three days, and then sacrificed and processed for organ histology by an independent testing laboratory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). No abnormalities were detected in control animals (5/5) or in animals injected with exosomes (5/5). In contrast, only one of the LNP-injected animals (1/5) displayed normal spleen histology, as 4/5 animals showed an increase in red pulp. Adverse LNP effects may also explain the ~5% reduction in body mass (n = 5; <italic>p</italic> = 0.05) we observed at 3 days post-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">The robust expression of exosome-delivered mRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> and the absence of exosome-associated adverse effects led us to next test whether RNA-loaded exosomes might also be able to drive Antares2 expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. Towards this end, we injected adult mice (0.05 ml volume, intramuscular (i.m.) administration) with Antares2 mRNA-loaded exosomes, returned the animals to cages to allow for Antares2 expression. 24 hours later, the control (uninjected) and treated mice were injected (i.p.) with a solution of the Antares2 luciferin DTZ and imaged immediately using a real-time bioluminescent imaging (BLI) system to visualize exosome-mediated, mRNA-directed Antares2 expression. Control animals displayed no significant light emission upon DTZ injections whereas animals that had been injected with the mRNA-loaded exosome formulation displayed robust light emission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). These observations demonstrate that RNA-loaded exosomes can deliver functional mRNAs into cells in live animals in a way that leads to mRNA translation, protein expression, and directed enzyme activity.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Design and validation of S<sup>W1</sup> and LSNME mRNAs</title>
<p id="P10">We next tested whether exosome-mRNA formulations can be used to elicit immune responses to mRNA-encoded antigens. Towards this end, we synthesized a pair of mRNAs, one of which expresses the form of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S<sup>W1</sup>) encoded by the initial viral isolate <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. The second mRNA expresses a fusion protein (LSNME) comprised of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein, as well as fragments of the Spike, Membrane, and Envelope proteins, all inserted in the extracellular domain of human Lamp1 (this Lamp1-based fusion protein aims to induce anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity by targeting viral protein fragments to the MHC Class I and II antigen presentation pathways <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>
</sup>). Transfection of these mRNAs into HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) resulted in expression of Spike at the cell surface but also at internal organelles (shown elsewhere to be lysosomes <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>
</sup>), whereas expression of LSNME led to its accumulation in what appears to the endoplasmic reticulum, the site of MHC Class I peptide loading and maturation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>The LSNME/S<sup>W1</sup> vaccine induces antibody responses to N and S</title>
<p id="P11">A single exosome-mRNA formulation containing both the LSNME and S<sup>W1</sup> mRNAs (hereafter referred to as the LSNME/S<sup>W1</sup> vaccine) was injected (i.m.) into 13 weeks-old male C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). The vaccine was dosed at 4 ug or 0.25 ug equivalents of each mRNA and injections were performed on day 1 (primary immunization), day 21 (1st boost), and day 42 (2nd boost). Blood (0.1 mL) was collected on days 14, 35, 56, 70 and 84. On day 84 the animals were sacrificed to obtain tissue samples for histological analysis and splenocytes for blood cell studies. Using ELISA kits adapted for the detection of mouse antibodies, we observed that vaccinated animals displayed a dose-dependent antibody response to both the SARS-CoV-2 N protein and S protein. These antibody reactions were not particularly robust but they were long-lasting, persisting to 7 weeks after the final boost with little evidence of decline. It should be noted that the modest antibody production was expected in the case of the N protein, as the LSNME mRNA is designed to stimulate cellular immune responses rather than the production of anti-N antibodies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>LSNME/S<sup>W1</sup> vaccination induces cellular immune responses to N and S</title>
<p id="P12">Vaccinated and control animals were also interrogated for the presence of antigen-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. This was carried out by collecting splenocytes at the completion of the trial (day 84) using a CFSE proliferation assay in the presence or absence of recombinant N and S proteins. These experiments revealed that vaccination had induced a significant increase in the percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells that proliferated in response to addition of either recombinant N protein or recombinant S protein to the culture media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A-D</xref>). These vaccine-specific, antigen-induced proliferative responses demonstrate that the LSNME/S<sup>W1</sup> vaccine achieved its primary goal, which was to prime the cellular arm of the immune system to generate N-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, and also S-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. In additional experiments, we stained antigen-induced T-cells cells for the expression of interferon gamma (IFNγ) and interleukin 4 (IL4). These experiments revealed that the S-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell population displayed elevated expression of the Th1-associated cytokine IFNγ, and to a lesser extent, the Th2-associated cytokine IL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7</xref>). In contrast, N-reactive T-cells failed to display an N-induced expression of either IFNγ or IL4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>Absence of vaccine-induced adverse reactions</title>
<p id="P13">Control and vaccinated animals were examined regularly for overall appearance, general behavior, and injection site inflammation (redness, swelling). No vaccine-related differences were observed in any of these variables, and animals from all groups displayed similar age-related increases in body mass (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental figure 1</xref>). Vaccination also had no discernable effect on blood cell counts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental figure 2</xref>). Histological analyses were performed on all animals at the conclusion of the study by an independent histology service, which reported that vaccinated animals showed no difference in overall appearance of any of the tissues that were examined. Representative images are presented for brain, lung, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, and side of injection skeletal muscle in an animal from each of the trial groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P14">Exosomes are natural products of human cells that are more ‘self’ than ‘non-self’. Immune systems are tolerant of the high levels of exosomes that are continuously present in all biofluids (e.g. blood, lymph, cerebrospinal fluid, vitreous, interstitial fluids, etc.) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>
</sup>. Furthermore, there is no evidence of adverse effects of allogeneic exosome transfer, whether of purified exosomes (from amniotic fluid, blood, etc.) or of inadvertent exosome transfer during tissue transplantation, blood transfusion, plasma injection, etc. In this context, the fact that exosomes normally participate in pathways of vesicle-mediated, intercellular RNA traffic <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>
</sup> indicates that exosomes may be an ideal vehicle for clinical RNA delivery. The data presented here support this hypothesis by showing that that exosome-mRNA formulations can support the <italic>in vivo</italic>, functional expression of proteins as diverse as soluble cytoplasmic enzymes, viral structural proteins, and synthetic fusion proteins.</p>
<p id="P15">Our findings are also relevant to the ongoing battle against SARS-CoV-2. Current vaccine strategies are all centered on inducing immunity to Spike, but Spike-only vaccines are susceptible to escape effects whenever and antigenically shifted Spike variants starts to spread in susceptible populations. While we are developing strategies designed to address this challenge by improved design of expression-dependent Spike vaccines, we are also working to address it by generating a multiplexed mRNA vaccine that delivers two or more mRNAs, one encoding Spike and the others encoding Nucleocapsid and perhaps fragments of other proteins as well. One limitation of this approach is that Nucleocapsid is a cytoplasmic protein rather than a surface antigen, a topology that limits its efficacy in vaccination studies. However, this limitation can be overcome by expressing Nucleocapsid as part of a fusion with the lysosomal resident protein Lamp1, which places Nucleocapsid protein in the correct compartments for Class I and Class II antigen presentation (ER and lysosome/MHC Class II compartment, respectively). This approach was realized in our LSNME/S<sup>W1</sup> vaccine, which elicited strong cellular immune responses to Nucleocapsid as well as to Spike. Vaccinated animals displayed antigen-induced CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses to both Nucleocapsid and to Spike that persisted for nearly two months after immunization. Furthermore, when these cell populations were interrogated for antigen-induced expression of the cytokines IFNγ and IL4, we detected elevated expression of IFNγ in CD4+ T-cells exposed to exogenous Spike protein, as well as a more modest Spike-induced expression of IL4. These results raise the possibility that the exosome-based LSNME/S<sup>W1</sup> vaccine induces the kind of Th1-skewed cellular immune response desired for an anti-viral vaccine. Vaccinated animals also developed durable antibody responses to the Nucleocapsid and the Spike proteins that were sustained at relatively constant levels over the 7 weeks following immunization. This multi-antigen immune response bodes well for this approach in the next generation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that will be needed to protect against the emerging array of antigenically distinct SARS-CoV-2 viral strains and their ever-increasing spectrum of Spike protein mutations.</p>
<p id="P16">In conclusion, the results presented in this study validate the use of multiplexed exosome-mRNA formulations for functional delivery of mRNAs both in cultured cells and in live animals. The successful use of exosomes to deliver Antares2 mRNA opens the door to follow-on studies aimed at optimizing exosome-RNA formulation conditions, as well as for characterizing the time-dependence of Antares2 expression, biodistribution of exosome-mediated RNA expression, injection site effects, and exosome-mediated tissue tropism. As for the future development of exosome-based SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, we anticipate that follow-on studies will demonstrate multiple advantages of exosome-based delivery, improved antigen designed, and most importantly, improved protective effects that arise from immunization with multiple viral antigens, and particularly Nucleocapsid, which is a main target of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity in COVID-19 patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup> and has proven effective in vaccine studies of other coronaviruses <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>
</sup>. Furthermore, the fact that exosomes can be deployed at high concentrations without adverse effects on cells or animals bodes well for their future use in dosing regimens that require higher-level or ongoing repeated injections.</p>

<p id="P17">293F cells (Gibco, Cat.# 51-0029) were tested for pathogens and found to be free of viral (cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus I and II, Epstein Barr virus, hepatitis B virus, and parvovirus B19), and bacterial (<italic>Mycoplasma</italic>) contaminants. Cells were maintained in FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium (Gibco, #12338-018) and incubated at 37°C in 8% CO<sub>2</sub>. For exosome production, 293F cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 10^6 cells/ml in shaker flasks in a volume of ~1/4 the flask volume and grown at a shaking speed of 110 rpm. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.</p>

<title>Exosome purification</title>
<p id="P18">293F cells were grown in shaker cultures for a period of three days. Cells and large cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 300 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 minutes followed by 3000 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 minutes. The resulting supernatant was passed through a 0.22 μm sterile filtration filter unit (Thermo Fisher, #566-0020) to generate a clarified tissue culture supernatant (CTCS). The CTCS was concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Centricon Plus-70, Ultracel-PL Membrane, 100 kDa size exclusion, Millipore Sigma # UFC710008), with ~120 mLs CTCS concentrated to ~0.5 mLs. Concentrated CTCS was then purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in 1x PBS (qEV original columns/35 nm: Izon Science, #SP5), with the exosomes present in each 0.5 mL starting sample eluting in three 0.5 mL fractions. Purified exosomes were reconcentrated using Amicon<sup>®</sup> Ultra-4 100 kDa cutoff spin columns (#UFC810024). This process yielded a population of exosomes/small EVs that have the expected ultrastructure and size distribution profile of human exosomes and contain the exosomal marker proteins CD9 and CD63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>), at a concentrating effect of ~500-fold, to a final concentration of ~2 × 10<sup>12</sup> exosomes/ml, representing an average recovery of 35%.</p>

<title>Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA)</title>
<p id="P19">Vesicle concentrations and size distribution profiles of exosome preparations were measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) using a NanoSight NS300 (Malvern Panalytical, United Kingdom) in 1x PBS clarified by filtration through a 0.22 μm sterile filtration unit. Measurements were carried out in triplicates at ambient temperature with fixed camera settings (level of 14, screen gain of 10, detection threshold 3, and temperature of 21.7-22.2 °C). Immunostaining nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) was performed using fluorescently labeled antibody conjugate directed against human CD63 (AlexaFluor488-conjugated clone 460305; R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, USA)). The fluorescently labeled anti-CD63-antibody (1 μl) was incubated with exosomes (9 μl) for 2 hours at room temperature in the dark, then diluted by addition of 1 ml of sterile-filtered PBS (Thermo Fisher, USA) and examined for exosome abundance, size, and CD63 immunoreactivity using a Particle Metrix ZetaView® TWIN device. Samples were visualized in scatter mode using the 488 nm laser and standard instrument settings (sensitivity: 80, shutter: 100, min. brightness: 30; min. area: 10; max. area: 1000) in fluorescence mode with standard fluorescence settings (sensitivity: 88, shutter: 100, min. brightness: 25; min. area: 10; max. area: 1000).

<title>Electron Microscopy and light microscopy</title>
<p id="P21">Exosomes were fixed by addition of formaldehyde to a final concentration of 4%. Carbon-coated grids were placed on top of a drop of the exosome suspension. Next, grids were placed directly on top of a drop of 2% uranyl acetate. The resulting samples were examined with a Tecnai-12 G2 Spirit Biotwin transmission electron microscope (John Hopkins University, USA). Fluorescence micrographs of Antares2 expression in transfected HEK293 cells were captured as PNG files using an EVOS M7000 microscope equipped with an Olympus UPlanSAPo 40x/0.95 objective.</p>

<title>ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific antibody responses</title>
<p id="P25">Mouse IgG antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 antigens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). For antigens S1 (RBD) and N, pre-coated ELISA plates from RayBiotech were utilized (IEQ-CoV S RBD-IgG; IEQ-CoVN-IgG), and the experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, with modification. Briefly, mouse plasmas at dilutions of 1:50 were added to antigen pre-coated wells in duplicates and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 2 hours on a shaker (200 rpm). The plates were washed 4 times with wash buffer followed by blocking for 2 hours at RT with 1% BSA in PBS. Mouse antibodies bound to the antigens coated on the ELISA plates were detected using HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson Immuno Research Inc.) Plates were washed 4 times with washing buffer, and developed using TMB substrate (RayBiotech). Microplate Reader was used to measure the absorbance at 650 nm (SpectraMaxID3, Molecular Devices, with SoftMax Pro7 software).</p>
