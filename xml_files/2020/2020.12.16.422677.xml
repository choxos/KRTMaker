<abstract>
<p id="P1">Compound repurposing is an important strategy for the identification of effective treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CL-Pro), also termed M-Pro, is an attractive drug target as it plays a central role in viral replication by processing the viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab at multiple distinct cleavage sites. We here report the results of a repurposing program involving 8.7 K compounds containing marketed drugs, clinical and preclinical candidates, and small molecules regarded as safe in humans. We confirmed previously reported inhibitors of 3CL-Pro, and have identified 62 additional compounds with IC<sub>50</sub> values below 1 μM and profiled their selectivity towards Chymotrypsin and 3CL-Pro from the MERS virus. A subset of 8 inhibitors showed anti-cytopathic effect in a Vero-E6 cell line and the compounds thioguanosine and MG-132 were analysed for their predicted binding characteristics to SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro. The X-ray crystal structure of the complex of myricetin and SARS-Cov-2 3CL-Pro was solved at a resolution of 1.77 Å, showing that myricetin is covalently bound to the catalytic Cys145 and therefore inhibiting its enzymatic activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with large (27-31 kb) single-stranded positive-sense RNA genomes. Genes encoding structural and accessory proteins are located at the 3' end which terminates with an UTR and a poly-A tail. The 5' end consists of a 5' cap structure and a non-coding region untranslated region (UTR) followed by open reading frames (ORF) coding for 14-16 non-structural proteins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Past outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome <italic>coronavirus</italic> (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have demonstrated the zoonotic potential of coronaviruses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was initially isolated and identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and within less than six months developed into a pandemic leading to severe impacts on global health and economic systems. To date (24.11.2020) WHO reports that 64 million people are infected and almost 1.5 million have died<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β-coronavirus genus of Coronaviridae family of the order Nidovirales<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. Non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 take up two thirds of the viral genome and are prominent targets for drugs modulating the replication machinery of the virus<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. This group includes viral replication and transcription enzymes (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp], helicase and 2'O-MTase), the papain-like protease (PLpro), as well as the 3C-like protease (3CL-Pro or M-Pro), the focus of this study.</p>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Role of 3CL-Pro and qualification as an antiviral target</title>
<p id="P3">As a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 uses cellular translation machinery directly after infection of the cell to produce viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. The generation of individual viral proteins involves proteolytic cleavage of 3CL-Pro and PLpro, whereby 3CL-Pro is cleaved auto catalytically from the polyprotein, before itself processing the 13 non-structural proteins which go on to initiate further viral replication<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, it plays a central role in progression of infection and generation of new viral particles. Structurally, the SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro forms a homodimer, wherein each monomer has three domains<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. Domains I (residues 8−100) and II (residues 101−183), are located at the N-terminal and are chymotrypsin-like, with six antiparallel beta-barrels forming the substrate binding site located in the cleft between them. Domain III (residues 200−303) at the C-term consists of five helices and is responsible for regulation of dimer formation. Domains I and II are connected to domain III through a loop structure (184 - 199). The active site of SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro is formed by a catalytic dyad of Cys-145 and His-41, which is uncommon for Cys protease family enzymes. In common with SARS-CoV 3CL-Pro, a water molecule forms a hydrogen bond with His-41 and can act as a third component in the active site<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. The SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro cleaves at least 11 sites in the polyproteins with preference for Leu-Gln↓(Ser, Ala, Gly) (↓ marks the cleavage position) and a high specificity for the Gln in P1 position, a function only shared with Enteroviruses. Sequence analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro shares 96.08 % and 87.00 % sequence identity with the 3CL-Pro of SARS-CoV and MERS, respectively<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. The similarity of active sites across the three viruses raises the possibility of successful inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro using compounds previously identified in studies on SARS-CoV and MERS and opportunities for identification of compounds with broad-spectrum activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Known inhibitors of 3CL-Pro, examples from SARS-CoV and MERS</title>
<p id="P4">Peptidomimetic inhibitors of several viral main proteases have previously been designed according to natural substrate sequences, in which the peptide bonds are chemically modified to be non-cleavable<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>, using designed chemical warheads including carbonyls, hydroxy- and chloromethyl ketones and di-keto moieties. These classes of inhibitors often contain a Michael acceptor moiety and act as reactive substrates. A prominent example is rupintrivir (AG7088), an irreversible inhibitor of the human rhinovirus (HRV) 3C protease, although it lacks activity against SARS-CoV 3CL-Pro, most probably due to the planar fluorophenylalanine at P2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. In general, this group of inhibitors exhibit limitations in some relevant medicinal chemistry and pharmacokinetic features such as half-life and stability in human plasma, as well as high binding to plasma proteins which serves to reduce their bioavailability. A second group of 3CL-Pro inhibitors are the alpha-ketoamides peptidomimetics which reversibly inhibit SARS-CoV 3CL-Pro through nucleophilic attachment of the catalytic cysteine to the alpha-keto group. Representatives of this group have been shown to inhibit the MERS 3CL-Pro at sub-micromolar, and SARS-CoV 3CL-Pro at low micromolar, concentrations<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. A third group is represented by non peptidic reversible inhibitors, among them benzoquinoline compounds, designed using computational modelling. The compounds contain two benzoquinolinones connected to N-phenyl tetrazole moiety through a sulphur atom. The binding mode is proposed to be based on formation of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interaction between the S1 and S2 side of 3CL-Pro and benzoquinolinones and N-phenyltetrazole groups, respectively<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. Pyrazoles have also been shown to inhibit the SARS-CoV 3CL-Pro, as well as 3CL-Pro of type 14 rhinovirus (<italic>RV14</italic>) at low micromolar level, raising the possibility for broad spectrum antiviral compounds to be identified<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">More recently, in vitro screening of compound libraries and molecular docking based on the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV and MERS 3CL-Pro has revealed inhibitors with potentially different modes of actions against the SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro. Among them are metal (zinc)-conjugates (e.g. zinc-pyrithione, PDB: 6YT8)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>, natural products of the isoflavone family <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup> (e.g. 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxy-2'-(3,3-dimethylallyl)-isoflavone), drug candidates (e.g. ebselen) and approved drugs (e.g. disulfiram and carmofur)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. To date, virtual screening of large libraries of compounds have been reported (extended list of references and data: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ghddi-ailab.github.io/Targeting2019-nCoV/computational/">https://ghddi-ailab.github.io/Targeting2019-nCoV/computational/</ext-link>) and several in-vitro screens have been published mainly in pre-print form against SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro<sup>

<title>Compound repurposing</title>
<p id="P6">In the case of emerging diseases, such as COVID-19, where limited therapeutic or prevention options in form of vaccine or prophylaxis exist, compound repurposing can allow for fast identification of drug candidates, if the selected therapeutics are efficacious, well-tolerated and have suitable safety profiles. Considerable additional insights into anti-Coronaviridae therapeutic discovery accumulated through past outbreaks of SARS-CoV (2002/2003) and MERS (2012) which informed multiple drug repurposing-based clinical studies following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Clinical trials with antivirals (lopinavir, ritonavir) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup> and antimalarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup> have yet to show consistent safety and efficacy. However, other studies including the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>, and the viral RNA-polymerase inhibitor remdesivir<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup> have led to regulatory approvals for their use in COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, more effective treatments are still required, in particular for patients at earlier stages of infection, where pharmacological interventions have not been approved so far. Classical antiviral drug development can take many years and need high financial investments. Therefore, repurposing of known drugs represents a cost and time saving alternative especially when combined with high-throughput screening against relevant disease models or target mechanisms as part of the candidate identification process.</p>
<p id="P7">Part of the response to the above need is the project (“EXaSCale smArt pLatform Against paThogEns for CoronaVirus – Exscalate4CoV or E4C”, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.exscalate4cov.eu">http://www.exscalate4cov.eu</ext-link>) which is funded through EU's H2020-SC1-PHE-CORONAVIRUS-2020 emergency call, (grant N. 101003551). It collects 18 European public Institutions and a private company (DOMPE SpA) in the leading role and brings together high-end computational facilities, drug discovery and BSL-3 high-throughput screening resources. The first aim of E4C is to identify repurposed candidates for a fast track entrance on clinical trials, and in a second phase to provide the foundation for a European platform for rapid response to pandemics with novel drug candidates. In this study, we report on identification of 3CL-Pro inhibitors using repurposed drugs and annotated preclinical compounds, together with a comparative discussion on similar results obtained by cheminformatics and structural biology approaches.</p>

<p id="P8">Results covering key SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro enzymatic properties are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Substrate turnover was directly proportional to enzyme concentrations up to 60 nM and assay incubation times up to 15 minutes post substrate addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>). The relative enzymatic activity was not influenced by the presence of DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), with Vmax = 63070 RFU/min in the presence of 1 mM DTT and 58111 RFU/min without DTT. The corresponding Km values were 18.8 μM with 1 mM DTT and 16.3 μM without DTT.

<title>Compound pre-incubation conditions</title>
<p id="P9">Reference inhibitors were calpeptin, a close analogue of GC376, and zinc pyrithione which binds the SARS-COV-2 3CL-Pro catalytic cysteine <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. The effects of time and temperature conditions during compound pre-incubation with SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro was determined. Compounds were pre-incubated with the enzyme for 15, 30 and 60 mins (at 25 °C and 20 μM concentration), before substrate addition. The inhibitory effect of zinc pyrithione increased with pre-incubation time, while calpeptin inhibition was unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Similarly, zinc pyrithione was 3-fold more potent after pre-incubation at 37 °C versus pre-incubation at 25 °C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). Therefore, to increase assay sensitivity the pre-incubation step in the screening protocol was performed for 60 min at 37 °C.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup> lost its inhibitory effects in the presence of DTT. Chlorhexidine, predicted by docking studies to bind SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>, was not an effective inhibitor at 20 μM concentration, regardless of DTT. The protease inhibitor, calpeptin<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>

Some 156 compounds showed a relative reduction in SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro inhibition of more than 30 % in the presence of 1 mM DTT, and these were designated as “DTT sensitive”.

The 2Fo-Fc map unambiguously shows that myricetin is covalently bound to the catalytic Cys145, with a bond length of 1.7 Å. The orientation found is determined in large part by the covalent bond between Cys145 sulphur and the 2' position of the flavonoid leading to unprecedented binding for a flavonoid scaffold. Consistent with the measured complex structure, the non-covalent in-silico docking calculations for myricetin docking led to a similar pose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, rhs). Moreover, the 2Fo-Fc map of the myricetin:MPro X-ray structure showed that the binding pocket is only partially occupied by myricetin, and voids are filled by solvent (ethylene glycol and water) molecules, signalling an opportunity for future structure-based drug design efforts.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P22">The protease 3CL-Pro is responsible for accurately processing the SARS CoV-2 polyprotein at 11 distinct cleavage sites. With the unique exception of the specificity for Gln in P1, the high number of different cleavage sites recognized suggests a certain degree of promiscuity with regard to cleavage site selectivity on other sub pockets. This is consistent both with the diversity of peptide-like compounds found as inhibitors so far and with recent comparison of crystal structures between the 3CL-Pro apo-form obtained at room temperature with the corresponding low-temperature apo- and inhibitor bound-forms, which show large changes in catalytic cavity dimensions upon ligand binding<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. Molecular dynamics simulations also predict high flexibility in solution, especially of the loop regions adjacent to binding sites<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. The protein is suggested to work as a dimer with N- and C-terminal regions of each monomer actively involved in ligand binding. The 3CL-Pro catalytic cavity includes four exposed cysteines, of which Cys145 appears predisposed to reacting with covalent ligands. This differs from other Cys-Proteases where a triad (Cys-His-Asp/Glu) is typically involved<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. In addition, there are also four exposed histidine residues which may be responsible for other 3CL-Pro biochemical characteristics observed in this study, including DTT sensitivity. These structural properties, combined with the absence of homologous human proteases, point towards anti-3CL-Pro compounds, alone or in combination with other therapies, as having the capacity to exert antiviral effects and thus be a potential treatment of COVID-19 infection.</p>

We reconfirmed the activity of published inhibitors including: TDZD-8, carmofur, tideglusib, ebselen, disulfiram and baicalein which gave IC<sub>50</sub>'s between 20 and 220 nM. Analogues of ebselen (IC<sub>50</sub> = 30nM) carrying the same N-phenyl-1,2-benzothiazol-3-ones scaffold, also stood out in the confirmed hit population and the preclinical compounds PD08290 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 20 nM), MLS0315771 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 20 nM), PBIT (IC<sub>50</sub> = 20 nM) and ML345 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 20 nM) showed higher potencies than ebselen itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). The 60 min preincubation time at 37°C facilitated the identification of slowly binding putative cysteine-reactive inhibitors.

<p id="P25">The lack of anti-CPE effect for the great majority of identified SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro inhibitors may be due to modest cell membrane permeability, poor metabolic stability or efflux effect from Vero-E6 cells which express PgP. A second possible reason might reside on the chemical reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro inhibitors within cells. For example, the antifungal phenylmercuric acetate (IC<sub>50</sub> = 10 nM) or anti-arthritis auranofin (IC<sub>50</sub> = 210 nM) both contain chemical moieties prone to react with nucleophiles such as mercury, zinc or gold<sup>

Recent interest as an anti-influenza agent has been raised for this molecule, although no further development has been recorded<sup>

<p id="P27">The presence of polyhydroxy phenolic moiety seems to provide some interaction advantages, as suggested by the reported SARS CoV-2 3CL-Pro crystal structure with baicalein (PDB: 6M2N).

Moreover, a similar ortho di-hydroxy phenol moiety is present in the dye haematoxylin (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.22 μM), dopamine receptor agonists apomorphine (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.52 μM), dihydrexidine (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.05 μM) and SKF-38393 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.63 μM) and lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.59 μM). Unfortunately, all these compounds showed DTT sensitivity, likely due to the high oxidation propensity of polyhydroxy phenols<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. For instance, two polyhydroxy phenol-containing compounds, myricetin and benserazide, have been successfully predicted to have nanomolar affinities based on structural modelling (J.

Polyhydroxy phenolic moieties are, however, considered promiscuous and are found as frequent hitters in large scale assessments of screening library performance<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>

This may not only be due to their redox features but also to the presence of a high number of closely arranged promiscuous hydrogen-bond acceptor/donor sites, which raises the number of protein 3D-pharmacophores satisfiable by such molecular structures. Notwithstanding, these “promiscuity” features, curcumin, benserazide, apomorphine, flavopiridol, anthracycline-based antibiotics and other products have reached approval for clinical use across several indications.</p>
<p id="P28">To visualize how hit compounds may bind to the protein, we exemplarily docked MG-132 and thioguanosine, the two molecules shown to inhibit viral CPE, into the main catalytic cavity of 3CL-Pro, as well as myricetin for which confirmatory structural information was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p id="P29">While for MG-132 the docking pose is straightforward, as many peptide-like structures are oriented in a similar direction, for the smaller and more compact thioguanosine the optimal pose was not as evident. The observation that corresponding compound guanosine did not exert the same inhibition potency in the screen, prompted us to focus on the sulphur atom. Through extensive DFT calculations we assessed that, in contrast to guanosine, the most probable tautomer for thioguanosine involves a thiol group rather than a thio-ketonic group (Supplementary modelling section). When docked this tautomer clearly shows its sulphur atom in proximity to the catalytic Cys145, allowing the ribose moiety to make hydrogen-bond interactions with Glu166 backbone atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). When in such high proximity, thiol-redox reactions to generate S-S species are possible, not only for thioguanosine but for the other potent sulphur-containing compounds which were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). Myricetin appears bound to 3CL-Pro in an opposite orientation to that previously seen with baicalein <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>

The unprecedented sulphur addition to 2' position of myricetin suggest the presence of a quinoid species apt to be attacked by a strong nucleophile with consequent oxidative loss of an electron or a hydride.

The hypothesized 3CL-Pro cavity flexibility could therefore reward smaller compounds compared to larger ones, either because the protease induced-fit requires more time to successfully complete, or because catalytic Cys145 needs more time to address adjacent electrophiles. In this direction structural differences in cavity binding between nanomolar and micromolar affinity ligands have been illuminating [J. Goosen et al. <italic>submitted</italic>].

<p id="P36">The detection of enzymatic activity of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro was performed under conditions similar to those reported by Zhang et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. Enzymatic activity was measured by a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), using the dual-labelled substrate, DABCYL-KTSAVLQ↓SGFRKM-EDANS (Bachem #4045664) containing a protease specific cleavage site after the Gln. In the intact peptide, EDANS fluorescence is quenched by the DABCYL group. Following enzymatic cleavage, generation of the fluorescent product was monitored (Ex/Em= 340/460 nm), (EnVision, Perkin Elmer). The assay buffer contained 20 mM Tris (pH 7.3), 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. The assay was established in an automated screening format, (384 well black microplates, Corning, #3820) and optimized with respect to assay volume, enzyme concentration, substrate concentration, incubation time and temperature, DMSO tolerance, response to inhibition with known compounds as zinc pyrithione <sup>

</sup> and the effects of reducing agents (DTT).</p>

<sec id="S28">
<title>Primary screen, hit confirmation and profiling</title>
<p id="P37">In the primary screen, test compounds (stock at 10 mM in 100 % DMSO), positive (zinc pyrithione (medchemexpress, #HY-B0572) 10 mM in 100 % DMSO) and negative (100 % DMSO) controls, were transferred to 384-well assay microplates by acoustic dispensing (Echo, Labcyte). Plate locations were: test compounds at 20 μM final (columns 1 to 22); positive control zinc pyrithione at 10 μM final (column 23); and negative control 0.2 % v/v (column 24). 5 μl of SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro stock (120 nM) in assay buffer were added to compound plates and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. After addition of 5 μl substrate (30 μM in assay buffer), the final concentrations were: 15 μM substrate; 60 nM SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro; 20 μM compound; and 0.2 % DMSO in a total volume of 10 μL/well. The fluorescence signal was then measured at 15 min and inhibition (%) calculated relative to controls (Envision, PerkinElmer). Results were normalized to the 100 % (positive control) and 0 % (negative control) inhibition. To flag possible optical interference effects, primary assay plates were also read 60 min after substrate addition, when the reaction was complete.</p>
<p id="P38">For Hit Confirmation (HC), the putative hits from the primary screen were picked and re-tested in the same primary assay format in triplicate at 20 μM compound. Confirmed compounds were then profiled in triplicate in 11 point concentration responses, starting from 20 μM top concentration with 1:2 dilution steps. Whilst the primary screening assay did not contain DTT, the HC and profiling steps were performed +/-DTT (@ 1 mM) to identify any DTT-dependent effects.</p>

<title>Selectivity assays (MERS 3CL-Pro and Chymotrypsin)</title>
<p id="P39">A MERS 3CL-Pro inhibition assay was performed to observe potential broad inhibition effects of compounds against related Coronaviruses. The substrate was identical to that used in the SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro primary assay. The assay buffer contained 20 mM Tris (pH 7.3), 100 mM NaCl and 1mM EDTA. Test compounds were pre-incubated with 2.1 μM of enzyme (2 μl) and 0.5% DMSO, for 60 minutes at 37 °C prior to addition of substrate to obtain a final concentration of 15 μM substrate and 20 μM test compound in a 20 μl total volume. The signal was monitored after 30 minutes of incubation. A dose response curve of the compound GC376 was used as a positive control<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup> and DMSO (0.5 % final) was used as a negative control. Although, showing low similarity to human proteases and being a cysteine protease, SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro is structurally related to the serine protease of the chymotrypsin family with a cysteine replacing the serine in the active site <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup>. Therefore, a Chymotrypsin activity assay kit (#K352-100, Biovision) was used according to manufacturer's instructions to profile the relative selectivity of confirmed Hits. Here, the assay buffer contained 1mM DTT, which was essential to observe chymotrypsin enzymatic activity. Cleaved substrate was detected at Ex/Em= 380/460 nm. The positive control (100 % inhibition) was nafamostat (final concentration 5 μM), and the negative control was DMSO at 0.5 %.</p>

<title>Anti-cytopathic effect and virus yield reduction assays</title>
<p id="P40">The CPE assay used the African green monkey kidney cell line (Vero-E6) which had previously been engineered to constitutively express GFP<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup>. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10 % foetal calf serum (FCS; Biowest), 0.075% Sodium Bicarbonate (7.5 % solution, Gibco) and 1x Pen-strep (Gibco) and kept under 5 % CO2 at 37 °C. Assay medium contained 2 % FCS. SARS-CoV-2 strain BetaCov/Belgium/GHB-03021/2020 recovered from a nasopharyngeal swab taken from an asymptomatic patient returning from Wuhan, China in the beginning of February 2020 was sequenced on a MinION platform (Oxford Nanopore). After serial passaging on Huh7 and Vero-E6 cells, infectious content of the virus stock was determined by titration on Vero-E6 cells using the Spearman-Kärber method. To measure inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect, 384-well plates (Greiner #781092) were spotted with test compounds using an acoustic dispenser (Echo, Labcyte) to yield 10 μM final concentration at 0.1 % DMSO in primary screening. The day before infection (Day -1), plates were equilibrated to room temperature and 30 μL of Vero-E6 EGFP cells were added to give 8,000 cells/well. On the day of infection (Day 0), plates were transported to the CAPS-IT robotic system for the addition of virus dilution (MOI = 0.001) using a liquid handler (EVO 100, Tecan) to a final well volume of 60 μl, and left for incubation at 37 °C, 5 % CO2. At four days post-infection, GFP signal was captured using wide field fluorescence imaging by exciting at 485-20 nm and emitting with the BGRFRN filter set. A 5 X objective captured 80 % of an entire well on a 384 plate at once. The optimal exposure time was determined based on fluorescence intensity and was set on 0.023 seconds. A 2x2 binning was used and autofocus plane count was reduced to increase image acquisition speed. An image analysis protocol was developed in-house by using the SpotDetector bioapplication (Cellomics, Thermofisher). After background reduction on the raw image files, a fixed fluorescent intensity threshold was determined for the identification of GFP cells. Afterwards, the total area (‘total amount of surface covered by fluorescent cells’) was calculated for the detected cells and compared to the positive (remdesivir 20 μM) and negative (DMSO) control. This parameter directly correlates to cell confluence. Compound profiling used the screening primary protocol as above, with compounds arrayed in 8 point concentration responses in triplicate (max 20 μM, 1:3 dilution steps). Assessment of the underlying cytotoxicity of the compounds was performed as described above in dose response but without virus infection and using Sodium-Selenite (20 μM final) as the cytotoxicity control.</p>
<p id="P41">For selected compounds, efficacy was verified in a virus yield reduction assay. Briefly, VeroE6 cells were seeded in a 96-well cell culture plate in a density of 40,000 cells per well. After 24 hours, compounds were added to the medium, starting at a highest concentration of 25 μM and then serially diluted 1:3 (8 steps). Each compound was carried out in duplicate. After two hours, cells were inoculated with virus (MOI = 0.1) and left for incubation. Two hours later, the virus-containing medium was washed away with PBS and replaced with fresh medium and compound. At two days post infection, cells were visually inspected for cytopathic effects and supernatant was collected in the lysis buffer. RNA extraction was carried out using the NucleoSpin kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to manufacturer's instructions. Subsequent RT-qPCR was performed on a LightCycler96 platform (Roche) based on SARS-CoV-2 N gene RNA amplification using forward (5'-GACCCCAAAATCAGCGAAAT) and reverse (5'-TCTGGTTACTGCCAGTTGAATCTG) primers and probe (5'-FAM-ACCCCGCATTACGTTTGGTGGACC-BHQ1) designed by CDC (United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Standard of infectious virus with a known titer was used to quantify the amount of viral RNA (vRNA) as TCID50 (50 % tissue culture infectious dose) per mL. Effect of the compound was expressed as log reduction of vRNA.</p>
