The study was aimed to observe the current sero-prevalence status of MERS-CoV, assess the presence of active cases through detection RNA Viral particle and investigate possible risk factors of MERS-CoV in camels. A total of 589 sera were collected and tested with indirect Enzyme linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (iELISA).</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Result</title><p id="P2">The overall seroprevalance of MERS-CoV was 87.3% (n=514/589, 95% CI: 84.5-89.9). Association of different risk factors with seroprevalance revealed that origin (X<sup>2</sup>=13.39,P=0.001), sex (X<sup>2</sup>=4.5 P=0.034), age ((X<sup>2</sup>=185.7, P=0.001) season (X<sup>2</sup>=41.7, P=0.000) and reproduction status (X<sup>2</sup>=96.1, P=0.001) displayed a statistical significant difference among the groups (P&lt;0.05) while herd size did not show a Significant difference among groups (p&gt;0.05). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, age (OR=7.39, 95% CI:3.43-15.91), season (OR=4.83, 95% CI:-2.14-10.90), and in adult female camel reproduction status (OR=7.39,95% CI:3.43-15.91) showed statistically significant difference among the groups for MERS CoV antibody detection while risk factors of origin, animal sex and herd size difference were statistically insignificant. A total of 857 nasal swab samples were collected for the detection of MERS-CoV RNA particle. However, all swab samples tested by Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique were Negative for the virus.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P3">In conclusion, the present study revealed a high seroprevalance of MERS CoV in adult camels. However, in spite of high seroprevalance the lack of any RNA viral particle in the study suggests the need for further in depth longitudinal study to detect the circulating virus focusing on juveniles and young camels whereby seroprevalance of antibody is low when compared with adult camel in order to get the active virus before the camel develop antibody. Moreover, the zoonotic significance and potential transmission routes of MERS CoV to pastoral communities should also be investigated and design strategy for the preparedness in control of the diseases in Ethiopia.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Afar</kwd><kwd>Amibara</kwd><kwd>Camel</kwd><kwd>Cross sectional</kwd><kwd>Ethiopia</kwd><kwd>MERS-CoV</kwd><kwd>Sero prevalence</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S4" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">The one-humped camel (<italic>Camelus dromedaries</italic>) is an important livestock species exceptionally adapted to hot, dry and harsh environment due to heat and water deprivation tolerance. These tolerances in camels appear to be due to behavioral response that reduces heat absorption, a relatively efficient sweating mechanism for heat dissipation, an ability to reduce fecal and urine water loss and the ability vary body temperature substantially. It is used for milk and meat production, transportation, and draught power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Camels are widely distributed in Ethiopian lowlands especially in Afar, Somali and Oromia region where by pastoralism is the dominant mode of life and mobility is an inherent strategy to efficiently utilize the spatially and temporally distributed pasture and water resources. Usually, large numbers of camels and other domestic animals from many different herds/flocks congregate at watering sites, and this may create a perfect condition for disease transmission and spread among animals. The same water sources are also shared by multitudes of wild animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. According to CSA 2016/17 report, the camel population of dromedaries in Ethiopia is estimated to be about 1,209,321. Afar region has 474,146 camels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory diseases within the largest group of Corona viruses (CoVs) belonging to Nidovirale order which includes Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae and Ronaviridae families. The coronavirinae are further divide into four groups the alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronaviruses. MERS CoV is within beta corona virus group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Dromedary camels are sturdily suspected of acting as a zoonotic source for human cases of MERS-CoV, by either direct contact through droplet infection via mucous membranes or indirect contact through milk, meat or urine. According to, Miguel <italic>et al.</italic>, (2016) five major points reason out accounts that suggest dromedary camels can play an important role in the epidemiology of MERS-CoV, possibly as a reservoir host:</p><list list-type="bullet" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P6">Corona-viruses are widespread in the animal kingdom (in bats and livestock), but MERS-CoV does not infect many of the hosts (e.g. sheep, goats, cattle, chickens, water buffaloes, birds, horses and) whereas high levels of sero positivity have been observed in dromedary camelids, ranging from 0% in Asia to as much as 100% in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula (with mean of 79%);</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P7">The Mers-Cov isolated from dromedaries are genetically and phenotypically very similar to those infecting humans;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P8">Retrospective serological studies in Africa going back more than 30 years indicate long-term circulation of the virus in dromedary camels;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P9">Infection in dromedaries causes no or only mild respiratory symptoms, making it difficult to detect;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P10">Mers-Cov genome has likely undergone numerous recent recombination’, which suggests frequent co-infection, probably in camels, with distinct lineages of Mers-Cov [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p></list-item></list><p id="P11">Studies have demonstrated that dromedary camels can act as a source of human MERS-CoV infection. Indeed, the current state of knowledge indicates that dromedary camels are the only animal species for which there is convincing evidence that they act as host species for Mers-Cov and hence a potential source of human infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].Nonetheless, the route of infection of MERS CoV and types of exposures remain largely unknown, and only a small proportion of the primary cases have reported contact with camels. Other possible sources and vehicles of infection include food-borne transmission such as unpasteurized camel milk and raw meat, and medicinal use of camel urine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Clearly, transmission from camels to humans does take place, and camel exposure is a risk factor for human infection, but such transmission is not efficient and infection is not directly proportional to exposure while in the other hand, many patients with clinically diagnosed MERS did not have an obvious history of direct exposure to camels or their products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P12">Researchers found high percentages of animals sampled from Nigeria and Ethiopia being seropositive for Mers-Cov with an overall seropositivity of 94% in adult dromedaries in Nigeria and 93% and 97% for juvenile and adult animals, respectively, in Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. More recently, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]other researchers displayed a high seropositivity of 99.4% in camel of Ethiopia and also relatively higher Mers-Cov RNA detection in Ethiopia (15.7%) than in Burkina Faso (12.2%) and Morocco (7.6%).

In Ethiopia, a high seroprevalance of MERS-CoV in camel have been reported ranging from 93-97% in pastoral camel rearing areas of the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. In the current study, a high prevalence of MERS-CoV with 87.3% (n=514/589), (95% <italic>CI: 84.5-89.9</italic>) was observed in camels of Amibara district, Afar Region.

The high prevalence in autumn was due to gathering of camels at one place for prolonged period for the reason that camels are getting sufficient vegetation and grass. For this reason there had been high probability of infection and which induces he development of natural infection antibody. In winter the prevalence is low due to camels are dispersing far places in search of feed and water due to scarce of feed at one place. In this season the possibility of close contact and getting the disease through aerosol and developing antibody is limited.</p><p id="P25">Regarding seasonal factors, high seroprevalance was recorded in Autumn (September, October and November) in which prevalence was recorded (n=260/272) (95.5%), subsequent winter Dry season (December, January and February) with prevalence of (n=79/88) (89.7%) and then the relatively low prevalence was seen in summer (n=174/229) (75.98%).
