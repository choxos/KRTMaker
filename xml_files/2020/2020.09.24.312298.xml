<abstract>
<p id="P2">The <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> are a family of viruses that causes disease in humans ranging from mild respiratory infection to potentially lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome. Finding host factors that are common to multiple coronaviruses could facilitate the development of therapies to combat current and future coronavirus pandemics. Here, we conducted parallel genome-wide CRISPR screens in cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 as well as two seasonally circulating common cold coronaviruses, OC43 and 229E. This approach correctly identified the distinct viral entry factors ACE2 (for SARS-CoV-2), aminopeptidase N (for 229E) and glycosaminoglycans (for OC43). Additionally, we discovered phosphatidylinositol phosphate biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis as critical host pathways supporting infection by all three coronaviruses. By contrast, the lysosomal protein TMEM106B appeared unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol phosphate biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis reduced replication of all three coronaviruses. These findings offer important insights for the understanding of the coronavirus life cycle as well as the potential development of host-directed therapies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">The <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family includes seven known human pathogens, for which there are no approved vaccines and only limited therapeutic options. The seasonally circulating human coronaviruses (HCoV) OC43, HKU1, 229E and NL63 cause mild, common cold-like, respiratory infections in humans <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. However, three highly pathogenic coronaviruses emerged in the last two decades, highlighting the pandemic potential of this viral family <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death, with fatality rates between 10-40% <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2, which is currently causing a global pandemic, is less deadly but far more transmissible than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and has been responsible for over 32 million cases and 900,000 deaths globally so far <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. Because of the severity of their impact on global health, it is critical to understand how SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses hijack the host cell machinery during infection, and apply this knowledge to develop new therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p id="P4">Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with a genome length of approximately 30kb. Upon receptor binding and membrane fusion, the viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm, where it is translated to produce viral proteins. Subsequently, the viral replication/transcription complexes form on double-membrane vesicles and generate genome copies. These are then packaged into new virions via a budding process, through which they acquire the viral envelope, and the resulting virions are released from infected cells <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. During these steps, specific cellular proteins are hijacked and play crucial roles in the viral life cycle. For example, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is exploited as the viral entry receptor for HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. Additionally, cellular proteases, such as TMPRSS2, cathepsin L and furin, are important for the cleavage of the viral spike (S) protein of several coronaviruses, thereby mediating efficient membrane fusion with host cells <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Systematic studies have illuminated virus-host interactions during the later steps of the viral life cycle. For example, proteomics approaches revealed a comprehensive interactome between individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins and cellular proteins <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. Additionally, biotin labelling identified candidate host factors based on their proximity to coronavirus replicase complexes <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. While these studies uncovered physical relationships between viral and cellular proteins, they do not provide immediate information about the importance of these host components for viral replication.</p>
<p id="P5">An orthogonal strategy is to screen for mutations that render host cells resistant to viral infection using CRISPR-based mutagenesis. These screens identify host factors that are functionally required for virus replication and could be targets for host-directed therapies <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. Several groups have already successfully applied this approach, yet with certain limitations, e.g. the use of Vero green monkey cells instead of a human cell line <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>, the use of a small CRISPR library only based on the SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>, or the use of a SARS-CoV-2 harboring a deletion in the spike S1/S2 site due to cell culture adaptation <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">In this study, we have performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout (KO) screen using wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (USA/WA-1 isolate) in human cells. Importantly, we expanded our functional genomics approach to distantly related <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> in order to probe for commonalities and differences across the family. This strategy can reveal potential pan-coronavirus host factors, thus illuminating targets for antiviral therapy to combat current and potential future outbreaks. We conducted comparative CRISPR screens for SARS-CoV-2 and two seasonally circulating common cold coronaviruses, OC43 and 229E. Our results corroborate previously implicated host pathways, uncover new aspects of virus-host interaction and identify targets for host-directed antiviral treatment.</p>

<title>CRISPR knockout screens identify common and virus-specific candidate host factors for coronavirus infection</title>
<p id="P7">Phenotypic selection of virus-resistant cells in a pooled CRISPR KO screen is based on survival and growth differences of mutant cells upon virus infection. We chose Huh7.5.1 hepatoma cells as they were uniquely susceptible to all tested coronaviruses. We readily observed drastic cytopathic effect during OC43 and 229E infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Huh7.5.1 also supported high levels of SARS-CoV-2 replication but only displayed limited virus-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b,c</xref>). To improve selection conditions for the SARS-CoV-2 CRISPR screen, we overexpressed ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2, which are present at low levels in WT Huh7.5.1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>). This led to increased viral uptake of a SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentivirus, confirming the important function of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for SARS-CoV-2 entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). We ultimately used Huh7.5.1 cells harboring a bicistronic ACE2-IRES-TMPRSS2 construct for the SARS-CoV-2 screen as these cells sustained efficient infection that led to widespread cell death, while still allowing the survival of a small number of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">The three CRISPR screens - for resistance to SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 - identified a compendium of critical host factors across the human genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Importantly, the known viral entry receptors ranked among the top hits: ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 and aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) for 229E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. OC43, unlike the other coronaviruses, does not have a known proteinaceous receptor but primarily depends on sialic acid or glycosaminoglycans for cell entry <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>; consistent with this fact, multiple heparan sulfate biosynthetic genes (B3GALT6, B3GAT3, B4GALT7, EXT1, EXT2, EXTL3, FAM20B, NDST1, SLC35B2, UGDH, XYLT2) were identified in our OC43 screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). Several of these genes were also markedly enriched in the SARS-CoV-2 screen, consistent with a recent report that SARS-CoV-2 requires both ACE2 and cellular heparan sulfate for efficient infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. Overall, the identification of the expected entry factors validates the phenotypic selection of our host factor screens.</p>
<p id="P9">Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis found a number of cellular processes to be important for multiple coronaviruses. These included proteoglycan and aminoglycan biosynthesis, vacuolar and lysosomal transport, autophagy, Golgi vesicle transport and phosphatidylinositol metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). In the phosphatidylinositol metabolic process, the SARS-CoV-2 screen identified VAC14, which is part of the PIKfyve kinase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). PIKFYVE itself was moderately enriched in the SARS-CoV-2 screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). This complex catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate to phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate, which is localized to late endosomes <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. Interestingly, the CRISPR screens with HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 identified the subunits (PIK3C3, UVRAG, BECN1 and PIK3R4) of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, which generates the precursor phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate in early endosome membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. Taken together, our data highlight different steps of the phosphatidylinositol biosynthetic pathway, which regulates endocytic sorting, endomembrane homeostasis and autophagy, to be critical for the life cycle of all three and possibly all coronaviruses.</p>
<p id="P10">Another group of genes found in all three CRISPR screens are linked to cholesterol metabolism. The SARS-CoV-2 resistant cell population contained multiple knockouts in genes of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) pathway (SCAP, MBTPS1, MBTPS2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. SCAP is an escort protein for the transport of the transcription factors SREBF1 and SREBF2 from the ER to the Golgi in response to low levels of cholesterol. In the Golgi, the SREBF proteins are sequentially cleaved by the proteases MBTPS1 and MBTPS2. Subsequently, the transcription factors translocate to the nucleus to activate fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. SREBF1 and SREBF2 themselves did not score in the screen, potentially due to their functional redundancy. LDLR (Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor), important for cholesterol uptake, was also enriched in both the SARS-CoV-2 and the 229E screen, while SCAP was enriched in the OC43 screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Additionally, NPC1 (Niemann–Pick intracellular cholesterol transporter 1), which facilitates export of cholesterol from the endolysosomal compartment, ranked highly in the 229E screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. Overall, our data indicates a strong link between intracellular cholesterol levels and infection by all three coronavirus.</p>
<p id="P11">Some genes were found in the OC43 and 229E screens, but not in the SARS-CoV-2 screen. For instance, the common cold coronavirus screens showed a strong overlap of genes, which are important for endosome and autophagosome maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). These include the small GTPase Rab7a, components of the HOPS complex (VPS11, VPS16, VPS18, VPS33A), the Ccz1-Mon1 guanosine exchange complex (CCZ1, CCZ1B, C18orf8), the WDR81-WDR91 complex, and other genes related to lysosome and autophagosome function (SPNS1, TOLLIP, TMEM41B, AMBRA1) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>. We also identified cathepsin L (CTSL1) as well as the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) and GNPTAB, which are important for proper trafficking of lysosomal enzymes from the trans-Golgi network <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>. Interestingly, the HOPS complex, cathepsins, GNPTAB and SPNS1 were previously linked to Ebola virus entry, implying similar viral entry strategies <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P12">The absence of endolysosomal factors in the SARS-CoV-2 screen may be explained by the ectopic expression of the cell-surface protease TMPRSS2 in this screen. The cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 spike can occur either at the plasma membrane via TMPRSS2 or in endolysosomes through cathepsins. Sufficient TMPRSS2 levels may thus ablate the requirement for cathepsin and other factors linked to endolysosomal activity <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. Consistent with this hypothesis, a CRISPR screen using a SARS-CoV-2 with a spike S1/S2 site deletion, which preferentially uses the endolysosomal entry route, showed strong enrichment in RAB7A, the Ccz1-Mon1 guanosine exchange complex, the HOPS complex and the WDR81-WDR91 complex, similar to the OC43 and 229E screen results <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. This suggests that endolysosomal host factors can be required for infection under certain conditions but may become largely dispensable for SARS-CoV-2, especially in TMPRSS2-expressing cell types. As nasal and lung epithelial cells can express high levels of TMPRSS2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup>, we speculate that the genes identified in the SARS-CoV-2 CRISPR screen using Huh7.5.1-ACE2-IRES-TMPRSS2 cells may represent rate-limiting factors that are more physiologically relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection <italic>in vivo</italic> than the endolysosomal components found in our other two screens and in other studies.</p>
<p id="P13">The OC43 and 229E screens also uncovered KEAP1, the principal negative regulator of NRF2, whose activation restores cellular redox and protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup>. Activation of the NRF2 transcriptional program may induce a cellular state that is protective against coronavirus infection. Indeed, NRF2 agonists seem to elicit an antiviral response as demonstrated in cell culture and were proposed for SARS-CoV-2 treatment <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P14">In addition to genes that scored in multiple CRISPR screens, we also found genes that were only enriched in one screen. Several genes related to the Golgi apparatus were uncovered only in the 229E screen and may possibly have 229E-specific roles. Among them were GPR89A and GPR89B, which encode two highly homologous G protein coupled receptors important for Golgi acidification <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
</sup>, and NBAS and USE1, which play a role in Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup>. The exact role of these factors in coronavirus infection – and their specificity to 229E – remain to be determined.</p>
<p id="P15">The SARS-CoV-2 screen identified multiple subunits of the exocyst (EXOC1-8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>), an octameric protein complex that facilitates the tethering of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane prior to SNARE-mediated fusion <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
</sup>. This complex could therefore facilitate trafficking of virus particles during entry or egress. The top hit of the SARS-CoV-2 screen was TMEM106B, a poorly characterized lysosomal transmembrane protein linked to frontotemporal dementia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>. Deletions in TMEM106B caused defects in lysosome trafficking, impaired acidification and reduced levels of lysosomal enzymes but its precise molecular function remains enigmatic <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>
</sup>. TMEM106B KO could thus indirectly affect SARS-CoV-2 entry, although it is also possible that SARS-CoV-2 physically interacts with TMEM106B, for example as lysosomal receptor, similar to NPC1 and LAMP1 for Ebola and Lassa virus, respectively <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P16">Overall, the comparative CRISPR screen strategy provides a rich list of shared and distinct candidate host factors for subsequent validation and host-directed inhibition of coronavirus infection.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Network propagation across multiple CRISPR screens highlights functional biological clusters important for coronavirus infection</title>
<p id="P17">To better understand the functional connections between the genes identified in our screens, we performed network propagation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>
</sup>. This approach integrates large datasets using networks, thereby identifying subnetworks and pathways that are common across datasets. Propagations from the three CRISPR screens identified subnetworks most common to all three viruses and independently confirmed the biological processes highlighted as important for coronavirus infection in our previous analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">3</xref>). For instance, we found clusters linked to cholesterol metabolism (containing SCAP, MBTPS1, SREBF2, LDLR and NPC1), endosome to lysosome transport (including the HOPS complex components VPS11, VPS16, VPS18, VPS33A and VPS39) and glycoprotein biosynthetic processes (containing heparan sulfate biosynthesis genes). Another cluster reflected the critical role of autophagy/ phospholipid metabolism and indicated a functional link between VAC14 and subunits of the PI3K complex as described above.</p>
<p id="P18">Moreover, network propagation also identified previously unappreciated biological functions, such as steroid hormone signaling, cell-cell adhesion, metal ion transport, intra-Golgi vesicle transport, snare complex assembly, Rab protein signal transduction, peroxisomal transport and mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">3</xref>). Altogether, network propagation revealed numerous distinct cellular processes that may have critical roles during coronavirus infection.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Knockout of candidate host factor genes reduces coronavirus replication</title>
<p id="P19">To validate the candidate genes from the SARS-CoV-2 screen, we generated individual KO cells in two cell types. We first introduced gene deletions for several top hits in A549 lung epithelial cells transduced with ACE2 (A549-ACE2) using Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels were markedly reduced in cells that contained indel mutations in ACE2, the ADP Ribosylation Factor 5 (ARF5), multiple subunits of the exocyst (EXOC2/6/8), the cholesterol homeostasis genes SCAP, MBTPS1 and MBTPS2, the phosphatidylinositol kinase complex components PIKFYVE and VAC14, as well as TMEM106B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Additionally, we generated clonal Huh7.5.1 cells (without the ACE2-IRES-TMPRSS2 construct) harboring frameshift mutations in a subset of the same genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>). Deletion of TMEM106B and VAC14 decreased SARS-CoV-2 replication, and this effect was reversed by cDNA complementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>), thus confirming the role of these two factors in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Similarly, knocking out SCAP, MBTPS2 or EXOC2 led to a decrease of SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). When we infected the same Huh7.5.1 KO cells with HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, we observed reduced viral replication in SCAP and MBTPS2 KO cells, but not in TMEM106B KO and only moderately in VAC14 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). This suggests that the latter genes are more rate-limiting in SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P20">Finally, we probed cells lacking several genes involved in endosome maturation or the PI3K complex, which were initially found in the common cold coronavirus screens. We saw reduced viral replication for OC43 and 229E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f,g</xref>). Additionally, we observed increased cell viability in all KO cells relative to WT Huh7.5.1 cells 8 dpi, indicating that endosome maturation is important for infection by the common cold viruses and for virus-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). Next, we tested whether the hits shared between OC43 and 229E might also affect SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infection also depended on endosomal factors in the context of Huh7.5.1 without ACE2-IRES-TMPRSS2, similar to the common cold coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). Additionally, deletions of the PI3K subunits, in particular PIK3R4 KO, led to a strong decrease in replication of all three coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). Together, these experiments confirm that the host factors identified in our screens have functional roles for <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> and demonstrate that important aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology can be revealed by studying the common cold coronaviruses.</p>

<title>Compounds directed at host factors inhibit coronavirus replication</title>
<p id="P21">Host factors important for virus infection are potential targets for antiviral therapy. Host-directed therapy is advantageous as it allows pre-existing drugs to be repurposed, it may provide broad-spectrum inhibition against multiple viruses, and it is generally thought to be more refractory to viral escape mutations than drugs targeting viral factors <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup>. We therefore explored whether the cellular pathways identified in our screens could serve as targets for therapy against coronavirus infection.</p>
<p id="P22">Given the strong dependence of all three coronaviruses on PIK3R4, we tested SAR405, a selective and ATP-competitive inhibitor of class III PI3K (PIK3C3) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>. The drug exhibited a dose-dependent effect against all three coronaviruses with low cytotoxicity, consistent with the reduced virus replication in PIK3R4 KO cells, and suggesting that it could serve as a pan-coronavirus inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). As VAC14, a PIKfyve complex component, was a strong hit in the SARS-CoV-2 screen, we also tested the PIKfyve inhibitor YM201636 and observed inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>
</sup>. Similar antiviral activity was previously demonstrated with apilimod, another PIKfyve inhibitor <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P23">Furthermore, we tested compounds modulating cholesterol homeostasis as this pathway appeared important for all three coronaviruses as well. PF-429242, a reversible, competitive aminopyrrolidineamide inhibitor of MBTPS1 showed dose-dependent reduction of SARS-CoV-2 replication with cytotoxicity only at high concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>
</sup>. Fatostatin, which binds to SCAP and inhibits ER-to-Golgi translocation of SREBPs, also moderately reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection levels at higher doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>
</sup>. The two cholesterol modulating compounds also led to a decrease in OC43 and 229E levels, suggesting that modulation of intracellular cholesterol levels could be used as pan-coronavirus treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Therefore, our genetic and pharmacological data suggest that both phosphatidylinositol kinase complexes and cholesterol homeostasis are potential targets for pan-coronavirus host-directed therapy in vitro and may be explored further in vivo.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P24">In this study, we performed genome-scale CRISPR KO screens to identify host factors important for SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. Our data highlight that while the three coronaviruses exploit distinct entry factors, they also depend on a convergent set of host pathways, with potential roles for the entire <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family. In particular, genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis were enriched in all screens and in the network propagation. Consistent with our data, two SARS-CoV-2 interactomes revealed binding of viral proteins to SCAP, and a recent CRISPR screen focused on the interactome components also identified SCAP as a host factor critical for SARS-CoV-2 replication <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>; given the essentiality of SCAP for replication, viral proteins are likely to positively regulate SCAP activity and cholesterol levels. Cellular cholesterol homeostasis has previously been linked to viral entry and membrane fusion in the context of bunya- and hantavirus infections, suggesting a pro-viral function across different viral families <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>
</sup>. Consistent with this hypothesis, treatment with 25-hydroxycholesterol, which blocks SREBP processing and stops cholesterol synthesis, reduced infection with SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped viruses <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P25">Additionally, phosphatidylinositol biosynthesis was uncovered as an important pathway for coronavirus infection. While PIKfyve has previously been implicated through chemical inhibition <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>
</sup>, we identified the upstream PI3K complex as a new critical host factor, potentially exhibiting pan-coronavirus function. Due to its involvement in multiple cellular processes including vesicular trafficking and autophagy <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>, it remains to be determined whether coronaviruses hijack this pathway during entry or for the generation of double-membrane vesicles required for the viral replication/transcription complexes.</p>
<p id="P26">Our results also inform those of a recent drug repurposing screen, which identified ~100 compounds that inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>
</sup>; notably, among those were PIKfyve inhibitors, protease inhibitors and modulators of cholesterol homeostasis. Our functional genomics data therefore suggest that the observed effects of several compounds were possibly due to inhibition of critical host factors.</p>
<p id="P27">In conclusion, our study offers important insight into host pathways commonly hijacked by coronaviruses. Importantly, the identification of the phosphatidylinositol PIK3C3 kinase complex as a potent therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 based on the 229E and OC43 screens underscores the value of the parallel CRISPR screening approach for finding novel therapies against SARS-CoV-2 and other <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>.</p>

To generate CRISPR KO libraries, a total of 240 million Huh7.5.1-Cas9-blast or Huh7.5.1-Cas9-blast+ACE2-IRES-TMPRSS2-hygro cells were transduced with lentivirus of the human GeCKO v2 library (Addgene, #1000000049, gift from Feng Zhang) at a moi of 0.4 and subsequently selected using puromycin and expanded for 7 days. A total of 60 million mutagenized cells for each GeCKO sublibrary (A and B) were collected for genomic DNA extraction to assess the sgRNA representation of the starting population. For the SARS-CoV-2 CRISPR host factor screen, 100 million cells of Huh7.5.1-Cas9-blast+ACE2-IRES-TMPRSS2-hygro GeCKO library cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 0.01.

<p id="P37">We performed three independent propagations, one for each CRISPR dataset (i.e. each virus). After propagation, each propagated network was integrated by multiplying gene-wise. Such an operation is used to create a gene list ranked to prioritize genes with high scores from all propagated datasets. To control for nodes with high degree (i.e. many connections), which due to their heightened connectivity are biased to receive higher propagation scores, we conducted a permutation test. Specifically, we simulated random propagations by shuffling the positive scores to random genes, repeating this 20,000 times per CRISPR screen. Next, we calculated an empirical p-value by calculating the fraction of random propagation runs greater than or equal to the true propagation run for each gene.</p>

<title>Genome-wide CRISPR KO screens in human cells identify host factors important for infection by for SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43.</title>
<p>
<bold>(a)</bold> Schematic of CRISPR KO screens for the identification of coronavirus host factors. Huh7.5.1-Cas9 (with bicistronic ACE2-IRES-TMPRSS2 construct for SARS-CoV-2 and without for 229E and OC43 screen) were mutagenized using a genome-wide sgRNA library. Mutant cells were infected with each coronavirus separately and virus-resistant cells were harvested 10-14 days post infection (dpi). The abundance of each sgRNA in the starting and selected population was determined by high-throughput sequencing and a gene enrichment analysis was performed. <bold>(b-d)</bold> Gene enrichment of CRISPR screens for <bold>(b)</bold> SARS-CoV-2, <bold>(c)</bold> 229E and <bold>(d)</bold> OC43 infection. Enrichment scores were determined by MaGECK analysis and genes were colored by biological function. The SARS-CoV-2 was performed once. The 229E and OC43 screens were performed twice and combined MaGECK scores are displayed.</p>

<bold>(a)</bold> Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed on significant hits from the individual CRISPR screens (MaGECK enrichment score &lt;= 0.005). P values were calculated by hypergeometric test and a false-discovery rate was used to account for multiple hypothesis testing. The top GO terms of each screen were selected for visualization. <bold>(b)</bold> Data integration pipeline for network propagation of identified host factor genes. Unthresholded positive enrichment scores served as initial gene labels for network propagation using Pathway Commons. Separately propagated networks were integrated gene-wise (via multiplication) to identify biological networks that are shared between all three datasets. Genes found to be significant in the propagation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>) were extracted, clustered into smaller subnetworks, and annotated using GO enrichment analysis. <bold>(c)</bold> Selected biological subnetwork clusters from network propagation. Cluster title indicates the most significant biological function(s) for each cluster. Circle size represents p-value from network propagation permutation test (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). The original positive enrichment score of a gene in each CRISPR screen is indicated by color scale within the circle. The entire set of identified clusters is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>. (#) is the cluster number, which refers to the enrichment analysis of biological processes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>For all experiments, compounds were added simultaneously with virus. Viral RNA was quantified after 24 hpi (SARS-CoV-2) or 48hpi (229E and OC43) using RT-qPCR and normalized to RnaseP (SARS-CoV-2) or 18S RNA (229E and OC43). Values represent means ± s.e.m. relative to DMSO treated cells. For cell viability, datasets represent means ± s.d. and values are relative to DMSO treated uninfected controls. Non-linear curves were fitted with least squares regression using GraphPad Prism 8 and IC<sub>50</sub> was determined for (a-c). All experiments were performed in 3 biological replicates.</p>
