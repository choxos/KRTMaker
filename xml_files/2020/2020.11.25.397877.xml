Early studies helped to identify distinctions between GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes allocated within specific functional circuits, but their contribution to the changing dynamics of a microcircuit remains unclear. Here, using the whisker-barrel system in mouse, we assessed the contribution of specific synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes and gephyrin scaffolding changes to sensory processing <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Sensory information is processed in a selective manner and is encoded sparsely. The rodent whisker system is a well-established model to study how sensory perception is encoded within organized barrel cortex columns. A whisker deflection leads to depolarization in the majority of neurons, but only around 10% of these neurons respond with action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Crochet et al. 2011</xref>). In layer 2/3 (L2/3) of the barrel cortex, the excitability of a cortical microcircuit is tightly modulated by inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kapfer et al. 2007</xref>). The excitatory neurons outnumber GABAergic interneurons within the neocortex, although precise numbers vary across different cortical areas and layers. Despite this disparity in excitatory and inhibitory neuron numbers, the probability of finding excitatory-excitatory connections between 2 pyramidal neurons in supragranular layers is relatively low, whereas the connectivity between pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons is much higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Holmgren et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lefort et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Avermann et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Petersen 2019</xref>). Hence, GABAergic interneurons play a crucial role in controlling the activity of the pyramidal neurons within a cortical microcircuit in the superficial layers.</p><p id="P4">At the postsynaptic sites, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs), its main scaffolding protein, gephyrin, and their associated signaling proteins facilitate downstream signal transduction to modulate pyramidal cell excitability. The importance of GABA for cortical plasticity has been reported for the barrel cortex function, while the molecular mechanisms underlying plasticity changes at GABAergic synapses remain unclear. A local infusion of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist gabazine leads to increased spontaneous depolarization of L2/3 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gentet et al. 2010</xref>). GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are assembled from a heterogeneous gene pool to form pentameric ion channels. These GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes that constitute the GABA<sub>A</sub>R pentamers also exhibit distinct expression patterns within a given brain circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fritschy and Panzanelli 2014</xref>). GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes are also uniquely localized within different cortical layers. The α1 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (α1-GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) are more uniformly distributed across all six cortical layers, whereas the α2 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are abundantly expressed in the supragranular layers (layer 1, 2 and 3), and the α3 subunit containing-GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are more abundant in layers five and six (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fritschy and Mohler 1995</xref>). Hence, this spatial segregation of GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes implies that distinct functional roles exist for GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes within the somatosensory cortex.</p><p id="P5">GABA<sub>A</sub>R synaptic localization is facilitated by diverse receptor-interacting proteins that include neuroligin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Fritschy, Panzanelli, and Tyagarajan 2012</xref>), collybistin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">deGroot et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hines et al. 2018</xref>), and gephyrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Tyagarajan and Fritschy 2014</xref>). Among these proteins, gephyrin is unique because it aids activity-dependent adaptations at GABAergic synapses over different time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Battaglia et al. 2018</xref>). Many signaling pathways converge onto the gephyrin scaffold and in turn induce various post-translational modifications (PTMs) on gephyrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Zita et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kuhse et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Dejanovic and Schwarz 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dejanovic et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Ghosh et al. 2016</xref>). Super-resolution microscopy studies of gephyrin PTM mutants have shown that compaction of gephyrin molecule and synaptic dwell time of α2 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs contribute to activity-dependent adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Flores et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Battaglia et al. 2018</xref>). However, <italic>in vivo</italic> functional significance of gephyrin PTMs on GABA<sub>A</sub>R synapse recruitment and plasticity remains unexplored.</p><p id="P6">The barrel cortex function is facilicated by GABAergic inhibition via interneuron networks that coordinate pyramidal neuron activity during sensorimotor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Petersen 2014</xref>). At the microcircuit level, parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) neurons that typically synapse onto pyramidal cell soma and proximal dendrites become activated during passive and active whisker sensing. In contrast, somatostatin-expressing (SOM+) interneurons that typically synapse onto distal dendrites of a pyramidal cell become hyperpolarized during whisker sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gentet et al. 2012</xref>). The importance of inhibition is even more prominent in awake mice as the cortical state changes from quiet to active whisker behavior involves the reorganization of GABAergic neuronal network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gentet et al. 2010</xref>). The response of pyramidal neurons to different interneuron inputs during sensory processing relies heavily on the downstream receptor complex and postsynaptic density proteins. Hence, within a cortical microcircuit, differential GABA<sub>A</sub>R activation within the principal cell must contribute to encoding and regulating sensory inputs. Currently, the identities of specific GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and the role of scaffolding proteins in determining cortical microcircuit functional specificity are unknown.</p><p id="P7">In this study, we examined the involvement of two major GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes, namely α1-GABA<sub>A</sub>R and α2-GABA<sub>A</sub>R, and gephyrin PTMs, for sensory input-dependent cortical microcircuit function. In this regard, we employed a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, RCaMP1.07, to measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in L2/3 pyramidal neurons in the barrel cortex in wild-type (WT) and <italic>Gabra1</italic> or <italic>Gabra2</italic> global and conditional gene-deficient mice. We report α1- and α2- containing GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes, together with their scaffolding protein gephyrin, facilitate sparse encoding of whisker stimulation-induced sensory response within L2/3 pyramidal neurons. We identify that at a global and a local level, α1-GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and α2-GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs determine the excitability of L2/3 pyramidal neurons in the opposite manner. Specifically, within L2/3 pyramidal cells, α1 and α2- GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs control sparseness within the responding population. Importantly, distinct gephyrin PTM facilitates inhibitory synapse plasticity via the recruitment of either α1- or α2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to synaptic locations. This dynamic process helps fine-tune L2/3 pyramidal neuron excitability. Together, the changing needs of the barrel cortex L2/3 microcircuit during sensory stimulation are facilitated by specific GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes and diverse gephyrin PTMs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P8">All experiments were performed in accordance with the European Community Council Directives of November 24, 1986 (86/609/EEC) and approved by the cantonal veterinary office of Zurich.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Animals</title><p id="P9">Male and female mice C57BL/6J were purchased (Charles River, Germany), and the following strains were maintained in house: FVB, <italic>Gabra1</italic> KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Vicini et al., 2001</xref>), <italic>Gabra2</italic> KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Panzanelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Koester et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>Gabra1</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Vicini et al., 2001</xref>), <italic>Gabra2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> (Duveau et al., 2011).

Lateral ventricles were targeted using bregma and lambda as reference points to draw the mid-line, the needle was inserted into a site 1 mm lateral from the mid-point of the mid-line perpendicular to the skin surface.

In the first surgery, after fixing the mouse head in a stable position in a stereotaxic frame, an incision was made along the mid line to expose the skull. After cleaning the bone, bonding reagent (ONE COAT 7 Universal, Coltene) was applied, and then a head cap was created using layers of light-cured dental cement (SYNERGEY D6 Flow, Coltene). Finally, the custom-made aluminium head post was attached to the head cap. These procedures were carried out under isoflurane (4% for induction and 1.5-2% for maintenance, Forene, AbbVie). The second surgery involved a craniotomy, cortical viral injection and chronic window implantation. With a dental drill, a small piece of skull was removed above the sensory cortex to expose the barrel cortex. A glass pipette and hydraulic pump were used to inject 150 nL of virus (injecting speed 50-70 nL per minute) at a depth of 350 μm beneath the brain surface into the whisker areas identified by Intrinsic optical imaging (see below). Immediately after the injections, a 3x3 mm coverslip was fixed right above the exposed brain and secured with dental cement to the head cap. Buprenorphine (Temgesic 0.1 mg/kg) was given before and after surgical procedures for 3 days.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Intrinsic optical imaging (IOI)</title><p id="P15">IOI was used to identify barrel areas of the corresponding whiskers in the left somatosensory cortex. This technique was used to image activation of barrel areas through the skull (before craniotomy) to map the whisker field for potential viral injections, and through the cranial window to map specific whisker areas before 2-photon imaging. Under a red light (630 nm illumination), the activated brain region (imaged 400 μm under cortical surface) was identified by increased light absorption following whisker deflection by a piezo stimulator.

We injected an AAV8- CaMKIIα-tdTomato into the lateral ventricles of pups on post-natal day 0 (P0) to achieve wide-scale tdTomato expression in excitatory neurons, including cortical pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kim et al. 2013</xref>). At P60, we either stimulated the vibrissae bilaterally for one minute every day or trimmed all the whiskers daily for one week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The mice were then sacrificed and tdTomato-positive L2/3 pyramidal neurons in the barrel cortex were analyzed for expression of GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes using immunohistochemistry for α1 or α2 subunit containing-GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, as α1- or α2-GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes represent the most abundant synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in the superficial cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fritschy and Mohler 1995</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, C</xref>). Cluster analysis with an Image-J plugin (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">methods</xref>) was performed to identify α1- or α2 subunit staining within the somata, where synapses are predominantly inhibitory, and determined the size and density of α1- or α2- GABA<sub>A</sub>R clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D-G</xref>).

Based on this knowledge, and to understand how <italic>Gabra1</italic> gene depletion impacts the population distribution of pyramidal neuron activity, we defined a cut-off for high-responding cells as the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile amplitude value from the WT neurons and only considered L2/3 pyramidal neurons in the WT and KO groups that had amplitudes greater than or equal to this value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Margolis et al. 2012</xref>).

Independent quantum dot–based single-GABA<sub>A</sub>R tracking studies have shown that the gephyrin scaffold influences GABA<sub>A</sub>R surface mobility and synapse retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Choquet and Triller 2013</xref>). Specifically, it was recently shown that gephyrin PTMs, specifically the gephyrin-SSA mutant, increase the synaptic confinement of α2-GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in response to 4-Aminopyridine-induced circuit activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Battaglia et al. 2018</xref>). Supporting this finding, our electrophysiology data demonstrated an increase in mIPSC amplitude in gephyrin-SSA expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), and <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging data showed that a less excitable population of neurons doubled in size upon gephyrin-SSA expression and whisker stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Suppl. Fig. 7B</xref>). Increased synaptic confinement of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in gephyrin-SSA expressing neurons could disrupt dynamic shifts in reducing inhibitory synapses according to excitatory inputs in a neuron. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that gephyrin-DN expression increased diffusion and exploration of α2-GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Battaglia et al. 2018</xref>). In our electrophysiology studies, we observed increases in mIPSC IEI and reduced amplitude upon gephyrin-DN mutant expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> imaging data demonstrated that gephyrin-DN mutant expression increases the population of high responders after whisker stimulation by 20% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Suppl. Fig. 7B</xref>). Our data implicate a dynamic recruitment model for specific GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes based on gephyrin PTM. This would mean that specific demand would trigger a signaling cascade to converge onto the gephyrin scaffold. The PTM change on gephyrin in turn would switch affinity towards specific GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtype for synapse recruitment.</p><p id="P61">Independent of gephyrin scaffold modulation, a mechanism involving microRNA miR376c was recently reported to specifically regulate dendritic α1 and α2 subunit expression after inhibitory long-term potentiation (iLTP), but not α3, α4, α5 subunit containing-GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Rajgor et al. 2020</xref>). This highlights a role for multiple context-dependent GABA<sub>A</sub>R modulations at inhibitory synapses.</p><p id="P62">In summary, while it is known that the distribution of activity within cortical neurons is sparse, our data demonstrate that pyramidal neuron excitability is defined by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtypes and facilitated by gephyrin scaffold dynamics. Our results have characterized the first-time molecular components that are operational at GABAergic postsynaptic terminals to refine and define the sparse sensory encoding process in adult mice.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Suppl.
