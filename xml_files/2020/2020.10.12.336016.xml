<abstract>
<p id="P1">The human membrane protein Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) acts as the main receptor for host cells invasion of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The viral surface glycoprotein Spike binds to hACE2, which triggers virus entry into cells. As of today, the role of hACE2 for virus fusion is not well understood. Blocking the transition of Spike from its prefusion to post-fusion state might be a strategy to prevent or treat COVID-19. Here we report a single particle cryo-electron microscopy analysis of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric Spike in presence of the human ACE2 ectodomain. The binding of purified hACE2 ectodomain to Spike induces the disassembly of the trimeric form of Spike and a structural rearrangement of its S1 domain to form a stable, monomeric complex with hACE2. This observed hACE2 dependent dissociation of the Spike trimer suggests a mechanism for the therapeutic role of recombinant soluble hACE2 for treatment of COVID-19.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Coronavirus is a family of single-stranded RNA viruses, many of which can infect animals and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">MacLachlan and Dubovi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Monto, 1984</xref>). The symptoms of coronavirus-related diseases can be mild and mainly occur in respiratory tract. For example, roughly 15%-30% cases of the common cold are caused by human coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Mesel-Lemoine et al., 2012</xref>). A coronavirus infection sometimes can develop serious illnesses, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and also the current pandemic COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Tang et al., 2020</xref>). SARS-CoV is a beta-coronavirus that caused a pandemic in 2002. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that is genetically similar to the previous SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 causes the ongoing pandemic COVID-19 and has been spreading globally since the first quarter of this year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Ciotti et al., 2020</xref>). The symptoms of COVID-19 vary from person to person. In some cases, the illness is very serious, in particular for the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Pascarella et al., 2020</xref>). As of today, no specific antiviral drugs were approved for use against COVID-19 and vaccine development is still at the phase of clinical testing.</p>
<p id="P3">Cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) is a technique for structure determination of biomacromolecules, which has been particularly successful for studying high molecular-weight proteins. Cryo-EM does not require crystallization of the target protein. COVID-19 related protein structures have been widely investigated since the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in this year, using cryo-EM single particle analysis (SPA). The protein nicknamed Spike is with its 180kDa monomeric molecular weight the largest viral surface protein of SARS-CoV-2. It consists of two domains S1 and S2 that are connected by a short linker. Spike forms stable trimers on the virus surface that are attached to the virus membrane. This Spike trimer is the key molecule for host cells receptor binding and invasion of the host cells. The cryo-EM structure of the entire Spike homotrimer was determined recently, showing a mushroom sharped overall architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Walls et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Wrapp et al., 2020a</xref>). As also for the SARS-CoV, the viral fusion bridge from SARS-CoV-2 to the host cell is formed by Spike and the ectodomain of the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), which is the virus receptor on the host cell that triggers virus entry. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that the Spike receptor binding domains (RBDs) from SARS-CoV as well as SARS-CoV-2 can both bind to the ectodomain of hACE2 with comparable binding affinities in low nanomolar levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Lan et al., 2020a</xref>). However, the new SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a more potent capacity of host cells adhesion, as well as a larger virus-entry efficiency than other beta-coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Shang et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">The membrane-attached hACE2 is known to be the key molecule for the infection by several viruses, including SARS-CoV, Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and SARS-CoV-2. The infection process primarily involves virus adhesion and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Fehr and Perlman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Kuba et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Sia et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, hACE2 may not only serve as a drug target to prevent SARS-Co-2 infection, but hACE2 itself may also be considered as a potential therapeutic drug candidate for the usage against COVID-19 or other beta-coronavirus related diseases. The clinical-grade soluble form of hACE2 has been reported to be a potential novel therapeutic approach for reducing the infection of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Monteil et al., 2020</xref>) by preventing the viral Spike from interacting with other hACE2 present on human cells. Recently, researchers have also characterized the entire architecture of the inactivated authentic virions from SARS-CoV-2 using cryo-electron tomography, observing that post-fusion S2 trimers are distributed on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Turonova et al., 2017</xref>). The exact role of hACE2 so far is not yet fully understood in terms of its interaction with full-length Spike protein.</p>
<p id="P5">In this study, we present a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) study of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in complex with hACE2. Our analysis reveals a monomeric complex of Spike S1 domain with hACE2, requiring a large structural rearrangement in S1 compared to its isolated structure. Our data show that hACE2 binding induces a conformational change in Spike, leading to Spike trimer dissociation.</p>

<title>Spike and hACE2 production and its complex assembly</title>
<p id="P6">The prefusion Spike 2P ectodomain was expressed in ExpiCHO cells and affinity purified via its twin Strep-tag. SDS-PAGE analysis showed the presence of pure full-length Spike protein, consisting of both, the S1 and S2 domains at the expected molecular weight of 180 kDa for the Spike monomer. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S1a</xref>). The purified Spike sample in PBS buffer was imaged as negatively stained preparations by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This revealed the expected trimeric shape, and 2D class averages of selected particles in negative stain TEM images showed the typical, mushroom-shaped particles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S2a.c</xref>), in accordance with the expected structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike in the pre-fusion state.</p>
<p id="P7">Human ACE2 ectodomain was expressed in HEK293 cells and purified via a poly-histidine immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) with a Fastback Ni2+ column, followed by another anion exchange column (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S1b</xref>). For details, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>.</p>
<p id="P8">Purified Spike protein was mixed with excess hACE2 (molar ratio Spike:hACE2 of 1:5) and incubated for 12 hours at 4° C. Samples were prepared by negative staining and imaged by TEM. Unexpectedly, the observed particle features were largely different from the typical Spike trimers in shape. A 2D analysis of 5’854 picked negatively stained particles revealed in class averages that the majority of the particles were smaller in size and asymmetrical, compared to the non-incubated Spike trimeric samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S2b,d</xref>). This suggests that the prolonged incubation with hACE2 led to Spike trimer dissociation. A similar observation for SARS-CoV-ACE2 complex was recently reported by Song et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Song et al., 2018</xref>). Due to particle heterogeneity, we decided to further purify the complex by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and indeed the SEC profile showed three distinct peaks, called Peak1, Peak2 and Peak3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S1c,d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">By analyzing the 3 peaks by SDS gel and negative stain EM, we could clearly differentiate non-structured aggregates of full-length Spike and hACE2 in Peak1, that did not allow further structural analysis (data not shown), to the excess of unbound hACE2 in Peak3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S1c,d</xref>). The homogenous Peak2 that contained full-length Spike in complex with hACE2, was further analyzed by cryo-EM.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>hACE2 binding can induce disassembly of Spike homotrimer</title>
<p id="P10">Peak2 (Spike:hACE2 at molar ratio 1:5 after overnight incubation at 4°C) was vitrified and frozen grids were loaded into a Thermo Fisher Scientific (TFS) Titan Krios cryo-EM instrument, operated at 300kV acceleration voltage, and equipped with a Gatan Quantum-LS energy filter equipped with K2 direct electron detector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S3</xref>). 8’927 dose-fractionated images (i.e., movies) were recorded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S4</xref>), from which ~1.7 million particles were extracted and subjected to image processing and 3D reconstruction. The final 3D reconstruction from 72’446 particles at 5.1Å overall resolution showed a density map corresponding to a single, monomeric Spike protein in complex with hACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The map allowed docking with available structures for S1 and hACE2 taken from the previously reported structures (Spike PDB ID 6VYB and Spike RBD-ACE2 6M0J), revealing a structural rearrangement of the C-terminal domain (CTD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1 compared to a monomer from that Spike structure in the RBD<sup>up</sup> conformation. The interaction between the S1 RBD and hACE2 is in agreement with several other reported structures of the RBD-ACE2 complex (PDB ID 6M0J, 6VW1 or 6LZG). No additional density for S2 or a fragment of S2 was detected in the reconstruction.</p>
<p id="P11">We tested a shorter incubation time by mixing Spike:hACE2 (molar ratio of 1:3) and let it incubate for 3 hours at 4°C, instead as overnight. No further SEC purification was performed. Subsequently, cryo-EM grids of this sample were prepared and subjected to cryo-EM analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S5</xref>). From 7’045 recorded movies, 615’348 particles were extracted and subjected to classification and 3D analysis. This revealed a small sub-set of 47’901 particles corresponding to the prefusion Spike trimer, which allowed a 3D reconstruction at 4.2Å overall resolution (no symmetry was applied), while some regions of the 3D map showed lower resolution, presumably due to increased flexibility of these areas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S6</xref>). A resolution-limited map at 9Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) allowed clear docking the models of Spike S1 and S2 and hACE2, which showed that the complex is composed of Spike and hACE2 in a molar ratio of 3:3 (Spike:hACE2). Three hACE2 molecules were observed to attach to the RBDs of Spike. All three RBDs were in the RBD<sup>up</sup> conformation and slightly shifted away from the central trimer axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). A similar arrangement was also recently observed by Kirchdoerfer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018</xref>), see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Structural comparison of Spike-hACE2 complexes</title>
<p id="P12">A detailed analysis of both obtained structures shows significant structural rearrangements in different forms of Spike-hACE2 complex. The resolution of our reconstructed EM maps was not sufficient for building atomic models, but allowed clear placement of available atomic structures for Spike (PDB ID: 6VYB) and ACE2-RBD (PDB ID: 6M0J) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Lan et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Walls et al., 2020</xref>). Comparison of the docked and fitted monomeric S1-hACE2 model to that of the trimeric Spike-hACE2 (3:3) showed that a ~30° rotation of the C-terminal and N-terminal sub-domains of Spike S1 were required to bring the Spike S1 protein into the monomeric arrangement with hACE2. After such re-arrangement, the domains of hACE2 and the RBDs of the S1 protein are in good agreement with a reported crystal structure (REF Lan et al.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">When comparing the docked model of the monomeric S1-hACE2 complex with that of the trimeric Spike-hACE2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), a considerable number of stearic clashes at the interface between Spike S1 (CTD) and its neighboring region from the S2 polypeptide chain was obvious. The docked monomeric S1-hACE2 complex is further structurally incompatible with the observed trimeric arrangement.</p>

<sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P14">The stoichiometric ratio of the complex of Spike:hACE2 on the host cell upon virus entry is not well established. Nevertheless, one hACE2 molecule per Spike trimer is likely sufficient for binding and initializing virus fusion with the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Song et al., 2018</xref>). Even though the structure of a post-fusion S2 trimer has recently been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cai et al., 2020</xref>), it is not clear how membrane fusion during virus entry is coordinated upon release of the S1-hACE2 caps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). We here report the cryo-EM structure of a stable monomeric S1 Spike-hACE2 (1:1) complex. Even though size-wise it would have been detectable, our particle classification did not reveal any particle class corresponding to an isolated S1 fragment in addition to the observed S1 Spike-hACE2 (1:1) particles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S3c, S4</xref>). Knowledge of the mechanism how the S1 fragment might be detached from the hACE2 receptors after virus entry would be relevant for understanding its mechanism of infection and pathogenicity. The fact that we did not observe any free S1 fragments suggests that the S1-hACE2 complex is rather stable, at least under our <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions.</p>
<p id="P15">Secondly, the S2 domain was not detected in the obtained structure of the Spike-hACE2 monomeric complex (1:1), even though the SDS-PAGE analysis showed that S2 was present as full length in the sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S1d</xref>). The S2 domain is expected to be connected to the S1 domain via a short loop between S1 and S2, where a Furin protease cleavage site is expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Belouzard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Haan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Hoffmann et al., 2020</xref>). However, in the absence of stable trimers, the loop between S1 and S2 is likely very flexible, possibly making the S2 domain undetectable by cryo-EM maps. Our cryo-EM analysis that didn’t show the S2 domain in the averaged 3D reconstruction therefore likely failed to align the S2 domains either due to their flexibility, or due to a denaturation of S2 during sample preparation.</p>
<p id="P16">An early study presented a potential dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by a recombinant soluble form of hACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Monteil et al., 2020</xref>). The mechanism, how the soluble forms of hACE2 would be able to neutralize the virus, is not known. One possible mechanism could be a direct competition between the soluble hACE2 and the host cell hACE2 receptor, so that Spike proteins saturated with soluble hACE2 domains render them unable to interact with host cell hACE2. Here, however, we report that the soluble forms of hACE2 induce the opening and disassembly of the trimeric Spike structure to create the stable Spike S1-hACE2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). We propose a mechanism by which the formation of the Spike-hACE2 (3:3) complex induces a high structural flexibility in the Spike trimer, allowing a conformational re-arrangement of the S1 C- and N-terminal domains when interacting with hACE2. In consequence, the new S1-hACE2 complex is incompatible with a trimeric arrangement, causing the dissociation of the trimeric complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">This hypothesis is supported by the recent manuscript deposited in bioRxiv.org, which describes a similar effect triggered by engineered DARPin molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Walser et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we suppose that the soluble forms of hACE2 may not only block the infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2, but also destroy the trimeric Spike adaptors that are responsible for viral host membrane fusion. This mechanism suggests a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of COVID-19, by adding soluble hACE2 to dissociate the Spike trimer of approaching viruses.</p>

<p id="P24">For both samples, dose-fractionated images (i.e., movies) were recorded with a Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher), operated at 300kV, and equipped with a Gatan Quantum-LS energy filter (20 eV zero-loss energy filtration) followed by a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector. The data collection statistics is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Images were recorded in counting mode, at a magnification yielding a physical pixel size of 0.82Å at the sample level. Images were automatically recorded with the SerialEM program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Mastronarde, 2003</xref>) at a defocus range of -0.8 ~ -2.5um. All the movies were gain-normalized, aligned, dose weighted and averaged with the program of MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) within FOCUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Biyani et al., 2017</xref>), which also was used to sort images and reject images of insufficient quality. The pre-processed micrographs were imported into cryoSPARC V2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>Image processing</title>
<p id="P25">Data processing of the monomeric Spike-hACE2 complex was conducted in CryoSPARC V2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>). The defocus and contrast transfer function (CTF) values were estimated on 8’927 micrographs and 7’927 good images were selected. 1’685’202 particles were auto-picked by blob picking, followed later by another round of template picking. Particle clearing was performed by two rounds of 2D classifications, resulting in a particles stack of 435’410 particles. 3D references were generated using ab-initio reconstruction (CryoSPARC V2) and followed by two rounds of 3D hetero-refinements. The final particle set contained 72’446 particles, leading to a 3D map at 5.1Å overall resolution, as estimated by Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) using the 0.143 cutoff criterion.</p>
<p id="P26">For the trimeric Spike-hACE2 complex, image processing was performed similarly. The final reconstruction produced a 3D map at 4.2Å overall resolution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S12">
<title>Model interpretation</title>
<p id="P27">Protein models were generated from reported structures (Spike: PDB ID 6VYB; ACE2-RBD: PDB ID 6M0J) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Lan et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Walls et al., 2020</xref>). For the S1-hACE2 structure, the model was manually docked into the EM density with the program Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) and further refined using rigid-body fitting in COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>). For the Spike-hACE2 trimer, the density corresponding to hACE2 was relatively weak, so that low-pass filtration to 9Å resolution was applied to the map before proceeding with the docking of hACE2 as described above.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM maps of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-hACE2 complexes and fitted models.</title>
<p>
<bold>a</bold>. The 3D reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and human ACE2 (mixed at a molar ratio 1:5) incubated for 12hrs and further purified by SEC shows a structure corresponding to monomeric Spike S1 protein in complex with hACE2. No density for S2 is observed. The N- and C-terminal domains of S1 had to be re-arranged to fit into the map. Left: Side-view, center: 90° rotated view. The structure is colored as follows: hACE2 ectodomain green, Spike S1-RBD yellow, Spike S1-CTD slate blue, Spike S1-NTD salmon. Right: The bottom image shows a representative 2D class average of the S1-hACE2 complex. The upper cartoon is its interpretation. <bold>b</bold>. 3D reconstruction of Spike and hACE2 (ratio 1:3) incubated for 3 hours shows a trimeric map allowing docking of three hACE2 molecules and three S1 and three S2 molecules, all forming a trimeric complex. The map is low-pass filtered to 9Å resolution for better interpretation. The complex is arranged in a molar ratio of 3:3 (SpikeS1-S2:hACE2). The image on the left indicates the host cell membrane as a cartoon. Center: 90° rotated view. Right: The bottom image shows a representative 2D class average of Spike-hACE2 (3:3) complex, here shown from the top as in the central panel. The upper cartoon is its interpretation (here shown from the side). Scale bar in class averages: 2 nm.</p>

<bold>a</bold>. Superposition of S1-hACE2 complex structures derived from different conformations. Structures are shown as a cartoon and colored as follows: monomeric Spike-hACE2 complex, blue; trimeric form of Spike-hACE2 complex, green; Spike one RBD-up (PDB ID: 6VYB), red. The RBDs have been superimposed. <bold>b</bold>. Structural comparison of S1-hACE2 regions. The movement is presented as two colors: SARS-CoV2 trimeric Spike-hACE2 complex (green) and S1-hACE2 (blue) <bold>c,d</bold>. The close-up views show the proposed local structural rearrangements. <bold>e</bold>. Superposition of S1-hACE2(1:1) with the trimeric form of Spike-hACE2 complex. The RBDs have been superimposed. The rearranged structure of Spike-hACE2 is no longer compatible with formation of trimers so that it dissociates. The right panel is a predicted structure of the dissociated Spike-hACE2 monomer.</p>

<title>Proposed models for Spike-hACE2 complex formation and structural rearrangement.</title>
<p>The upper row shows a possible pathway leading to a conformational change of the trimeric SARS-CoV2 Spike. In this model, one hACE2 molecule binds to one Spike S1 monomer and induces the conformational changes in the trimeric Spike. Subsequently, a post-fusion S2 trimer is formed. The lower row shows a novel proposed pathway leading to Spike trimer disassembly by hACE2. In presence of a high concentration of hACE2 molecules, a Spike-hACE2 (3:3) complex is formed. Structural clashes between the three Spike-hACE2 elements lead to their dissociation. This induces the formation of monomeric Spike-hACE2 complexes.</p>
