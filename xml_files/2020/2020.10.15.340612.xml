<abstract>
<p id="P1">The innate immune system constitutes a powerful barrier against viral infections. However, it may fail because successful emerging pathogens, like SARS-CoV-2, evolved strategies to counteract it. Here, we systematically assessed the impact of 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins on viral sensing, type I, II and III interferon (IFN) signaling, autophagy and inflammasome formation. Mechanistic analyses show that autophagy and type I IFN responses are effectively counteracted at different levels. For example, Nsp14 induces loss of the IFN receptor, whereas ORF3a disturbs autophagy at the Golgi/endosome interface. Comparative analyses revealed that antagonism of type I IFN and autophagy is largely conserved, except that SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 is more potent in counteracting type I IFN than its SARS-CoV-2 ortholog. Altogether, however, SARS-CoV-2 counteracts type I IFN responses and autophagy much more efficiently than type II and III IFN signaling. Consequently, the virus is relatively resistant against exogenous IFN-α/β and autophagy modulation but remains highly vulnerable towards IFN-γ and -λ treatment. In combination, IFN-γ and -λ act synergistically, and drastically reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication at exceedingly low doses. Our results identify ineffective type I and II antagonism as weakness of SARS-CoV-2 that may allow to devise safe and effective anti-viral therapies based on targeted innate immune activation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a zoonotic, novel coronavirus that emerged at the end of 2019<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. The virus rapidly spread all over the world owing to its higher transmission rates<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup> (R=2.5), as well as a lower morbidity and case fatality rates (CFR 3-4%)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup> compared to previous epidemic coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-1 (R=2.0, CFR 11%) or MERS-CoV (R=0.9, CFR 35%)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. However, its pathogenicity is still much higher than that of ‘common cold’ CoVs such as HKU1 and 229E<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup> and to date SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than a millions deaths (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html</ext-link>).</p>
<p id="P3">Upon infection of a target cell, CoVs are recognized by innate immune sensors, for example via RIG like receptors (RLRs)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>, which activate cell-intrinsic innate immune defenses (hereafter referred to as the innate immune system)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>, such as interferon (IFN) responses, inflammasome activation and autophagy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. However, the exact ligand triggering the response is unknown. Activation of RLRs induces signaling cascades that ultimately lead to the release of IFNs and other pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as induction of anti-viral effectors<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Released cytokines are subsequently also recognized by neighboring cells and induce an antiviral transcriptional response. Thus, both the infected cell and non-infected neighboring cells are set in an anti-viral state<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup> eventually limiting viral spread. Other branches of the innate immune system, such as autophagy, are activated during CoV infections as well<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. Autophagy is capable of targeting viral components or even whole viruses for lysosomal degradation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup> and SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to block autophagic turnover<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. Eventually activation of innate immunity recruits and stimulates the adaptive immune system ultimately facilitating elimination of the virus<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. Notably, inborn defects in innate immunity or auto-antibodies against IFNs are associated with high frequencies of severe COVID19 cases, suggesting that innate defense mechanisms play a major role in immune control of SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 infections show higher numbers of subclinical, asymptomatic infections (up to 80%<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>) compared to previous epidemic CoVs such as SARS-CoV<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. Indeed, recent evidence suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can be more efficiently antagonized by IFNs than SARS-CoV-1 <italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. However, the underlying reasons for differences in IFN susceptibility between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 are currently not fully understood.</p>
<p id="P4">Recent reports demonstrated that infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces an imbalanced innate immune response, indicating manipulation by SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. Proteomics analysis of selected SARS-CoV-2 proteins revealed that innate immune activation is perturbed on multiple levels<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. For example, it was suggested that ORF3a inhibits autophagic turnover, ORF8 alters Integrin-TGFβ-EGFR-RTK signalling<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup> and ORF3b antagonizes type I IFN induction by a yet unknown mechanism<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) shuts down cellular translation including the cytokine-mediated innate immune response<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. Analysis of the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and IFN-β induction and signaling revealed that at least 8 SARS-CoV-2 proteins interfere with type I IFN signalling<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. Among them is ORF6, which was suggested to interfere with nuclear trafficking of transcription factors thereby impairing gene induction<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>. However, so far only type I IFN signaling was analyzed in some detail and our knowledge how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates innate immunity is far from being complete.</p>
<p id="P5">Currently, treatment with IFNs is explored in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. However, patients receiving immunomodulatory therapy with IFNs generally suffer from severe side-effects including psychological symptoms such as depression<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>. Novel strategies which activate the immune system but reduce inflammation and lower doses of cytokines are required<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. Thus, analyzing how SARS-CoV-2 antagonizes innate immunity may give valuable clues on viral vulnerabilities that might be exploited for effective and safe therapeutic immune control.</p>
<p id="P6">Here, we systematically analyzed the impact of 29 SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup> on the major branches of the cell-intrinsic innate immune system: IFN induction, IFN/pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling and autophagy. This identified Nsp1, Nsp3, Nsp5, Nsp10, Nsp13, Nsp14, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a and ORF7b as the major innate immune antagonists encoded by SARS-CoV-2. Interference with innate immune activation is achieved by using a diverse, synergistic, set of mechanisms ranging from downregulation of IFN receptor expression by Nsp14 to blockage of autophagy via fragmentation of the trans-Golgi network by the viral proteins ORF3a and ORF7a. Strikingly, our data indicate that Nsp15 of both RaTG13 CoV and SARS-CoV-2 counteract type I IFN induction and signaling much less efficiently than SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15. Taken together our analyses revealed that IFN-γ and IFN-λ1 pathways are antagonized the least, and consequently treatment with these two cytokines is most potent against SARS-CoV-2. Combined IFN treatment at very low doses potentiates the individual anti-viral effect and can be further improved by anti-inflammatory autophagy activation. Thus, our results provide a plausible explanation why SARS-CoV-2 is more susceptible against IFN treatment than SARS-CoV-1 and indicate that combination of IFN-γ and IFN-λ1 is an effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 approach.</p>

<title>A variety of SARS-CoV-2 proteins antagonize innate immune pathways</title>
<p id="P7">To systematically examine how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates innate immunity, we used Strep II-tagged expression constructs coding for 28 of the 30 currently reported SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Nsp1, Nsp2, Nsp4, Nsp5, Nsp6, Nsp7, Nsp8, Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp11, Nsp12, Nsp13, Nsp14, Nsp15, Nsp16, S, ORF3a, ORF3c, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9b, N, ORF9c and ORF10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In addition, we examined untagged Nsp3. Expression of all proteins was confirmed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>) and immunofluorescence analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). The impact of all 29 viral proteins on three major branches of innate immunity: IFN/pro-inflammatory cytokine induction via Rig-like receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>), signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>) and autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>) was analyzed by quantitative reporter assays.</p>
<p id="P8">Induction of type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β) was monitored using a Firefly luciferase reporter controlled by the full IFNα4 promotor, the full IFN-β promotor, or isolated binding sites for the transcription factors IRF3 or NF-κB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). All assays were normalized for cell viability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>). HEK293T cells were infected with Sendai Virus, mimicking RLR activation by SARS-CoV-2. Nsp2, Nsp6 and Nsp12 slightly enhanced both IFN-α4 and IFN-β promotor induction as well as IRF3-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). However, our analyses revealed that Nsp1, Nsp3, Nsp5, Nsp10, Nsp13, ORF6 and ORF7b are the major SARS-CoV-2 encoded antagonists of type I IFN induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">Type I and III IFNs, such as IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-λ1 culminates in the induction of genes with IFN response element (ISRE)-containing promotors<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. Type II IFN-γ cause gene activation of gamma activated sequence (GAS) containing promotors. Pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling (TNFα and IL-1α) induce genes containing NF-κB sites in the promotor. Signaling of type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β), Type II IFN (IFN-γ), type III IFN (IFN-λ1) and pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling (TNFα and IL-1α) was quantified using quantitative firefly luciferase reporters controlled by the respective promotors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Stimulation with IFN-α2 and IFN-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) revealed that activation of the ISRE promotor is strongly repressed by Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp13, Nsp14, ORF6 and ORF7b. A similar set of viral proteins interfered with type II IFN-γ and type III IFN-λ1 signaling, albeit much weaker (mean inhibition 18% and 35%, respectively) compared to type I IFN signaling (mean inhibition 78% for IFN-α2 and 53% for IFN-β). Activation of NF-κB signaling by TNFα or IL-1α was potently inhibited by the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp15, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6 and ORF7b proteins. These analyses revealed that a similar set of proteins (Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp15, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6 and ORF7b) antagonizes pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling.</p>
<p id="P10">Since induction of autophagy does not depend on <italic>de novo</italic> gene expression<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup>, we monitored autophagy levels in SARS-CoV-2 protein expressing HEK293T cells by membrane-association of stably expressed GFP-LC3B, a hallmark of autophagy induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup>. Autophagosome numbers under basal conditions were strongly increased in the presence of ORF3a, E, M and ORF7a suggesting either de novo induction of autophagy or blockage of turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Upon induction of autophagy using Rapamycin, a similar pattern was observed. To clarify whether these viral proteins induce autophagy or block turnover, leading to accumulation of GFP-LC3B positive vesicles, we treated cells with saturating amounts of Bafilomycin A1, which inhibits autophagic turnover. The increase of autophagosome numbers by ORF3a, E, M and ORF7a was drastically reduced compared to non-blocking conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), indicating that these proteins block turnover, rather than induce it. Blockage of autophagy and co-expression of Nsp1 and Nsp14 induced cell death, which may be responsible for the low number of autophagosomes. Unexpectedly, in the presence of Nsp15 autophagosome numbers were consistently reduced, suggesting that it inhibits autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">Inflammasome responses were analyzed in stable THP-1 cell lines expressing SARS-CoV-2 proteins upon doxycycline induction. To avoid any effects of transcription, assembly of ASC specks was quantified after cytosolic delivery of the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome activator <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> needle protein MxiH using the anthrax toxin delivery system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 e</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup>. ASC speck assembly is typically followed by caspase-1 activation and release of pro-inflammatory IL-1β and IL-18<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup>. Expression of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp8, Nsp11 and ORF9c very weakly induced inflammasome activity in the absence of inflammasome activators, although counterselection against cells prone to aberrant inflammasome activation during selection cannot be ruled out. Activation of NLRC4 inflammasomes was not significantly antagonized by any viral protein.</p>
<p id="P12">Taken together, our analysis reveals that SARS-CoV-2 encodes multiple proteins that strongly antagonize innate immunity. Notably, there are differences in overall inhibition of the pathways with IFN-γ, IFN-λ1 as well as inflammasome activity signaling being only weakly antagonized. However, type-I IFN induction and signaling and autophagy are strongly repressed.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>SARS-CoV-2 proteins target autophagy and type-I IFN at multiple levels</title>
<p id="P13">To analyses mechanistically why type-I IFN and autophagy are potently counteracted by SARS-CoV-2, we aimed at identifying the steps that are targeted in these pathways. We focused on the top 5 inhibitors as identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-d</xref>. Nsp1 was removed from the analysis as it prevents translation in general<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. To analyses IFN-β signaling, we monitored the levels of the type I IFN receptor, IFNAR using western blotting in HEK293T cells overexpressing Nsp5, Nsp13, Nsp14, ORF6 or ORF7b. Activation of the two major transcription factors of type I IFN signaling, STAT1 and STAT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) was examined by phosphorylation status. Basal STAT1 and STAT2 levels were not significantly affected by all proteins tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, quantification in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a-c</xref>). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In the presence of Nsp5, activated STAT1 and to a lesser extend STAT2 accumulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b and 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). ORF6 and ORF7b did not affect IFNAR levels or STAT1 expression or activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b-d</xref>). This agrees with recent reports<sup>26,45,46</sup> suggesting that ORF6 instead prevents trafficking of transcription factors. In the presence of Nsp14 and to a lesser extend for Nsp13 endogenous levels of IFNAR is prominently reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, c</xref>).

</sup>. Upon fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, the autophagic receptor p62 is degraded (autophagy turnover, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). We analyzed the effect of the top 5 autophagy modulating SARS-CoV-2 proteins: Nsp15, ORF3a, E, M and ORF7a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>) on autophagy markers. Levels of Beclin-1 and ULK1, which parts of the core machinery of autophagy initiation remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d and 2e</xref>). Overexpression of Nsp15 leads to a very slight decrease of LCB3-II but accumulation of p62, suggesting that Nsp15 blocks induction of autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f and 2g-h</xref>). In line with this, the number of GFP-LC3B-puncta (=autophagosomes) per cell in HeLa-GFP-LC3B cells is reduced upon Nsp15 expression to almost 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i, j</xref>). In the presence of ORF3a, E and ORF7a, the levels of processed LC3B (LC3B-II) were 4-to 7-fold increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>), and p62 levels are approximately 1.5-fold increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). This indicates that these three viral proteins block autophagic turnover. Consequently, the number of autophagosomes is 10-fold increased upon ORF3a, E, M or ORF7a expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i, j</xref>). Curiously, while accumulation of LC3B-II indicates that M blocks autophagic turnover or induces autophagy, the levels of p62 are not significantly altered in the presence of M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f, h</xref>). Notably, overexpression of M resulted in an accumulation of LC3B in the perinuclear space, whereas for all other viral proteins autophagosomes are normally distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i, j</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">Taken together, our data demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 synergistically targets type-IFN signaling and autophagy. The major type I IFN antagonists Nsp5, Nsp13, Nsp14, ORF6 or ORF7b block the signaling cascade at different levels. E, ORF3a and ORF7a use similar mechanism to block autophagic turnover, while M may have evolved a different mechanism and Nsp15 inhibits de novo autophagy induction.</p>

In line with the proteome analysis, ORF7a and ORF3a both localized to the late endosomal compartment, co-localizing with the marker Rab9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d, e</xref>). In contrast, localization to Rab5a-positive early endosomes was not apparent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3g</xref>).

<title>SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 is less potent in innate immune antagonism than SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15</title>
<p id="P18">To examine the conservation of innate immune antagonism, we functionally compared Nsp1, Nsp3, Nsp7, Nsp15, M, N, ORF3a, ORF6 and ORF7a of SARS-CoV-2, the closest related CoV, RaTG13-CoV and the previous highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-1. RaTG13-CoV was isolated from the intermediate host horseshoe bats (<italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic>). The amino acid sequences of the different CoVs are largely conserved, with the exception of Nsp3, ORF3a and ORF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>) and are all expressed to similar levels as confirmed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a-i</xref>). Rabies virus P protein, Measles virus V protein and TRIM32 expression served as positive controls. Overall, proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and RaTG13 behave similar to their SARS-CoV-2 counterparts, suggesting that many functions are conserved. Importantly, however, this is not the case for Nsp15, Nsp3 and to a lesser extend ORF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-c</xref>). SARS-CoV-1 ORF6 is about 4-fold less potent in antagonizing type I IFN signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) but induces higher levels of autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). However, expression levels of SARS-CoV-1 ORF6 were also higher than that of its SARS-VoV-2 and RaTG13 counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4g</xref>), which may explain the differences in activity. Differences between SARS-CoV, RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3 were reanalyzed in a dose-dependent manner, and only in the range of 2-3-fold which may also explained by differential expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4j</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">The most striking, statistically significant difference was observed for Nsp15. SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 is over 10-fold more potent in suppression of type I IFN induction and signaling than RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). Notably, expression levels of SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 are similar, with SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 even being slightly less expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). Notably, all Nsp15 variants still inhibit autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Dose-dependent effect of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15, RaTG13-CoV Nsp15 and SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 on type I IFN induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>) and signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>) showed that on average SARS-CoV2 Nsp15 performed 32-fold worse than SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15, and RaTG13 Nsp15 inhibited type I IFN induction 7.8-fold less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Similarly, SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 outperformed RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 by 15- and 5.7-fold, respectively, in inhibition of type I IFN signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P20">Taken together, this data indicates, that while most IFN antagonist activities are conserved between SARS-CoV, RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2, there is an exception: Nsp15 of SARS-CoV-1 is considerably more potent than SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 in counteracting both IFN-β induction and signaling.</p>

<title>Inefficient antagonism by SARS-CoV-2 proteins is predictive for efficient immune control</title>
<p id="P21">Our analyses revealed that several of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins synergistically antagonize innate immune activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), albeit with different efficiency. The mean inhibition of IFN-γ and IFN-λ1 signaling was 18% and 35%, respectively, compared to type I IFN signaling with a mean inhibition of only 78% for IFN-α2 and 53% for IFN-β. Consequently, we assessed whether IFN-α2, IFN-β, IFN-γ and IFN-λ1 have a different impact on SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a, b</xref>). Treatment with the type I IFN-α2 was the least efficient. In contrast, at the same concentration IFN-γ (500 U/mL) reduced viral RNA in the supernatant almost 300-fold more efficiently. All agents caused little if any cytotoxic effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). Altogether, we observed a good correlation (r= 0.89) between average inhibition of the respective signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) antagonized by the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins and IFN susceptibility at 5 U/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P22">In contrast to type II and II IFN signaling, autophagic turnover was strongly repressed by at least four SARS-CoV-2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, based on our inhibition data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) we would expect that modulation of autophagy only weakly affects SARS-CoV-2 replication. Indeed, treatment with Rapamycin, which induces autophagy, reduced viral replication to a maximum of 4-6-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>). Bafilomycin A1, which blocks autophagy, had little to no effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>).

<title>Rational innate immune activation allows highly effective control of SARS-CoV-2</title>
<p id="P24">IFN therapy is commonly associated with significant adverse effects, due to induction of inflammation. To minimize detrimental pro-inflammatory effects of IFNs, doses required for efficient viral restriction should be reduced. Thus, we analyzed the impact of the most potent IFNs, IFN-γ and IFN-λ1 and their combination of SARS-CoV-2. To mimic prophylactic and therapeutic treatment we examined pretreatment for 24 h before infection with SARS-CoV-2 and treatment 6 h post-infection. Overall, the effects of IFN treatment were about 10-fold stronger in the prophylactic condition than in the therapeutic treatment but consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c, d</xref>). Expression analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S and N confirmed the qPCR results, and equal GAPDH levels exclude effects on viral replication by cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). While treatment with a single dose of IFN-γ and IFN-λ1 alone reduced viral RNA production 50-100-fold, the combinatorial treatment at the same concentration potentiated the effect to about 1000-fold reduction in SARS-CoV-2 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P25">To further decrease inflammatory side-effects by IFN treatment, anti-inflammatory pathways like autophagy could be induced<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>
</sup>. Treatment with Rapamycin, which induces autophagy, already reduces viral replication ~ 4-6-fold at 125nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Treatment of Rapamycin (125nM) in combination with either IFN-γ or IFN-λ1 was found to be additive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c, d</xref>). Triple treatment with IFN-γ, IFN-λ1 and Rapamycin showed the most potent anti-viral effect of all combinations for pre-treatment and post-treatment, reducing viral RNA in the supernatant by 2100-fold and 85-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P26">In summary, our data shows that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of combinatorial treatments of IFN-γ, IFN-λ1 are synergistic. Additional activation of anti-inflammatory autophagy by Rapamycin further decreased SARS-CoV-2 replication. This suggests that concerted activation of innate immunity may be an effective anti-viral approach, exploiting vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2 revealed by analysis of its innate immune antagonism.</p>

</sup>. Our data reveal the extend of immune manipulation SARS-CoV-2 employs. We determined the major antagonists of type I IFN induction and signaling as well as pro-inflammatory NF-κB activity encoded by SARS-CoV-2 (Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp13, Nsp14, ORF6 and ORF7b). Type II and III IFN signaling is targeted by a similar set of proteins, although much less efficient. Autophagy is majorly targeted by Nsp15, ORF3a, E, M and ORF7a. Inflammasome activity is very weakly induced by Nsp8, Nsp11 and ORF9c, but none of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins block formation of the NLR4C inflammasome. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that SARS-CoV-2 proteins synergistically block type-I IFN signaling and autophagy at various levels. We could reveal for the first time, that Nsp14 lowers the cellular levels of the IFN receptor, IFNAR, thus blocking activation of the crucial transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2. Both ORF3a and ORF7a cause fragmentation of the TGN via disturbing the late endosomal pathway. This is a common strategy of viruses to block autophagic turnover. Examination of the functional conservation showed that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 was less efficient in blocking innate immune activation, both type I IFN induction and signaling, than SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15. This may ultimately cause SARS-CoV-2 to be better controlled by the innate immune system than SARS-CoV-1, explaining higher numbers of subclinical infections and thus overall lower mortality rates of the current pandemic CoV. Overall, the combined analysis of IFN antagonism allowed us to deduce that treatment with type-I IFNs and regulation of autophagy is only weakly anti-viral. In contrast, treatment with IFN-γ and IFN-λ1 drastically reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication. Finally, combinatorial treatment of SARS-CoV-2 with these two IFNs potentiated the effects of the individual treatments. This may pave the way for future anti-viral therapies against SARS-CoV-2 based on rational innate immune activation.</p>
<p id="P28">Why would multiple effective proteins target the same pathway? For example, type I IFN signaling could have been shut down by Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp13, Nsp14, ORF6 and ORF7b alone, each reducing the activation of the innate immune pathways to below 10%. However, our assays revealed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) that the targeting mechanisms are often not redundant and may act synergistically. This could allow the virus to better control the targeted pathway, thus minimizing the effect of the signaling on its replication. In addition, a viral protein majorly targeting one pathway may affect other connected immune pathways at once. For example, disturbance of the kinase TBK1 activation may affect primarily IFN induction and to a lesser extend also impact autophagy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>
</sup>. Proteome analyses revealed the late endosome/Golgi network as a target of ORF3a and ORF7a. Our data suggests, that both ORF3a and ORF7a of SARS-CoV-2 cause fragmentation of Golgi apparatus and thus blockage of autophagy. SARS-CoV-1 ORF3a was previously already implicated in Golgi fragmentation, thus our data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a uses a similar strategy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>
</sup>. Notably, fragmentation of the Golgi is for example triggered by Hepatitis C virus viruses to block anti-viral autophagic turnover<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>
</sup> and thus may represent a common strategy by viruses to avoid autophagic degradation. Based on our initial proteome approaches, future studies will see more mechanistic data to explain the molecular details of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 proteins on innate immune activation. Notably, several proteins including ORF6, ORF3a, ORF7a, M and E accumulate at the Golgi network or in perinuclear spaces, alluding to the emerging role of the Golgi as a hub for immune manipulation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P29">Our results demonstrate that ORF6, ORF3a, ORF7a and ORF7b are the strongest innate immune antagonists among the accessory genes of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Besides the accessory genes, which classically encode immune antagonists, a surprising number of non-structural proteins manipulate innate immunity. Nsp1, which targets cellular translation and thus broadly inhibits any response dependent on cellular translation, which includes IFN induction and expression of ISGs and anti-viral effector proteins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. However, Nsp3, Nsp5, Nsp13 and to a lower extend Nsp15 also antagonized IFN induction and signaling. These non-structural proteins of CoVs have important functions in the viral life-cycle: Nsp3 as ISG/ubiquitin ligase and protease for autocatalytic processing of the ORF1a/b precursor protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>
</sup> Nsp5 as a protease mediating cleavage of the precursor polyproteins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>
</sup>, Nsp13 as NTPase/Helicase<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>
</sup> and Nsp15 as endoribonuclease<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>
</sup>. It is so far not completely clear how their enzymatic functions may impact their activity against innate immunity. Except for Nsp3, as its activity as a de-ISGlase may inactivate the transcription factor IRF3 and thus reduce IFN induction<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>
</sup>. According to our analysis the structural proteins E and M strongly manipulated autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). This suggests that the incoming virion may already block autophagic turnover to prevent their own degradation by autophagy.</p>
<p id="P30">However, while we may pick up most counteraction strategies, our screening approach may miss immune evasion strategies employed by SARS-CoV-2. For example, many non-structural proteins form complexes, that are not formed during single overexpression and may only be functional as a full assembly. Evasion mechanisms based on RNA structures and sequences are lost due to usage of codon-optimized expression plasmids. Finally, the virus itself may employ strategies to hide itself from recognition, thus not activating innate immune defenses in the first place. One example is the capping of its genomic and sub genomic mRNAs, which removes the free triphosphate 5’end, which otherwise would be immediately recognized by the cytoplasmic sensor RIG-I.</p>
<p id="P31">Our analyses further revealed that the human innate immune antagonism is largely conserved in the SARS-CoV-2 closest related bat isolate, RaTG13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). This indicates that the bat virus is capable of counteracting the human immune defenses, which may have facilitated successful zoonotic transmission from bat eventually to humans. Currently, the intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 is under debate<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>
</sup>, however it is likely, that the virus isolated from it is even closer related to SARS-CoV-2 than RATG13. Thus, any immune evasion mechanisms conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13, is likely to be conserved in the direct progenitor virus of SARS-CoV-2. The previous epidemic and related human SARS-CoV-1 and the current pandemic SARS-CoV-2 differ in susceptibility towards IFN s with SARS-CoV-1 being more resistant<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. Furthermore, infection with SARS-CoV-2 is often asymptomatic and likely controlled by the host<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup> as lower mortality rates and higher subclinical infections suggest<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. Paradoxically, this may support the fast spread of the virus. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may have found the ‘perfect’ balance. Intermediate immune evasion and thus intermediate pathogenicity to support spread, but not kill the host. Our data shows that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 is strikingly less in efficient in IFN evasion than Nsp15 of SARS-CoV. These data are the first mechanistic evidence why SARS-CoV-1 is less susceptible towards IFN treatment than SARS-CoV-2. It may be tempting to speculate that common cold CoVs counteract the innate immune system less efficiently than SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="P32">Our analysis indicates that during a SARS-CoV-2 infection less cytokines than expected are released, autophagic turnover is blocked and general immune activation is perturbed. This is supported by a large amount of data from COVID19 patients<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). One possible explanation would be that there was no need for the virus to antagonize them. Indeed, in COVID19 patients and in vitro infections with SARS-CoV-2, IFN-γ levels are surprisingly low<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>
</sup>. Furthermore, despite high IFN-γ levels being a hallmark of cytokine storms induced by influenza viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm only has low IFN-γ levels and decreased IFN-γ expression in CD4+ T cells is associated with severe COVID19<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>

Our data indicates that effects of treatment with multiple IFNs is additive but synergistic and potentiates each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, a promising anti-viral approach may be a combinatorial treatment of different cytokines, effectively also reducing the burden of side-effects. The side effects of IFN therapy are mainly caused by inflammation. Combined with anti-inflammatory approaches such as autophagy activation by Rapamycin<sup>

<title>Proteome analysis</title>
<p id="P50">For the proteome analysis of infected cells, 0.6x106 Caco-2 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 BetaCoV/Netherlands/01/NL/2020 at an MOI of 0.5 and harvested 24 h and 48 h post infection with TM lysis buffer supplemented with 1:500 protease inhibitor. After centrifugation for 10 minutes with 14,000 rpm at 4°C, supernatant was mixed with 6xLaemmli buffer and stored at -20°C until further analysis. Then, the samples were boiled at 95°C for 10 minutes to ensure denaturation. For the proteome analysis of single overexpressed SARS-CoV-2 proteins, 1×107 HEK293T cells were transfected with the respective constructs (pCG vectors containing V5 tagged, codon optimized open reading frames (Orfs) of SARS-CoV-2 (Nsp1, Nsp7, Nsp15, Nsp16, S, E, M, N, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a)). The cells were harvested in PBS and processed for LC-MS using the iST-kit (Preomics) as recommended by the manufacturer. For LC-MS purposes, desalted peptides were injected in a nanoElute system (Bruker) and separated in a 25-cm analytical column (75μm ID, 1.6μm C18, IonOpticks) with a 100-min gradient from 2 to 37% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The effluent from the HPLC was directly electrosprayed into a hybrid trapped ion mobility-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (timsTOF Pro, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) using the nano-electrospray ion source at 1.4kV (Captive Spray, Bruker Daltonics). The timsTOF was operated at 100% duty cycle in data dependent mode to automatically switch between one full TIMS-MS scan and ten PASEF MS/MS scans in the range from 100–1700 m/z in positive electrospray mode with an overall acquisition cycle of 1.23 s. The ion mobility was scanned from 0.6 to 1.60Vs/cm2 with TIMS ion charge control set to 5e4, RF potential of 300 Vpp. The TIMS dimension was calibrated linearly using four selected ions from the Agilent ESI LC/MS tuning mix [m/z, 1/K0: (322.0481, 0.7318 Vs cm−2), (622.0289, 0.9848 Vs/cm2), (922.0097, 1.1895 Vs/cm2), (1221.9906, 1.3820 Vs/cm2)].
