<title>Summary</title>
<p id="P1">To understand the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity related to viral protection and disease severity in COVID-19, we evaluated the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome (3141 MHC-I binding peptides) to identify immunogenic T cell epitopes, and determine the level of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell involvement using DNA-barcoded peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) multimers. COVID-19 patients showed strong T cell responses, with up to 25% of all CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes specific to SARS-CoV-2-derived immunodominant epitopes, derived from ORF1 (open reading frame 1), ORF3, and Nucleocapsid (N) protein. A strong signature of T cell activation was observed in COVID-19 patients, while no T cell activation was seen in the ‘non-exposed’ and ‘high exposure risk’ healthy donors. Interestingly, patients with severe disease displayed the largest T cell populations with a strong activation profile. These results will have important implications for understanding the T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how T cell immunity might influence disease development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic caused by the highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has challenged public health at an unprecedented scale, causing the death of more than one million people so far (World Health Organization). The T-cell of the immune system is the main cell type responsible for the control and elimination of viral infections; CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are critical for the clearance of viral-infected cells, whereas CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are critical for supporting both the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response efficacy and the generation of specific antibodies. Characteristics from the ongoing pandemic suggest that T cell recognition will be critical to mediate long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cañete and Vinuesa, 2020</xref>), as the antibody-mediated response seems to decline in convalescent patients in 3-month follow-up evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Seow et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Vabret, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, studies of the closely related SARS-CoV infection shows persistent memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses even after 11 years in SARS recovered patients without B cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Peng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Tang et al., 2011</xref>), emphasizing the potential role of CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells in long-term protection from coronaviruses.</p>
<p id="P3">Several recent studies have reported robust T cell immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Peng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Weiskopf et al., 2020</xref>), and unexposed healthy individuals also showed functional T cell reactivity restricted to SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Le Bert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Grifoni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Meckiff et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Nelde et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Sekine et al., 2020</xref>). The T cell cross-reactivity is hypothesized to derive from routine exposure to common cold coronaviruses (HCoV) (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E) that are widely circulated in the population with 90% of the human population being seropositive for these viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Braun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kissler et al., 2020</xref>), which share sequence homology with the SARS-CoV-2 genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mateus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Stervbo et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">SARS-CoV-2 infection might result in mild to severe disease (including death), but also a large number of asymptomatic infections are described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Havers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Oran and Topol, 2020</xref>). The presence of pre-existing T cell immunity, represented by cross-reactive T cells, could have marked implications for how individuals respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their biological role upon encounter with SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear, and their contribution to disease protection needs to be determined. Furthermore, in severe clinical disease, cytokine release syndrome is reported, and might, in some cases, be dampened to immunosuppressive medication or anti-IL6 antibody-therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Moore and June, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Such clinical characteristics point to a potential uncontrolled immune response with the involvement of strong T cell activation.</p>
<p id="P5">T cells are activated by a specific interaction between the T cell receptor (TCR) and peptide-antigen presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of virus-infected cells. Although SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity has been reported both in the context of COVID-19 infection and pre-existing T cells, the exact antigens (minimal peptide epitope) of the viral genome associated with this immunity in COVID-19-infected patients is not fully known. Using our large-scale T cell detection technology based on DNA-barcoded peptide-MHC multimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bentzen et al., 2016</xref>), we have mapped T cell recognition throughout the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome, and identified the exact epitopes recognized by SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Furthermore, we have evaluated the phenotype characteristics of T cells recognizing these epitopes in COVID-19 patients and in healthy donors.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cell immunity is represented by strong immunodominant epitopes</title>
<p id="P6">To reveal the full spectrum of T cell immunity in COVID-19 infection, we used a complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Wu et al., 2020</xref>) to identify immunogenic minimal epitopes recognized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Using NetMHCpan 4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Reynisson et al., 2020</xref>), we selected 2204 potential HLA binding peptides (9–11 amino acids) for experimental evaluation. These peptides were predicted to bind one or more of ten prevalent and functionally diverse MHC class I (MHC-I) molecules representing HLA-A (A01:01, A02:01, A03:01, and A24:02), -B (B07:02, B08:01, B15:01), and -C (C06:02, C07:01, and C07:02) loci, leading to a total 3141 peptide-MHC specificities for experimental evaluation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). T cell reactivity towards these peptides was analyzed in 18 COVID-19-infected patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), with a mean HLA coverage of 3.1 and evaluation of an average of 972 peptides per patient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>) by our high-throughput T cell detection technology using DNA-barcoded peptide-MHC (pMHC) multimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bentzen et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, each pMHC complex is multimerized on a PE-(Phycoerythrin) or APC-(Allophycocyanin) labeled dextran backbone and tagged with a unique DNA-barcode. DNA-barcoded pMHC multimers are then pooled to generate an HLA matching patient-tailored pMHC multimer panel, which is incubated with patient-derived PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), and multimers bound to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are sorted and sequenced to identify T cell recognition towards the probed pMHC complexes. For phenotype characterization of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we combined pMHC multimer analysis with a 13-parameter antibody panel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), and for comparative evaluation, we furthermore included 39 T cell epitopes from common viruses; cytomegalovirus (<bold>C</bold>MV), Epstein-Barr virus (<bold>E</bold>BV), and influenza (<bold>F</bold>lu) virus (CEF, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">We found broad and strong SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in COVID-19 patients, contributing up to 27% of the total CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). A few epitopes showed characteristics of immunodominance, and raised T cell responses up to 25% of total CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells against two overlapping epitopes; HLA-A01:01 TTDPSFLGRY (11%), and TTDPSFLGRYM (14%), in some patient-specific T cell repertoires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). We validated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells identified with our pMHC multimer-based T cell detection technology using functional analysis in selected patient samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">In total, we identified T cell responses to 142 pMHC complexes corresponding to 122 unique T cell epitopes across the ten analyzed HLAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). HLA-A01:01, A02:01, and B15:01 dominated in terms of the total number of identified epitopes as well as the immunogenicity score (i.e., the number of T cell responses normalized to the number of probing pMHC multimers and the number of patients analyzed) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). HLA-A03:01 and C07:01 specific peptides showed the least T cell reactivity (three epitopes each) despite being analyzed in nine and six patients, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Most of the immunogenic epitopes were mapped to the ORF1 protein, followed by S and ORF3 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G and H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Given the size difference of the viral proteins, the ‘immunogenicity score’ was used to evaluate their relative contribution to T cell recognition. Based on such evaluation, we observe that peptides derived from ORF3 displayed the highest relative immunogenicity (in terms of T cell recognition), followed by ORF1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). Of the 122 epitopes recognized by T cells in the patient cohort, 13 were determined as ‘immunodominant’ based on the presence of T cell recognition in two or more patients, and prevalence of &gt;25% in the tested samples with the given HLA molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). Among these, a very robust HLA associated immunodominance was observed for two of the epitopes: HLA-A01:01-TTDPSFLGRY-specific (and its variant peptides TTDPSFLGRYM and HTTDPSFLGRY), with specific T cells detected in all five analyzed patients (estimated frequency reaching up to 25% of total CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells); and HLA-B07:02-SPRWYFYYL, with specific T cells observed in four of the five patients evaluated (estimated frequency up to 10%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). Surprisingly, in our patient cohort, none of the immunodominant epitopes were derived from the S protein, despite this being the second-largest protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">In summary, we report SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity towards several epitopes and the recurrent finding of T cell recognition towards a few immunodominant epitopes. The ORF1 protein contributes the most to T cell recognition of SARS-CoV-2, but is also by far the largest group of proteins. When protein size is taken into account, ORF3 and ORF1 contributed the most for both immunogenic and immunodominant epitopes.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Large-scale reactivity towards SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides in healthy individuals</title>
<p id="P10">Next, we analyzed healthy individuals for T cell recognition against all 3141 SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides. We selected two healthy donor cohorts; representing COVID-19 unexposed healthy individuals (HD-1; n=18, PBMCs collected before COVID-19 outbreak), and healthcare staff at high-risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure but not tested COVID-19 positive (HD2; n=20, PBMCs collected during COVID-19 outbreak). CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells of COVID-19 unexposed healthy individuals showed large-scale T cell recognition towards SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides from across the whole viral genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 6a</xref>). Cumulatively, 214 SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides were recognized by T cells in 16 out of the 18 analyzed samples. Despite such broad T cell-recognition, most of the T cell populations were of low-frequency, never exceeding 1% of total CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The high-risk COVID-19 healthy cohort showed similar T cell recognition towards 178 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 6b</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 recognizing T cell populations in this cohort were also of low frequency (less than 1% of total CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) and were identified in 15 of the 20 donors. Interestingly, while T cell recognition was seen at a substantial level in both the healthy donor cohorts; the staining-index of the pMHC multimer binding in healthy donors was significantly lower than similarly observed in patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). This might indicate a lower TCR avidity to the probed pMHC in healthy individual compared to COVID-19 patients, and could be due to potential cross-reactivity from existing T cell populations raised against other coronaviruses (such as common cold viruses HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) that share some level of sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2, as suggested in recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Le Bert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Braun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mateus et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">Forty-one of the COVID-19 immunogenic peptides, including eight of the immunodominant peptides, identified in the patient cohort were also recognized by T cells of healthy donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), this includes the two most frequently observed epitopes of SARS-CoV-2: HLA-A01:01-TTDPSFLRGY and HLA-B07:02-SPRWYFYYL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). For further validation, we expanded T cells <italic>in-vitro</italic> from several COVID-19 unexposed healthy donors and measured T cell binding using fluorophore-labeled pMHC tetramers. Based on <italic>in-vitro</italic> peptide-driven expansion pMHC tetramer binding T cell populations were verified in multiple donors for SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides, including immunodominant epitopes across four HLAs (A01:01-TTDPSFLRGY, A02:01-LLLLDRLNQL, A02:01-KLKDCVMYA, A24:02-FYAYLRKHF, and B07:02-SPRWYFYYL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Although these T cell responses were of low magnitude, a functional response (measured by IFN-γ and TNF-α) was observed in these <italic>in-vitro</italic> expanded T cell cultures when re-stimulated with individual peptide epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>) or epitope pools (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">Altogether, we show a full spectrum of functionally validated T cell recognition towards SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides in healthy donors; this is detected at low frequency and seems to have low-avidity interaction (as determined based on the staining index of the pMHC multimer interaction).</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Strong and distinct activation profile exhibited by SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in COVID-19 patients</title>
<p id="P13">Since our study design integrated T cell phenotype characterization in combination with the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell identification, we evaluated and compared phenotypic characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cell populations in COVID-19-infected patients and healthy donors. This also allowed us to evaluate whether the multimer-specific T cell profile of the high-risk COVID-19 healthy cohort (HD-2) has any distinct features compared to the unexposed cohort (HD-1). Dimensionality reduction visualization of SARS-CoV-2 multimer positive T cells using UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) showed distinct clustering for the patient cohort compared to the two healthy donor cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Patient-derived SARS-CoV-2 multimer-positive T cells were distinguished with higher expression of activation markers CD38, CD69, CD39, HLA-DR, CD57, and reduced expression of CD8 and CD27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). These features were found unique to SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, as no difference was observed between the three cohorts in similar analysis for CEF-specific multimer positive T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 6A and B</xref>). Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in patients and healthy donor cohorts showed a similar distribution of memory subsets, effector memory (E<sub>M</sub>) CCR7<sup>-</sup> CD45RA<sup>-</sup>; central memory (C<sub>M</sub>), CCR7<sup>+</sup> CD45RA<sup>-</sup>; and terminally differentiated effector memory (T<sub>EMRA</sub>), CCR7<sup>-</sup>CD45RA<sup>+</sup>; and naïve (CCR7<sup>+</sup>, CD45RA<sup>+</sup>) phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 7A and B</xref>). However, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells of the patient cohort showed unique clustering (UMAP) of EM and TEMRA and these two subsets particularly showed strong expression of the T cell activation markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 7C and D</xref>) compared to both healthy donor cohorts.</p>
<p id="P14">Phenotype analysis demonstrated a highly activated state of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, with a significantly higher fraction of such T cells expressing the inflammation marker (CD38) and early-stage activation markers (CD39, CD69, and HLA-DR), and showed a late-differentiated effector memory profile (reduced CD27) together with increased CD57 expression (not significant) compared to the two healthy donor cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). We did not observe activation of SARS-CoV-2 specific multimer-positive T cells in the high-risk COVID-19 healthy cohort, except for non-significant trends for reduced CD27 and increased CD57 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, the highly activated and differentiated T cell phenotype in the COVID-19 patients was associated with the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and not to the CEF-specific T cells detected in this cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). To further characterize the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell phenotype, we compared the expression of the T cell activation markers in combination with inflammatory response marker CD38 on multimer positive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells across the three cohorts, which showed significantly enhanced expression of activation molecules (CD39, CD69, and HLA-DR) and PD-1 inhibitory receptor on CD38<sup>+</sup> T cells only in the patient cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E and F</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">Altogether, these results demonstrate highly active and proliferative SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in COVID-19-infected patients, and distinguishes them from the potential cross-reactive T cell repertoire detected in healthy donors.</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>The severity of COVID-19 disease correlates with enhanced activation of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells</title>
<p id="P16">To dissect the association of T cells with COVID-19 disease severity, we next evaluated the phenotype characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the patient cohort related to their requirement for hospital care. Our patient cohort consists of severely diseased patients requiring hospitalization (hospitalized; n = 11) and patients with mild symptoms not requiring hospital care (outpatient; n = 7). Substantially higher frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and increased total number of epitopes were detected in samples from hospitalized patients compared to outpatient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Comparing the SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell population (multimer<sup>+</sup>) between hospitalized and outpatients for phenotype markers, we observed a clear trend in increased expression of CD38, CD39, CD69, HLA-DR (non-significant), and PD-1 (significant) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, measuring co-expression of immune activation marker CD38 together with CD39, CD69, PD-1, and HLA-DR showed a strong elevation of these combinations of activation markers in hospitalized patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C and D</xref>), suggesting a role for SARS-CoV-2 CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in severe COVID-19 infection. It should be noted that samples from hospitalized patients might have been collected relatively later after the time-of-infection compared to the outpatient cohort, which could influence the level of T cell reactivity. To solve this potential bias, ongoing studies are addressing (in detail) the kinetics of the T cell response after time-of-infection.</p>

<p id="P17">Pre-existing T cells immunity, in the context of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in COVID-19 unexposed healthy individuals, has been reported by several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Le Bert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Braun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Grifoni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mateus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Nelde et al., 2020</xref>), and it has been hypothesized that this is due to the shared sequence homology between the SARS-CoV-2 genome and other common cold coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E). Having evaluated the full spectrum of minimal epitopes for T cell recognition, we set out to evaluate the sequence homology at the peptide level, and its correlation with the SARS-CoV-2 T cell reactivity observed in the healthy donors. First, we searched for any immunogenic hot-spots across the full SARS-CoV-2 proteome by comparing the number of identified epitopes (in the patient cohort) to the total number of predicted peptides in any given region of the proteins. Generally, the epitopes were spread over the full length of the protein sequences, while clustering in minor groups throughout all regions of the viral proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Regions indicated by asterisk, demonstrates significant enrichment of T cell recognition, relative to the number of MHC-I binding peptides in a given region. Both the C- and N-terminal regions of the ORF1 seem to hold fewer T cell epitopes compared to the rest of this protein. When similarly illustrating the T cell recognition of SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides observed in healthy donors, we detected a comparable spread of T cell recognition in the healthy donor cohort. Interestingly, most T cell epitope clusters in the patient cohort coincide with T cell recognition in the healthy donor cohort. There are few areas that distinguish the T cell recognition observed in healthy donors from that observed in patients, these include: the C- and N-terminal regions of ORF1, parts of the N, and in general, a higher level of T cell recognition to S. In all those areas, T cell recognition in healthy donors exceed the observation from the patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, when evaluating the prevalence of T cell responses detected towards the immunodominant epitopes identified either from the patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>) or the healthy donor cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>), we observed that most T cell responses dominating in patients are also detected in healthy donors, while a large fraction of epitopes domination in healthy individual are exclusively detected in this cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). This points to a substantial degree of cross-recognition to SARS-CoV-2 from pre-existing T cell populations, and that such populations might, to a large extent, drive the further expansion of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P18">To further elucidate the potential origin of such a cross-reactive T cell population in the healthy donors cohort, we next evaluated the sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2 MHC-I binding peptides with the four common cold coronaviruses; HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E. With a variation limit of up to two amino acids in each peptide sequence, 15% of the total predicted peptides showed sequence similarity with one or more HCoV peptide sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>, <bold>grey pie</bold>). Among the T cell recognized peptides, in both the patient and healthy donor cohorts, respectively, this fraction was comparable with 19% and 16% of T cell recognized peptides sharing sequence homology with one or more HCoV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). As an alternative approach the similarities were calculated by kernel method for amino acid sequences using BLOSUM62, indicating comparable sequence similarity of peptides recognized by T cells and those not recognized in reference to HCoV. However, interestingly, peptides of lowest similarity were not recognized by T cells in the patient cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">As T cell cross-recognition can often be driven by a few key interaction points, predominantly in the ‘core’ of the peptide sequence (i.e., position 3–8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Calis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Frankild et al., 2008</xref>), we restricted the sequence similarity to the core of the peptide that would most likely interact with the TCR(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bentzen et al., 2018</xref>). Based on the protein-core only, up to 74% of all the identified epitopes showed sequence homology to HCoV (one or more) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting these common cold viruses as a potential source of the observed low-avidity interactions in healthy donors. Further, when evaluating peptides frequently recognized by T cells in both the patients and the healthy cohort, we find evidence of substantial homology, as exemplified with the peptide sequences listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>. However, similar sequence homology is observed for the peptide sequences that are recognized only in the patient cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, at present, our data points to substantial T cell cross recognition being involved in shaping the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients, however, we find no specific enrichment of T cell recognition to peptide sequences with large sequence homology compared to the total peptide library being evaluated, and the responses that are identified in the patient samples only does not hold a more SARS-CoV-2 unique signature than those recognized in both cohorts. Interestingly, however, ORF1 being one of the elements displaying the highest T cell recognition immunogenicity, also display the highest sequence identity to HCoV (40%, as oppose to 22-34% for all other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, calculated using direct sequence alignment). Seeking to fully understand the role and origin of the underlying T cell cross-recognition will likely require an in-depth evaluation of pre- and post-infection samples.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P20">We identified CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to 122 epitopes in 18 COVID-19 patients after screening for T cell recognition based on 3141 peptides derived from the full SARS-CoV-2 genome, and selected based on their predicted HLA-binding capacity. Of these, a few dominant T cell epitopes were recognized in the majority of the patients. Strikingly, both dominant and subdominant T cell epitopes were cross-recognized by low-level existing T cell populations in SARS-CoV-2 unexposed healthy individuals. We have observed that the SARS-CoV-2 dominant epitopes mount very strong T cell responses, with up to 25% of all CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes specific to a single epitope (two overlapping peptides with same peptide core).</p>
<p id="P21">Pre-existing immunity based on cross-reactive T cells can influence how our immune system reacts upon viral exposure. One way could be via faster expansion of pre-existing memory cells upon initial exposure to viral infection. A similar outcome and benefit of pre-existing T cell immunity have been shown in the case of flu pandemic virus H1N1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Sridhar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Wilkinson et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, hyperactivation of pre-existing T cells can contribute to short- and long-term disease severity via inflammation and autoimmunity, as increased production of IFN-γ by CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells has been observed in severe COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, it has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Ehrenfeld et al., 2020</xref>) that SARS-CoV-2 infection can be a triggering factor for autoimmune reactions and severe pneumonia with sepsis leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bone-marrow affection with pancytopenia and organ-specific autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Gagiannis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Henderson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hersby et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, pre-existing T cell immunity can influence vaccination outcomes, as they can induce a faster and better immune response. The ORF1 protein regions are highly conserved within coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cui et al., 2019</xref>), and show the highest HCoV identity among SARS-CoV-2 proteins; and most of the immunodominant epitopes that we have identified belong to the ORF1 region. Thus, a detailed evaluation of these T cell epitopes could be of value in vaccine design.</p>
<p id="P22">Most vaccine-development efforts are currently focusing on mounting antibody-responses to the spike protein, with limited focus on T cell immunity. However, studies point to a potential fast decline in antibody titers after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Seow et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Vabret, 2020</xref>), and such kinetics might be similar following vaccinations. Thus, the involvement of T cell immunity might be a relevant focus if antibody titers cannot sufficiently protect against infections. In such scenarios, T cell immunity can sustain the antibody responses and provide a direct source of T cells clearing virus-infected cells. For the involvement of T cell immunity in vaccine development, our data suggest that the inclusion of other virus proteins, such as ORF1 or 3, might be highly relevant.</p>
<p id="P23">T cell recognition of SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides in both COVID-19 patients and healthy donors has prompted us to understand the role of T cell cross-reactivity in controlling infections. In recent years, technology improvements in TCR characterization have allowed us to interrogate the TCR-pMHC interaction from a structural approach, while obtaining experimental information related to the peptide amino acids that are crucial to T cell recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adams et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bentzen and Hadrup, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Birnbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Garcia et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Linette et al., 2013</xref>). Such efforts have taught us that T cell cross-recognition is very difficult to predict, without knowing the precise interaction required for the given TCR, as even T cell epitopes with as low as 40% sequence homology can be recognized by a given TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bentzen et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the underlining source of T cell cross-reactivity might arise from a larger set of epitopes within the HCoV viruses, including sequences with larger variation than those evaluated here (i.e., max. two amino acid variants per peptide sequence/peptide core).</p>
<p id="P24">While the T cell recognition itself was largely overlapping in identity between patients and healthy donors, the magnitude for the T cell responses and, in particular, the T cell phenotype of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells was substantially different. A unique phenotype characterization demonstrated a strong activation profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells only in patients. This strong ‘activation signature’ (high expression of CD38, CD39, CD69, PD1) was further enhanced in patients requiring hospitalization. Such strong and highly activated T cell responses should be able to clear the virus, and hence our data further support the notion that some severely affected patients might suffer from hyperactivation of their T cell compartment as a consequence of their primary viral infection, which may even be cleared.</p>
<p id="P25">Taken together, the data presented here demonstrate a substantial role for T cell recognition in COVID-19, and in-depth evaluations in larger cohorts over time will provide essential insight to the role of such T cells in disease severity and how pre-existing T cell immunity can be leveraged to fight novel infections.</p>

<title>Clinical samples</title>
<p id="P26">Approval for the study design and sample collection was obtained from the Commitee on Health Research Ethics in the Capital Region of Denmark. All included patients and health care employees gave their informed written consent for inclusion. PBMC samples from 18 COVID-19 infected patients were used in this study. Blood samples were collected as close as possible to the first COVID-19 positive test. The patient cohort included samples from individuals with severe symptoms who required hospital care (hospitalized; n = 11) and patients with mild symptoms not requiring hospital care (outpatient; n = 7). For hospitalized patients, we collected full data from the medical record regarding disease course, age, gender, travel history, performance status, symptoms, comorbidity, medications, laboratory findings, diagnostic imaging, treatment, need of oxygen, need for intensive care, and an overall estimate of disease severity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). For outpatients, we used a questionnaire to collect data on comorbidity, travel history, medications, and performance status.</p>
<p id="P27">COVID-19 infection was diagnosed by one of the four platforms; BGI (BGI Covid-19 RT-PCR kit), PantherFusion (Hologic), Roche Flow (Roche MagNA Pure 96, Roche LightCycler 480 II real-time PCR), and Qiaflow (QIAsymphony or RotorGene, Qiagen). In the last three platforms, LightMix Modular SARS-CoV (COVID-19) E-gene (# 53-0776-96) has been used. The diversity of platforms used were due to supply issues. All platforms were validated using validation kits and panels from the Statens Serum Institute (SSI), Denmark. Most patients had more than one positive test for COVID-19. Swabs, sputum, and tracheal secretion were used depending on the setting.</p>
<p id="P28">For the pre-COVID-19 healthy donor cohort (n = 18), we used samples collected prior to October 2019 and obtained from the central blood bank, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, in an anonymized form. Additionally, we included 20 health care employees from Herlev Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic, who were at high risk of COVID-19 infection but not positive, as a cohort to follow immune responses in a potentially exposed population.</p>
<p id="P29">PBMCs from all three cohorts were isolated immediately after sampling using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare) density gradient centrifugation and were cryopreserved thereafter at a density of 2–20 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL.</p>

For peptides predicted from ORF1 protein, a percentile rank binding threshold of 0.5% was used, and for peptides derived from all other proteins, a threshold of 1% was used. Altogether, 2203 peptides were selected, binding to one or more HLA molecules, generating 3141 peptide-HLA pairs for experimental evaluation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). All peptides were custom synthesized by Pepscan Presto BV, Lelystad, The Netherlands.

<p id="P31">All ten MHC-I monomer types were produced using methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Saini et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, MHC-I heavy chain and human ß2-microglobulin (hß2m) were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> using pET series expression plasmids. Soluble denatured proteins of the heavy chain and hß2m were harvested using inclusion body preparation.

<title>DNA-barcoded multimer library preparation</title>
<p id="P32">The DNA-barcoded multimer library was prepared using the method developed by Bentzen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bentzen et al., 2016</xref>). Unique barcodes were generated by combining different A and B oligos, with each barcode representing a 5' biotinylated unique DNA sequence. These barcodes were attached to phycoerythrin (PE) or allophycocyanin (APC) and streptavidin-conjugated dextran (Fina BioSolutions, Rockville, MD, USA) by incubating them at 4°C for 30 min to generate a DNA-barcode-dextran library of 1325 unique barcode specificities. SARS-CoV-2 pMHC libraries were generated by incubating 200 μM peptide of each peptide with 100 μg/mL of respective MHC molecules for 1 h using UV-mediated peptide exchange (HLA-A01:01, A03:01, B07:02, B08:01, B15:01, C06:02, C07:01, and C07:02) or direct binding to empty MHC molecules (HLA-A02:01 and A24:02). HLA-specific DNA-barcoded multimer libraries were then generated by incubating pMHC monomers to their corresponding DNA barcode dextrans at 4°C for 30 min, thus providing a DNA barcode-labeled dextran for each peptide-MHC (pMHC multimer) specifically to probe respective T cell population. A similar process was followed to generate DNA-barcoded pMHC multimers for CEF epitopes using APC- and streptavidin-conjugated dextran attached with unique barcodes.</p>

Patient and healthy donor HLA-matching SARS-CoV2 and CEF pMHC multimer libraries were pooled (as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bentzen et al., 2016</xref>)) and incubated with 5–10 × 10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs (thawed and washed twice in RPMI + 10% FCS, and washed once in barcode cytometry buffer) for 15 min at 37°C at a final volume of 60 μL.

<p id="P34">Cells fixed after staining with pMHC-multimers were acquired on a FACSAria flow cytometer instrument (AriaFusion, Becton Dickinson) and gated by the FACSDiva acquisition program (Becton Dickinson), and all the PE-positive (SARS-CoV-2 multimer binding) and APC-positive (CEF multimer binding) cells of CD8<sup>+</sup> gate were sorted into pre-saturated tubes (2% BSA, 100 μl barcode cytometry buffer) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9A</xref>). Sorted cells belonging to each sample were then subjected to PCR amplification of its associated DNA barcode(s). Cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 × g, and the supernatant was discarded with minimal residual volume. The remaining pellet was used as the PCR template for each of the sorted samples and amplified using the Taq PCR Master Mix Kit (Qiagen, 201443) and sample-specific forward primer (serving as sample identifier) A-key36.

<title>DNA-barcode sequence analysis and identification of pMHC specificities</title>
<p id="P35">To process the sequencing data and automatically identify the barcode sequences, we designed a specific software package, ‘Barracoda’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?Barracoda-1.8">https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?Barracoda-1.8</ext-link>). This software tool identifies the barcodes used in a given experiment, assigns sample ID and pMHC specificity to each barcode, and calculates the total number of reads and clonally reduced reads for each pMHC-associated DNA barcode. Furthermore, it includes statistical processing of the data. Details are given in Bentzen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bentzen et al., 2016</xref>). The analysis of barcode enrichment was based on methods designed for the analysis of RNA-seq data and was implemented in the R package edgeR. Fold changes in read counts mapped to a given sample relative to mean read counts mapped to triplicate baseline samples were estimated using normalization factors determined by the trimmed mean of M-values. P-values were calculated by comparing each experiment individually to the mean baseline sample reads using a negative binomial distribution with a fixed dispersion parameter set to 0.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bentzen et al., 2016</xref>). False-discovery rates (FDRs) were estimated using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Specific barcodes with an FDR &lt; 0.1% were defined as significant, determining T cell recognition in the given sample. At least 1/1000 reads associated with a given DNA barcode relative to the total number of DNA barcode reads in that given sample was set as the threshold to avoid false-positive detection of T cell populations due to the low number of reads in the baseline samples. T cell frequency associated with each significantly enriched barcode was measured based on the % read count of the associated barcode out of the total % multimer-positive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells population. In order to exclude potential pMHC elements binding to T cells in a non-specific fashion, non-HLA-matching healthy donor material was included as a negative control. Any T cell recognition determined in this samples was subtracted from the full data set.</p>

Epitopes were considered successes and the count of ligands were regarded as the number of trials in a binomial test.

<p id="P41">The similarity of SARS-CoV-2 ligands and epitopes from both patient and healthy donor cohorts to a set of human common cold corona viruses (HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43) was tested using two methods. The first approach utilized a kernel method for amino acid sequences using BLOSUM62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Shen et al., 2012</xref>). The second approach was a simple string search allowing up to two mismatches. Based on the second approach each epitope was categorized by how many, if any, of the common cold viruses it would match with. Both methods were applied to the full peptide length and to the peptide core.</p>

<title>Data processing and statistics</title>
<p id="P42">T cell recognition was determined based on the DNA-barcoded pMHC multimer analysis and evaluated through ‘baracoda’ (see above). The data was plotted using python 3.7.4. For all plots, peptide sequences with no significant enrichments are shown as gray dots and all peptide with a negative enrichment are set to LogFc equal zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E, G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Box plots for data quantification and visualization were generated, and their related statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C, D, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, B, D</xref>) or R studio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). For unpaired comparisons Mann-Whitney test was done using GraphPad Prism, all p values are indicated in figure legends. Flow Cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo (version 10). Immunogenicity scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F, H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>) were calculated (as %) by dividing total identified T cell reactivity associated with a HLA or protein with the total number of specificities analyzed in a given cohort (number of peptides multiplied by number of patient with a given HLA). Staining index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) was calculated as; ((mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of multimer<sup>+</sup> cells – MFI of multimer<sup>-</sup> cells)/2 × standard deviation (SD) of multimer<sup>-</sup> cells)). MFI of multimer<sup>+</sup> and multimer<sup>-</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and the SD of the multimer<sup>-</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from FlowJo analysis for patient and healthy donor samples.</p>

(<bold>B</bold>) Experimental pipeline to analyze for T cell recognition towards the 3141 SARS-CoV-2-derived HLA-binding peptides in PBMCs using DNA-barcoded peptide-MHC (pMHC) multimers. A 13-antibody panel was used for phenotype analysis of pMHC multimer positive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. pMHC multimers binding CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were sorted based on PE (SARS-CoV-2-specific) or APC (CEF-specific) signal, and sequenced to identify antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. (<bold>C</bold>) Representative flow cytometry plot of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from a COVID patient stained with pMHC multimer panel showing SARS-CoV-2 (PE) and CEF (APC) multimer<sup>+</sup> T cells that were sorted for DNA-barcode analysis to identify epitopes recognition. <bold>D</bold>) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell recognition to individual epitopes were identified based on the enrichment of DNA barcodes associated with each of the tested peptide specificities (LogFc&gt;2 and p &lt; 0.001, <italic>barracoda</italic>).
