<abstract>
<p id="P1">The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic currently prevails worldwide. To understand the immunological signature of SARS-CoV-2 infections and aid the search for treatments and vaccines, comprehensive characterization of adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 is needed. We investigated the breadth and potency of antibody-, and T-cell immune responses, in 203 recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who presented with asymptomatic to severe infections. We report very broad serological profiles with cross-reactivity to other human coronaviruses. Further, &gt;99% had SARS-CoV-2 epitope specific antibodies, with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and spike-ACE2 receptor interaction blocking observed in 95% of individuals. A significant positive correlation between spike-ACE2 blocking antibody titers and neutralization potency was observed. SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses were clear and quantifiable in 90% of HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> individuals. The viral surface spike protein was identified as the dominant target for both neutralizing antibodies and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Overall, the majority of patients had robust adaptive immune responses, regardless of disease severity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The year of 2020 has been thoroughly marked by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Originating in China December 2019, the outbreak was formally declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. With millions of cases confirmed across 200 countries, the virus has claimed more than 1.4 million lives as of early December 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is an ongoing health crisis, which is extensively affecting almost all aspects of the global human society. An important aspect of SARS-CoV-2 replication is binding and infection of the host cell. The viral spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), found on the cell surface, thereby mediating viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms manifest primarily as a respiratory disease, with emergent complications of several organs in cases of severe disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. While efforts are converging globally to develop an effective vaccine[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], our broader basic understanding of the adaptive immune response towards SARS-CoV-2 is still limited.</p>
<p id="P3">Several studies have described the general adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2, showing that SARS-CoV-2 specific B and T cells are generated during infections. First immunoglobulin (Ig) M and later IgG SARS-CoV-2 spike specific antibodies are readily detected in COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Evaluations by neutralization assays have confirmed the ability of the generated antibodies to prevent viral infections <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. The limited number of confirmed cases suffering reinfections post recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], and high degree of protective immunity against viral re-challenge shown <italic>in vivo</italic> in macaque challenge studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], suggest that the immunological response developed during primary infections provide at least some protection against reinfection. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell activation has also been documented in a range of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. However, most studies have been limited to specific disease severity populations, and small or none RT-PCR verified cohorts.</p>
<p id="P4">Currently, in depth characterization of the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a large cohort representing the full disease spectrum, as well as the development of functional, and easily scalable, serological assays, are needed to guide and support rapid further vaccine development. Here, we have delineated the humoral and cellular immune responses in 203, RT-PCR verified, recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients. We evaluated the quantity and potency of antibodies in each individual towards several different coronaviruses and antigens, using both a SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus neutralization assay and a novel Mesoscale Diagnostics (MSD) multiplex platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. We further quantified the breadth and magnitude of single-epitope SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, using dextramer flow cytometry. Thus, we report an extensive panel of adaptive immune parameters in the context of disease severity, to provide an outline of the general broad and functional SARS-CoV-2 specific adaptive immune response observed across the full COVID-19 disease spectrum.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Patient enrollment</title>
<p id="P5">We studied the adaptive immune response towards SARS-CoV-2 among 203 patients who had recovered from COVID-19. We have recently described the cohorts clinical characteristics thoroughly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] a basic overview of which is shown in table 1. The median age of individuals was 47 years (range: 21 – 79), and 45% were female. The cohort was divided into three COVID-19 disease severity groups. 1: Home/outpatients with no limitation of daily activities (8%), 2: Home/outpatients with a limitation of daily activities (75%), and 3: Hospitalized patients (17%). The median duration of COVID-19 symptoms was 13 days (range: 0 – 68). Enrollment occurred at least 14 days after the end of COVID-19 related symptoms, with a median of 31 (range: 14 – 61) days from time of recovery to study enrollment. To allow comparison of immunological outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection recovered patients, samples from 10 healthy individuals enrolled in a study conducted prior to the current COVID-19 pandemic were included as controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p>
<p id="P6">All individuals were assigned a COVID-19 severity group depending on their course of disease. Group 1 consisted of asymptomatic individuals with no limitations in their daily activities. Group 2 of moderately sick, able to recover at home. Finally, group 3 comprises all hospitalized individuals, including those with/without oxygen requirement and/or ICU admission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Human coronavirus serology</title>
<p id="P7">First, we analyzed the presence of IgG antibodies towards multiple human coronaviruses in serum, using the multiplex MSD platform. Compared to controls, we found significantly elevated levels of IgG antibodies in spike RBD, spike N-terminal domain (NTD), and the nucleocapsid (p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). Furthermore, IgG antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals exhibited strongly increased reactivity towards spike protein from other human beta coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), as compared to the controls. Further, increased IgG levels towards the seasonal beta coronavirus strains: HKU1 and OC43, compared to IgG from the control group were also observed (p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). No difference was detected in IgG levels to the negative bovine serum albumin (BSA) control between SARS-CoV-2 patients and controls. Importantly, 202 out of the 203 individuals analyzed here, developed detectable antibodies, otherwise absent in the historical controls, against both full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD antigens, during SARS-CoV-2 infections. Likewise, robust production of IgA antibodies was also observed for nearly all infected individuals, with SARS-CoV-2 spike specific IgA levels being significantly elevated compared to controls in 201 of the 203 individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels towards both spike and nucleocapsid antigens, correlated positively with the disease severity. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D+E</xref>). Overall, we conclude that more than 99% of the SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in this cohort had readily detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen, and that broad IgG immunological recognition of SARS-CoV-2 with cross-reactivity to several different coronavirus develops during COVID-19. Additionally, the magnitude of spike-targeting antibodies increases with disease severity.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization</title>
<p id="P8">Next, we investigated the functional neutralization capacity of total plasma antibodies <italic>in vitro,</italic> using VSV pseudotyped virus expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Antibody neutralizing potency was evaluated by serial dilutions of plasma, yielding infectivity titration curves for each of the SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). We found that 95.5% of the individuals (193 of 202) were able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoviruses and provided 100% inhibition at the lowest (1:25) plasma dilution. IC50 values were extrapolated from the neutralization curves, and assigned to each individual as a measure of antibody neutralization potency. Serum from the remaining nine individuals (4.5%) were unable to fully neutralize viral infection, producing neutralization curves comparable to that of the uninfected controls. No legitimate IC50 value could be calculated for these individual, and consequently they were excluded from further analyses using this parameter. Collectively, the IC50 values of all 193 neutralizing individuals span evenly across four orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). In concurrence with the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D+E</xref>, we observed lower IC50 values among individuals experiencing mild symptoms compared to those with moderate (p&lt;0.001) or severe COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>). We conclude that in this large cohort, with considerable diversity in disease severity, the vast majority (&gt;95 %) of SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to the production of effective neutralizing antibodies, and that neutralization potency increases with disease severity.</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>Antibodies efficiently block ACE2 receptor binding</title>
<p id="P9">We continued the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 antibody functionality, using an MSD SARS-CoV Spike – ACE2 competition assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). This allowed us to measure the quantity of antibodies able to block the interaction between the ACE2 receptor and SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and SARS-CoV-1 spike protein. Many of the recovered individuals reached the assay's upper limit of quantification, and a clear increase in the quantities of serum ACE2 blocking antibodies was observed for all three antigens compared to historic controls (p≤0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). The levels of antibodies blocking SARS-CoV-2 Spike – ACE2 receptor interaction was increased in &gt;99% of the individuals (202 of 203) compared to uninfected controls. The individual antibody concentrations also correlated to the time from disease recovery to inclusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig 1</xref>). Nevertheless, we found that those experiencing severe COVID-19 had significantly greater levels of SARS-CoV-2 spike specific ACE2 blocking antibodies, compared to individuals with mild to moderate disease (p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). Both the pseudovirus cell-based neutralization assay and the SARS-CoV Spike – ACE2 competition assay investigate the presence of functional antibodies towards SARS-CoV-2. We identified a highly significant correlation between the IC50 values from the pseudovirus neutralization assay and the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 spike specific antibodies capable of blocking ACE2 receptor interaction (p&gt;0.0001 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>). In conclusion, we observed that nearly all individuals produce antibodies that target the spike protein-ACE2-receptor interaction and that the level of these antibodies was increased with severe disease. Further, the virus neutralization capacity increased in conjunction with the amount of functional ACE2 blocking antibody present in serum.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>Collected serological analysis</title>
<p id="P10">Next, we constructed a heatmap compiling all humoral immunological data, to gain a cohort wide perspective of the overall antibody response developed during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We ranked individuals according to their antibody response potency from the pseudovirus neutralization assay (IC50 value), displaying their respective immunological variables underneath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). We observed, that the neutralization capacity was clearly linked to the overall antibody levels present in the patients. Interestingly, it was further evident, that the best (top 10%) neutralizers of the cohort displayed a corresponding increase in the overall breadth of their antibody response, towards all the investigated coronavirus antigens. Importantly, strong pseudovirus neutralization profiles were almost exclusively seen in individuals with antibodies that potently block spike-ACE2 receptor interaction. We therefore conclude that the best neutralizers exhibit a broader variety of cross-reactive antibodies and have greater levels of spike binding and receptor-blocking antibodies.</p>

<sec id="S8">
<title>Epitope specific CD8+ T cell-responses</title>
<p id="P11">We then went on to explore the epitope specific T-cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals. We analyzed the reactivity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from 106 HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> individuals in the cohort for their specificity to nine different SARS-CoV-2 epitopes using dextramer staining flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>). Overall, Membrane<sub>61-70</sub> (M) (epitope 1), Nucleocapsid<sub>222-230</sub> (N) (epitope 3), and Spike<sub>269-277</sub> (S) (epitope 6) were the most commonly recognized epitopes with positive responses detected in 17%, 25% and 81% of individuals, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>). Interestingly, these three epitopes originate from three separate SARS-CoV-2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>). The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells was similar across all nine HLA-A2+ epitopes tested, with the highest individual responses observed for N<sub>222-230</sub> and S<sub>269-277</sub> (epitopes 3 and 6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C</xref>). Only 10% of the HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> individuals (11 of 106) had no detectable response to any of the epitopes tested, while the remaining 90% responded to at least one, and up to seven, of the analyzed epitopes. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref>). We compared the cumulative frequency of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells across the disease severity groups and observed no significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref>). However, we did observe significant albeit weak correlations between the cumulative frequency of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and the majority of the serological immunological parameters analyzed, including pseudovirus neutralization IC50 values as well as SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody production and ACE2 blocking ability, as outlined with correlation coefficients in table 2. The 11 individuals with no detectable CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses were evenly distributed among the disease severity groups and displayed varying antibody neutralization capacity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig 3</xref>). Based on this we were only able to identify two individuals with both no detectable neutralizing antibodies and no detectable CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses. Thus, we conclude that 90% of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals mount a detectable CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response, towards the nine epitopes tested, irrespectively of disease severity. We further conclude that the broadest targeted epitope in this cohort is located in the spike protein. Lastly, there is an overall weak but statistically significant correlation of antibody responses and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P13">We aimed to characterize the cellular and humoral adaptive immune response in a large cohort of RT-PCR verified SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients, spanning a full spectrum of COVID-19 severity. Overall, our results show that the majority of patients developed a robust and broad both humoral and cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2. However, our data may also help explain that some rare individuals have no detectable immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2, and will therefore be at risk of re-infection as it has been reported in a few case reports[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p>
<p id="P14">We were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in all but one of the 203 individuals investigated, irrespectively of their disease severity and duration of symptoms. Antibody specificity was distributed across several SARS-CoV-2 antigens, and with cross coronavirus serological activity observed against SARS-CoV-1, MERS, HKU1, and OC43 human coronaviruses. We assume this reflects cross-reactivity of the antibodies generated against SARS-CoV-2 for two reasons: First, due to the clear significant difference to the pre-pandemic controls, and secondly because no cases of SARS-CoV-1 or MERS have been documented in Denmark. We interpret this as an indication of extensive and broad immune recognition development in COVID-19 patients. Similar to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], we confirmed the functionally neutralizing and ACE2 blocking capabilities of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD specific antibodies. Noticeably, this infers the development of a robust humoral immune response within the vast majority of the COVID-19 recovered population. Furthermore, nearly all individuals also have SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA responses, clearly indicating a functional rigorous class switching and maturation. This presence of IgA is crucial for the immunological protection at mucosal barriers, and hence protection against future SARS-CoV-2 exposures.</p>
<p id="P15">All serological and functional data collected show that both antibody levels and neutralization potency correlate significantly with the disease severity. This indicates that severe disease manifestation is not caused by a lack of adaptive immunity, which is in line with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Hence, we suggest that the prolonged disease course, and consequent larger exposure to virus experienced in hospitalized patients, may provide a timeframe in which enhanced antibody affinity maturation takes place, compared to shorter course mild infections.</p>
<p id="P16">Studies are conflicted on the degree to which cross-reactive immunity between different coronavirus develop during SARS-CoV-2 infections [11, 13, 14, 28, 30-33]. The considerable diversity of antigen recognition independent of COVID-19 severity shown here, demonstrates that at least some immunological cross-recognition of several different coronavirus is developed during SARS-CoV-2 infections. This is in line with data on cross-reactivity in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell epitopes between seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. The cross-reactivity observed between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, may be due to conserved epitopes between these viruses, as prior infections with SARS-CoV-1 or MERS within our cohort are highly unlikely.</p>
<p id="P17">Such potential cross-reactivity could arise through either newly generated SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies reacting with conserved epitopes, or by reactivation of memory cells originally generated against seasonal coronaviruses, followed by affinity maturation. Importantly, the multiplex serological analyses we performed do not provide insight into the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response on a monoclonal antibody level. Here, further studies are needed to determine possible protective and cross-reactive properties of single-antibody specificities.</p>
<p id="P18">We functionally verified the antibody responses in all individuals, using two separate assays. The cell-based pseudovirus neutralization assays are at present the standard method for determining SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody potency. We additionally used the MSD novel coronavirus multiplex assay, recently reported by Johnson <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>] to determine the ACE2 blocking capability of individual serum antibodies. The significant correlation between the two assay readouts identifies the plate format ACE2 competition assay as a powerful, high-throughput, screening tool, with applications in both SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic neutralizing antibody development, and assessments of functional protective antibody induction in vaccine studies. An immense global effort is currently undertaken to develop effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the majority of which are centered on inducing spike or RBD antigen specific immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 spike specific, ACE2 blocking antibodies are found in the majority of infected individuals. Their extensive induction, even in short-term, asymptomatic infections, align with current vaccines designs inducing protective immunity based on spike antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Nevertheless, the protective effect of antibodies elicited during natural infections, remains to be determined.</p>
<p id="P19">We further report, with single-epitope resolution, a SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response in 90% of the HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> individuals analyzed. This corresponds well with other studies reporting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation in 70%–100% of recovered patients using full protein overlapping peptide stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. The location of the top three immunogenic epitopes within separate proteins in the viral proteome additionally reinforces our conclusion that a broad immune response is generated towards SARS-CoV-2 in the general infected population. T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-1 is known to persist for up to six years, in contrast to B-cell immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], underlining the importance of developing protective cell based immunity to SARS-CoV-2 if long term viral protection is to be reached. As an important point, the most broadly recognized CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell epitope (S2<sub>69-277</sub>) within our cohort (responses detected in 81% of HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> individuals) is located in the spike antigen. Thus, such epitope specificity can clearly be used to evaluate CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell immunity in spike focused vaccine developments currently underway.</p>
<p id="P20">Surprisingly, we found that the cumulative CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response, across all epitopes, did not vary by disease severity in contrast to what we, and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], observed with antibody levels. While the limited coverage of epitopes investigated here may influence this observation, recent evidence suggests that persistent viral replication in otherwise recovered patients may be linked to CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response magnitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Despite the different observations with regard to immune responses and disease severity, we found overall significant relationships between humoral and T-cell based immunity, but all of modest strength. A possible explanation could be a synchronized waning of the magnitude of response for both immune parameters during the time from recovery to study enrollment.</p>
<p id="P21">Of note, the use of dextramer staining is limited by inclusion of selected epitopes only, and conclusions are consequently limited to the relative low epitope coverage. However, the advantages of the dextramer technology are superior sensitivity and a high degree of specificity. In the light of the relative low proteome coverage, the fact that only 10% of the investigated individuals did not have a detectable CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response clearly indicate a strong cytotoxic T-cell component in the immune response towards SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, as our observations of breadth and magnitude in relation to the distribution of distinct SARS-CoV-2 antigens are similar to others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] we conclude that the panel of dextramers applied here provide a new and sensitive representation of the general CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 that will be an important tool in assessing long-term immunity following primary infection or vaccination.</p>
<p id="P22">In conclusion, we observed that disease severity is closely related to the potency and breadth of the antibody response towards SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we identified the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a target of adaptive immunity in &gt;99% of the cohort, irrespective of COVID-19 symptom manifestation. Only two individuals (&lt;2%) had neither antibodies with virus neutralization capacity, nor detectable CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses. Hence, we conclude that regardless of COVID-19 severity, a robust adaptive immune response towards SARS-CoV-2 is elicited during primary infections.</p>

<title>Study design and sample collection</title>
<p id="P23">Samples were collected from a cohort of 203 individuals who had recovered from COVID-19. Participants were enrolled at Department of Infectious Diseases at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark from April 3<sup>rd</sup> to May 29<sup>th</sup> 2020. Inclusion criteria were as follows; 1) Age above 18 years; 2) PCR verified SARS-CoV-2 within the preceding 12 weeks; 3) Full recovery from acute COVID-19 illness; 4) Able to give informed consent. Exclusion criteria were; 1) Ongoing febrile illness; 2) Immunosuppressive treatment and/or known immunodeficiency; 3) Pregnancy. Samples were collected at least 14 days after recovery and a maximum of 12 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 PCR-verified diagnosis. One patient ID116 only had serum collected, and thus is absent from IC50 and T-cell analyses.</p>
<p id="P24">Individuals were allocated to three groups according to the severity of COVID-19 illness, based on the criteria: 1) Home/outpatient, not experiencing any limitations in daily activities; 2) Home/outpatient, certain limitations in daily activity level (fever, bedridden during illness); 3) All hospitalized patients, regardless of need for supplemental oxygen treatment, or ICU admission with/without mechanical ventilation. Additional data regarding demographic and clinical characteristics of this cohort has been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].</p>

<title>Serology</title>
<p id="P25">IgG antibodies were measured in serum samples using the MSD Coronavirus Plate 1 Cat. No. N05357A-1, MesoScale Discovery, Rockville, Maryland), a solid phase multiplex immunoassay, with 10 pre-coated antigen spots in a 96-well format, with an electro-chemiluminescence based detection system. The SARS-CoV-2 related antigens spotted were CoV-2 Spike, CoV-2 RBD, CoV-2 NTD, and CoV-2 nucleocapsid. The remaining spots comprised antigens from other respiratory pathogens: Spike protein from SARS-CoV-1, MERS coronavirus, and two seasonal coronaviruses OC43, HKU1. BSA served as negative control, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Unspecific antibody binding was blocked using MSD Blocker A (Cat. No. R93AA-1). COVID-19 patient serum samples and control samples were diluted 1:4630 in MSD Diluent 100 (Cat. No. R50AA-3). After sample incubation, bound IgG was detected by incubation with MSD SULFO-TAG Anti-Human IgG Antibody and subsequently measured on a MESO QuickPlex SQ 120 Reader (Cat. No. AI0AA-0) after addition of GOLD Read Buffer B (Cat. No. R60AM-2).</p>

<sec id="S13">
<title>ACE2 Competition Assay</title>
<p id="P26">Spike and RBD targeting antibodies with the ability to compete with ACE2 binding were measured using the MSD Coronavirus Plate 1. COVID-19 blocking antibody calibrator and 1:10 diluted patient and control serum samples were incubated after plate blocking. SULFO-Tag conjugated ACE2 was added before washing, allowing ACE2 to compete with antibody binding to spike and RBD antigens immobilized on the plate. Bound ACE2 was detected as described for the serology assay above, and antibody concentrations were subsequently calculated using the MSD Discovery Workbench software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S14">
<title>ELISA</title>
<p id="P27">IgA antibodies were measured using the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA ELISA from Euroimmun (Euroimmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG, Lübeck, Germany, Cat. No. El 2606-9601 A), according to manufacturer's instructions. In brief, antibodies in serum samples diluted 1:200 were captured by recombinant S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein immobilized in microplate wells. IgA type antibodies were detected by incubation with peroxidase labelled anti-human IgA followed by a chromogen solution, resulting in color development in positive wells. Signal was read at 450 nm with reference measurements at 650 nm, which were used for background signal corrections. Results were analyzed relative to the ELISA kit calibrator, as a ratio between sample absorbance and calibrator absorbance.</p>

<title>Cells and plasmids</title>
<p id="P28">All cell lines were incubated at 37 °C and 5 % CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified atmosphere. BHK-G43, previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>], were cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (DMEM), containing 5 % Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 50 U/mL Penicillin G/Streptomycin (P/S), where Zeocin (100µg/ml) and Hygromycin (50µg/ml) were added at every fourth passage. Induction of VSV-G glycoprotein was performed with 10<sup>−8</sup>M mifepristone. HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM, containing 10% FBS and 50 U/mL P/S. Vero76 cmyc hTMPRSS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 U/mL P/S, and 10 μg/mL Blasticidin.</p>
<p id="P29">The construction of pCG1-SARS-2-Spike has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Briefly, SARS-2-S (NCBI Ref.Seq: YP_009724390.1) coding sequence was PCR-amplified and cloned into the pCG1 expression vector via BamHI and XbaI restriction sites.</p>

<title>Virus production</title>
<p id="P30">For generation of VSV*∆G(luc)-G particles BHK-G43 cells were seeded day 1 to reach a confluence of 70-80% at day 2, where Mifepristone (10<sup>−8</sup> M) was added to induce transcription of glycoprotein G. After 6 hours the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 5% FBS, 50 U/mL P/S, and VSV*∆G(luc) at MOI = 0.3. After 1 hour of incubation at 37°C BHK-G43 cells were washed three times in PBS and fresh media was added. Cells were incubated for 24 hours, after which the supernatant was centrifuged at 2000 xg for 10 min at room temperature to pellet cellular debris, and stored at −80 °C.</p>
<p id="P31">VSV*∆G(luc)-SARS-2-S pseudovirus was produced by transfection with pCG1-SARS-2-S followed by transduction with VSV*∆G(luc)-G. HEK293T cells were seeded in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 50 U/mL P/S to reach 70-80% confluence the next day. 2 μg plasmid was used per 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells and incubated with PEI (3:1) for 30 min at room temperature. The transfection mixture was added to the cells, and incubated for 18 hours at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS, transduced with VSV*(luc)+G at MOI = 2, and incubated for 2 hours. The virus was removed by gently washing with PBS twice, and fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS and 50 U/mL P/S was added. Cell supernatant was harvested after 24 hours, centrifuged at 2000 xg for 10 min to eliminate cellular debris, and stored at −80 °C immediately. A VSV*∆G(luc)-mock was generated simultaneously to allow subtraction of any remaining background from VSV*∆G(luc)-G signals.</p>

<title>Neutralization Assay</title>
<p id="P32">The SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacity of plasma was assessed through infection of Vero76 cmyc hTMPRSS2 cells, with VSV*∆G(luc)-SARS-2-S pseudovirus particles. Neutralization was conducted as follows: Plasma samples were thawed and heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 45 min. Subsequently, five-fold serial dilution in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 50 U/mL P/S were made. 25 μL of each plasma dilution was incubated with 50 μL VSV*∆G(luc)-SARS-2-S at MOI = 0.01 in duplicates, for 1 hour at 37 °C, in a flat bottomed 96-well plate. Successively, 20,000 Vero76 cmyc hTMPRSS2 cells, in 50 μL DMEM containing 10% FBS and 50 U/mL P/S were added to each well, and incubated at 37 °C for 20 hours. Cells were prepared for flow cytometry by gently removing the culture media, and washing once with PBS. Cell suspensions were made by incubating each well with 75 μL Trypsin + 0.02% EDTA for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min at room temperature, and re-suspension in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 50 U/mL P/S. Cells were fixed in 1% PFA for at least 15 min at 4 °C, before eGFP expression was analyzed using a Miltenyi Biotec MACSquant16 flow cytometer. The VSV*∆G(luc)-mock eGFP background signal was subtracted from all samples.</p>

<title>Data and Statistical analyses</title>
<p id="P34">Flow cytometry data was analyzed using FlowJo (Version 10.7.1). All data was processed and graphed in GraphPad Prism version 8.4.3. Mann-Whitney U t-test was used to compare between different groups. Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used to access the correlation between variables as specified. Neutralization curves were plotted with three parameter non-linear fits, from which IC50 values were calculated. p ≤ 0.05 was interpreted as statistically significant. P-values are indicated as follows: n.s. = not significant,* = p ≤ 0.05, ** = p &lt; 0.01, *** = p &lt; 0.001, **** = p &lt; 0.0001.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>

<p>SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe and deadly infections. However, the immunological understanding of this viral infection is limited. Currently, several vaccines are being developed to help limit transmission and prevent the current pandemic. However, basic understanding of the adaptive immune response developed during SARS-CoV-2 infections is needed to inform further vaccine development and to understand the protective properties of the developed immune response. We investigated, the adaptive immune response developed during SARS-CoV-2 infections in recovered patients experiencing a full spectrum of disease severity, from asymptomatic infections to severe cases requiring hospitalization. We used a novel multiplex serological platform, cell-based neutralization assays and dextramer flow cytometry assays to characterize a broad and robust humoral and cellular immune response towards SARS-CoV-2. We found that the vast majority of recovered individuals have clear detectable and functional SARS-CoV-2 spike specific adaptive immune responses, despite diverse disease severities. The detection of both a humoral and cellular functional spike specific immune response in the vast majority of the individuals, irrespective of asymptomatic manifestations, supports vaccine designs currently underway, and encourages further exploration of whether primary infections provide protection to reinfection.</p>
