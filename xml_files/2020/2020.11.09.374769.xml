<abstract>
<p id="P1">The release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a process termed NETosis, avoids pathogen spread but may cause tissue injury. NETs have been found in severe COVID-19 patients, but their role in disease development is still unknown. The aim of this study is to assess the capacity of NETs to drive epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of lung epithelial cells and to analyze the involvement of NETs in COVID-19.</p>
<p id="P2">Neutrophils activated with PMA (PMA-Neu), a stimulus known to induce NETs formation, induce both EMT and cell death in the lung epithelial cell line, A549. Notably, NETs isolated from PMA-Neu induce EMT without cell damage. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of severe COVID-19 patients showed high concentration of NETs. Thus, we tested in an <italic>in vitro</italic> alveolar model the hypothesis that virus-induced NET may drive EMT. Co-culturing A549 at air-liquid interface with alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and SARS-CoV2, we demonstrated a significant induction of the EMT in A549 together with high concentration of NETs, IL8 and IL1β, best-known inducers of NETosis. Lung tissues of COVID-19 deceased patients showed that epithelial cells are characterized by increased mesenchymal markers. These results show for the first time that NETosis plays a major role in triggering lung fibrosis in COVID-19 patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">Neutrophils represent the most abundant type of white blood cells. Neutrophils protect against foreign pathogens and are considered an essential component of the innate immune system. After activation, neutrophils can react against pathogens with three major different mechanisms: i) phagocytosis; ii) release of granules (that contain proteases and ROS); iii) NETosis. This last mechanism is considered a type of programmed neutrophils cell death, which consequently releases NETs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). NETs are webs-like structures composed by chromatin decorated with proteases, such as human neutrophils elastase (HNE) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), whose primary role is limiting the spreading of pathogens in tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Several signals can stimulate NETosis: microorganisms; pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL8 and IL1β; and chemicals, such as PMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">In spite of their protective role in reducing pathogens diffusion in the parenchyma, several studies revealed that a persistence of NETs can amplify the primary injury therefore inducing further clinical complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). In the lung, the persistence of activated neutrophils that release NETs has been linked to several diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Notably, COVID-19 patients who developed ARDS show increased NETs in the serum and, most importantly, NET release significantly correlates with the severity of the lung pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Moreover, a recent paper demonstrated that NETs are detectable in tracheal aspirate of patients with COVID-19 and that they are involved in the prothrombotic clinical manifestations of COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The direct consequence of NETs persistence in the lung is the damage of epithelial and endothelial cells, driven predominantly by histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Additionally, NETs have been found to drive the EMT in the context of the breast cancer thanks to their capacity to upregulate transcription factors involved in the EMT (<italic>ZEB1</italic> and <italic>SNAI1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">Given these premises, the aim of this study is to assess whether NETosis may drive the EMT also in lung epithelial cells. This would represent a new crucial molecular mechanism underlying the development of inflammatory-induced lung fibrosis, thus it would also be of great importance for several pulmonary diseases, such as autoimmune microbial insults and transplant rejection. Also, given the high concentration of NETs in COVID-19 patients that develop ARDS, this study is aimed at understanding if NETs could be implicated in the induction of EMT in SARS-CoV2 pneumonia by promoting a fibrosis.</p>

<title>NETosis induces the EMT in an alveolar epithelial cell line</title>
<p id="P6">Since NETosis is toxic in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) and it induces the EMT in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), we investigated if NETs can induce the EMT in the alveolar epithelial cell line A549. We used PMA as a primary chemical effector of NETosis. Confocal microscopy confirmed that PMA leads to a very efficient release of NETs by human neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1L-T</xref>) compared to non-activated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-I</xref>). NETs are visible as web-like structures and, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), they are positive for the histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1L-N</xref>), HNE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1O-Q</xref>) and MPO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1R-T</xref>). Moreover, DAPI labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1L, O, R</xref>) further confirms that these proteins are associated to free-DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1N, Q and T</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">To evaluate the possibility that NETs may induce the EMT in lung epithelial cells, we cultivated A549 cells with PMA-Neu for 24 and 48 h. By microscopy we observed that A549 cells lose the epithelial morphology upon incubation with PMA-Neu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) and gain a fibroblastic phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). These morphological changes are visible also after TGF-β treatment, the best-known effector of the EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). To confirm that these morphological changes are related to EMT induction, we evaluated the expression of two major proteins involved in the EMT: α-SMA (a mesenchymal marker) and E-cadherin (an epithelial marker). We performed western blot analysis on A549 cells exposed to PMA-Neu or TGF-β, used as a positive control of EMT induction. PMA-Neu induced a significant up-regulation of α-SMA (1.21 ± 0.025) after 24 h compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D and F</xref>), an effect that was only slightly decreased after 48 h of treatment (1.05 ± 0.102) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E and F</xref>). α-SMA upregulation by TGF-β was significant (1.17 ± 0.087) only after 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E and F</xref>) compared to control cells. PMA-Neu also downregulated significantly the expression of E-cadherin after 24 h of treatment (0.24 ± 0.101) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D and F</xref>), an effect that was amplified at 48 h (0.046 ± 0.032) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E and F</xref>). Upon TGF-β administration, E-Cadherin was significant downregulated starting at 24 h (0.253 ± 0.023) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D and F</xref>) up to 48 h (0.201 ± 0.131) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E and F</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">Notably, microscopy of A549 cells treated with PMA-Neu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>) suggests that a portion of cells encounter cell death. The amount of cell death was quantified by propidium iodide (PI) staining 24 h after treatment with PMA-Neu. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that PMA-Neu induced 33.70 ± 4.37% of cell death compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">Since PMA-Neu were able to induce both the EMT and cell death of A549 cells, we asked if these effects were directly related to NET release. NETs were isolated from either 2.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells (NETs 2.5) or 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells (NETs 5) PMA-Neu. NETs were incubated with A549 cells and EMT induction and cell death were evaluated. Both preparations of NETs induced a significant up-regulation of α-SMA (NETs 2.5 1.35 ± 0.05; NETs 5 2.11 ± 0.12) and decreased E-cadherin expression (NETs 2.5 0.08 ± 0.002; NETs 5 0.35 ± 0.023) after 24 h of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">B</xref>), compared to control cells. Interestingly, NETs administration to A549 cells did not induce cell death, in contrast to PMA-Neu (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

<title>NETs are enriched in the BAL of COVID-19 patients and correlates with neutrophil numbers and IL8 levels</title>
<p id="P10">Figure S2 are representative image of immunohistochemical analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of COVID-19 showing that the major cellular components are neutrophils, macrophages, epithelial cells and cellular/nuclear debries. In agreement with recent papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), measuring NETs in the BAL of mild (IMW) and severe (ICU) patients, we founded that ICU have a significant higher amount of NETs compared to IMW patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Interestingly, when patients were divided in survivors and non-survivors, we found that the non-survivors group presents more NETs compared to patients who survived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Finally, we assessed the neutrophil count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>) and the levels of IL8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>) in the same BAL samples as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), and found a significant direct correlation between NETs and neutrophil counts, as well as the levels of IL8.</p>

<title>The presence of SARS-CoV-2, AMs and neutrophils are necessary for the EMT of lung epithelial cells</title>
<p id="P11">We next investigated if in the context of COVID-19, NETs could play a significant role in inducing the EMT. To do so, we set up an alveolar <italic>in vitro</italic> model by culturing A549 cells at the air-liquid interface (ALI). Alveolar macrophages (AM) were seeded at the apical side of A549 cells, while Neu were added to the basolateral chamber of the transwell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Our <italic>in vitro</italic> alveolar model was, then, inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (Neu+AM+SARS-CoV2). As a control, A549 cells were cultured alone, or with SARS-CoV2, or with Neu+SARS-CoV2. After 48 h of incubation, we observed that only in the wells containing Neu+AM+SARS-CoV2 epithelial cells encountered the EMT, as demonstrated by a significant up-regulation of α-SMA (1.6 ± 0.321), together with a down-regulation of E-cadherin (0.723 ± 0.059), compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A and B</xref>). When epithelial cells were treated with SARS-CoV2 only, the expression of E-cadherin was significantly reduced (0.667 ± 0.249) but α-SMA levels were not significantly increased, while Neu+SARS-CoV2 cultures induced the up-regulation of α-SMA (1.339 ± 0.216), but not the downregulation of the E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A and B</xref>). Altogether these data suggest that the presence of AM, Neu and the virus are necessary for an efficient EMT of lung epithelial cells.</p>
<p id="P12">To clarify if NETs are produced by Neu and involved in this <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental setting, we measured HNE-DNA complexes in culture media after 48 h of incubation, but also IL8 and IL1β, two most known effectors of NETosis. In agreement with the role played by NETs in the induction of the EMT, we found a significant higher induction of NETs in Neu+AM+SARS-CoV2 compared to Neu+SARS-CoV2 and, as expected, SARS-CoV2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Similarly, the quantification of IL8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>) and IL1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>) showed that these two cytokines are only produced in Neu+AM+SARS-CoV2 cultures, in agreement with the well-known capacity of AM to secrete these cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p>

<title>EMT marker in lung biopsies in COVID-19 dead patients</title>
<p id="P13">Histopathological examination of lung tissues obtained from two patients who died of COVID-19 pneumonia demonstrated exudative and proliferative features of diffuse alveolar damage, corresponding to an early/intermediate phase of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Immunohistochemical analyses showed a subset of pneumocytes expressing both epithelial and mesenchymal markers (cytokeratin 7 and α-SMA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), thus confirming that these epithelial cells acquired a mesenchymal phenotype via an EMT process.</p>

<sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P14">Our study demonstrated for the first time that NETs are sufficient to induce EMT in the A549 alveolar epithelial cell line. Moreover, we confirmed a significant correlation between NET induction in the lung and the severity of COVID-19. We also demonstrated in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model that NETs, possibly sustained by the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines from AMs, are involved in the inducement of EMT. Notably, lung tissues of COVID-19 deceased patients showed that epithelial cells are characterized by increased mesenchymal markers.</p>
<p id="P15">We found that neutrophils efficiently induce the EMT via NETosis, an observation that, at the best of our knowledge, has never been demonstrated before in the context of lung fibrosis and, more importantly, in severe COVID-19. NET-related injuries are usually studied in the context of the endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). In particular, the prothrombotic role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) of NETs and their ability to drive endothelial-mesenchymal transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) has been thoroughly analyzed. However, recent reports suggested that the infiltration of neutrophils in the alveolar space interferes with cell-cell adhesion of lung epithelial cells through HNE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), also, that neutrophils induce the EMT by releasing TGF-β, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) or Proteinase-activated receptor 4 (PAR4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Herein, we demonstrate that NETs can also directly activate the EMT program in A549 cells, a commonly used model of type II pneumocytes. We showed that the addition of purified NETs to A549 cells induced a significant overexpression of the mesenchymal marker α-SMA after 24 h of treatment, together with a decrease of E-cadherin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Comparing PMA-Neu and NETs effect, we found that although both treatments are able to trigger the EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), the presence of neutrophils is uniquely able induce the death of A549 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). These results not only confirm data already present in the literature, but also shed new light on the mechanism that leads to the EMT in the lung: exaggerate NETosis not only induces tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) but it also triggers the EMT in lung epithelial cells.</p>
<p id="P16">Another important finding of our study is the presence of NETs in the BAL of COVID-19 patients. Given the high percentage of NETs in the peripheral blood and the exaggerate infiltration of neutrophils in alveolar spaces of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), the role of these phagocytes in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 was clear since the very beginning. NET levels in different samples of SARS-CoV2-infected patients significantly correlated with the disease severity, suggesting that NETosis may play a relevant role in COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Here, we confirmed and expanded previous observations by quantifying NETs in the alveolar micro-environment. We took into consideration two groups of patients, those with mild disease (patients that were admitted to the hospital with signs and symptoms of bilateral interstitial pneumonia but did not required intubation) and those with severe disease (who needed ICU support). Our data demonstrated higher levels of NETs in severe patients compared to IMW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). In addition, NET levels correlated to the percentage of neutrophils in the BAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), as well as with the levels of IL8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>) and the disease severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">Because of the high levels of NETs in the BAL of COVID-19 patients and their potential role in inducing the EMT, we next focused on the correlation between NETs and the EMT by setting up an <italic>in vitro</italic> alveolar model that we infected with SARS-CoV-2. To mimic the alveolar microenvironment A549 were cultivated at the ALI to have the contact with air, such as under physiologic conditions. Next, we added AM onto the apical side of A549 and Neu in the basolateral chamber of the transwell. SARS-CoV2 was inoculated on the apical side and after 48 h only the Neu+AM+SARS-CoV2 culture significantly induced the EMT in A549, in contrast to Neu+SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV2 alone conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A and B</xref>). Another recent study suggested that SARS-CoV2 infection may trigger EMT-like molecular changes in A549, as determined by the upregulation of the <italic>ZEB1</italic> gene together with the downregulation of <italic>EPCAM</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). However, in our experimental model, we demonstrated that the sole presence of SARS-CoV2 is not sufficient to induce an efficient EMT, as measured by α-SMA/E-cadherin regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Notably, also in the case of Neu+SARS-CoV2 we did not see a strong EMT, as measured by α-SMA/E-cadherin protein modulation in A549 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>), although Neu were stimulated to secrete NETs by SARS-CoV2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), as previously described by Veras et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that the amount of NETs released by Neu in Neu+SARS-CoV2 is not sufficient to elicit the EMT in A549 cells. In fact, when we added AM, we observed an enhancement of NETs release probably due to the capacity of these cells to secrete IL8 and IL1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D and E</xref>), two proteins known to efficiently drive NETosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). We are aware about the low endogenous expression by A549 of ACE2, the specific receptor for SARS-CoV2 cell entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). However, our results are even more interesting because emphasizes the critical role of innate immunity in SARS-CoV2 infection despite the internalization of virus by cells. In particular, we would like to propose a model in which macrophages, by releasing IL8 and IL1β, two cytokines significantly increased in the plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) and BAL-fluid of severe COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), potentiate the capacity of NETs released by Neu to amplify the noxious activity on lung cells, favoring the EMT. Our data are in agreement with previous studies that showed the existence of a feedback loop between neutrophils/NETs and release of IL8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) and IL1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p>
<p id="P18">The immunohistochemistry analysis of lung tissue obtained <italic>post-mortem</italic> from deceased COVID-19 patients supported our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, showing a subset of pneumocytes expressing mesenchymal markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), thus confirming that epithelial cells acquired a mesenchymal phenotype.</p>
<p id="P19">Futures studies will be focused on</p>
<p id="P20">In conclusion, this study highlights the contribution of neutrophil activation and NET generation in the induction of the EMT. Several inflammatory disorders besides ARDS, such as autoimmune diseases and chronic lung graft rejection have been associated at various degrees with alveolar and small airway influx of Neu and with their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). We, thus, hypothesize that NETosis-induced EMT should be considered as an important pathogenic step of lung fibrosis consequent to neutrophilic inflammation. Our findings also suggest that future therapeutic interventions could target this mechanism.</p>
