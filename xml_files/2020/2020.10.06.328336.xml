<title>SUMMARY</title>
<p id="P3">The COVID-19 pandemic by non-stop infections of SARS-CoV-2 has continued to ravage many countries worldwide. Here we report the discovery of suramin, a 100-year-old drug, as a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) through blocking the binding of RNA to the enzyme. In biochemical assays, suramin and its derivatives are at least 20-fold more potent than remdesivir, the currently approved nucleotide drug for COVID-19. The 2.6 Å cryo-EM structure of the viral RdRp bound to suramin reveals two binding sites of suramin, with one site directly blocking the binding of the RNA template strand and the other site clash with the RNA primer strand near the RdRp catalytic active site, therefore inhibiting the viral RNA replication. Furthermore, suramin potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 duplication in Vero E6 cells. These results provide a structural mechanism for the first non-nucleotide inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and a rationale for repurposing suramin for treating COVID-19.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P4">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with over 33.1 million infections and 998,000 death as reported on September 28 of 2020(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Dong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gorbalenya et al., 2020</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, several related betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS- CoV), are highly pathogenic, which infections can lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome exacerbated by loss of lung function and death. Compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 appears to have much higher capacity of human to human infections, which result in a rapidly growing pandemic(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Sanche et al., 2020</xref>). Finding an effective treatment for SARS- COV-2 through drug repurposing is an urgent but unmet medical need.</p>
<p id="P5">Suramin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) is a century-old drug that has been used to treat African sleeping sickness and river blindness(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Brun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hawking, 1958</xref>). Suramin has also been shown to be effective in inhibiting the replication of a wide spectrum of viruses, including enteroviruses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Ren et al., 2014</xref>), Zika virus(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Albulescu et al., 2017</xref>), Chikungunya(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Albulescu et al., 2015</xref>) and Ebola viruses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Henß et al., 2016</xref>). The viral inhibition mechanism of suramin appears to be very diverse, including inhibition of viral attachment, entry, and release from host cells in part through interactions with viral capsid proteins(Wiedemar et al., 2020). Recently, suramin has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture, which was proposed to act through preventing entry of the virus(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Salgado-Benvindo et al., 2020</xref>). Here we report that suramin is a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), an essential enzyme for the life cycle of virus. The potency of suramin is at least 20-fold more potent than remdesivir, the current FDA approved nucleotide drug for COVID-19. Cryo-EM structure reveals that suramin binds to the RdRp active site, blocking the binding of both RNA template and primer strands. These results provide a rationale for repurposing suramin for COVID-19 and a structural template to design next generation drugs of suramin derivatives.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Inhibition of RdRp by suramin and the potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of suramin</title>
<p id="P6">The core RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 is composed of non-structural protein nsp12 with two accessary subunits nsp7 and nsp8(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Kirchdoerfer</xref> and Ward, 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Subissi et al., 2014</xref>). Incubation of the purified nsp12-7-8 complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1A-1B</xref>) with a 30-base template and 20- base primer (poly-A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) allowed the primer extension to the same length as the template in the presence of saturated concentrations of UTP as illustrated in a gel-based assay (lane 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Addition of 8-32 µM suramin nearly abolished the elongation of the primer strand while it required 100-1000 µM of remdesivir in its triphosphate form (RDV-TP) to achieve the same degree of inhibition under the same condition(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Yin et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, addition of 100 µM of higher concentrations of suramin completely blocked the formation of RdRp-RNA complex, while it required more than 5 mM of RDV-TP to inhibit the binding of RdRp to RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1C</xref>). Solution based assays of the RdRp inhibition determined that half maximal inhibition concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of suramin is 0.26 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), and the IC<sub>50</sub> for RDV-TP is 6.21 µM under identical assay conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1D</xref>), suggesting that suramin is at least 20-fold more potent than RDV-TP. Cell-based experiments indicated that suramin was able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 duplication in Vero E6 cells with a half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>)of ~2.9 µM, which is about the same range as remdesivir in the same assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1E</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). The apparent weaker inhibition of suramin in cell-based assays than in enzyme inhibition assays may be due to the highly negative charges of suramin that may prevent its efficient uptake by the host cells. In addition, the CC<sub>50</sub> (concentrations of drug required to reduce cell viability by 50%) of suramin is over 1000 µM, indicating its relatively low cytotoxicity, which is much safer than remdesivir (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1E</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>The structure of the RdRp-suramin complex</title>
<p id="P7">For the cryo-EM studies, we incubated the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex with 10-fold molar excess of suramin (see methods). The structure was determined at a nominal resolution of 2.57 Å with 95,845 particles from over 8 million original particles auto-picked from 11,846 micrographs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). Because of the relatively high resolution of the structure, the EM map reveal the clear density for all key components of the RdRp-suramin complex, including one nsp12 (residues S6-C22, V31-I106, M110-L895, and N911-T929), one nsp7 (residues K2-G64), two nsp8 (residues D78-A191 for nsp8-1, and residues T84-A191 for nsp8-2, respectively), and two suramin molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">The overall structure of the RdRp-suramin complex is very similar to the apo RdRp complex, with an RMSD of 0.465 Å for all Cα atoms between the two structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S4</xref>). Nsp12 adopts the same right-hand palm-fingers configuration, where its catalytic active site is composed of seven highly conserved motifs A-G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Two suramin molecules were found to fit into the catalytic chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-2B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>The interactions of suramin with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp</title>
<p id="P9">One suramin molecule (suramin #1) is fit into a cavity formed by conserved motif G and the N- terminus of motif B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The chemical structure of suramin has a two-fold symmetry with a urea linker at the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The EM density map for this suramin is very clear defined but only for half of the suramin molecule without the urea linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The key interactions of suramin #1 with RdRp were summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, including hydrogen bonds, charge interactions, and hydrophobic packing interactions with conserved RdRp residues, which restrain the naphthalene-trisulfonic acid head in a relative narrow cavity. Two out of the three sulfonates (positions 3 and 5) form hydrogen bonds with the side chains from N497, K500, R569 and Q573, and the main chain from N497, while the sulfonate at positions 1 points toward the solvent and forms only one hydrogen bond with the side chain of N496. The K577 side chain forms cation-π stacking with the naphthalene ring, and also forms a hydrogen bond with the amide bond linker between the naphthalene and benzene rings. The amide bond linker between the benzene rings C and D forms a hydrogen bond with main chain NH of G590. In addition, the suramin # 1 is in van der Waals contact with several residues, including L576, A580, A685, Y689 and l758. The other suramin molecule (suramin #2) is fit into the cavity near the catalytic active site formed by conserved motifs A, C, E, and F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Also, only half of suramin was observed in the structure with clear EM density map. The key interactions of suramin #2 with RdRp were summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, including hydrogen bonds, charge interactions, and hydrophobic packing interactions. Different from suramin # 1, the sulfonate at positions 5 of suramin # 2 points toward the solvent and forms only one hydrogen bond with the side chain of R555, while the other two sulfonates at positions 1 and 3 form hydrogen bonds with the side chains from K551, R553, R555 and R836, and the main chains from A550 and K551. Meanwhile the side chain of R555 also forms a hydrogen bond with the amide bond linker between the naphthalene and benzene rings. The R836 side chain forms cation-π stacking with the benzene ring C. The NH of the benzene ring D forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of D865. In addition, suramin # 2 is in van der Waals contact with several residues, including H439, I548, S549, A840, S861 and L862. Sequence alignment with RdRp from several viruses indicated that these suramin-contacting residues are conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5</xref>), suggesting that suramin may be a general inhibitor of viral RdRp, which implies that suramin could be used as a drug for treating infections of these viruses.</p>

<title>Inhibition mechanism of suramin to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp</title>
<p id="P10">Structural comparison of the RdRp-suramin complex with the remdesivir-bound RdRp complex reveal a clear mechanism of RdRp inhibition by suramin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). If the base position of remdesivir was defined as +1 position, then the binding of the first suramin molecule occupies the same space of -1 to -3 positions of RNA template strand (suramin #1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). The second suramin molecule at the active site occupies the space of the primer strand ranging from -4 to +1 positions (suramin #2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). The binding of these two suramin molecules would thus block the binding of the RNA template-primer duplex to the active site as well as the entry of nucleotide triphosphate into the catalytic site, which results in the direct inhibition of the RdRp catalytic activity. The direct inhibition mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by suramin is different from the suramin-mediated inhibition of the norovirus RdRp, which also contained two binding sites for suramin binding(Mastrangelo et al., 2012). In each site, only half of suramin molecule was found. Structural comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp with the norovirus RdRp reveals only one of the two suramin binding sites (suramin #2) is partially overlapped (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S6A, S6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S6D</xref>). Both suramin binding sites in norovirus RdRp did not clash with the RNA strands but one of the suramin binding site is overlapping with the proposed nucleotide entry channel, thus indirectly blocking RdRp polymerization activity, a mechanism different from the direct blocking of the binding of the RNA template to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by suramin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, structural comparisons of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp-suramin structure with the structures of the norovirus RdRp bound to other suramin derivatives show that the suramin and suramin derivatives bind to the RdRp with diverse conformations and orientations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Croci et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Mastrangelo et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S6B, S6E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S7</xref>), indicating the possibility for other suramin derivatives to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp as tested below.</p>

<sec id="S7">
<title>Inhibition SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by suramin derivatives</title>
<p id="P11">Suramin derivatives have been explored for diverse applications including anti-cancers and antiparasites(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Wiedemar et al., 2020</xref>). To determine the structure-activity-relationship (SAR), we screened a set of 8 different suramin derivatives using in vitro RdRp primer extension assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1F</xref>). All 8 tested suramin derivatives showed efficient inhibition of RdRp activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1G</xref>). NF157, NF279, and NF449 are most potent inhibitors with IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.05 µM, which are about 5-fold more potent than the parent drug suramin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Cell-based assays showed that NF110 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication with EC<sub>50</sub> of 2.87 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>), while NF157 and NF279 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication with EC<sub>50</sub> of ~10 µM. The CC<sub>50</sub> values of all suramin derivatives are over 1000 µM, indicating their good safety window and their potential use for treating COVID-19. However, there is a 200-fold separation between their biochemical potency in inhibiting RdRp activity and their potency in inhibiting viral replication in cell-based assays, suggesting the difficulties of these suramin derivatives to be uptake by host cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Alsford et al., 2013</xref>). Future drug formulation such as with glycol chitosan-based nanoparticles(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>) may improve their bioavailability to lung tissues and their potency in inhibiting viral replication.</p>
<p id="P12">The COVID-19 pandemic has infected many more people and caused many more deaths than anyone could imagined since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in December of 2019. The ongoing pandemic urgently press the need for effective vaccines and drug treatments. Suramin is a century-old drug that has been used for treating African sleepiness and showed activity against a number of viruses without a clear mechanism. In this paper, we showed that suramin is a direct potent inhibitor of the viral RdRp, the essential enzyme for the viral life cycle. The structure reveals that suramin binds to the active site of RdRp, blocking the binding of both strands of the template-primer RNA substrate and inhibiting the polymerase activity of the RdRp. Suramin derivatives also showed potent inhibition of the RdRp activity and blocked viral replication in cell-based assays. Together, these results uncovered the structural mechanism of the first non-nucleotide inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and suggested the potential use of suramin for treating the SARS-CoV-2 infections. The structure and biochemical results presented in this paper also provided a rationale to develop suramin analogs as well as drug formulations to improve their potency and efficacy to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication.</p>

<title>Overall Structures of the RdRp-suramin complex</title>
<p>A. Two views of cryo-EM density map of the RdRp-suramin complex, SARS-CoV2 nsp12 contains a N-terminal extension composed of the β-hairpin (green), the NiRAN domain (yellow) and an interface domain (purple) adjacent to the RdRp core domain, which contains subdomains: fingers, palm, and thumb, colored with violet, orange, and blue, respectively. The nsp12 binds to a heterodimer of nsp7 (light green) and nsp8 (nsp8-2, red) as well as to a second subunit of nsp8 (nsp-1, red). The two bound suramin molecules are set as dark green. Color code is used throughout.</p>
