<abstract>
<p id="P3">K777 is a di-peptide analog that contains an electrophilic vinyl-sulfone moiety and is a potent, covalent inactivator of cathepsins. Vero E6, HeLa/ACE2, Caco-2, A549/ACE2, and Calu-3, cells were exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and then treated with K777. K777 reduced viral infectivity with EC<sub>50</sub> values of inhibition of viral infection of: 74 nM for Vero E6, &lt;80 nM for A549/ACE2, and 4 nM for HeLa/ACE2 cells. In contrast, Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells had EC<sub>50</sub> values in the low micromolar range. No toxicity of K777 was observed for any of the host cells at 10-100 μM inhibitor. K777 did not inhibit activity of the papain-like cysteine protease and 3CL cysteine protease, encoded by SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations of ≤ 100 μM. These results suggested that K777 exerts its potent anti-viral activity by inactivation of mammalian cysteine proteases which are essential to viral infectivity. Using a propargyl derivative of K777 as an activity-based probe, K777 selectively targeted cathepsin B and cathepsin L in Vero E6 cells. However only cathepsin L cleaved the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and K777 blocked this proteolysis. The site of spike protein cleavage by cathepsin L was in the S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2, differing from the cleavage site observed in the SARS CoV-1 spike protein. These data support the hypothesis that the antiviral activity of K777 is mediated through inhibition of the activity of host cathepsin L and subsequent loss of viral spike protein processing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P4">The COVID-19 outbreak of 2019(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) has led to a global health crisis of a magnitude not seen since the influenza pandemic of 1918. By October 2020, more than 40 million people have been infected worldwide, including more than 8 million in the US(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The scope of COVID-19 pandemic is such that as-yet unavailable vaccines may be too late to circumvent a prolonged health and economic crisis. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for the rapid identification of therapies that limit the pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 for the management of COVID-19(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks of 2003 and 2012(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), caused by betacoronaviruses highly related to SARS CoV-2 provided important clues to the mechanism of viral infection of host cells. These include two virally-encoded cysteine proteases, 3CL protease (Mpro)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) and a papain-like protease (PLpro)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) that are essential to coronaviral maturation. In addition, the trimeric coronaviral spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (76% sequence identity to SARS-CoV-1 spike protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>)), is involved in the fusion of the viral envelope with mammalian cell membranes, followed by the release of the genomic viral RNA and the nucleocapsid complex into the host cell (cellular entry)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Studies of the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein have shown that it adheres to the extracellular domain of the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor in susceptible human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). In SARS-CoV-2, the receptor binding domain of the spike protein subunit S1 binds to the ACE2 receptor, and the subunit S2 is involved in the viral cell membrane fusion to facilitate viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Prior to cellular entry, the spike protein requires processing by host cell proteases for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). In particular, the transmembrane protease serine-2 (TMPRSS-2), the cysteine protease cathepsin L (CTSL), and furin-like proteases, have been proposed to play roles in preparing SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells by either endocytosis or traversing the cellular membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">These proposed mechanisms have stimulated studies to explore the role of both serine and cysteine protease inhibitors in reducing coronaviral entry. Inhibitors of TMPRSS-2, such as camostat, reduced infectivity in selected human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Broad spectrum cysteine protease inhibitors, such as E-64d, also inhibited coronaviral entry in certain cell types, suggesting a role for cathepsin L and possibly other cysteine proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Most recently, Riva <italic>et. al</italic> demonstrated in a drug repositioning screen that various cathepsin inhibitors have the ability to block SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells at sub-micromolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">
<bold>K777</bold> (also known as, K11777, S-001, SLV213, 4-methyl-N-((S)-1-oxo-3-phenyl-1-(((S)-1-phenyl-5-(phenylsulfonyl)pentan-3-yl)amino)propan-2-yl)piperazine-1-carboxamide) is a highly potent, irreversible, covalent inhibitor of mammalian cathepsin L and other cysteine proteases of clan CA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">K777 was originally developed as an inhibitor of cathepsin S,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) but later showed promise as an anti- parasitic agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). <bold>K777</bold> has since been approved by the FDA as a clinical stage compound (Selva Therapeutics, Del Mar, CA).</p>
<p id="P9">In 2015, Zhou and colleagues reported that <bold>K777</bold> blocked entry of pseudovirus forms of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS into Vero E6 or HEK293 cells, likely due to inactivation of cathepsin L(CTSL) on cell surfaces and/or within endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). These results suggest that <bold>K777</bold> might also be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID-19. Here we show that <bold>K777</bold> blocks CTSL-mediated processing of the spike protein and blocks infection of SARS-CoV-2 in several mammalian cell lines.</p>

<title>K777 blocks SARS CoV-2 infectivity of host cells</title>
<p id="P10">The anti-coronarial activity of K777 was evaluated in multiple, relevant infected mammalian cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). EC<sub>50</sub> values for inhibition of viral invasion of host cells by K777 was assessed by observation of a cytopathic effect (CPE). The concentration dependence of the anti-CoV-2 effects of K777 are shown for three cell lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, in which K777 was most active vs. HeLa cells which express the ACE2 receptor (EC<sub>50</sub> = 4 nM). For Caco-2 cells virus titer was used as CPE was not observed. EC<sub>50</sub> values ranged from 4 nM for HeLa/ACE2 cells to 5.5 μM for Calu-3 cells and 4.3 μM for Caco-2 cells. Note that the 2B4 cells, which are Calu-3 cells that have been selected for higher expression of the ACE2 receptor, were more potently inhibited by K777 than standard Calu-3 cells obtained from the ATCC. A549/ACE2 and HeLa/ACE2 cells were the most susceptible to blockage of viral infection by K777. No host cell toxicity was seen for any cell line at inhibitor concentrations of 10-100 μM.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Analysis of K777 versus SARS-CoV-2 and Clan CA cysteine proteases</title>
<p id="P11">In assays carried out at both UC San Diego and Texas A&amp;M University, there was no inhibition of either the PL or the 3CL proteases of SARS-CoV-2 (25-100 nM enzyme concentration) up to 100 μM K777 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5</xref>). Conversely, K777 exhibited potent activity against human cathepsin L, where the second-order rate constant of inactivation, <italic>k</italic>
<sub>inact</sub>/<italic>K</italic>
<sub>I</sub>, was found to be 50-fold and 333-fold greater than cathepsin K and cathepsin B, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figs. S1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S4</xref>). K777 formed irreversible covalent adducts with these enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3</xref>), but exhibited weak, slowly reversible, inhibition of cathepsin C and potent, but rapidly reversible inhibition of cathepsin S (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Activity-Based Protein Profiling of K777 protein targets in Vero E6 cells</title>
<p id="P12">We prepared a K777 analog, N4-propargyl-K777 (K777 Alkyne; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>)) to elucidate the cellular target(s) of K777. This K777 probe facilitates copper-mediated cycloaddition between an azide and alkyne to both enrich target proteins for mass spectrometry analysis, and for visualization of target proteins via in-gel fluorescence. In both virally and non-virally infected cells, the protein(s) bound to the K777-Cy7 conjugate had a molecular weight of approximately 25 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), a molecular weight that could correspond to either cathepsin B (mature form: 25 kDa) or cathepsin L (mature form: 24.2 kDa). To confirm that the specificity of the K777 alkyne was analogous to that of K777, cells were also preincubated with 1 μM K777 prior to treatment with the K777 alkyne probe. This resulted in &gt;80% blockage of the 25-kDa target protein signal in both virally and non-virally infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). As the other minor protein bands visualized were unchanged upon K777 pre-treatment, it is clear these proteins are not targets of K777.</p>
<p id="P13">When comparing the intensity of the 25-kDa band in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells to that of its uninfected counterpart there was nearly a 5-fold decrease in intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>). Reduction of the signal for this band in the virally-infected samples may be due to either a reduction of total protein or differential expression of the target(s) of the K777-alkyne. To investigate this, we immunoblotted the housekeeping protein human β-actin to compare its relative amounts in both sets of samples. Upon quantifying the difference in β-actin content between the SARS-CoV-2-infected and uninfected cells, we measured a 5.7- fold decrease in total β-actin signal in the Vero E6 SARS-CoV-2 infected samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C, 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S7</xref>). Comparison of the relative intensities of the β-actin band versus the 25-kDa enriched protein for both SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected cells approximated a 1:1 ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results suggested that coronaviral infection of Vero E6 caused a global reduction in protein expression, in agreement with recent reports that NSP1 of SARS-CoV-2 suppresses protein translation in infected cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>Identification of Cathepsin B and L as K777 targets by affinity enrichment and proteomic analysis</title>
<p id="P14">To identify the molecular target(s) of the K777 alkyne, affinity enrichment and proteomic analysis of treated Vero E6 cell lysates was carried out with variable concentrations of the K777 alkyne (0-10 μM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S8A</xref>). 117 proteins at a false discovery rate of 1% were identified, of which 65 were present in the K777 alkyne-treated samples, but not the untreated control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S8B</xref>). Proteins of the highest abundance in the treated (5 and 10 μM samples), as determined by MaxQuant LFQ analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), were cathepsin B (CTSB) and cathepsin L (CTSL).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>Cathepsin L but not cathepsin B catalyzes cleavage of the SARS CoV-2 spike protein</title>
<p id="P15">Having identified CTSB and CTSL as putative targets of K777 in cells, we sought to elucidate the ability of these proteins to process the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins <italic>in vitro</italic>. We determined that both proteases could process the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein, but only CTSL could process the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S9</xref>). Additionally, processing of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by CSTL produced different sized molecular weight bands than that of SARS-CoV-1 spike protein. Immunoblotting against the C-terminal Flag epitope of the SARS-CoV-2 S resulted in immuno-reactivity with both the intact S protein and a ~120 kDa protein fragment, indicating that this ~120 kDa protein contained an intact S2 domain, and that CTSL proteolysis took place in the S1 domain of the spike protein at an unknown site, which we have coined S1’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). K777 efficently blocked the cleavage at this S1’ site by CTSL of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S8">
<title>Cathepsin L is present in all cell lines tested but levels vary</title>
<p id="P16">Although K777 targets both CTSL and CTSB, inhibition of CTSL is apparently responsible for its potent anti-viral effects. To investigate why virally-infected A549/ACE2, HeLa/ACE2, and Vero E6 cells are more sensitive to K777 treatment than Calu-3 cells, we evaluated the relative abundance of CTSL protein in each cell line. Human CTSL shares 96% protein sequence identity with CTSL in African green monkeys (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S10</xref>) and therefore both the proprotein (upper band) and mature active enzyme (lower band) can be detected by immunoblot using an anti-human CTSL antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E-F</xref>). Mature CTSL was 8.8-fold and 8.7-fold higher in Vero E6 extracts compared to HeLa/ACE2 and A549/ACE2, respectively. Under these exposure conditions, CTSL was not detectable in Calu-3 cell extracts. The large difference in CTSL abundance between these cell lines was further validated by quantitative proteomic analysis using a CTSL-derived peptide (NHCGIASSASYPTV) that is identical in humans and African green monkeys (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S10</xref>). This peptide was between 32- and 57-fold more abundant in Vero E6 compared to the other three cell lines, therefore supporting the immunoblotting studies. Finally, we quantified the specific activity of CTSL in all four cell lines using the fluorogenic substrate Z-FR-AMC. The cell extracts were first treated with broad spectrum serine, aspartic acid and metallo-protease inhibitors to inactivate non-cysteine proteases that may hydrolyze this substrate. The remaining activity in each cell line was eliminated by K777 confirming that only cysteine proteases were active in the non- K777 treated samples. As K777 inhibits both CTSL and CTSB, we treated the cell lines with CA-074, a selective CTSB inhibitor. Cysteine protease activity in A549/ACE2, HeLa/ACE2 and Calu-3 cell lystates was found to be mostly due to CTSB, while activity in Vero E6 cells was mostly CTSL. The specific activity of CTSL was determined to be 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 36.7 RFU s<sup>-1</sup> μg<sup>-1</sup> for Calu-3, A549/ACE2, HeLa/ACE2, and Vero E6, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). These studies showed that the concentration of CTSL in HeLa/ACE2, A549/ACE2 and Vero E6 cells strongly correlated with the EC<sub>50</sub> values generated for K777 treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. However, Calu-3 cells had the lowest levels of CTSL but the highest EC<sub>50</sub> values, suggesting that another protease may be involved in spike protein processing.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P17">Three host proteases, TMPRSS2, furin, and CTSL, have been proposed as key enzymes for the processing of the coronaviral spike protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). In our analysis, we have shown that K777, a potent inhibitor of CTSL activity, is also a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection agent in several host cell models. Although the maximal rates of inactivation, <italic>k</italic>
<sub>inact</sub>, for cathepsins L, B, and K are similar, the second-order rate constant of time-dependent inactivation <italic>(k<sub>inact</sub>
</italic>/K<sub>I</sub>) varies by over two orders-of-magnitude for these enzymes and by five orders-of-magnitude compared to cathepsin C, highlighting the functional selectivity of K777 for CTSL versus other host-cell cathepsins. Using a propargyl analog of K777 as an affinity probe we determined that CTSB and CTSL were intracellular targets of this compound in Vero E6 cells, however only CSTL, but not CTSB, cleaved the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This cleavage occurred in the S1 domain of the spike protein at a site different from that observed in the S protein of SARS-CoV-1. The S1 domains of the spike proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 share 64% sequence identity, and analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein structure revealed multiple unresolved loop regions in the S1 domain, suggesting that CTSL proteolysis may occur in one of these unstructured regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>)</p>
<p id="P18">K777 inhibited viral entry into three host cell models including cell lines derived from African green monkey renal epithelium (Vero E6), human cervical epithelium (HeLa/ACE2) and human lung epithelium (A549/ACE2) with nanomolar potency. Anti-viral inhibition was lower (EC<sub>50</sub> = 3.7 and 4.3 μM) in a second human lung epithelium cell line (Calu-3) and a human colon epithelium-derived cell line (Caco-2). Why is the efficacy of K777 different in different cell lines? We quantified differential levels of CTSL in cell lines via Western blotting and an enzyme activity assay. Vero E6 cells expressed the highest levels of CTSL and HeLa/ACE2 and A549/ACE2 had lower amounts. These data suggest that the amount of CTSL correlates with K777 efficacy. However, Calu-3 cells have the lowest amount of CTSL and yet are relatively insensitive to K777 treatment. Previous work has shown that treatment of MERS-infected Calu-3 cells with E64d, a broad cysteine protease inhibitor, had diminished efficacy presumably as a result of low CTSL expression but heightened TMPRSS2 expression. This shift in expression profile resulted in the predominant processing of the MERS spike protein by TMPRSS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). It was also suggested that cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by TMPRSS2 in cells with low CTSL levels (such as Calu-3) is essential for efficient viral entry, whereas in TMPRSS2 negative cells (Vero E6) viral infection can proceed with high efficiency using CTSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). On the other hand, Hoffman and co-workers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) concluded that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor, camostat mesylate, reduced but did non abrogate SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3 cells. They suggested that following camostat treatment, there remains residual spike protein that might require processing by CTSL. The EC<sub>50</sub> for camostat mesylate inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3 cells was 1 uM, in the same range as K777(<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, future experiments should evaluate a combination of K777 and an appropriate TMPRSS2 or furin inhibitor. Combination therapy might protect all host cells from viral infection even if some utilize both CTSL and TMPRSS2 (or furin) for processing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.</p>
<p id="P19">In summary, there are currently two potential therapeutic uses of K777. First, it may block primary infection by SARS-CoV-2. If primary infection occurs in lung epithelium, it could be argued that the reduced activity of K777 to prevent infection of Calu-3 cells is concerning. However it should be noted that the anti-viral infection activity of K777 was robust in another lung epithelial cell line, A549/ACE2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore both Calu-3 and A549/ACE2 cells are derived from adenocarcinomas of the lung, not primary lung epithelium. Adenocarcinomas have multiple mutations compared to their cell of origin and that may alter infection potential. Alternatively, K777 might be employed to prevent viral infection of other host organs if spike protein processing in cells of those organs depends on CTSL. Confirmation of these suggestions will come from animal model testing and ultimately human clinical trials. Support for the rapid advancement of K777 as potential COVID-19 therapy comes from the fact that K777 is orally bioavailable, and safety, tolerability and PK/PD have been evaluated in several preclinical model systems, including non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). An IND application for K777 was recently approved by the FDA(Selva Therapeutics, Del Mar, CA).</p>

<title>Significance</title>
</caption>
<p>The virus causing COVID-19 is highly infectious and has resulted in a global pandemic. We confirm that a cysteine protease inhibitor, approved by the FDA as a clinical-stage compound, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of several human and monkey cell lines with notable(nanomolar) efficacy. The mechanism of action of this inhibitor is identified as a specific inhibition of host cell cathepsin L. This in turn inhibits host cell processing of the coronaviral spike protein, a step required for cell entry. Neither of the coronaviral proteases are inhibited, and the cleavage site of spike protein processing is different from that reported in other coronaviruses. Hypotheses to explain the differential activity of the inhibitor with different cell types are discussed.</p>
