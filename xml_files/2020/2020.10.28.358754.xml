Reverse genetics systems for many CoVs have been established, but none exist for ToVs. Here, we describe a reverse genetics system using a full-length infectious cDNA clone of bovine ToV (BToV) in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Recombinant BToV containing genetic markers had the same phenotype as wild-type (wt) BToV. To generate two types of recombinant virus, the Hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene was manipulated, since cell-adapted wtBToV generally loses the full-length HE (HEf), resulting in soluble HE (HEs). First, recombinant viruses with HEf and HA-tagged HEf or HEs genes were rescued; these showed no significant differences in cell growth, suggesting that HE is not essential for viral growth in cells. Then, recombinant virus in which HE was replaced by the Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) gene expressed EGFP in infected cells, but showed significantly reduced viral growth compared to wtBToV. Moreover, the recombinant virus readily deleted the EGFP gene after one passage. Interestingly, one variant with mutations in non-structural proteins (NSPs) showed improved EGFP expression and viral growth during serial passages, although it eventually deleted the EGFP gene, suggesting that these mutations contributed to EGFP gene acceptance. These recombinant viruses provide new insights regarding BToV and its reverse genetics will help advance understanding of this neglected pathogen.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Torovirus (ToV) belongs to order <italic>Nidovirales</italic>, family <italic>Tobaniviridae</italic>, subfamily <italic>Torovirinae</italic> and genus <italic>Torovirus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). ToVs are a causative agent of diarrheic and respiratory diseases, and are detected in many species including bovine, equine, swine, goat, and human species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Although ToV infections are generally asymptomatic or do not have severe symptoms, the bovine torovirus (BToV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) and porcine ToV (PToV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) are distributed globally, causing economic loss. At present, there are no drugs and vaccines available for treatment and prevention of this disease.</p><p id="P3">ToVs are enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with a genome 25-30kb in length, comprising the conserved six open reading frames. The first two-thirds of the genome contains ORF1a and ORF1b, with an overlap by a frameshift, encoding the replicase/transcriptase proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). The remaining one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), and nucleocapsid (N) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). ToV genome seemed to have occasionally undergone inter-genotype recombination events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).</p><p id="P4">ToVs were difficult to propagate in cultured cells, with the exception of equine ToV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>); however, in the last 13 years, a new cell line, human rectal tumor-18 (HRT18) cells, has been shown to be susceptible to BToV, and several BToVs in Japan were successfully isolated and propagated using HRT18 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). BToV with the full length HE gene was initially isolated from diarrheal feces, whereas cell-adapted BToV, after several passages in HRT18 cells, generally lost a full-length HE protein as a result of HE gene mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). This finding suggests that the HE protein is not essential for replication in cell culture and may instead suppress it.</p><p id="P5">ToVs historically belonged to the family <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, which was divided into the subfamilies coronavirus (CoV) and ToVs, since both viruses are structurally and morphologically similar despite having some differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). CoVs are mainly associated with respiratory and enteric diseases and are regarded as important pathogens in humans and animals. In human CoVs, in addition to four human CoVs causing mild upper respiratory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), three novel life-threating CoVs that cause acute lung injury have emerged in the 21st century, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002-2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). In animals, some CoVs cause severe or lethal diseases in swine (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [PEDV] and transmissible gastroenteritis virus [TGEV]), bovine (bovine CoV), avian (infectious bronchitis virus [IBV]), mouse (mouse hepatitis virus [MHV]), and feline (Feline infectious peritonitis virus [FIPV]) animals. As such, numerous studies have been conducted on CoVs. Notably, reverse genetics systems for many human and animal CoVs, including the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2, have been established to study these fundamental viral processes and pathogenesis or to aid in vaccine development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>). Full-length cDNA-based reverse genetics systems of CoVs have been made, although there were obstacles such as large genome sizes, thereby complicating genome engineering, and the instability of some CoV replicase genes in bacteria. Currently, four systems are available: bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), in vitro ligation of cDNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), vaccinia vector with full-length CoV cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>), and the recently developed yeast artificial chromosome systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Thanks to these systems, a greater understanding of CoVs has been gained.</p><p id="P6">In contrast to CoVs, only few studies of ToVs have been conducted, and no reverse genetics systems have been established since many ToVs are difficult to propagate in cells, and because less attention has been paid to ToVs as ToV infections are generally asymptomatic or not severe. In this study, we describe a reverse genetic system for BToV (Aichi strain) based on the cloning of a full-length genomic cDNA into BAC. Using this system, recombinant viruses with HA-tagged HE gene, untagged full-length HE gene, or with EGFP gene, were successfully rescued by manipulating the HE gene; these viruses were then characterized.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Full-length genome sequence of wild-type (wt) BToV</title><p id="P7">To determine the parent BToV (Aichi strain) for reverse genetics, the full-length genomic sequences of three plaque-purified BToV were analyzed. We tried to determine the <italic>5’</italic> terminal end of these viruses using the <italic>5’</italic> RACE method, but several different sequences were observed in the terminal three bases; 5’-TG<underline>ACGT</underline>-3’, 5’-GT<underline>ACGT</underline>-3’, 5’-GG<underline>ACGT</underline>-3’, 5’-G<underline>ACGT</underline>-3’, 5’-<underline>ACGT</underline>-3’, 5’-(-)CGT-3’. The sequence at the 5’ terminal end of three published BToVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) and two published PToVs (Accession # JQ860350 and KM403390) all shared the 5’-TG<underline>ACGT</underline>-3’ sequence, whereas equine ToV showed 5’-<underline>ACGT</underline>-3’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>). Whether the differences observed in the BToVs were due to the intrinsic features of BToV or due to suboptimal experimental condition of the 5’ RACE method remained unclear. However, 5’-TG<underline>ACGT</underline>-3, previously reported in published BToVs and PToVs, was found in only one out of seven in our analysis, whereas 5’-<underline>ACGT</underline>-3’ reported in equine BToV is a consensus sequence. Thus, in this study, the sequence at 5’ terminal end of BToV was set as 5’-<underline>ACGT</underline>-3’. Two BToV clones showed the same sequence; from these, one was selected as the parent virus (wtBToV).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Construction of a full-length BToV genome in BAC</title><p id="P8">Full-length BToV (Aichi strain) genome cDNA was assembled into the pBeloBAC11 plasmid carrying cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter, hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (Rz), and bovine growth hormone (BGH) termination, and the cDNA was inserted downstream off the CMV promoter and flanked by a 25-poly(A) sequence. The BToV genome cDNA was amplified into eight PCR fragments (BToV-A to H) carrying homology arms (hms) at both terminals, and these were sequentially assembled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) using the Red/ET recombination method described in the Materials and Methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). After assembly of the eight fragments, the BAC carrying the full-length BToV genome cDNA (pBAC-BToV<sup>mut1</sup>) contained two single mutations at nucleotide (nt) G3399Tand at nt T8469G, and the 1,350 bp <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosomal derived sequence was inserted at nt 10,136, likely to counter the toxic regions in bacteria observed in some CoVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).

Of these cells, 293T showed the best virus production with no clear cytopathic effect (CPE), and the viral titer of the supernatant 3 days post-transfection (dpt) averaged 1.0 × 10<sup>4.1</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ ml (N=3), suggesting that the host range specificity of BToV, which was difficult to propagate in cultured cells, was primarily determined by the entry step, which was also observed in CoVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). The supernatant from transfected 293T was inoculated into permissive HRT18 cells, after which the virus was plaque-purified three times, and then the purified virus was used to characterize phonotypic properties. CPE and plaque morphology induced or formed by rBToV were identical to parental wtBToV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Comparison of the full-length genome sequence between rBToV and wtBToV showed complete sequence identities except for two gene markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). To compare growth kinetics between rBToV and wtBToV, HRT18 cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001, and supernatants were harvested at the indicated times. rBToV and wtBToV had indistinguishable growth properties in HRT18 cells and had peaked titers of &gt;1.0 × 10<sup>6.4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml at 48 h post infection (pi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Thus, a full-length infectious cDNA clone of BToV in the BAC system was successfully constructed, and features of the rescued rBToV and parental wtBToV had the same phenotypic properties in HRT18 cells.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Characterization of recombinant BToV with full-length HE or HA-tagged HE gene</title><p id="P10">Although BToV initially isolated from clinical samples had full-length HE (HEf) genes, cell adapted BToV usually lost HEf due to a stop codon somewhere in HE gene. Cell-adapted wtBToV in our laboratory also has a stop codon at nt 481 (the base number of HE gene), CAG (Q)→<underline>T</underline>AG (stop), resulting in soluble HE 160 aa in length (HEs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). This suggested that HE protein is dispensable for virus replication in cells and may have a negative effect on it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). However, the precise functions of BToV HE protein in cellular viral growth still remains elusive. To investigate HE gene stability and the effect of HE protein on viral growth in HRT18 cells, recombinant BToVs with HEf, or with HA-tagged HEf and HEs genes to facilitate their detection were generated (designated as rHEf, rHEf/HA, rHEs/HA, and rBToV was written as rHEs together here, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). All these recombinant BToVs were successfully rescued using the same method described in rBToV. They displayed no significant differences in plaque morphology and CPEs (data not shown) in HRT18 cells compared to parental wtBToV and rBToV (rHEs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). To detect HEf or HA-tagged HEf and HEs proteins, HRT18 cells infected with recombinant BToVs were fixed at 24 hpi. The cells were then subjected to an α-NA esterase assay or to indirect immunofluorescence (IF) using mouse anti-M and anti-HE antiserum or using rabbit anti-HA and mouse anti-HA 12CA5 antibodies. Stained cells were observed under confocal laser scanning microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). M proteins were detected similarly in all cells infected with the recombinant BToVs, and HE proteins and α-NA esterase activity were observed only in cells infected with rHEf and rHEf/HA. On the other hand, HEs/HA proteins were well stained by both anti-HA antibodies (only rabbit anti-HA antibody was shown), whereas HEf/HA protein was barely stained despite being well detected by mouse anti-HE antiserum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). We next tried to detect HEf/HA by immunoblotting. Infected cells were lysed, and detection was performed using rabbit anti-N antiserum and two anti-HA antibodies. With similar detection of N proteins in all infected cells, HEs/HA could be detected in both anti-HA antibodies similar to IF results, whereas HEf/HA could not be detected by rabbit anti-HA but could only be detected by the mouse anti-HA 12CA5 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). To investigate whether the different reactivity of the C-terminal HA-tag was due to the modification of the HA-tag in the cytoplasm by either an infected cell metabolic change or viral proteins, HA-tagged proteins in COS7 cells transiently expressing HEf/HA and HEs/HA were attempted to be detected in the same way. Both HA-tagged proteins could be stained in IF (data not shown), but reactivity did not change in immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Although we could not rule out the possibility that differences were due to the modification or due to the expression level of HA-tag of HEf/HA in infected cells from IF results, immunoblotting results at least suggested that the C-terminal HA-tag of HEf/HA had the specific structure that affects reactivity of the anti-HA antibodies. Finally, to compare growth kinetics, HRT18 cells were infected with these recombinant BToVs with a MOI of 0.001. All these recombinant BToVs, wtBToV, and rBToV (rHEs) had no significant differences in growth properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). These results indicated that recombinant BToVs could express full-length HE and HA-tagged proteins in infected cells with growth ability comparable to those of the parental wtBToV and to rBToV (rHEs)</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Full-length HE gene stability of rHEf and rHEf/HA</title><p id="P11">To assess stability of the full-length HE gene of rHEf and rHEf/HA, HRT18 cells were infected with two clones (No.1 and No.2) derived from different plaques of each virus, and viruses were serially passaged until twenty passages (P20). Cells were infected with the viruses harvested at the indicated passage history and were fixed or lysed at 24 hpi, and then subjected to either α-NA esterase assay or N protein-detection by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A and 5B</xref>). N proteins were detected in all infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). On the other hand, cells infected with rHEf No.2 and two rHEf/HA retained α-NA esterase activity until P19, whereas cells infected with rHEf No.1 gradually decreased in activity during passages and completely lost activity at P19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). RT-PCR of the supernatants from infected cells (resulting in +1 passage history) using primers flanking the HE gene showed that during serial passages, band sizes of rHEf No.1 without esterase activity and rHEf No.2 with esterase activity were not different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). On the other hand, although both rHEf/HA exhibited esterase activity, a smaller band was observed in rHEf/HA No.2 from P10. To further study their HE genes, all these viruses at P19 were plaque-purified once, and the HE gene of viruses from six well-isolated plaques were sequenced. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, all six rHEf No.1 sequences had one base deletion at nt T19 in the HE gene, causing 17 aa short peptide with a stop codon by -1 frame shifting, and three out of six had an additional deletion between nt 1,216 to nt 1,241. In contrast, all six rHEf No.2 retained the full-length HE gene, and one out of six had an amino acid substitution at T321I in the HE protein. Out of the six, five rHEf/HA No.1 retained the HA-tagged full-length HE gene, but one had an aa mutation within the HA-tag (YPYDYPDYA→Y<underline>L</underline>YDYPDYA), whereas three rHEf/HA No.2 retained the HA-tagged full-length HE gene with a D247E substitution in the HE protein in one virus but the other three had a deletion between nt 278 to nt 878, causing a short soluble HE protein 99 aa in length. These data partly supported the idea that HE proteins are not essential or could have a negative effect on virus growth in HRT18 cells. However, it is notable that each one clone could retain the full-length HE gene up to at least twenty passages. Thus, cell adapted BToV may be able to retain full-length HE gene more stably in cells under certain conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Characterization of recombinant BToV carrying EGFP gene</title><p id="P12">Since recombinant viruses carrying the reporter gene are helpful in understanding fundamental viral processes and for screening therapeutic compounds, we attempted to generate recombinant BToV by replacing the HE gene with the EGFP gene (rEGFP). Rescued rEGFP were plaque-purified three times and expanded (clone No.1 and No.2) or expanded without plaque purification (No.3 to No.6) because of the instability of the EGFP gene described below. rEGFP formed smaller and more heterogeneous plaques compared to the parent wtBToV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). To detect EGFP in infected cells, infected cells at 36 hpi were observed under fluorescence microscope, or fixed, permeabilized, stained with mouse anti-M antiserum, and observed under confocal laser scanning microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). EGFP-expressions were observed only in cells infected with rEGFP but not with wtBToV and rBToV, and cells expressing EGFP always also expressed M protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). These infected cells were next subjected to N protein and EGFP detection by immunoblotting. Although the amount of N protein in the rEGFP-infected cells was significantly less than that of cells infected with wtBToV and rBToV, EGFP was only detected in rEGFP-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Comparison of growth kinetics among rEGFP, wtBToV, and rBToV showed that rEGFP significantly decreased growth ability. In four independent experiments, no virus could be detected at 24 hpi, and peak titer 1.0 × 10<sup>3.8-4.6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml was observed at 48 to 72 hpi in three experiments, which decreased by &gt;2 log compared to parent viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). In one experiment, peak titer reached 1.0 × 10<sup>6.6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml at 72 hpi, but the virus no longer expressed EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). These data indicated that rEGFP could express EGFP in infected cells but significantly decreased its growth properties. Moreover, rEGFP seemed to readily lose EGFP-expression during virus growth.</p><p id="P13">To study EGFP gene stability, HRT18 cells were infected with rEGFP, and viruses were serially passaged until five passages (P5). Cells were infected with rEGFP harvested at the indicated passage history and were observed under a fluorescence microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). As a result, EGFP was not observed in most of the cells infected with rEGFP (No.1 to No.4) after one passage. RT-PCR of P0 and P1 viruses using primers flanking EGFP gene found that the all P0 rEGFP predominantly had the full-length EGFP gene, but smaller bands were observed in all P1 rEGFP (No.1 to No.4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Of these, the major bands of P1 rEGFP (No.2 to No.4) were analyzed, and it was found that a large part of the EGFP gene was deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>), suggesting that rEGFP readily lost EGFP-expression due to deletion of EGFP gene after one passage.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Improvement of EGFP-expression and growth properties in rEGFP variant</title><p id="P14">Interestingly, rEGFP No.5 and No.6 maintained the EGFP gene after one passage. No.6 gradually decreased EGFP-expression until P5, while No.5 appeared to gradually increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). Thus, serial passages of rEGFP No.5 was continued until P15, and the viruses were then harvested. Cells were infected with rEGFP No.5 harvested at the indicated passage history and their supernatants (+1 passage history) were collected and subjected to RT-PCR targeting EGFP gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>), or the infected cells were lysed at 36 hpi and subjected to N protein and EGFP detection by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7C</xref>). Although smaller bands were observed, rEGFP No.5 retained full-length EGFP gene at least until P6 and mainly lost it by P9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>), but EGFP-expression was still observed in infected cells even at P9 to an extent (data not shown). The major bands of P15 rEGFP No.5 (and P6 No.6: data not shown) were analyzed by sequencing, and a part of the EGFP gene was deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>). Similar to RT-PCR results, immunoblotting of N protein and EGFP of rEGFP showed that EGFP-expression level of No.5 was maximized at P5, and this gradually decreased until P11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). It should be noted that the EGFP-expression level or growth property seemed to dramatically increase compared to that of P0 rEGFP No.5.</p><p id="P15">To further investigate P5 rEGFP No.5, this was plaque-purified three times and three clones were expanded (designated rEGFP c1-c3). These variants formed similar plaque morphologies to wtBToV and rBToV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>). Comparing growth kinetics among rEGFP c1-c3, wtBToV, and rBToV showed that their peak titer reached 1.0 × 10<sup>6.5-7.2</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ ml at 72 hpi, which is comparable to that of the parental viruses, although the peak was reached one day slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>). Cells infected with rEGFP c1-c3 were lysed at 24 hpi, and these lysates were then subjected to N protein and EGFP detection. The result indicated that EGFP-expression levels in these rEGFP c1-c3 were dramatically improved compared to P0 original virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig.8C</xref>). Analysis of the full-length genome sequence of rEGFP c1 revealed five aa substitutions at G1001S, C1442F, T2129I in NSP1, I3562T in NSP4, and I5327V in NSP10 (Helicase), respectively, strongly suggesting that these accumulated mutations in NSPs were involved in this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig.8D</xref>). Finally, EGFP gene stability in rEGFP c1-c3 were investigated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8E</xref>, these variants tend to stably express EGFP until P4, but smaller bands due to the deletion of the full-length HE gene were mainly observed, with EGFP-expression decreasing until P6 (data not shown in rEGFP c3). Sequencing the major band of P7 rEGFP c1-c3 showed deletion of the EGFP gene, similar to those observed in other rEGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7D</xref>). These data indicated that any or all of the five mutations in NSPs would contribute to some acceptance of exogenous gene such as EGFP gene, resulting in improved EGFP-expression and viral growth in cells, although the EGFP gene was eventually lost</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">In this study, we successfully constructed a full-length infectious BToV cDNA clone in a bacterial artificial chromosome.

This method is more rapid and produces mutated clones more efficiently than traditional methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>); however, despite several tries, the unintentional insertion of an <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived sequence which may counter toxic regions could not be removed. Red/ET seemed not to function in restoring the toxic region to the host. Thus, a type IIS restriction enzyme, SapI, was inserted into both ends of the <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived sequence, and this was removed by in vitro self-ligation. The resulting plasmid could be successfully propagated in <italic>E. coli</italic> without pRed/ET enzyme. Similar observations were not seen in the full-length genome assembly of PEDV and FIPV into low copy BAC plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>), but were seen in the subcloning of the TGEV cDNA fragment into high copy plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). The position wherein the <italic>E. coli</italic> sequence is inserted is similar in both (BToV at nt 10,136 and TGEV at nt 9,973), suggesting that these regions (BToV is in 3C-like protease) were particularly toxic in bacteria in ToVs and CoVs. Though it remains unclear whether very small amounts of 3C-like protease in <italic>E. coli</italic> or, functional viral proteins cleaved by this protease causes toxicity, the <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived sequence was inserted not when the BToV-C fragment containing the 3C-like protease gene was assembled but when the full-length 1ab gene (BToV-F fragment) was assembled. For BToV, since insertion of the <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived sequence was observed even in low copy BAC plasmid, this region may be more toxic than that of CoV or Red/ET recombination method may be prone to this. Thus, to establish other BAC-based ToV reverse genetics using this method, it may be better to counter the toxic region (3-C like protease gene) beforehand with an <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived sequence flanked by type IIS restriction enzymes for subsequent in vitro ligation.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Characterization of recombinant BToV with manipulating HE gene</title><p id="P18">Since cell-adapted BToV generally lost the full-length HE gene, HE protein is not essential for viral growth in cells or could suppress growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). To study this, we generated rHEf with full-length HE gene and rHEf/HA, rHEs/HA with HA-tagged HEf, or HEs gene. Comparing their growth kinetics to wtBToV and rBToV (rHEs) showed no significant differences; however, during serial passaging of two clones from each rHEf and rHEf/HA, each clone lost the full-length HE gene, supporting the above idea. In contrast, each the other clone could retain the full-length-HE gene at least until twenty passages. This was unexpected because another BToV (Niigata strain) isolated from a clinical sample in our laboratory easily lost the full-length HE gene somewhere due to a stop codon insertion until eight passages during cell-adaptation (Islam and Taguchi, unpublished data). Thus, the negative effect on HE protein in the cells of cell-adapted Aichi-BToV may be lower than that of non-cell-adapted Niigata-BToV. Furthermore, HE proteins of cell-adapted Aichi-BToV may have some advantage in terms of viral growth in the cells.</p><p id="P19">HE proteins are retained not only in ToV, but also in some of the beta CoVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>). HE is a type I glycoprotein on the viral envelope with two reversible functional domains: one binds O-acetylated sialic acids (O-Ac-Sia) and the other destroys this binding. Both viruses also contain another type I glycoprotein S protein responsible for receptor-binding and fusion activity. Among some beta CoVs, the species <italic>Betacoronavirus-1</italic>, including human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), bovine coronavirus, and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, use O-Ac-Sia as the receptor via the S protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>). Thus, these viruses bind to O-Ac-Sia via both the S and HE proteins, while HE acts as a receptor-destroying enzyme that promotes release of progeny viruses from infected cells and helps avoid attachment to non-permissive cells or to receptor-like decoy. The importance of HE in these viruses has been reported, and HE of HCoV-OC43 plays an essential role in the efficient release of progeny viruses from infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>) and balancing receptor-binding and receptor-destroying of HE contributes to host adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>). In contrast, the species <italic>Murine coronavirus</italic>, a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in which the S protein uses CAECAM1a as receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>) and in which HE binds to O-Ac-Sia exclusively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>) does not require HE proteins for viral growth. In fact, many cell-adapted laboratory strains of MHV fail to produce HE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>), with MHV rapidly losing it during serial passages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>), which is similar to BToV. On the other hand, experiments using recombinant MHV carrying the full-length HE gene showed about half of the HE deficiencies until six passages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>), while our experiment showed that some recombinant BToVs could retain HE at least until twenty passages. This may be explained by the hemagglutination activity of the S protein of cell-adapted Aichi-BToV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). It is not known whether the hemagglutination activity is mediated via O-Ac-Sia binding, but, if so, HE protein may contribute to the regulation of S protein-mediated cell surface attachment to facilitate release of progeny viruses. Alternatively, in twenty passages, accumulation of mutations in other regions may contribute to HE protein acceptance, as observed in rEGFP. Although the precise function of BToV HE remains to be elucidated, further studies using these recombinant BToVs will bring better understanding.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Characterization of recombinant BToV with EGFP gene</title><p id="P20">Since recombinant viruses expressing reporter proteins such as GFP, Red Fluorescent Protein and luciferase are useful for understanding fundamental viral processes and for high-throughput testing of therapeutic compounds, some recombinant CoVs carrying these reporters were generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). These recombinant CoVs have their ORF3, ORF4 or ORF5 accessory genes replaced with reporter genes, and these could all stably express reporter proteins, with their growth abilities comparable to or slightly reduced compared to the parent virus. In contrast, rFGFP in which the HE gene, which is also an accessory gene, was substituted with EGFP gene, could express a fluorescent protein, but it showed significantly reduced growth compared to parental wtBToV, as well as less EGFP-expression. Furthermore, rEGFP easily lost EGFP-expression ability after only one passage due to the deletion of HE genes. Since EGFP itself is a neutral protein, which probably does not give any advantage or disadvantage to viral growth in cells, whereas rEGFP with deleted EGFP gene increased in terms of growth properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6D</xref>), EGFP gene itself rather than EGFP would lead to a significant decrease in viral growth. It is interesting to note that, despite eight independent experiments, starting points of HE deletion in the five were concentrated at around specific positions, namely nt 24, 27, 28, and 30, and likewise the end points of the four were concentrated at around nt 668, 671, 673, and 690 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7D</xref>), suggesting that “specific negative positions” of the EGFP gene are easily recognized and deleted. Deletion patterns of the EGFP gene showed that in many cases, a large part of or the entire EGFP, even including a part of the transcription-regulating sequence of EGFP (HE) and, the untranslated region between EGFP (HE) and the N genes, were deleted, whereas a relatively short deletion leading to retention of more than 80% of the EGFP gene was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>). All rEGFP with deleted genes rapidly replaced intact rEGFP, likely under negative selection of EGFP genetic structure. These suggested that either the entirety or a part of the EGFP gene structure may suppress viral genome replication or transcription, resulting in decreased viral growth.</p><p id="P21">On the other hand, rEGFP variant obtained during serial passages showed remarkably improved EGFP-expression and growth ability in the cells. This is noteworthy considering EGFP gene has a negative effect on viral growth whereas a neutral EGFP protein exists without clear positive selection. rEGFP variant contained accumulated five mutations in NSPs: three in NSP1, and one each in NSP4 and NSP10 (helicase), respectively. Though functions of NSP1 and NSP4 of ToVs remain unknown, the primary function of helicase, which is highly conserved among nidoviruses including ToVs and CoVs, is to unwind DNA or RNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>). The crystal structure of MERS-CoV helicase (corresponding to NSP13) showed that it comprises multiple domains, an N-terminal Cys/His rich domain (CH) binding to three zinc atoms, a beta-barrel domain, and a C-terminal helicase core with two Rec-A like domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>). Protein sequence alignment between MERS and BToV helicase by MEGA6 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>) revealed that the mutation at I5327V (I68V in helicase) was located next to Cys69 (corresponding to Cys72 of MERS-CoV helicase) in the CH, one of the cysteine residues that coordinated with the third zinc atom. It was reported that alanine substitutions in highly conserved Cys/His in CH of HCoV-229E and other nidovirus equine viral arteritis have big effects on helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref>). Thus, one possibility is that mutation in the CH of rEGFP helicase may facilitate to unwind “specific negative positions” of the EGFP gene, resulting in increased growth. However, even this variant showed similar EGFP gene deletion patterns to other intact rFGFP until five passages. This finding that the virus tolerates unfavorable foreign gene to some degree without clear positive selection may contribute in understanding the mechanism by which the virus evolves by accepting other genes.</p><p id="P22">In this article, we descraibe a reverse genetics platform for BAC-based BToV, which is a useful tool for understanding fundamental viral processes and pathogenesis and for BToV vaccine development.

After 2 dpi, supernatants were harvested and viruses were plaque-purified three times. A 20 μL aliquot from the 100 μL plaque suspension was added to HRT18 cells with 480 μL DMEM(-) in 24-well plates, and the supernatant was harvested after 2 dpi. This was stored at -70°C as a master virus. Next, 100 μL of the master viruses were expanded on HRT18 cells with 10 mL DMEM(-) in a 10 cm dish, and these viruses were harvested after the appropriate CPE was observed. These were stored as passage 0 (P0) viruses, which were used for subsequent experiments. In the case of rEGFP, plaque purification of some recombinant viruses (No.3 to No.6) were omitted because of EGFP gene instability. 293T cells prepared on a 3 cm dish were transfected with 5 times reagent volumes and pBAC-BToV-EGFP. The 2.5 mL supernatants of transfected HRT18 cells were inoculated into the cells in a 10 cm dish to expand the viruses, and these viruses were then harvested. In this case, these were used as passage 0 (P0) viruses. The nomenclature of recombinant BToV rescued from these BAC plasmids was rBToV(rHEs), rHEf, rHEs/HA, rHEf/HA and rEGFP, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Immunofluorescence staining</title><p id="P31">A 35 mm glass base dish (12 mm glass area) (Iwaki, Shizuoka, Japan) was seeded with 1.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> HRT18 cells, the day before the experiment. Cells were washed twice with PBS and infected with 300 μL recombinant BToV in DMEM(-) with a MOI of 0.05. After 24 hpi (and 36 hpi only for the rEGFP), infected cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature (rt), and were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min at RT. Cells were incubated with mouse anti-HE, anti-M antiserum, or rabbit and mouse anti-HA antibodies at 4°C overnight, and were then incubated with a mixed FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse or mixed AlexaFluor™ 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse for mouse antiserum and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies for rabbit antibody, for 2 h at rt. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 solution (Dojindo) for 20 min at rt. PBS washing was done twice between each step. Stained cells were observed under confocal laser scanning microscopy using an LSM 710 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>α-naphthyl acetate esterase activity</title><p id="P32">HRT18 cells grown in 24-well plates were infected with recombinant BToVs with a MOI of 0.05.

At 24 hpi (and 36 hpi only for rEGFP), infected HRT18 cells and 40 hpt transfected COS7 cells were lysed with 100 μL sample buffer (50 mM Tris, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) and were boiled for 5 min. N protein, EGFP, and HA-tagged proteins of samples were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Merck Millipore, Tokyo, Japan). The membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-N antiserum or mouse anti-GFP antibody, and then with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies, respectively. To detect HA-tagged proteins, mouse-anti-HA 12CA5 antibody for HA-tagged HEf and rabbit anti-HA antibody for HA-tagged HEs were used because of differences in their reactivity.

After the appropriate CPE was observed (2 to 3 dpi), the supernatant was harvested and 0.5 uL was inoculated to the fresh cells, resulting in a serial passages by 1,000-fold diluted virus. To estimate stability of the HEf and EGFP genes during serial passages, HRT18 cells in a 24-well plate were infected with rHEf and rHEf/HA harvested at the indicated passage history with a MOI of 0.05, and cells at 24 hpi were subjected to an α-NA esterase assay or to immunoblotting of N proteins. EGFP-expression of the infected cells with rEGFP were monitored during serial passages under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus CKX41 U-RFLT50; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Later, images of cells infected with rEGFP harvested at the indicated passage history at the same conditions were taken, and EGFP and N proteins were detected by immunoblotting. Supernatants of the infected cells (resulting in +1 passage history) were subjected to RNA extraction, RT-PCR, and sequencing described above. PCR fragments of 1130 and 1630 bp containing HE and EGFP genes, respectively, were amplified using Takara ExTaq (Takara) under the following conditions [94°C, 5min; 30 cycles of (94°C, 30 s; 50°C, 30 s; 72°C, 1 min/kb); 72°C 10min]. DNase treatment was also performed before RNA extraction to digest BAC plasmid from transfection, depending on passage history.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Dr. Tsunemitsu Hiroshi (Nishimikawa Livestock Hygiene Service Center, Japan) for providing cell-adapted BToV (Aichi strain) and Drs.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Importance</title></caption><p>ToVs are diarrhea-causing pathogens that have been detected in many species, including humans. BToV has spread worldwide, leading to economic losses. We developed the first reverse genetics system for Tobaniviridae using a BAC-based BToV. Using this system, we showed that recombinant BToVs with HEf and HEs showed no significant differences in cell growth. In contrast, clinical BToVs generally lose the HE gene after a few passages but some recombinant viruses retained the HE gene for up to 20 passages, suggesting some benefits of HE retention. The EGFP gene of the recombinant viruses was unstable and was rapidly deleted, likely via negative selection. Interestingly, one virus variant with mutations in NSPs was more stable, resulting in improved EGFP-expression and viral growth, suggesting that the mutations contributed to some acceptance of the exogenous EGFP gene without clear positive selection. The recombinant BToVs and reverse genetics developed here are powerful tools for understanding fundamental viral processes and their pathogenesis and for developing BToV vaccines.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Assembly of a BToV full-length cDNA into a BAC and flowchart of Red/ET recombination.</title><p>(A) The genome sequence of BToV is divided into eight fragments (BToV-A to H), and each fragment contained homology arms (hm) overlapping each fragment at the 3’ and 5’ terminal ends (vertical dashed line). To distinguish the base number between BToV genome and BAC, the BToV genome of 28,313 nt without poly(A) (25 nt) was written as the normal number, while BAC of 8,219 bp was written as the number in parentheses starting with the CMV promoter.

(ii) The linear rpsL/Neo counter-selection/selection cassette flanked by hms was electroporated, and the Red/ET enzyme inserted the rpsL/Neo cassette into the target position via hms. After selecting appropriate antibodies, (iii) the Red/ET enzyme in <italic>E. coli</italic> carrying the modified BAC could replace the rpsL/Neo cassette with the cDNA fragment of BToV in the same way.
