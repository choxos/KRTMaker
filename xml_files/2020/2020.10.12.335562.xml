<abstract>
<p id="P1">The Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 to direct fusion with host cells. S comprises a large external domain, a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a short cytoplasmic tail. Understanding the intracellular trafficking of S is relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to vaccines expressing full-length S from mRNA or adenovirus vectors. We have applied proteomics to identify cellular factors that interact with the cytoplasmic tail of S. We confirmed interactions with the COPI and COPII vesicle coats, ERM family actin regulators, and the WIPI3 autophagy component. The COPII binding-site promotes exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and although COPI-binding should retain S in the early Golgi where viral budding occurs, there is a suboptimal histidine residue in the recognition motif. As a result, S leaks to the surface where it accumulates and can direct the formation of multinucleate syncytia. Thus, the trafficking signals in the tail of S indicate that syncytia play a role in the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Coronavirus virions are encapsulated by a lipid bilayer that contains a small set of membrane proteins including the S protein that binds to, and fuses with, target cells, and the Membrane (M) protein that recruits the viral genome into the virion<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. Virions of SARS-CoV-2 and other betacoronviridae also contain the minor structural Envelope (E) protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. In infected cells, all three proteins are initially inserted into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are then trafficked to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the Golgi where they are glycosylated, and in the case of S also cleaved, by Golgi enzymes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. Virions form by budding into the membranes of the ERGIC and Golgi, and membrane-bound carriers then transfer the newly-formed virions to the surface for release from the cell<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. Once released, the virions thus display S on their surface where it can bind the host plasma membrane protein ACE2 to mediate fusion and thus infection of further cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. Although SARS-CoV-2 and most other coronaviruses do not bud from the cell surface, some S protein is found on the surface of infected cells. Consistent with this, infected cells have been observed to fuse with neighbouring cells to form large multinucleate cells or syncytia<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">Thus, S must exit the ER to reach the ERGIC and later Golgi compartments, with some travelling all the way to the cell surface but the majority being retained at the site of viral budding. In many coronaviruses, the latter retention is, in part, mediated by an interaction with M, which contains a Golgi localisation signal<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. In addition, S proteins typically have binding sites for the COPI vesicle coat in their cytoplasmic tail, and it has been proposed that COPI-mediated recycling within the Golgi allows S to come into contact with M which then retains it there<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. Insight into the intracellular traffic of S is thus relevant to understanding the replication of SARS-CoV-2 during infection. In addition, the majority of current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are based on using either mRNA or adenovirus vectors to express the full-length S protein in cells of the vaccine recipient<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. The location of S in the cell when expressed by the vaccine could affect its initial presentation to the immune system, and also the effect of the induced immunity on the S expressed by a subsequent vaccine boost.</p>
<p id="P4">S comprises a large external domain, a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a short cytoplasmic tail<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. The traffic of membrane proteins through the secretory pathway is typically mediated by interactions between their cytoplasmic tails and the coat proteins that form the carriers that move proteins and lipids between compartments. To investigate the mechanisms by which S protein becomes distributed between the membranes of host cells we have used affinity chromatography to identify the cellular factors that recognise its cytoplasmic tail. By mapping the residues in the tail required for these interactions we could then test their role in vivo, and so provide evidence that several features of the tail of SARS-CoV-2 enable its accumulation at the cell surface which suggests that syncytia could have a role in viral propagation, and also has implications for vaccine design.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Affinity chromatography of cytosol with the cytoplasmic tail of S</title>
<p id="P5">The 37 residue cytoplasmic tail of S was expressed in bacteria as a fusion to GST, and used for affinity chromatography of cytosol from human 293T cells. Proteins that bound preferentially to the tail fusion rather than GST alone were identified by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The highest hits included several vesicle coat proteins and three related proteins, ezrin, moesin and radixin, that link membrane proteins to actin. Ezrin was previously reported as a hit in a yeast two-hybrid screen with the cytoplasmic tail of S from SARS, and suggested to have a role in restraining viral entry<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. The vesicle coat proteins include subunits of the coatomer complex that forms COPI-coated vesicles, consistent with a previous report that coatomer binds to the closely related cytoplasmic tail of the S protein of SARS<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. In addition to these known interactors, there was a strong enrichment of subunits of the COPII coat that forms ER-to-Golgi vesicles, and of the sorting nexin SNX27 and its associated retromer complex that together recycle proteins from endosomes to the cell surface<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>. The few other strong hits are not linked to membrane traffic and were not investigated further, with the exception of WIPI3/WDR45B which interacts with membranes to regulate autophagy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. The significance of these other hits will thus not be clear until validated by in vitro and in vivo studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Mapping of binding sites in the cytoplasmic tail of S</title>
<p id="P6">To dissect the roles of the different coat proteins we mapped the regions that they bind on the 37 residue S protein tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). The tail comprises two distinct sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). The membrane proximal half (1237-1254) contains eight cysteines which are known to be palmitoylated in the equivalent region in SARS and other coronaviruses and, once modified, are likely to be embedded in the surface of the bilayer<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. The distal half of the tail (1255-1273) lacks cysteines and so will project into the cytoplasm. Testing GST fusions to these two halves showed that all the interactors bound to the distal region with the exception of SNX27 which exclusively bound to the cysteine-rich region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 1a,b</xref>). To map binding at higher resolution, we tested tails with adjacent pairs of residues mutated to alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). COPII binding was reduced by mutations in the acidic stretch DEDDSE that contains three copies of the di-acidic ER exit motif that is recognised by the Sec24 subunit of the coat<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. In contrast, COPI binding required the residues in the C-terminal KXHXX motif that was also found to be required for this interaction in SARS-CoV S protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. Finally, binding of the FERM domain proteins required residues between the COPI and COPII binding sites, and SNX27 binding required residues in the N-terminal half of the tail nearest the TMD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Direct binding of trafficking proteins to the tail of S</title>
<p id="P7">To further validate these interactions, we used recombinant proteins to test direct binding. Binding of COPI to KXKXX-type motifs is known to be primarily via the Œ≤-propellor domain of the Œ≤‚Äô-COP subunit<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>, and we could confirm that this part of the human protein binds directly to the tail of S from SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Recombinant SNX27 also bound directly to the tail, with residues 1238TSC next to the transmembrane domain being important, with the same residues found to be required for recruitment of SNX27 from cell lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). SNX27 associates with retromer via the latter‚Äôs VPS26 subunit, and we found that VPS26 is recruited to the tail of S protein by the addition of SNX27 indicating that the tail can bind SNX27 whilst it is in a complex with retromer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Interestingly, some tail mutants that lost SNX27 binding retained binding to retromer indicating that this complex can also bind elsewhere in the tail. Mutation of residues required for SNX27 or moesin binding in full length S protein did not detectably alter its intracellular distribution or accumulation on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>), indicating that these interactions do not have a role in cell surface delivery. Recently, two high-throughput screens for cellular factors required for SARS-CoV-2 infection of cultured cells identified retromer and SNX27 as hits, although this may be due to a role in trafficking of ACE2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. It should also be noted that the binding of SNX27, although very efficient, is to the region of the tail that will be palmitoylated in host cells and so the in vivo significance of this interaction remains uncertain.</p>
<p id="P8">Moesin is known to interact with plasma membrane proteins via its N-terminal FERM domain, and this part of the protein bound directly to the S protein tail, with residues 1261SEPV being essential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The autophagy regulator WIPI3, when expressed in E. coli, also bound directly to the membrane distal half of the tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Role of the binding sites for COPII in traffic of S</title>
<p id="P9">We next examined the contribution of the COPI and COPII binding sites to the subcellular distribution of S protein. Mutation of the acidic residues in the COPII binding region greatly reduced cell surface expression, with S protein accumulating in the ER, indicating that these residues direct efficient egress of the newly-made S protein out of the ER and into the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-c</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>The binding site in S for COPI is sub-optimal</title>
<p id="P10">The COPI binding region comprises KLHYT which differs somewhat from the canonical KXKXX or KKXX C-terminal COPI binding motif<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>, and it has been speculated for SARS-CoV that this non-canonical motif might allow more S to reach the surface, although this was not tested experimentally<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. We thus initially determined whether COPI binding to the KLHYT region was actually suboptimal by examining the effect on binding of changing His1271 to a canonical lysine. For a H1271K variant of the tail, binding of COPI from cytosol was substantially increased, whereas K1269A and H1271A variants showed reduced binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-c</xref>). Thus, the presence of His rather than Lys at residue 1271 results in the COPI binding site being suboptimal. In addition, in the above alanine scanning of the tail, mutation of the terminal residue T1273 to alanine was found to increase COPI binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), and this effect was recapitulated, suggesting the C-terminal threonine is a further feature of the tail that reduces its affinity for COPI.</p>
<p id="P11">Incorporation of the K1269A COPI binding site mutation into full length S protein caused, at most, only a small increase in the cell surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). In contrast, the H1271K and T1273A mutations that increase COPI binding both caused S protein to instead accumulate intracellularly with substantial co-localisation with the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d,e</xref>). The proximity of the COPII and COPI binding sites in the very short tail of S means that mutations that affect the binding of one coat might also affect the other, especially as structures of COPI and COPII bound to peptides show that residues around the conserved motif can also make contact with the coat protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup>. We thus also checked the binding of COPII to these variants, and found that indeed the H1271K mutation did reduce COPII binding slightly which may slow ER exit somewhat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). However, the T1273A mutation did not bind less well to COPII and so the reduced cell surface expression is likely to reflect increased COPI binding rather than a reduction of interaction with COPII. Compared to H1271K, the T1273A mutant showed more post-ER staining in the perinuclear region, and this colocalised with the cis-Golgi marker GM130, consistent with a protein that is leaving the ER but then being recycled by binding COPI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">These experiments were performed with S alone, but SARS-CoV-2 also expresses membrane (M) protein which in many coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, is known to interact with S and cause it to accumulate in the Golgi where virion assembly occurs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. When the location of S was examined in cells co-expressing M, we found that, as expected, it caused S to accumulate with M in the Golgi, but it only reduces rather than eliminates the appearance of S on the surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). This surface expression is further reduced by mutation of the COPII-binding site, and also by the H1271K and the T1273A mutations that optimise the COPI binding site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Immunofluorescence shows that these variants still have the substantial ER staining seen in the absence of M (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). In these cases, M itself remains in the Golgi, consistent with previous studies with other coronaviruses that found that S and M do not associate in the ER, but rather assemble at the site of virion budding in the early Golgi<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup>. Thus, even in the presence of M, the COPII binding site in S is required for exit from the ER, and an optimised COPI binding site in S can be recognised so as to reduce transport to the surface.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S8">
<title>S is not efficiently endocytosed from the cell surface</title>
<p id="P13">Thus, the COPI binding site in S has conserved features that reduce its ability to act as a retention signal in the Golgi and so allow at least some S to reach the cell surface. Some other coronaviruses, including those that have a histidine residue at the -3 position in the tail of S, have been found to be efficiently endocytosed if they reach the surface<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
</sup>. In these cases, endocytosis requires a tyrosine-containing motif that resembles the classic YxxœÜ signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), but the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 lacks such a motif and consistent with this, we found that when it accumulated on the surface it was not efficiently endocytosed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S9">
<title>Syncytia formation is increased by the suboptimal COPI binding site</title>
<p id="P14">What might be the reason for S protein to accumulate at the cell surface? SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, buds into intracellular membranes and so S protein that has reached the plasma membrane will not contribute to virion formation but it is in a position to cause infected cells to fuse to adjacent cells and so facilitate spread without virion release. We thus tested the effect of the mutations in the COPI binding site on the degree of cell fusion induced by S protein. 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing S protein and mixed with Vero cells expressing human ACE2. In this assay system S is expressed in cells that are human but do not express ACE2, and the fusion target expressed human ACE2, and is a cell line widely used for fusion with S or intact virus, with fusion being followed in this case by mixing of different fluorescent markers present in the two cell types<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup>. Using this assay we found that the K1269A mutant that prevents COPI binding caused a small but reproducible increase in cell fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>). In contrast, the H1271K mutation that binds better to COPI resulted in greatly reduced cell fusion, with the mutant S also showing reduced levels of S1/S2 cleavage, consistent with it not moving beyond the early Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). This suggests, that at least in this context, the sub-optimal COPI binding site enhances the ability of S to form syncytia.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P15">The data presented here indicate that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has three features that facilitate its accumulation on the plasma membrane. Firstly, a region containing diacidic COPII binding motifs directs efficient exit from the ER. Secondly, the COPI-binding site is suboptimal which allows some S protein to escape the Golgi apparatus. Consistent with this, the S protein of the coronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has a related C-terminal sequence (-KVHVQ) and binds COPI with a much lower affinity than canonical KXKXX motifs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. Finally, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 is not efficiently endocytosed, consistent with it lacking a tyrosine-containing motif of the sort that is found in many other coronaviruses, including PEDV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). For several of these other coronaviruses the tyrosine-containing motifs has been shown to either induce endocytosis or prevent movement beyond the Golgi<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>. Our data do not provide insight into possible roles for the other interactions we have observed, and progress may require testing in different cells or in conditions of virus replication. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the ERM proteins anchor plasma membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton and hence can direct their accumulation at specific regions of the cell surface, and also that cell fusion proteins expressed by reoviruses have been found to direct actin filament formation to drive cell fusion<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>
</sup>. Two recent studies have reported interaction screens of all proteins expressed by SARS-CoV-2, looking for host proteins that co-precipitate with each viral protein when expressed individually in cultured cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup>. In both cases, the only interaction partners identified for S were the palmitoyltransferase subunits ZDHHC5 and GOLGA7. However, in both studies S was expressed with an HA-tag at the C-terminus of the cytoplasmic tail. Not only does the KXKXX motif have to be at the C-terminus for recognition by COPI, but it also seems likely that the presence of a bound antibody adjacent to the small cytoplasmic tail would obstruct binding of large coat protein complexes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P16">Overall, our results, along with previous studies on SARS-CoV, provide a clear explanation of why S accumulates on the cell surface when expressed alone. In SARS-CoV-2 infected cells the majority of S accumulates at the site of virion biogenesis in the early Golgi due to an interaction with M, as happens with other coronaviruses including SARS<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>. Nonetheless, even in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells it is clear that at least some S reaches the surface, and syncytia formation has been observed in cultured airway epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, in post mortem samples of patients who have died of COVID-19, and in nonhuman primate models<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>
</sup>. Syncytia formation is a known feature of a diverse range of viruses, including other respiratory viruses such as measles and respiratory syncytial virus. It is proposed that it allows rapid and efficient spread of viruses between cells in a manner that also evades immune surveillance<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>
</sup>. One striking example is the reoviruses which are not enveloped, but particular strains have been found to carry a gene for a fusion protein that directs cell-cell fusion, with this fusion protein being required for pathogenicity but not replication<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>
</sup>. Indeed, it seems conceivable that the formation of large syncytia could increase viral pathogenicity by destablising airway epithelia or creating holes that are harder to repair than the loss of a single infected cell. It has recently been reported that syncytia formation by SARS-CoV-2 S can induce pyroptosis, and it has been proposed for other viral-mediated fusion events that cell death following syncytia formation can affect immune responses<sup>

</sup>. All this has led to an interest in the possibility that syncytia formation by SARS-CoV-2 is a potential target for therapeutic strategies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>
</sup>. Indeed, the process appears entirely dependent on the cell surface protease TMPRSS2 to make the activating S2‚Äô cleavage, whereas viral entry can be facilitated by either TMPRSS2 or lysosomal cathepsins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. Nonetheless, it should be stressed that for SARS-CoV-2 the importance of syncytia for either infection or pathogenicity remains to be proven, but our findings at least suggest a means by which this could be tested by examining the effect of making changes in the cytoplasmic tail that reduce the cell surface expression of S, and hence the rate of syncytia formation, without otherwise affecting viral replication.</p>
<p id="P17">The trafficking of S protein to the cell surface has implications beyond understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection, as intact S is also expressed by the current vaccines based on mRNA or adenovirus vectors<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. In this case, S is expressed without other viral proteins and so will almost certainly to be efficiently trafficked to the cell surface. Syncytia formation is unlikely to be an issue as most of the vaccines express a version of S that is stabilised in the pre-fusion state by changing two residues to proline, and this change greatly reduces syncytia formation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>
</sup>. However, the location of S within the cell could affect the efficiency with which it is recognised as a non-host protein and then processed by the immune system to generate an immune response. Once an immune response has been evoked, a second vaccination will expose more S on the surface of cells, and again, altering the location of S could conceivably reduce adverse reactions from immune attack on host cells, especially if multiple rounds of vaccination prove to be required to contain future variants of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="P18">Clearly, further studies will be required for investigating the importance of the intracellular location of S for both SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine design. However, our studies should provide a framework for testing the effect on both processes of altering the location of S by rational mutation of the trafficking signals in its cytoplasmic tail.</p>

Constructs used for bacterial expression of the cytoplasmic domains of the Spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2: the sequence encoding the N-terminally GST-tagged cytoplasmic domain of S were cloned into the vector pGEX6p2 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). For GST-S (1255-1273, pJC149) and GST-S (1237-1273, pJC150), the inserts and vector were amplified by PCR and assembled using Gibson cloning with the linker SDLEVLFQGPLGSPGIQ. For GST-S (1237-1254, pJC247) in pGEX6p2, sequence specific primers were annealed and inserted at the EcoRI and BamHI sites with the linker SDLEVLFQGPLGSPGIQ. For the alanine mutants of GST-S (pJC173 to pJC190, and pJC254 to pJC257) two fragments of pJC150 were amplified by PCR using mutation specific primers and assembled by Gibson cloning. gBlocks and PCR amplified vector were assembled by Gibson cloning. or the constructs used in figure 4b to express single alanine mutations pLGW829, and pJC206 to pJC210, mutation specific oligos were annealed and ligated to pGEX6p2 digested with EcoRI and XhoI.</p>

Clarified bacterial lysates were added to the glutathione Sepharose beads, and incubated at 4¬∞C for 1 hour on a tube roller. 293T cells (from four confluent T175 flasks per GST-tagged bait) were collected by scraping and lysed with lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (EDTA-free, cOmplete, Roche). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 17,000 <italic>x g</italic> and pre-cleared with 100 ŒºL of Glutathione Sepharose bead slurry per bait. Beads loaded with recombinant GST-tagged baits were washed once with ice-cold lysis buffer, once with lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mM NaCl, and once again with lysis buffer. Around 5% of the beads were kept aside as an input control and the remaining beads were incubated with the pre-cleared 293T cell lysate for 2-4 hours on a tube roller at 4¬∞C. Beads were washed twice with lysis buffer, transferred to 0.8 mL centrifuge columns (Pierce 89869B) and washed twice more.

<p id="P27">Polyacrylamide gel slices (1-2 mm) were placed in a well of a 96-well microtitre plate and destained with 50% v/v acetonitrile and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, reduced with 10 mM DTT, and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide. After alkylation, proteins were digested with 6 ng/ŒºL trypsin (Promega, UK) overnight at 37 ¬∞C. The resulting peptides were extracted in 2% v/v formic acid, 2% v/v acetonitrile. The digests were analysed by nano-scale capillary LC-MS/MS using an Ultimate U3000 HPLC (ThermoScientific Dionex, San Jose, USA) to deliver a flow of approximately 300 nL/min. A C18 Acclaim PepMap100 5 Œºm, 100 Œºm x 20 mm nanoViper (ThermoScientific Dionex, San Jose, USA), trapped the peptides prior to separation on a C18 BEH130 1.7 Œºm, 75 Œºm x 250 mm analytical UPLC column (Waters, UK). Peptides were eluted with a 60-minute gradient of acetonitrile (2% to 80%). The analytical column outlet was directly interfaced via a nano-flow electrospray ionisation source, with a quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive HFX, ThermoScientific, USA). MS data were acquired in data-dependent mode using a top 10 method, where ions with a precursor charge state of 1 + were excluded. High-resolution full scans (R=60,000, m/z 300-1800) were recorded in the Orbitrap followed by higher energy collision dissociation (HCD) (26 % Normalized Collision Energy) of the 10 most intense MS peaks. The fragment ion spectra were acquired at a resolution of 15,000 and dynamic exclusion window of 20s was applied. Raw data files from LC-MS/MS data were processed using Proteome Discoverer v2.1 (Thermo Scientific), and then searched against a human protein database (UniProtKB, reviewed) using the Mascot search engine programme (Matrix Science, UK).</p>

One missed enzyme cleavage was allowed and variable modifications for oxidized methionine, carbamidomethyl cysteine, pyroglutamic acid, phosphorylated serine, threonine and tyrosine were included. MS/MS data were validated using the Scaffold programme (Proteome Software Inc., USA). All data were additionally interrogated manually.

<title>Proteomic analysis of the binding partners of the cytoplasmic tail of SARS-CoV-2 S protein.</title>
<p>
<bold>a</bold> Mass spectrometry analysis from affinity chromatography of 293T cell lysates using GST-S tail (1237-1273). The plot compares the average spectral counts from three independent replicates of GST-S(1237-1273) versus the negative control (GST). Values are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>
<bold>b</bold> Volcano plot comparing the spectral intensities from proteins bound to GST-S(1237-1273) or GST alone, using data from three independent experiments.</p>
<p>
<bold>c</bold> Immunoblots of eluates from the indicated GST-tagged S tails as prepared in (<bold>a</bold>). Coomassie blue-stained gels show the GST-tail fusions with adjacent residues of the tail of S (residues 1237-1273) mutated to alanine. The blots shown are representative from two independent experiments, and the input lysate represents 1/100 of the material applied to the GST fusions.</p>
<p>
<bold>d</bold> Validation of the interactions using two distinct halves of the tail of S: the membrane proximal half (residues 1237-1254) and the distal half (residues 1255-1273). The blots shown are representative from three independent experiments. Binding of COPII is seen to residues 1237-1254 but this could be spurious - this region contains eight cysteines, and only one charged residue and so could be sticky in the absence of the rest of the tail and thus binds COPII non-specifically. In the context of the entire tail, none of the double alanine mutations in this region reduces substantially COPII binding, in contrast to what is seen with Snx27.</p>
<p>
<bold>e</bold> Schematic of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The residues that are critical for binding to the different cytoplasmic factors are indicated.</p>

<title>The tail of SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds directly to moesin, WIPI3, SNX27, and to VPS26 via SNX27.</title>
<p>
<bold>a</bold> Coomassie-stained gel and immunoblot against 6xHis to test the binding from bacterial cell lysates of the Œ≤-propellor of the Œ≤‚Äô-COP subunit of COPI (residues 1 -304 with an MBP-His6 tag) to beads coated with GST fusions to the tail of S. Experiment representative of three repeats with either His6-MBP-tag (as here) or with His-tag alone. Input is 1/50 of that applied to beads.</p>
<p>
<bold>b</bold> Coomassie gel showing that the residues 1238ThrSerCys1240 of the tail of S are required for binding to SNX27. As in (<bold>a)</bold> except that the lysate was from cells overexpressing SNX27-6xHis. Experiment repeated three times, input 1/40 that applied to beads.</p>
<p>
<bold>c</bold> Coomassie gel showing that VPS26 requires SNX27 to bind to the tail of S protein. Same experiment as in (<bold>a</bold>) except that beads coated with the GST-fusions were incubated with bacterial lysate from cells overexpressing either SNX27-6xHis, 6xHis-VPS26 or both. Experiment repeated twice.</p>
<p>
<bold>d</bold> Coomassie-stained gel and immunoblot against 6xHis to test the binding of the FERM domain of moesin (residues 1-300, expressed in bacterial lysate) to GST fusions to the tail of S. Experiment repeated twice, input is 1/40 (Coomassie) or 1/160 (immunoblot) of that applied to beads.</p>
<p>
<bold>e</bold> As in (<bold>d</bold>), except beads coated with the indicated GST-fusions were incubated with lysates from bacteria overexpressing WIPI3-6xHis. Experiment repeated twice, input is 1/14 (Coomassie) or 1/160 (immunoblot) of that applied to beads.</p>

<bold>c</bold> Quantification of (<bold>b</bold>) by flow cytometry. Displayed are overlaid histograms representing the ratio of extracellular S (AF488 signal) to that of intracellular S (AF647 signal) for wild-type S and the D/E to A mutant. Histograms normalised to the mode value, and represent &gt;10,000 events. Chi-squared test shows the difference in the median ratios (wild-type, 0.78; D/E&gt;A, 0,096) to be statistically significant (P&lt;0.01). Representative of six independent experiments.</p>

<bold>d</bold> Flow cytometry analysis of U2OS cells expressing the indicated forms of S. The histograms represent the ratio of extracellular S (AF488 signal) to that of intracellular S (AF647 signal). Histograms normalised to the mode value and represent ~10,000 events. Chi-squared tests show the differences between the median ratios of the wild-type (0.87) and those of K1269A (1.1), H1271K (0.11), and T1273A (0.12) to all be statistically significant (P&lt;0.01). Representative of four independent experiments.</p>
<p>
<bold>e</bold> Micrographs of U2OS cells transiently expressing N-terminally HA-tagged wild-type S or the indicated mutants. Cell surface S was initially stained using AF647-labelled anti-HA under non-permeabilising conditions. Cells were then permeabilised and stained with AF488-labelled anti-HA to detect the internal S, and for the ER marker calreticulin. Both H1271K and T1273A accumulate in the ER, with the latter‚Äôs additional perinuclear location presumably reflecting subtle differences in relative ER to Golgi, and Golgi to ER transport kinetics due to differential effects on COPI and COPII binding. Scale bars 10 Œºm. Experiment repeated twice.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 S leakage to the plasma membrane facilitates cell-cell fusion and the formation of syncytia.</title>
<p>
<bold>a</bold> Comparison of the cytoplasmic tails of S proteins from the four genera of Coronaviridae, aligned by their TMDs. Binding motifs for trafficking proteins are indicated, along with cysteine residues (orange).</p>
<p>
<bold>b</bold> Representative micrographs showing 293T cells coexpressing mCherry and different full-length S variants fusing with acceptor Vero cells stained with CellTracker Green. Cell fusion is monitored by overlap between the green and red signal. Retention of S in the ER reduces its capacity to form syncytia while increased leakage to the plasma membrane increases it. Scale bars: 200 Œºm.</p>
<p>
<bold>c</bold> Quantification of cell-cell fusion as percentage of field showing green and red overlap area. N = 2, error bars SEM. The rate of cell fusion with K1269A is significantly faster than wildtype (P&lt;0.005), and H1271K significantly slower (P&lt;0.0001), as determined by linear regression analysis of the values over the period of maximal rate (3-9 hours).</p>
