<abstract>
<p id="P1">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is a dire need for novel effective antivirals to treat COVID-19, as the only approved direct-acting antiviral to date is remdesivir, targeting the viral polymerase complex. A potential alternate target in the viral life cycle is the main SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CL<sup>pro</sup> (M<sup>pro</sup>). The drug candidate PF-00835231 is the active compound of the first anti-3CL<sup>pro</sup> regimen in clinical trials. Here, we perform a comparative analysis of PF-00835231, the pre-clinical 3CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor GC-376, and the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, in alveolar basal epithelial cells modified to express ACE2 (A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells). We find PF-00835231 with at least similar or higher potency than remdesivir or GC-376. A time-of-drug-addition approach delineates the timing of early SARS-CoV-2 life cycle steps in A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells and validates PF-00835231's early time of action. In a model of the human polarized airway epithelium, both PF-00835231 and remdesivir potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations. Finally, we show that the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, which was previously suggested to diminish PF-00835231's efficacy based on experiments in monkey kidney Vero E6 cells, does not negatively impact PF-00835231 efficacy in either A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells or human polarized airway epithelial cultures. Thus, our study provides <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence for the potential of PF-00835231 as an effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral and addresses concerns that emerged based on prior studies in non-human <italic>in vitro</italic> models.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">In December 2019, multiple cases of severe pneumonia with unexplained etiology were reported in Wuhan, China<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. The infectious agent was identified as a novel member of the family <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>, later named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. The resulting disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has since become a deadly pandemic.</p>
<p id="P3">A number of candidate drugs that may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication have been proposed. However, only one direct-acting antiviral is currently approved for the treatment of COVID-19: remdesivir, a nucleoside analog that inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp). Remdesivir is incorporated into viral RNA by the RdRp, resulting in chain termination of both viral transcripts and <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized viral genomes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. Given this considerably limited arsenal of direct-acting antivirals for COVID-19, it remains a strategic priority to develop novel compounds with minimal side effects and that are directed against alternate viral targets.</p>
<p id="P4">One such alternate SARS-CoV-2 target is its main protease, 3CL<sup>pro</sup> (M<sup>pro</sup>), which plays an essential role in the viral life cycle: Upon entry and uncoating of the viral particles, the positive-stranded RNA genome is rapidly translated into two polyproteins which are subsequently processed into functional proteins by PL2<sup>pro</sup> and 3CL<sup>pro</sup> viral proteases<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. 3CL<sup>pro</sup> is the main protease and is responsible for releasing 11 of the 13 individual proteins, including the polymerase subunits, enabling their proper folding and assembly into the active polymerase complex<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. Thus, blocking 3CL<sup>pro</sup> activity effectively shuts down the life cycle before viral transcription or replication occur, making it an enticing target for intervention<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. In addition, 3CL<sup>pro</sup> has a unique substrate preference (Leu-Gln ↓ {Ser, Ala, Gly}), a preference not shared by any known human protease, implying the potential for high selectivity and low side effects of 3CL<sup>pro</sup>-targeting drugs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. Although there have been intense efforts to develop 3CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors specific for SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>, only one inhibitor has been brought to the clinic, PF-07304814, which is the first anti-3CL<sup>pro</sup> compound in clinical trials.</p>
<p id="P5">PF-07304814 is a ketone-based covalent cysteine protease inhibitor<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. It is administered as a phosphate prodrug, which is then metabolized to its active form, PF-00835231<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. PF-00835231 was initially designed in response to a previous coronavirus epidemic in 2003, as an inhibitor for the 3CL<sup>pro</sup> of SARS-CoV<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. However, with SARS-CoV disease declining, clinical studies were not practical and, consequently, PF-00835231 was never tested in patients. Because 3CL<sup>pro</sup> of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are 96% identical at the amino acid level, including 100% identity within the catalytic pocket<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>, it seemed reasonable to assume that PF-00835231 may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 as well.</p>
<p id="P6">Indeed, a recent study demonstrated antiviral activity of PF-00835231 against SARS-CoV-2, albeit at high micromolar levels<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. The study was performed in Vero E6 cells, a monkey kidney cell line in which SARS-CoV-2 replicates to high titers, but which is known to express high levels of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (also known as Multi-Drug Resistance Protein 1, MDR1, and encoded by gene ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily B Member 1, <italic>ABCB1</italic>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Inhibiting MDR1 function significantly increased antiviral efficacy in Vero E6 cells, suggesting that PF-00835231 is an MDR1 substrate<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. MDR1 is well-studied in the context of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors such as lopinavir or ritonavir, where it reduces intracellular protease inhibitor levels and contributes to drug resistance in T-cells and monocytes<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. In contrast to HIV-1, where viral replication is essentially limited to T-cells and monocytes, SARS-CoV-2 infects multiple organs and cell types throughout the human body, with the first and major site of replication being cells of the respiratory tract<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. Thus, to investigate the potential role of MDR1 on antiviral potency of PF-00835231 against SARS-CoV-2, it is imperative to utilize experimental model systems representing the human airways.</p>
<p id="P7">Here, we characterize the antiviral potency and cytotoxicity profile of PF-00835231 in two human airway models: a human type II alveolar epithelial cell line, and polarized human airway epithelial cultures. In side-by-side experiments, we place PF-00835231's antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in context of another, pre-clinical 3CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor, GC-376, and of the current standard-of-care, remdesivir. Finally, we address the impact of P-glycoprotein (MDR1) on PF-00835231's antiviral efficacy in the human airways.</p>

<title>Establishing A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells as a tool to determine SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytopathic effect by high-content microscopy</title>
<p id="P8">The human adenocarcinoma alveolar epithelial cell line A549 is a workhorse cell line in the study of respiratory viruses. However, A549 cells are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as they do not highly express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. To make A549 cells amenable for experiments with SARS-CoV-2, we generated a stable A549 cell line expressing ACE2 exogenously. We confirmed elevated levels of ACE2 mRNA in A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells by RT-qPCR, and of ACE2 protein by Western blot, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">To determine permissiveness, we infected A549 or A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells with a serial dilution of SARS-CoV-2, in a 96-well format, for 24 h. Using immunofluorescence staining for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N) and high-content microscopy, we found A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas parent A549 cells were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-2, limited evolution has been observed, which has been attributed to the proof-reading mechanism of coronavirus polymerases<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. The two major lineages of SARS-CoV-2 circulating globally as of time of writing are represented by the Wuhan basal clade and the spike protein D614G clade, also referred to as clades A and B, respectively<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. Compared to clade A, clade B isolates carry a mutation in the spike-encoding gene S, which results in amino acid substitution D614G. D614G is frequently accompanied by an additional mutation in ORF 1b, which encodes the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase complex (RdRp), resulting in substitution P323L in the polymerase subunit NSP12<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. Clade B viruses are more prevalent globally, which might be due to their increased efficiency infecting cells in the upper respiratory tract and subsequently increased transmissibility, enabled by the Spike D614G mutation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P11">To characterize viral growth of representatives from the two major clades in our model, we challenged A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells with the clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020, a clade A representative<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>, or with USA/NYU-VC-003/2020, a clade B representative, the latter of which we had isolated in March 2020<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. USA/NYU-VC-003/2020 carries both of the signature clade B amino acid changes, S D614G and NSP12 P323L, but its 3CL<sup>pro</sup> sequence is identical to that of USA-WA1/2020. In low MOI growth kinetics on A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells, we found that growth of clade B USA/NYU-VC-003/2020 exceeds that of clade A USA-WA1/2020, especially at later times of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). We were able to detect <italic>de novo</italic> produced infectious particles as soon as 12 hours post infection (hpi) for USA-WA1/2020, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle in A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells is completed by that time. In terms of producing infectious titers, USA/NYU-VC-003/2020 initially lagged behind USA-WA1/2020, but then yielded significantly higher titers at 48 and 72 hpi.</p>
<p id="P12">Finally, we observed that the cytopathic effect (CPE) caused by SARS-CoV-2 on A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells manifests in syncytia formation, in which the nuclei form a ring-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). This effect had previously been described for other coronaviruses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>, although the exact mechanism for the ring-like nuclear structure formation remains to be elucidated. Altogether, our data establish A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells as a tractable tool to study SARS-CoV-2 infection, spread, and cytopathic effect.</p>

<title>PF-00835231 potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells</title>
<p id="P13">PF-00835231 is the active compound of the first anti 3CL<sup>pro</sup> regimen currently tested in clinical trials<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. We studied and compared three compounds in regards to SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity and cytotoxicity: i. PF-00835231, ii. the pre-clinical 3CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor GC-376, which is licensed for veterinary use in Feline Coronavirus infections<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup> and recently shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>, and iii. the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, which is currently the only direct-acting antiviral approved in the US to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections, and is thus standard-of-care. We exposed A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells with escalating doses of the three respective drugs, challenged them with SARS-CoV-2, and measured virus antigen (N)-expressing cells by high-content microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In parallel, we determined cellular viability by measuring ATP levels in drug-treated, but uninfected cells. Antiviral assays were performed with both our clade A and clade B SARS-CoV-2 representatives.</p>
<p id="P14">In a first set of experiments, we compared antiviral efficacy between PF-00835231 and remdesivir side-by-side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tab. 1</xref>). PF-00835231 inhibited the clade A representative SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 with an average 50% effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 0.221 μM at 24 h, and 0.158 μM at 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tab. 1</xref>). As such, PF-00835231 was statistically more potent than remdesivir with an EC<sub>50</sub> 0.442 μM at 24 h, and 0.238 μM at 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tab. 1</xref>). None of the compounds showed detectable cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tab. 1</xref>). We then compared antiviral efficacy of PF-00835231 and remdesivir for clade B USA/NYU-VC-003/2020. Due to cytopathic effects driven by USA/NYU-VC-003/2020 at the 48 h timepoint, we only determined antiviral efficacy at 24 h. PF-00835231 was inhibitory with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.184 μM, and was thus again statistically more potent than remdesivir with EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.283 μM.</p>
<p id="P15">Interestingly, only the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir exhibited statistically significantly weaker antiviral activity against the clade A isolate compared to the clade B isolate, with EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.442 μM (vs clade A) and EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.238 μM (vs clade B; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tab. 1</xref>). This might be an impact of the polymerase subunit NSP12 P323L mutation present in the clade B representative. Next, we analyzed microscopy data for drug-mediated inhibition of the CPE, including ring-shaped syncytia formation. PF-00835231 and remdesivir both decreased the overall number of infected foci, and fully protected A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells from ring syncytia formation, at 0.33 μM and above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref> and not shown).</p>
<p id="P16">In a second set of experiments, we compared antiviral efficacy between PF-00835231 and GC-376 side-by-side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-d</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tab. 2</xref>). PF-00835231 inhibited the clade A representative SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.422 μM at 24 h, and 0.344 μM at 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tab. 1</xref>). This slight shift in EC<sub>50</sub> values as compared to those in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> can be explained by intra-assay variation, which is higher for live cell assays as it is for binding assays. For this reason we could not compare PF-00835231 across assays. In the direct comparison, PF-00835231 trended towards being more potent than GC-376, which exhibited an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.632 μM at 24 h, and 0.696 μM at 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tab. 2</xref>). For clade B USA/NYU-VC-003/2020, PF-00835231 was inhibitory with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.326 μM, and thus again trended towards being more potent than GC-376 with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.529 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tab. 2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">Both protease inhibitors PF-00835231 and GC-376 had similar antiviral activities between the two clades in this assay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tab. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tab. 2</xref>). This is in line with the fact that 3CL<sup>pro</sup> is identical in these two viruses. Finally, GC-376 decreased the number and size of viral foci, but was unable to protect cells from virus-induced CPE at 1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). In contrast, at 1 μM and above, PF-00835231 fully protected A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells from CPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref> and not shown).</p>
<p id="P18">Collectively, we show that, in this assay, PF-00835231 inhibits isolates from both major SARS-CoV-2 lineages at similar or better effective concentrations than remdesivir and the pre-clinical 3CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor GC-376.</p>

<title>Timing of PF-00835231 antiviral action against USA-WA1/2020 in A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells is consistent with PF-00835231's role as a 3CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor</title>
<p id="P19">PF-00835231 and remdesivir target different SARS-CoV-2 proteins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>. PF-00835231 targets 3CL<sup>pro</sup>, blocking polyprotein processing and thus formation of the viral polymerase complex<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. Remdesivir acts on the subsequent step, which is the incorporation of nucleotides into nascent viral RNA transcripts and genomes by the viral polymerase complex<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P20">To determine whether the action of PF-00835231 is consistent with its established role as a 3CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor, and to delineate the timing of early SARS-CoV-2 life cycle stages in A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells, we performed time-of-drug-addition experiments<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. This approach determines how long the addition of a drug can be delayed before it loses antiviral activity. Using one-hour-increments (from 1 h prior to 4 h post infection), we varied the time-of-drug-addition for a monoclonal neutralizing antibody (viral attachment inhibition control), GC-376 (3CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibition control), PF-00835231, and remdesivir (RdRp inhibition control). We measured the percentage of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells via high-content microscopy at 12 hpi, which corresponds to one replication cycle in A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells, as determined previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). We synchronized infection using a preincubation step at 4°C, followed by a transition to 37° C at 1 h post-addition of virus, and used the minimum treatment doses for each drug that led to undetectable infection levels – 3 μM for PF-00835231 and the neutralizing antibody, and 10 μM for remdesivir and GC-376.</p>
<p id="P21">The neutralizing antibody lost its antiviral function first, starting at the first addition point post-infection (1 h), confirming blockage of attachment and entry as the mode of antiviral action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Interestingly, all three drugs, GC-376, PF-00835231, and remdesivir lost antiviral action at the same time of addition, starting at 2 hpi, and with subsequently enhanced loss of activity at 3 and 4 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). This suggests that polyprotein processing and the start of viral transcription / translation follow each other very closely in time. These time-of-drug-addition experiments confirm the timing of PF-00835231's antiviral action during the early stages of intracellular virus propagation, consistent with its role as a 3CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor. Furthermore, these experiments delineate the timing of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle events in the tissue culture model of A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) and demonstrate that polymerase and protease inhibitors such as PF-00835231 can effectively block SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells when administered within a few hours after infection.</p>

<title>PF-00835231 is well-tolerated in polarized human airway epithelial cultures (HAEC)</title>
<p id="P22">The human respiratory tract is a major entry portal for viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and the first battle between host and virus occurs in cells of the respiratory epithelium. This specialized tissue contains three major cell types (basal, secretory, and ciliated) which are organized in a characteristic polarized architecture<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>. As shown, human adenocarcinoma alveolar epithelial A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and allow for high-throughput experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). However, they do not recapitulate the complexity and architecture of the human airway epithelium.</p>
<p id="P23">To test PF-00835231 and remdesivir in an additional, more physiologically relevant, yet lower-throughput human model system, we generated polarized human airway epithelial cultures (HAEC). HAEC contain multiple cell types of the airway epithelium and recapitulate its typical architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a-d</xref>), which makes HAEC arguably one of the most physiologically relevant models for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of human respiratory pathogens. HAEC are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infections and were utilized to obtain the very first SARS-CoV-2 isolate in December 2019<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P24">First, we performed in-depth analyses of the cellular heterogeneity of our HAEC model system by single-cell RNA-sequencing (sc-RNAseq; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>). Gene-expression profiling enabled resolution of distinct clusters with cell types assigned based on previously published transcriptional signatures<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>. We identified 7 different clusters as cycling basal, basal, suprabasal, secretory, ciliated, and microfold cells, as well as cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The EMT process in HAEC has previously been associated with loss of polarized organization as a consequence of remodeling<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup> and is likely to occur at a low level at steady-state in HAEC. Recapitulation of the major cell types and physiological conditions of the lung epithelium provided molecular confirmation for the HAEC system in assessing SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P25">To establish the use of PF-00835231 in HAEC, we determined its cytotoxicity profile and compared it to that of remdesivir. We added PF-00835231 or remdesivir to the basolateral chamber of HAEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), and determined tissue morphology by histology and integrity of the epithelial layer by measuring trans-epithelial resistance (TEER; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c-e</xref>). Neither drug caused measurable adverse effects on the morphology of the cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c,d</xref>). However, while remdesivir negatively impacted TEER over time, albeit not statistically significantly compared to untreated cultures, we did not observe this trend for PF-00835231 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P26">To complement our assessment of how well human epithelium tolerates these inhibitors, we took advantage of an alternative cytotoxicity assay on BCi-NS1.1 cells, the basal-like undifferentiated precursor cell monolayers used for generation of HAEC. We treated these monolayers with a dose range of PF-00835231 or remdesivir for 48 hours, and quantified ATP as a measure of cell viability, similar to previous experiments with A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells. We did not detect a decrease in ATP upon PF-00835231 treatment, even at the highest amount of drug (10 μM) tested. In contrast, 10 μM of remdesivir caused a reduction in ATP levels compared to carrier control, albeit not statistically significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). These experiments demonstrate that both drugs are well-tolerated in our model of polarized human airway epithelium.</p>

<title>PF-00835231 exhibits potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in HAEC</title>
<p id="P27">To determine PF-00835231's anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in HAEC, we added either 0.025, 0.5 or 10 μM PF-00835231 or remdesivir, or DMSO carrier control, to the basolateral chamber of HAEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a-c</xref>). We then challenged HAEC apically with SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020, and determined viral infectious titers from apical washes collected at 12-hour increments.</p>
<p id="P28">We first detected progeny viral particles in apical washes from DMSO-treated cultures at 12 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a, b</xref>), indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle in HAEC cells is completed by that time. Both PF-00835231 and remdesivir potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 titers in a dose-dependent manner, with the 10 μM doses resulting in viral titers below the limit of detection at most time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a, b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P29">To visualize SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAEC during drug treatment, we fixed infected HAEC at the 72 h endpoint and stained them for SARS-CoV-2-N-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). In carrier control cultures, we observed robust infection. Upon treatment with 10 μM PF-00835231 or remdesivir, we found in both cases the number of infected cells significantly reduced. Taken together, both remdesivir and PF-00835231 potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in our model of polarized human airway epithelium.</p>

<title>Inhibiting the multi-drug transporter MDR1 does not increase efficacy of PF-00835231 in human airway epithelial cells</title>
<p id="P30">Previously, a hurdle in accurately determining PF-00835231's <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy was the action of the multi-drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (also known as MDR1 or <italic>ABCB1</italic>). However, these earlier studies were performed in the monkey kidney cell line Vero E6<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. MDR1 was found to efficiently export PF-00835231, thereby reducing intracellular PF-00835231 levels, and likely underestimating PF-00835231's potency. In those studies, chemical inhibition of MDR1 in Vero E6 cells significantly increased PF-00835231's antiviral efficacy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P31">Given the previously reported species differences in P-glycoprotein-mediated drug transport activity of MDR1 and the variability in expression levels of the <italic>ABCB1</italic> gene that encodes this drug transporter among cell types and tissues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup>, we sought to determine a potential role of MDR1 in our human <italic>in vitro</italic> airway models. We measured PF-00835231 anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity while chemically blocking MDR1 function, using the drug CP-100356 in the A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cell line and in HAEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). We observed no changes in antiviral efficacy when blocking MDR1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b-d</xref>), suggesting that, in contrast to Vero E6 cells, this transporter does not play a role in our human airway model systems.</p>
<p id="P32">Indeed, scRNA-seq analysis of HAECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>) did not reveal any detectable MDR1 (<italic>ABCB1</italic>) transcripts, suggesting levels of this transporter in HAEC are low.</p>
<p id="P33">A limitation of the previous experiments is that A549 cells originate from one patient, and HAEC were differentiated from precursor cells obtained from a single donor<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup>. As a result, we cannot exclude that human genetic variation might influence MDR1 function or expression. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the <italic>ABCB1</italic> promoter or within the open reading frame are well-described in the literature<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Furthermore, an inherent limitation of sc-RNAseq is that only abundant transcripts are detected, and given limited cellular heterogeneity of HAEC, it is possible that <italic>ABCB1</italic> transcripts remained undetected due to the limited depth of sequencing at single cell level.</p>
<p id="P34">To address these issues, we investigated transcript levels of <italic>ABCB1</italic> in bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) of healthy individuals and of COVID-19 patients with mild or severe symptoms from a previously published dataset<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup>. BAL contained multiple cell types, including airway epithelial cells, but also immune cells, such as macrophages, T-cells, plasma cells, and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e</xref>). In healthy individuals, we detected MDR1 (<italic>ABCB1</italic>) in 1.77 % of CD8+/NK cells, 0.59% of proliferating T-cells, and 0.06% of alveolar macrophages, but not in other cell types. Notably, we did not observe any <italic>ABCB1</italic> transcript in airway epithelial cells, which are thought to be the major site of SARS-CoV-2 replication<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
</sup>. Compared to BAL from healthy individuals, BAL from COVID-19 patients with mild or severe symptoms showed an increased number of cells with detectable levels of MDR1 (<italic>ABCB1</italic>) transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7f</xref>). Interestingly, rather than an overall increase in <italic>ABCB1</italic> gene expression, this upregulation was limited to a small subset of individual cells, with the majority of cells remaining <italic>ABCB1</italic>-negative. This phenomenon was observed in alveolar macrophages (0.25%/0.28% positive in mild/severe COVID-19 patients), SPP1+ macrophages (0.23%/0.23%), M1-like macrophages (2.60%/0.43%), CD8+/NK cells (7.75%/4.18%), proliferating T-cells (2.00%/3.60%), plasma cells (cells not detected/0.74%), neutrophils (0%/0.05%) and in epithelial cells (0.29%/0.18%). Our findings suggest that although MDR1 (<italic>ABCB1</italic>) is upregulated in some cells during inflammatory processes such as observed in COVID-19, its expression remains cell type-specific, and only a small fraction of airway epithelial cells, the main replication sites for SARS-CoV-2, exhibit detectable levels of this efflux transporter.</p>
<p id="P35">Thus, we conclude that MDR1 is unlikely to significantly impact PF-00835231 efficacy during SARS-CoV-2 infection of the respiratory epithelium. In addition, our findings highlight the importance of using appropriate <italic>in vitro</italic> models for the evaluation of antiviral drugs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P36">The current public health emergency caused by COVID-19 has illustrated our dire need for vaccines and therapeutics to combat SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex is the target of the majority of small molecule inhibitors in multiple stages of development, including remdesivir<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
</sup>, favipiravir<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>, and ß-d-N4-hydroxycytidine<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup>. At the time of writing, remdesivir is the only antiviral drug authorized for the treatment of COVID-19. In contrast to the abovementioned compounds, PF-00835231 blocks the SARS-CoV-2 3CL<sup>pro</sup> protease<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. PF-00835231 is the active component of PF-07304814, a first-in-class SARS-CoV-2 3CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor currently in clinical trials. Here, we report the potent antiviral activity of PF-00835231 against SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial cells and a model of polarized human airway epithelial cultures (HAEC). In our A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cell assay, we show that PF-00835231 has at least similar or better potency than the pre-clinical 3CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor GC-376, or remdesivir. In HAEC, we find both remdesivir and PF-00835231 similarly potent.</p>
<p id="P37">The lack of inhibitors specific to SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic prompted off-label testing of protease inhibitors approved for other viruses, albeit with limited success<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
</sup>. This failure highlighted the need for novel compounds of greater specificity. A number of 3CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors have since been identified and characterized in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, including the cancer drug carmofur (1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>, an alpha-ketoamide inhibitor named 13b<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>, and a dipeptide-based inhibitor named GC-376<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>. GC-376, licensed for veterinary use<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>, was recently shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells at an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.9 μM<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. A different study showed PF-00835231 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.27 μM in Vero E6 cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. As such a comparison of historical data is problematic, we directly compared the antiviral efficacy of PF-00835231 and GC-376 side-by-side in the same assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). We find that PF-00835231 is more potent that GC-376 in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 and protecting cells from CPE. This result illustrates the <italic>in vitro</italic> potency of PF-00835231 compared to other, preclinical, 3CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors, such as GC-376.</p>
<p id="P38">In coronaviruses, the genetic barrier to standard-of-care remdesivir or the pre-clinical drug ß-d-N4-hydroxycytidine is high, as mutations conferring resistance significantly reduce viral fitness, and cross-resistance between remdesivir or ß-d-N4-hydroxycytidine has not been documented<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup>. A high resistance barrier to 3CL<sup>pro</sup>-targeting drugs due to a high fitness cost has also been demonstrated for the beta-coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>
</sup>. Although the likelihood of selecting for resistant variants seems thus low, the existence of drugs with alternate targets may have important advantages. First, as seen in other acute and chronic viral infections, blocking multiple targets in combination therapy further decreases the likelihood for selection of viral resistance mutants<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup>. Second, combination therapy with a cocktail of multiple drugs tackling different steps of the viral life cycle may have synergistic effects on controlling viral replication. Indeed, a recent <italic>in vitro</italic> study demonstrated significant synergistic effects between PF-00835231 and remdesivir in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. Third, upon failure of monotherapy, it is preferable to switch to an antiviral with a different target to circumvent cross-resistance caused by mutations in the same target<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
</sup>. For these reasons, the development of a diverse toolbox of antiviral drugs with different targets will be important to improve antiviral therapy in COVID-19.</p>
<p id="P39">The optimal window of opportunity for starting a successful antiviral drug regimen during acute viral infections, such as influenza, is the first few days post-symptom onset, while viral replication is actively ongoing<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>. For most COVID-19 patients, this window is likely limited to the first week of symptoms<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>
</sup>. Such early treatment with remdesivir is impeded by its need for intravenous (IV) administration, requiring a healthcare facility setting, though it still demonstrated benefit for 68% of patients with more advanced infection in randomized clinical studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>
</sup>. PF-07304814, with its active component PF-00835231 evaluated in this study, is also an IV treatment<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. However, the time of active SARS-CoV-2 replication might be prolonged in the most severe patients, as suggested by the aforementioned clinical data of remdesivir<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>
</sup>. This suggests the usefulness of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral regimens even at later times of infection, which further supports the investigation of PF-00835231 for the treatment of COVID-19.</p>
<p id="P40">P-glycoprotein (also known as MDR1, and encoded by gene <italic>ABCB1</italic>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>, is a membrane-associated ATP-dependent efflux pump capable of removing cytostatic drugs from target cells. The endogenous function of this transporter remains to be fully elucidated, but it is expressed across several immune cell types and other metabolically active cells. P-glycoprotein appears to be critical for maintenance and effector function of a range of cytotoxic immune cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>
</sup>. Two recent studies suggested that PF-00835231 is a substrate for P-glycoprotein. This might pose a concern regarding the bioavailability of PF-00835231 in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. We addressed this concern in two ways: functionally, by using chemical inhibition of MDR1 in human airway models, and transcriptionally, by determining the expression of <italic>ABCB1</italic> in HAEC or in cells obtained from BAL of healthy or COVID-19 patients. Our combined results demonstrate that MDR1 function does not impact PF-00835231 efficacy in our model systems, and is expressed at very low levels in airway epithelial cells, which are the major sites of SARS-CoV-2 replication<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
</sup>. By mining scRNA-seq data from BAL of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls (n=12) for <italic>ABCB1</italic> expression, we considered the genetic variability on the <italic>ABCB1</italic> locus beyond that present in our two model systems. Indeed, a number of SNPs have been shown to alter expression of <italic>ABCB1</italic> transcripts, either by changing transcription factor or micro-RNA binding sites upstream of the <italic>ABCB1</italic> open reading frame, or by enhancing mRNA transcription due to silent mutations within the <italic>ABCB1</italic> open reading frame<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Other, missense, mutations within the <italic>ABCB1</italic> open reading frame have been shown to alter the functionality of MDR1, i.e. by altering membrane localization or recycling of the protein, or by modifying substrate recognition sites<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>
</sup>. Although we do not have information on the <italic>ABCB1</italic> genotype of our mined patient samples, the detected low expression of <italic>ABCB1</italic> transcripts in the cells permissive for SARS-CoV-2, together with the functional data from our model system, instills confidence that PF-00835231 efficacy is not hampered by the action of MDR1.</p>
<p id="P41">Spillovers of zoonotic coronaviruses with high pathogenic potential into the human population are not isolated events, as repeatedly illustrated by the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and now SARS-CoV-2 in 2019<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>
</sup>. To prepare for future pandemics, the development of pan-coronavirus compounds is of strategic importance. This involves choosing viral targets that are highly conserved within the coronavirus family, such as the 3CL<sup>pro</sup> protease<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. Indeed, a recent study performing in vitro protease activity assays with PF-00835231 revealed potent inhibition across a panel of diverse coronavirus 3CL<sup>pro</sup>, including those of alpha-coronaviruses (NL63-CoV, PEDV, FIPV), beta-coronaviruses (HKU4-CoV, HKU5-CoV, HKU9-CoV, MHV-CoV, OC43-CoV, HKU1-CoV), and a gamma-coronavirus (IBV-CoV)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. Our study revealed that the two 3CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors tested (PF-00835231 and GC-376) were similarly potent for different clades of SARS-CoV-2 in which 3CL<sup>pro</sup> is 100 % conserved. Of note, 3CL<sup>pro</sup> is also 100 % conserved in the SARS-CoV-2 “UK variant”B.1.1.7 and the “Brazil variant” B.1.1.28, whereas the “South African variant” B.1.352 carries amino acid substitution K90R<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>
</sup>. However, the K90 residue is distant from the active center of the protease, and is not expected to influence 3CL<sup>pro</sup> substrate specificity. These findings support the notion that PF-00835231 is an inhibitor with broad coronavirus activity, which may be of use for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and for other emerging coronaviruses beyond SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="P42">Together, our data from two human in vitro model systems for SARS-CoV-2 show efficient PF-00835231 antiviral activity and mitigate concerns arising from non-human models such as Vero E6 cells regarding PF-00835231 counteraction by the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein. Our results therefore inform and reinforce the ongoing clinical studies of pro-drug PF-07304814 and its active form PF-00835231 as a potential new treatment for COVID-19.</p>

<p id="P43">The primary goal of this study was to compare the <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy and cytotoxicity of PF-00835231 and remdesivir in two human model systems for SARS-CoV-2 infection, A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells and polarized human airway epithelial cultures. Compound characterization at NYU was done in a blinded manner. If not stated otherwise, all assays were performed in n=3 biological replicates. First, we performed in-depth characterization of A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells for the study of SARS-CoV-2, using RT-qPCR, western blotting, flow cytometry, microscopy, and high-content imaging. Second, we evaluated the <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy and cytotoxicity of PF-00835231, of a second, pre-clinical, protease inhibitor, GC-376, and of remdesivir in A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells. We performed antiviral assays with SARS-CoV-2 from the two major clades during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, we performed time-of-drug-addition assays in A549<sup>+ACE2</sup> cells to delineate the time of antiviral action for PF-00835231, remdesivir and GC-376 within the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Fourth, we assessed the <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy and cytotoxicity of PF-00835231 and remdesivir in the physiologically relevant model of polarized human airway epithelial cultures. Finally, we determined the role of efflux transporter MDR1 on the antiviral efficacy of PF-00835231.

The USA-WA1/2020 stock, obtained at passage 4, was passaged once in Vero E6 cells to generate a passage 5 working stock (1.7E + 06 PFU/mL) for our studies on A549<sup>+ACE2</sup>. For studies on human airway epithelial cultures, passage 5 USA-WA1/2020 was amplified once more in Vero E6 cells and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit with a cut off of 100 kDa, resulting in a passage 6 working stock of 1.08E + 07 PFU/mL. SARS-CoV-2 USA/NYU-VC-003/2020 was isolated from patient nasal swab material in March 2020 (GenBank accession no. MT703677). We inoculated Vero E6 cells with a 1:2 dilution series of the nasal swab material in infection media (DMEM 2% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep, 1% NEAA, 10mM HEPES) to obtain passage 0 (P0) stock. P0 was passaged twice in Vero E6 to generate a passage 2 working stock (1.1E + 07 PFU/mL) for drug efficacy studies on A549<sup>+ACE2</sup>. For viral growth kinetics, pooled media from P0 stock was used to plaque purify a single virus clone on Vero E6 cells in presence of 1μg/ml TPCK-Trypsin, to avoid virus adaptation to Vero E6 cells due to the lack of TMPRSS2 expression<sup>

<title>Importance</title>
</caption>
<p>The arsenal of SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral drugs is extremely limited. Only one direct-acting antiviral drug is currently approved, the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, and it has limited efficacy. Thus, there is a substantial need to develop additional antiviral compounds with minimal side effects and alternate viral targets. One such alternate target is its main protease, 3CL<sup>pro</sup> (M<sup>pro</sup>), an essential component of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle processing the viral polyprotein into the components of the viral polymerase complex. In this study, we characterize a novel antiviral drug, PF-00835231, which is the active component of the first-in-class 3CL<sup>pro</sup>-targeting regimen in clinical trials. Using 3D <italic>in vitro</italic> models of the human airway epithelium, we demonstrate the antiviral potential of PF-00835231 for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
