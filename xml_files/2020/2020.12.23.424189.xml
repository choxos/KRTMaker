<abstract>
<p id="P2">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a new human pathogen in late 2019 and has infected an estimated 10% of the global population in less than a year. There is a clear need for effective antiviral drugs to complement current preventive measures including vaccines. In this study, we demonstrate that berberine and obatoclax, two broad-spectrum antiviral compounds, are effective against multiple isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Berberine, a plant-derived alkaloid, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations and obatoclax, originally developed as an anti-apoptotic protein antagonist, was effective at sub-micromolar concentrations. Time-of-addition studies indicated that berberine acts on the late stage of the viral life cycle. In agreement, berberine mildly affected viral RNA synthesis, but strongly reduced infectious viral titers, leading to an increase in the particle-to-pfu ratio. In contrast, obatoclax acted at the early stage of the infection, in line with its activity to neutralize the acidic environment in endosomes. We assessed infection of primary human nasal epithelial cells cultured on an air-liquid interface and found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced and repressed expression of a specific set of cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, both obatoclax and berberine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in these primary target cells. We propose berberine and obatoclax as potential antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that could be considered for further efficacy testing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">Coronaviruses form a group of respiratory viruses in the order <italic>Nidovirales</italic> that possess a positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 30 kb (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Two coronaviruses of zoonotic origin caused significant outbreaks in the near past, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In late 2019, a new coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV emerged in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread across the globe. As of today, more than 60 million SARS-CoV-2 cases have been confirmed worldwide, but recent estimates from the World Health Organization suggest that that the total number may be more than 20 times higher due to asymptomatic and undetected cases (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) (WHO Coronavirus Disease Dashboard, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covid19.who.int/">https://covid19.who.int/</ext-link>).</p>
<p id="P4">SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelial cells in the nasal and oral cavities via binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the ACE2 receptor (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The spike glycoprotein requires cleavage by the protease TMPRSS2 to convert it into an active form allowing fusion at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). An additional furin cleavage site in the spike protein makes it also amenable to cleavage by intracellular proteases (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In permissive cells lacking TMPRSS2, receptor binding is most likely followed by dynamin and clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the virus particle into endosomal compartments (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Acidification of these compartments leads to activation of cathepsin-B/L proteases which prime the spike protein, initiating membrane fusion and release of the encapsidated viral RNA into the cytoplasm (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Upon nucleocapsid disassembly, the viral positive-sense RNA genome is translated into two open reading frames that encode for several non-structural proteins [reviewed in (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)]. These proteins constitute the machinery that replicates the viral RNA and transcribes subgenomic RNAs that code for viral structural proteins and several accessory proteins (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Newly formed viral genomic RNA is coated with nucleocapsid proteins, which interact with the structural proteins, resulting in budding into and transit through the ER-Golgi network and release of mature viral particles through exocytosis (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The virus then spreads to the lower respiratory tract and infects alveolar type-II pneumocytes in the lungs, where a severe infection could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">A year into the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an unprecedented fast development of vaccines (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), as well as study of antiviral of adjunctive host-directed therapy. Apart from dexamethasone (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), however, none has been proved effective. As preventive measures including vaccines are unlikely to curb the epidemic alone, there is a clear need for improved antiviral therapy. This could be applied either preventively, or after symptom development.</p>
<p id="P6">In this study, we assessed the plant-based alkaloid berberine and obatoclax, an anticancer drug proven safe in clinical trials, as possible antiviral candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Both berberine (BBR) (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and obatoclax (OLX) (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) have broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a range of different viruses including herpes simplex virus, influenza A virus, chikungunya virus and Zika virus. We show that these compounds are effective against two different isolates of SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations with promising selectivity indices. Antiviral activity was observed in Vero E6 cells as well as in physiologically relevant nasal epithelial cells cultured on an air-liquid interface. We propose these compounds for further assessment as antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<title>Berberine and obatoclax inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication</title>
<p id="P7">BBR and OLX have shown antiviral activity against viruses from multiple families (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). We therefore tested these compounds against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells. A virus growth curve was performed to determine the optimal time point for the assay. At a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01, SARS-CoV-2 titers peaked at 24 hours post-infection (hpi) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Robust infection of Vero E6 cells was confirmed through staining infected cells for the presence of dsRNA replication intermediates and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. dsRNA staining was observed in the perinuclear area, likely corresponding to the ER-Golgi network containing SARS-CoV-2 replication complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Spike protein expression was also detected in the perinuclear area where they are synthesized, but also on the outer periphery of the cells, probably from viruses exiting the infected cells.</p>
<p id="P8">Next, a dose response assay was carried out under these conditions with a series of concentrations of BBR and OLX, using 0.1% DMSO as a negative control. Plaque assay titrations of the viral supernatants showed that both BBR and OLX are effective against SARS-CoV-2 with 50% effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) values at low micromolar and nanomolar concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub> <sub>BBR</sub> = 9.1 μM and EC<sub>50</sub> <sub>OLX</sub> = 67 nM, respectively; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Cytotoxicity of these compounds was tested under the same conditions, but in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. BBR was toxic only at the highest concentrations tested (50% cellular cytotoxicity, CC50 &gt; 150 μM), resulting in a selectivity index of &gt;16 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), whereas the CC50 value for OLX was 7.8 μM (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), corresponding to a high selectivity index of 116 due to its low EC<sub>50</sub> value. Overall, these results indicate that BBR and OLX show potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with good selectivity indices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Berberine and obatoclax are effective against a SARS-CoV-2 isolate from a different geographic region</title>
<p id="P9">Our initial antiviral assays were performed using a SARS-CoV-2 isolate from Bavaria, Germany (BavPat1). To assess whether BBR and OLX are also effective against another SARS-CoV-2 isolate, we isolated a SARS-CoV-2 isolate from a hospitalized COVID-19 patient at Radboud University Medical Center, the Netherlands. This isolate, SARS-CoV-2/human/Nijmegen/1/2020 (hereafter called Nijmegen1), had a relatively small plaque phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>), in agreement with the relatively passage history in Vero cells (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). We used the Nijmegen1 isolate to perform dose response assays with BBR and OLX, using viral RNA in the cell culture supernatants as a readout (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). OLX showed stronger antiviral activity for the Nijmegen1 isolate (EC<sub>50</sub> = &lt; 0.04 μM) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) as compared to the BavPat1 isolate. In contrast, BBR showed relatively weak antiviral activity against the Nijmegen1 isolate (EC<sub>50</sub> = 23.2 μM for viral RNA in the supernatant and EC<sub>50</sub> = 43.3 μM for intracellular viral RNA; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) as compared to the initial experiments in which infectious titers were used as a readout. We therefore used conventional plaque assay to assess the antiviral activity of BBR against the SARS-CoV-2 Nijmegen1 isolate. We observed strong antiviral activity (EC<sub>50</sub> = 2.1 μM) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), which was slightly lower than for the BavPat1 isolate.</p>
<p id="P10">These results suggest that BBR does not inhibit viral RNA replication per se, but that it affects the production of infectious virus. To quantify this, we calculated the relative genome copy to infectious virus particle ratio for the different concentrations of berberine. Indeed, when compared to the DMSO control, this ratio increased upon BBR treatment in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Altogether these results confirmed that both BBR and OLX are effective against a second, early passage isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we conclude that BBR does not affect viral RNA replication or secretion of viral particles, but that it strongly affects the infectivity of the virus particles produced.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Berberine and obatoclax act at different stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle</title>
<p id="P11">To decipher a putative mode of action for BBR and OLX, we performed a time-of-addition assay. Vero E6 cells were infected at MOI of 1, adding 20 μM BBR or 0.25 μM OLX at different time points during the course of the experiment (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Cell culture supernatants were harvested at 10 hpi and infectious viral titers were measured by plaque assay. OLX showed a very potent inhibition of 3 logs at the early stages of the viral life cycle. The levels of inhibition gradually decrease as OLX is added at later time points of the experiment (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), suggesting that OLX most likely affects the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle. Indeed, when OLX was added during the 1 h of virus adsorption and subsequently discontinued, it reduced viral titers by 1.5 logs, indicating that the compound inhibits viral entry.</p>
<p id="P12">For BBR, an inhibition of almost 1.5 logs was seen when the compound was added to the cells 2 h prior to inoculation and maintained throughout the experiment. However, no inhibition was observed when BBR is only added during the 1 h of virus adsorption. Potent inhibition of 1 log was observed when BBR was added during inoculation and continuously maintained thereafter. Strikingly, BBR continues to be equally effective at reducing viral titers even when added at 7.5 hpi, indicating that it acts late in the viral infection cycle (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), in line with our conclusion that BBR affects the production of infectious virus particles (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary nasal epithelial cells</title>
<p id="P13">Even though SARS-CoV-2 efficiently replicates in Vero E6 cells, these cells are derived from the African green monkey kidney and have a defective interferon pathway (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and are thus not representative of natural target cells. It is therefore essential to validate candidate antiviral compounds in human host cells (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). We therefore cultured and differentiated human nasal epithelial cells, which were residual after surgery, on an air-liquid interface. This approach to mimic the natural environment of the infected host has previously been used in the study of circulating seasonal human coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, as well as the zoonotic SARS and MERS coronaviruses (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">Virus replication was assessed to determine the optimal time point for antiviral assays. We analyzed intracellular RNA, extracellular RNA from apical and basal supernatants, infectious viral titers and viral protein expression at different time points post-infection. Peak intracellular viral RNA levels were detected at 72 hpi (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). No time-dependent increase in viral RNA levels was observed in basolateral supernatants, suggesting inefficient release of virus into this compartment. In contrast, viral RNA signals from the apical surface supernatants were at their highest at 72 hpi, corresponding to the kinetics of intracellular RNA (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Preferential release from the apical membrane in polarized epithelial cells has been observed before for multiple viruses, including SARS-CoV (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Infectious viral titers from the apical supernatants also showed active viral replication, with peak titers at 72 hpi (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) in line with the viral RNA kinetics (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">The nasal epithelium contains both ciliated cells and mucus producing goblet cells after 4 weeks of differentiation on the air-liquid interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). To assess infection of these cell types, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expression by immunofluorescence microscopy. To validate the anti-Spike protein antibody used, we first analyzed SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells and observed abundant S protein expression in the perinuclear area as well as the periphery (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). In SARS-CoV-2 infected nasal epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 S protein was detected from 48-72 hpi onwards (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). In these cells, the S protein was mostly located at the outer cell periphery, and, as expected, at much lower levels than in Vero E6 cells. At 0 hpi, some S protein staining is also visible, likely corresponding to viral particles that have not internalized and remain attached to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Additionally, the epithelial cells were stained for the differentiation markers tubulin IV and Muc5Ac to identify ciliated cells and goblet cells, respectively. It did not appear that viral infection was more abundant in either of these cell types (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>).</p>

<title>Cytokine and chemokine responses are selectively enhanced or inhibited during SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary nasal epithelial cells</title>
<p id="P16">To assess the epithelial (immune) response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we measured cytokine and chemokine concentrations in the cell culture medium of primary nasal epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 from 0 to 96 hpi. Cytokines and chemokines associated with granulocyte (CXCL1 and CXCL8), monocyte (CXCL10, CCL4, and CCL20), NK cell (CXCL10 and CCL4) and T cell (CCL20, CCL17, and CXCL10) chemotaxis and activation increased over time compared to the mock infected cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL4, and CCL20 showed a more rapid production rate between 48 and 96 hpi, which is in line with the viral replication kinetics that we observed (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), suggesting that viral replication triggers cytokine and chemokine production in these cells. Strikingly, the cytokines that are typically associated with viral infections and acute phase reactions (IL-1β, TNF-α2, IL-6, IFN-λ1, and IFN-λ2,3) did not show increased production compared to mock infected cells, with the exception of IL-1β (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Furthermore, within the first 48 h of infection, the production of CXCL5, CCL3, CCL5, and, to a lesser extent, GM-CSF was reduced (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). This could be indicative of immune evasive activity of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="P17">These data suggest that the epithelium selectively stimulates cellular immune responses in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the virus inhibits secretion of specific cytokines. Both processes appear to be selective as for various other cytokines no difference in production could be observed between infected cells and mock infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Other cytokines that we tested, such as IFN-α, IFN-β, IL-10, and IL-12p70 were not produced by the epithelium at all (data not shown). Together, these data indicate a specific and dynamic interaction between airway epithelial cells and SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<sec id="S8">
<title>Berberine and obatoclax are effective against SARS-CoV-2 in nasal epithelial cells</title>
<p id="P18">Having established primary nasal epithelial cells as a relevant cellular model for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we assessed the antiviral activity of BBR and OBX in these cells. Nasal epithelial cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of BBR or OLX along with DMSO as a negative control and viral RNA levels were assessed at 72 hpi. BBR was effective at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in the supernatant of this nasal epithelial cell model with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 10.7 μM (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>), similar to that seen in Vero E6 cells. Likewise, OLX was effective in the sub-micromolar range with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.2 μM. Cytotoxicity assays were done with BBR and OLX over a 72h time period. There was a slight increase in toxicity in these cells as compared to the shorter 24 h exposure period in Vero E6 cells (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">D</xref>), resulting in lower selectivity indices for both compounds (SI=8.1 and 32.7 for BBR and OLX, respectively) than in Vero E6 cells. Altogether, these results indicate that BBR and OLX effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in a physiologically relevant human nasal epithelial cell model.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P19">The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread across the world, causing large-scale morbidity and mortality (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) (WHO Coronavirus Disease Dashboard, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covid19.who.int/">https://covid19.who.int/</ext-link>) and huge economic losses (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Effective treatment for patients who fall ill despite vaccination or other preventive measures is urgently needed. In this study, we propose to repurpose BBR and OLX, two compounds with good safety profiles in clinical trials as potential therapeutic options against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="P20">BBR is an isoquinoline alkaloid derived from the Chinese herb <italic>Coptis chinensis</italic> and plants of the <italic>Berberis</italic> genus (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Its wide-ranging biological properties identified in pre-clinical studies include anti-inflammatory, anti-arrhythmic, antimicrobial (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), and cholesterol-lowering (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) activity. In a large phase IV study randomising 612 patients, a treatment regimen containing 1000 mg BBR daily was not more effective in treating <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> than a comparator treatment, but it was well tolerated apart from a bitter taste (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>%) and nausea (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>%) as the most outspoken side effects (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Previous studies also identified a favourable safety profile, with predominantly mild gastrointestinal side effects (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). BBR has not found a place in clinical practise, but five placebo-controlled clinical trials are currently recruiting patients to study the effect of BBR against a range of conditions, including colorectal adenomas, schizophrenia and diabetes (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers NCT03281096, NCT03333265, NCT03378934, NCT02808351, NCT02983188, NCT03976336, NCT03198572, NCT02737943).</p>
<p id="P21">BBR has broad spectrum antiviral activity <italic>in vitro</italic> against viruses from several different families, including influenza A virus, enterovirus, chikungunya virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, HIV, respiratory syncytial virus, human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus and human papilloma virus [reviewed in (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>)]. We show here that BBR is effective against SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations in Vero E6 cells. While this manuscript was in preparation, our results were confirmed by another study showing the antiviral activity of BBR against SARS-CoV-2 also in Vero E6 cells at a similar EC<sub>50</sub> value (10.6 μM) (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Our study adds the validation of this finding in physiologically relevant primary nasal epithelial cells, where BBR is equally effective against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we show that BBR acts late in the viral life cycle and likely induces the formation of non-infectious virus particles. Congruently, BBR also inhibited replication of the alphaviruses Semliki Forest virus and chikungunya virus at a late stage (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), likely by interfering with capsid protein-viral RNA interactions, leading to nucleocapsid assembly or disassembly defects and less infectious viral particles (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). It remains to be confirmed whether BBR has similar effects on assembly of SARS-CoV-2 virions. In addition to inducing possible assembly affects, BBR may affect cellular pathways to reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication. BBR targets several cellular signalling pathways including major MAP-kinase pathways (ERK, p38 MAPK and JNK), as well as the NF-κB and the AMPK/m-TOR signalling pathways (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Many viruses upregulate these pathways to maximally utilize cellular resources for their replication (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). The modulation of these pathways by BBR has been implicated in its antiviral activity against several different viruses, including chikungunya virus (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), enterovirus 71 (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and herpes simplex virus (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). A recent proteomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 interaction networks revealed that the p38 MAP kinase pathway was upregulated to counteract the host immune system. In agreement, inhibitors specifically targeting the p38 MAPK displayed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Modulation of these cellular pathways needed for productive virus infection, could be a second mechanism through which BBR inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication.</p>
<p id="P22">OLX was originally developed as an inhibitor of Mcl-1, a member of the Bcl-2 family of anti-apoptotic proteins (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). OLX has been through phase I and II trials for a range of malignancies. Convincing antitumor effects have thus far not been demonstrated, but obatoclax proved safe in doses of 20-40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. The most reported adverse events are dose-related grade 1 or 2 neurological symptoms shortly after infusion (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>–<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>)</p>
<p id="P23">OLX has broad-spectrum antiviral activity, employing a mechanism independent of its pro-apoptotic activity. OLX acts as a weak base and rapidly neutralizes the acidic environment of endosomes and endolysosomes (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The acidification of endosomes is employed as an entry mechanism by enveloped viruses of several different families, including SARS-CoV-2 in TMPRSS2-negative target cells where endosomal cathepsin B/L proteases are activated by a drop in endosomal pH (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). We found that OLX inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at sub-micromolar concentrations in Vero E6 cells (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.06 μM) with a very high selectivity index. This confirms the results of another study in which OLX was reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2- induced cytotoxicity in Vero E6 cells (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Our time-of-addition assays confirmed the early effect of OLX, in alignment with the expected mechanism of virus entry inhibition. Moreover, we observe antiviral activity in nasal epithelial cells, with a three-fold higher EC<sub>50</sub> value as compared to Vero E6 cells. This is probably due to SARS-CoV-2 entry in airway epithelial cells being predominantly dependent on TMPRSS2 protease priming of the viral spike protein (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). However, unlike chloroquine, which also increases the endosomal pH but does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung epithelial cells (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), we observe an antiviral effect with OLX albeit with a lower but acceptable selectivity index. In clinical studies where OLX was administered intravenously over 3 hours, plasma level concentrations of ~0.4 μM were obtained (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), suggesting that it would be possible to achieve therapeutic dose levels to treat COVID-19.</p>
<p id="P24">To identify candidate antiviral compounds, it is important to assess antiviral activity in physiologically relevant <italic>in vitro</italic> models as drug sensitivities may be cell-type specific (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). We therefore characterized SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary nasal epithelial cells, which are one of the first cells the virus encounters during infection (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Expectedly, in these cells with an active innate immune system, SARS-CoV-2 showed lower replication kinetics and reached lower titers than in Vero E6 cells. Still, robust time-dependent increase in SARS-CoV-2 replication was seen using multiple assessment parameters – viral RNA levels, titers and viral protein expression. The viral titers we obtained correspond well to those observed previously in human tracheobronchial epithelial cells grown on an air-liquid interface (<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). In undifferentiated human airway epithelium, reconstituted from human primary nasal cells from a pool of 14 donors, higher SARS-CoV-2 titers were observed (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). We used differentiated cells from the post-operative tissue of a single donor, which may contribute to the observed differences.</p>
<p id="P25">SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary nasal epithelial cells induced epithelial release of CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL4, CCL20, CCL17 and IL1β. In contrast, we did not observe an increase in TNFα, IL-6, IFN-β, IFN-λ1, and IFN-λ2,3, cytokines that are typically involved in antiviral reactions and acute phase induction (<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). These observations might suggest that epithelial cells recruit leucocytes to the site of infection, rather than initiating an acute phase reaction themselves. Interestingly, viral infection also leads to reduced production of CXCL5, CCL5, CCL3 and GM-CSF, which are mainly involved in the attraction and activation of granulocytes and monocytes (<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 actively inhibits the recruitment of leukocytes early in infection.</p>
<p id="P26">In contrast to our findings, Pizzorno <italic>et al.</italic> observed a minor increase in IL-1β and TNFa mRNA levels, and a larger increase in IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2,3,4 mRNA levels in nasal epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). This discrepancy could be due to several differences in experimental setup, including the readouts (intracellular RNA versus protein in the supernatant), the use of cells from a pool of donors from different anatomical locations, and differentiation state (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>).</p>
<p id="P27">In conclusion, our study puts forth two small molecule compounds, BBR and OLX, as repurposed antiviral molecules against SARS-CoV-2, in doses lower than previously shown to be safe in human clinical trials. While OLX is effective at early steps of the viral life cycle, likely interfering with entry processes, BBR acts on the later stages and likely reduces the infectivity of newly produced virions. BBR and OLX are effective in a physiologically relevant cell culture model at low micromolar concentrations and could be considered for further assessment.</p>

<title>Berberine and obatoclax are effective antiviral compounds against SARS-CoV-2</title>
<p>Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (BavPat1 isolate) at an MOI of 0.01 for 24 h in the presence of the indicated concentrations of <bold>(A)</bold> berberine (BBR) or <bold>(B)</bold> obatoclax (OLX) in a two-fold dilution series or 0.1% DMSO. Infectious viral titers from duplicate cell culture supernatants were assessed by plaque assay and plotted as percentage inhibition compared to 0.1% DMSO control. Error bars indicate SD. Dashed line indicates 50% inhibition. A representative of two independent experiments is shown. Vero E6 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of <bold>(C)</bold> berberine or <bold>(D)</bold> obatoclax or 0.1% DMSO control. 24h post-treatment, ATP content in cells from triplicate wells was measured as indication for cell viability, plotted as percentage compared to the DMSO control.

<p>Vero E6 cells were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Nijmegen isolate at an MOI of 0.01 for 24h in the presence of the indicated concentrations of <bold>(A, C)</bold> berberine (BBR) or <bold>(B)</bold> obatoclax (OLX) in a two-fold dilution series or 0.1% DMSO. <bold>(A, B)</bold> Viral RNA from duplicate cell culture supernatants (red line in panel A) was quantified by qRT-PCR and plotted as percentage inhibition compared to the DMSO control. For BBR-treated cells, both extracellular and Intracellular viral RNA was analyzed (red and blue lines, respectively). Intracellular viral RNA levels were normalized to the human β-actin housekeeping gene. <bold>(C)</bold> Infectious viral titers from duplicate cell culture supernatants were quantified by plaque assay and plotted as percentage inhibition compared to the DMSO control. Error bars indicate SD. Dashed line indicates 50% inhibition. <bold>(D)</bold> Ratio of relative genome copies to infectious viral particles in cell culture supernatants for the indicated, non-toxic berberine concentrations and DMSO control.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary nasal epithelial cells</title>
<p>Primary nasal epithelial cells, cultured on an airliquid interface, were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (BavPat1 isolate) at an MOI of 10. At the indicated time points, cells were harvested and viral RNA from <bold>(A)</bold> cells or <bold>(B)</bold> apical and basolateral compartment supernatants was quantified by RT-qPCR. Intracellular viral RNA levels were normalized to the human β-actin housekeeping gene. Error bars indicate SD (n=2). <bold>(C)</bold> Infectious viral titers from apical supernatants corresponding to the indicated time points were quantified by plaque assay. Error bars indicate SD (n=2). <bold>(D)</bold> Immunofluorescence staining of mock (left panel), SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells fixed at 24 hpi (MOI 0.01; middle panel) or SARS-CoV-2 infected primary nasal epithelial cells fixed at 96 hpi (MOI 10; right panel). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein subunit S1 (pink) was assessed in cells stained with DAPI (nucleus, blue) and phalloidin (F-actin, red). Nasal epithelial cells were additionally stained with anti-Muc5AC antibodies (goblet cells, green). Bar represents 25 μm.</p>

<title>Berberine and obatoclax inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in primary nasal epithelial cells</title>
<p>Primary nasal epithelial cells cultured on an air-liquid interface were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (BavPat1 isolate) at an MOI of 10 in the presence of the indicated concentrations of <bold>(A)</bold> berberine (BBR) or <bold>(B)</bold> obatoclax (OLX) in a two-fold dilution series or 0.1% DMSO. Viral RNA from duplicate apical surface supernatants at 72 hpi was quantified by qRT-PCR and plotted as percentage inhibition compared to the DMSO control. Error bars indicate SD (n=2). Dashed line indicates 50% inhibition. Primary nasal epithelial cells cultured on an air-liquid interface were treated with the indicated concentrations of <bold>(C)</bold> berberine or <bold>(D)</bold> obatoclax or 0.1% DMSO control. At 72 h, ATP content in cells from duplicate samples was measured as a measure of cell viability, plotted as percentage of the DMSO control. Error bars indicate SD. Dashed line indicates 50% survival. A representative of two independent experiments is shown.</p>
