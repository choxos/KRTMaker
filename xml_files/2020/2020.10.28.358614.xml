<abstract>
<p id="P1">Severe manifestations of COVID-19 are mostly restricted to people with comorbidities. Here we report that induced mild pulmonary morbidities render SARS-CoV-2-refractive CD-1 mice to be susceptible to this virus. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 infection after application of low-doses of the acute-lung-injury stimulants bleomycin or ricin caused a severe disease in CD-1 mice, manifested by sustained body weight loss and mortality rates of &gt;50%. Further studies revealed markedly higher levels of viral RNA in the lungs, heart and serum of low-dose-ricin pretreated, as compared to non-pretreated mice. Notably, the deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection were effectively alleviated by passive transfer of polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies generated against SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Thus, viral cell entry in the sensitized mice seems to involve viral RBD binding, albeit by a mechanism other than the canonical ACE2-mediated uptake route. In summary, we present a novel mice-based animal model for the study of comorbidity-dependent severe COVID-19.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Severe manifestations of COVID-19 are mostly restricted to distinct groups of people; elderly persons and such that have comorbidities, form a significantly high proportion of those which develop acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) and thereby require intensive care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). These observations suggest that the severe form of COVID-19 is an outcome of the combined effects of both SARS-CoV-2 infection and an underlying pathological condition or predisposition. In the laboratory most COVID-19 animal models, based on ferrets, hamsters and non-human primates, develop a mild pathology which resolves within a relatively short period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) and thus seem to reflect the more prevalent asymptomatic-to-mild manifestation of the disease observed in humans. As such, these animal models do not enable a robust assessment of the therapeutic potential of candidate drugs and therapeutic antibodies which may alleviate the life-endangering form of the COVID-19 disease. Lately, to overcome the inability of SARS-CoV-2 to bind to murine ACE2, mice animal models in which human ACE2 is transiently or constitutively expressed were established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Although severe clinical manifestations were observed in some of these genetically-modified mice models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), these were not dependent on pre-existing morbidities, as in the case of severe COVID-19 in humans. Establishment of a COVID-19 animal model in which severe clinical signs are manifested only in the presence of a pathological background may prove to be more translationally-relevant for the study of this disease.</p>
<p id="P3">Bacterial lipopolysaccharide and bleomycin are well-established stimulants of ALI/ARDS in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Ricin, a plant-derived toxin, has also been proven in recent years to cause ALI/ARDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). We therefore examined whether pulmonary exposure of mice to carefully chosen sub-lethal doses of these stimulants could cause a relatively mild and transient lung injury which may serve as an underlying pathology that promotes increased susceptibility towards the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>
<p id="P4">In the present study we show that following infection with SARS-CoV-2 <italic>via</italic> intranasal application, low-dose ricin (LDR)- and bleomycin- pretreated mice display a significant and sustained decrease in body weight and that a significant proportion of these mice die within a surveillance period of 2 weeks. Passive transfer of polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 virus or the RBD portion of the viral spike resulted in full protection of LDR mice following viral infection. Our findings demonstrate that mice with induced pulmonary injuries can serve as an accessible model for studying SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and treatment, and imply a non-canonical mode of viral entry in comorbidity-dependent severe COVID-19.</p>

<title>Animal experiments</title>
<p id="P8">Animals in this study were female CD-1 mice (Charles River Laboratories Ltd., Margate, UK) weighing 27-32 grams. Prior to treatment or infection, animals were habituated to the experimental animal unit for at least five days. Treatment of animals was in accordance with regulations outlined in the USDA Animal Welfare Act and the conditions specified in the National Institute of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All mice were housed in filter-top cages in an environmentally controlled room and maintained at 21±2°C and 55±10% humidity. Lighting was set to mimic a 12/12 h dawn to dusk cycle. Animals had access to food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Ricin (1.7 mg/kg), bleomycin (2U/kg) or LPS (1.7 mg/kg) were applied intranasally (25ml per nostril) to mice anesthetized by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ketamine (1.9 mg/mouse) and xylazine (0.19 mg/mouse). Mice displaying weight loss of &gt;30%, were euthanized by cervical dislocation. SARS-CoV-2 diluted in PBS supplemented with 2% FBS was intranasally instilled to mice anesthetized as above. Where indicated, mice were administered (intraperitoneal injection, 1 ml) one of the following antibodies: equine-derived polyclonal anti-ricin F(ab)<sub>2</sub> fragment (1730 IsNU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD (MD65) antibody (1 mg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD antibody (SARS-CoV-2 NT<sub>50</sub>= 1:20,000) or polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 NT<sub>50</sub>= 1:10,000) antibody. For generation of RBD-huFc-and monomeric RBD were expressed and purified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD antibody was generated by immunizing a rabbit (female New-Zealand White) with RBD-huFc (150 μg, Complete Freund’s adjuvant) followed by boosting with RBD-huFc (150 μg, Incomplete Freund’s adjuvant) at day 21 and with monomeric RBD (150 μg, Incomplete Freund’s adjuvant) at day 42. Hyperimmune serum was collected at day 50. Polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody was generated in a rabbit (female New-Zealand White) by repeated intravenous injection of live SARS-CoV-2 virus (1x10<sup>

<title>Measurement of viral RNA</title>
<p id="P13">Mice lungs, trachea, nasal turbinate, heart, spleen, liver, kidney and brain were harvested and grinded. Serum was separated from collected blood. From each sample, 200 ml were added to LBF lysis buffer (supplied with the kit) and viral RNA was extracted using RNAdvance Viral Kit (Beckman Coulter) and further processed on the Biomek i7 Automated Workstation (Beckman Coulter), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Each sample was eluted in 50 ml of RNase-free water. Real-time RT-PCR assays, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 E gene, were performed using the SensiFAST Probe Lo-ROX One-Step kit (Bioline). The final concentration of primers was 600nM and the probe concentration was 300nM. Primers and probe for the E gene assay were taken from the Berlin protocol published in the WHO recommendation for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The primers and probe sequences were as follows:</p>

<p id="P19">RNA was isolated from lungs of mice using Qiagen RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen, CA, USA) with an on-column DNase step (Qiagen, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. RNA quantification was carried out in a Qubit fluorometer using the Qubit RNA HS assay kit (Invitogen, CA, USA).</p>
<p id="P20">RNA-seq was performed at the JP Sulzberger Columbia Genome Center (NY, NY). Libraries were generated using the Ilumina TrueSeq Standard mRNA kit according to manufacturers’ instructions. Polyadenylated RNA enrichment was performed. Sequencing of 100bp paired-end was performed on the Ilumina NovaSeq 6000 system. RNA-seq quality control was performed using fastQC v0.11.5, checking for per base sequence quality, per sequence quality scores and adapter content. Pseudoalignment to a kallisto index created from transcriptomes (Mouse: GRCm38) was performed using kallisto (0.44.0). We verified that each sample reached at least 75% of the target read goal and checked for adequate sequence alignment percentages. Sequencing yielded 19.5 M to 25.1M reads per sample resulting in identification of 35,199 transcripts. Analysis of differentially expressed genes under various conditions was performed using the R package DESeq2 v1/18.1, with default parameters.

<title>Induced pulmonary injuries predispose mice to SARS-Cov-2 infection</title>
<p id="P25">Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 requires the binding of the viral spike to ACE2. Unlike ACE2 of humans, hamsters and ferrets, ACE2 of mice does not sensitize cells for infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In line with this fact, CD-1 mice were refractive to SARS-CoV-2 infection as demonstrated by the lack of any discernable reduction in their body weights following viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). To determine whether pulmonary comorbidities affect the susceptibility of mice to SARS-COV-2, CD-1 mice were treated with one of three selected stimulants of acute lung injury, LPS, bleomycin or ricin. To promote the development of a mild and transient injury which resolves within a few days, these stimulants were administered intranasally at low doses, 1.7 mg/kg, 2U/kg and 1.7 mg/kg of LPS, bleomycin and ricin, respectively. The time-point at which the mice display an onset of disease as exemplified by body weight loss was 1, 4 and 2 days after the administration of LPS, bleomycin and ricin, respectively. At these time-points, the pre-administered mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a dose of 5x10<sup>6</sup> PFU/mouse and then monitored for 15 days. LPS-pretreated mice displayed an additional decrease in body weight following viral infection, however body weight regain began already at 5 dpi and the mice approached their weights determined prior to viral infection, within a short period of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). In contrast, mice pretreated with either bleomycin or ricin displayed a more sustained decline in body weight which lasted throughout the entire surveillance period following infection with SARS-CoV-2, reaching as low as 70% (bleomycin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) and 77% (ricin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) of their original weights determined immediately prior to viral infection. Most notably, 100 and 50 percent of the bleomycin- and ricin-pretreated mice, respectively, died within the 15 days surveillance period, death occurring at 4 to 7 dpi for bleomycin-pretreated mice and 9 to 13 dpi for ricin-pretreated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>
<p id="P26">The present study focused on the SARS-CoV-2 mice model predisposed by low dose ricin (LDR). Repeated experiments allowed us to determine that following infection with SARS-CoV-2 at a dose of 5x10<sup>6</sup> PFU per mouse, death rates were within the range of 17-75% with an overall average of 39% (n=26, 5 independent experiments). When low-dose ricin (LDR) mice were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 infection at a lower viral dose, 5x10<sup>

</sup> PFU per mouse, body weight reduction was less pronounced (&lt;7%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) and full weight regain was reached at 8 dpi. In a representative experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>), 20% of the animals died, similar to the average death rate determined in repeated experiments (n=16, 3 independent experiments, range=0-40%). Taken together, these findings clearly demonstrate that though CD-1 mice are refractive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, compromised pulmonary conditions induced by pre-exposure to low doses of selected ALI stimulants, confer a SARS-CoV-2-sensitive phenotype to these mice.</p>

<title>Characterization of the pulmonary injury induced by intranasal application of low-dose-ricin</title>
<p id="P27">To characterize the impaired pulmonary background that promotes SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity, we monitored the pathological changes occurring in LDR mice. These examinations, which were carried out starting from the time of ricin application included surveillance of body weight and motor activity over time, differential blood counts and bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) analyses. LDR mice which were not subjected to viral infection displayed a transient loss of weight of up to approximately 10% (9.6 ± 2.9%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). In repeated experiments, maximal weight reduction occurred 2-6 days after administration of low dose ricin, while commencement of body weight regain was recorded between 3 to 7 days after ricin treatment. In most experiments, mice reached their initial body weights at days 7-12 and average body weight percentage at day 12 was 102.5±2.5%. LDR mice morbidity was also by following their motor activity, utilizing a recently developed computerized home cage monitoring system (HCMS100) based on laser-beam interruption counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Examination of nocturnal activity profiles showed that LDR mice displayed a transient reduction in motor activity compared to sham-treated mice, which resolved at day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P28">Hematological analysis was performed on blood samples collected from LDR mice 2 days after the low dose ricin was administered (day 0), this time point corresponding to that at which LDR mice were infected with the virus. White blood cell counts in general and in neutrophils and monocytes in particular were elevated. Platelet counts increased as well (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). BALF collected from LDR mice at this time-point displayed higher protein contents as well as elevated cell counts, compared to sham-treated mice. Elevated TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6 levels were also measured in the BALF of the LDR mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In line with this observation, indicating that an inflammatory reaction has launched in response to low dose ricin administration, gene expression of cytokines and chemokines in the LDR mice lungs, 2 days after ricin application, were significantly upregulated, in comparison to naïve mice lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Finally, assessment of ricin catalytic activity (28S rRNA depurination) in the lungs demonstrated that ~8% of lung 28s rRNA extracted from LDR mice 2 days post-administration were depurinated at this time point (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). At day 7, nearly all of the hematological and BALF-related parameters displayed values that did not differ significantly from the corresponding values determined in sham-treated mice (a single exception was the BALF protein concentration value which was significantly higher than in the sham mice). In addition, depurinated 28S rRNA, the hallmark of ricin catalytic activity, could not be measured above background level at day 7 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that the impaired pulmonary state in LDR mice is limited, resolution occurring within a matter of days.</p>
<p id="P29">To provide a more comprehensive view of the alterations in protein expression that might play a role in sensitizing LDR mice to SARS-CoV-2 infection, whole lung cell RNA-seq of LDR-<italic>versus</italic> naïve-mice were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Principal component analysis revealed distinct transcriptional signatures between naïve and LDR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Compared with the naïve group, there were 8545 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the LDR group (2 days after low-dose-ricin application), comprising 4394 upregulated and 4151 downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis ranked by the false discovery rate (q value) after eliminating redundant terms, revealed 1379 G0 terms in upregulated DEGs (biological process-865, cellular function-210, molecular function-304) and 1289 GO terms in downregulated DEGs (biological process-810, cellular function-160, molecular function-319). These results reflect the notable magnitude of alterations that occur in the transcriptome profile of the LDR mice in a wide range of genes and in all three domains of the gene annotation analysis. Observing the top 50 (displaying highest q values, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) up-regulated biological processes GO terms, have shown an over-representation of themes related to immune and inflammatory response (44%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), corroborating our observation that low dose ricin application stimulates expression of proinflammatory gene pathways even though it does not cause a clinically acute disease.</p>
<p id="P30">We further ascertained that the marked deterioration observed in LDR-SARS-CoV-2 mice is directly due to the viral infection and does not reflect an exacerbation of a ricin-related disease. To this end, LDR-SARS-CoV-2 mice were treated 2 hours prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection with equine-derived anti-ricin F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> antibodies at a &gt;10-fold higher dose than that required for full protection of mice from a lethal dose (7 mg/kg body weight) of ricin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Indeed, treatment of mice with these antibodies at the time of low dose ricin treatment prevented body weight loss (data not shown), attesting to efficient and rapid neutralization of the toxin. Nevertheless, treatment with anti-ricin antibodies did not have any measurable beneficent effect on the well-being of the LDR-SARS-CoV-2 mice; following viral infection, weight loss continued to decline markedly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) in a manner similar to that observed in LDR-SARS-CoV-2 mice that were not treated with anti-ricin antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Twenty percent of the anti-ricin-antibody-treated LDR-SARS-CoV-2 died within the 15 day surveillance period, this death rate falling within the death rate range documented for mice that were not subjected to anti-ricin antibody treatment. Thus, the significant signs of morbidity documented in LDR mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus stem from the viral infection and not from continuous ricin toxic activity.</p>

<title>Characterization of the SARS-COV-2 infection model in LDR mice</title>
<p id="P31">We evaluated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on lung histopathology using H&amp;E and MTC stainings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). At 7 dpi, lungs from LDR-SARS-CoV-2 mice exhibited severe damage manifested by extensive peribronchial and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration along with intra-alveolar edema, fibrin and macrophage accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6, B, C</xref>, right). In contrast, lungs from SARS-CoV-2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6, A</xref>, right) exhibited a relatively preserved alveolar structure and a mild immune peribronchial and perivascular cell infiltration. Upon viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, day 0), LDR mice exhibited mild mononuclear cell infiltrations in the peribronchial and perivascular areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6, B, C</xref>, left). Taken together, these observations show that severe manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 induced lung injury were restricted to LDR mice.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup> PFU per mouse and thereafter, various organs and tissues were harvested and examined for the presence of viral RNA. Already at 2 days after viral infection, viral RNA levels in nasal turbinate, trachea and lung homogenates were markedly higher in LDR-SARS-CoV-2 mice than in SARS-CoV-2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). Significantly higher levels of viral RNA were also documented as early as 2 days post-infection in the serum and heart of LDR-SARS-CoV-2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Higher levels of viral RNA were also detected in brain and spleen homogenates of LDR-SARS-CoV-2 mice, however these did not differ statistically from the corresponding levels determined in SARS-CoV-2 mice. No viral RNA was found in liver and kidney homogenates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). We further profiled viral RNA in serum and heart homogenates over time. Indeed, LDR-SARS-CoV-2 mice displayed significantly high levels of viral RNA in the serum and heart at all time-points examined, 3, 5 and 7 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). Examination of lung homogenates at these time-points, demonstrated a progressive decline of viral RNA over time, yet levels remained relatively high even in SARS-CoV-2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). To determine the presence of viable SARS-CoV-2, lung homogenate samples were subjected to growth kinetics profiling. To this end, Vero E6 cells were with incubated with homogenate lung samples harvested at 3 dpi, and extracellular viral RNA was repeatedly quantified by RTPCR at 3 different time-points. Unlike lung homogenates of SARS-CoV-2 mice which exhibited unaltered Ct values, those of LDR-SARS-CoV-2 mice displayed decreasing Ct values of 29, 23 and 8 at 0, 24 and 48 hours, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>), attesting to the fact that viable virus is present at 3 dpi, solely in LDR-SARS-CoV-2 mice.</p>

<title>Anti-viral-related antibodies protect LDR mice from SARS-COV-2 infection</title>
<p id="P33">If indeed the deleterious manifestations documented in LDR-SARS-CoV-2 mice are due to direct viral activity, one may expect them to be redressed by treating the mice with anti-SARS-CoV-2-related antibodies. To address this issue, LDR mice were treated with polyclonal antibodies raised against either the entire virus or the receptor binding domain (RBD) portion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Materials &amp; Methods</xref>) or with the human MD65 monoclonal antibody shown to target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Application of either of the three anti-SARS-CoV-2-related antibodies 2 hours prior to viral infection, promoted mouse body weight regain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). Accordingly, at 9-10 dpi the body weights of the mice groups treated with each of the three antibody preparations approached their weight values determined at the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection. No deaths were recorded in the mice groups treated with either of the anti-viral related antibodies. In contrast, mice treated with non-specific antibodies (normal rabbit serum or TL1 Mab isotype control, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>)) displayed a steady drop in body weight and 40-100% of the mice succumbed within 5-13 dpi.</p>

<title>Effect of LDR pretreatment on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression</title>
<p id="P34">ACE2 is the key cell-surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2 while the TMPRSS2 protease serves as a co-factor involved in the trimming of the viral spike, a process which facilitates viral internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). It has been well established by others and shown in the present study as well, that mice are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and as such, cannot serve as models for the CoVID-19 disease. This refractivity towards the virus is attributed to the inability of SARS-CoV-2 to bind effectively to murine ACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Yet, in view of the fact that low doses of selected ALI stimulants render mice sensitive to the virus, we examined whether application of these stimulants affected the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. To this end, lungs of LDR mice were harvested 2 days after application of ricin. This time point was chosen since alterations documented at this time-point, correspond to those which occur at the time of viral infection following treatment with low-dose-ricin. Cell suspensions prepared from the mice lungs were analyzed by flow cytometry, utilizing anti-mACE2 and anti-TMPRSS2 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P35">Comparison between sham-treated and LDR mice demonstrated that ricin administration did not bring about any noticeable increase in the number of cells expressing ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A</xref>). In contrast, the number of lung cells expressing TMPRSS2 was significantly higher in LDR mice than in the sham-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref>). Notably, this increase in TMPRSS2 expression was cell-type dependent. Thus, a 50 percent increase was observed in the number of TMPRSS2<sup>+</sup> lung cells of epithelial (CD45<sup>-</sup>CD31) lineage, while lung endothelial (CD45<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>+</sup>) and hematopoietic cell (CD45<sup>+</sup>) TMPRSS2<sup>+</sup> counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref>) were not affected.</p>
<p id="P36">The fact that the number of cells expressing cell-bound ACE2 did not increase following treatment with ricin, does not negate the possibility that viral entry into lung cells of LDR mice takes place by the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD to the murine ACE2 with the aid of factor(s) which are present only following induction of the pulmonary injury or by binding to cell-surface receptors other than ACE2 which are newly expressed/exposed following mice sensitization. To address this issue, we examined whether application of low-dose-ricin affects binding of RBD to mice lung cells. To this end, lung sections prepared from LDR- and naïve-mice, were incubated with RBD-huFc fused protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) or with AChE-huFc (used as control for Fc) fused protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), immunostained with AF594-labeled anti-huFc antibodies and visualized by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>). Lungs of LDR mice displayed markedly higher binding of RBD-huFc than those of naïve mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10A</xref>). This staining reflects authentic RBD binding to the lung cells and not huFc binding, as incubation with control AChE-huFc-fused protein resulted in no noticeable binding (LDR-Fc control). Quantitation of the mean fluorescence intensity in each scanned field (5 fields/lung) demonstrates a 70% increase RBD binding in LDR mice lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10B</xref>). Whether this increased binding of RBD to LDR lungs is clinically functional and relevant, needs to be further examined.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P37">In the present study we show that transient pulmonary insults prompted by administration of low doses of the ALI/ARDS stimulants, LPS, bleomycin or ricin, render mice to be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Recently, mice models were adapted for SARS-CoV-2 infection either by adjusting the viral spike RBD domain to fit the murine version of ACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) or by transient or constitutive expression of the human ACE2 in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). In contrast, the model presented in the current study consists of mice expressing their native ACE2 receptor yet are sensitive to genetically unaltered <italic>bona fide</italic> SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>
<p id="P38">When LPS-treated mice were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the deleterious effect of the virus, reflected by additional loss of body weight, was slight and the mice displayed body weight regain within a few days. This narrow dynamic range of measurable viral-induced body weight loss precludes the use of LPS-pretreated mice for meaningful evaluation of virus-induced pathologies or anti-viral medical countermeasures. On the other hand, following SARS-CoV-2 infection of ricin- or bleomycin-pretreated mice, body weights of the mice decreased steadily and significantly during the entire course of the experimental surveillance period (15 days). Most importantly, 50-100 percent of the ricin- and bleomycin-pretreated mice animals died following viral exposure.</p>
<p id="P39">The finding that SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity is retained even when the LDR mice were treated with anti-ricin antibodies before viral infection, implies that active ricin is not required for conferring sensitivity towards the virus. Rather, the low-dose-ricin-induced pulmonary pathologies themselves promote viral susceptibility in these mice. Pathophysiological assessment of LDR mice at the time of viral infection, identified various factors that may contribute to the pathological setting required for acquisition of sensitivity towards SARS-CoV-2. These include high-level expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs and serum, mild immune cell infiltration to the lungs and elevated protein levels in the lungs, the latter indicative of compromised alveolar-capillary barrier function. Factors that may bring about gain-of-sensitivity towards SARS-CoV-2 in bleomycin-treated mice were not addressed in the present study and we now plan to examine these in our laboratory and to determine whether some of these overlap with the factors defined for low-dose-ricin-pretreated mice.</p>
<p id="P40">Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of tissues derived from LDR-SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 mice, demonstrated the presence of significantly higher levels of viral RNA in the lungs of LDR-SARS-CoV-2 mice. High levels of viral RNA, which were detected in the hearts and serum of LDR-SARS-CoV-2 mice, remained high at all examined time-points. Conversely, viral RNA levels in the hearts and serum of SARS-CoV-2 mice were considerably lower and waned rapidly. A recently published study also reported the presence of extrapulmonary SARS-CoV-2 virus in organs such as the heart, in a BALB-C-based mice model infected by murine-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). This finding is of considerable clinical relevance since autopsy samples obtained from COVID-19 patients revealed the presence of the virus in organs other than the lungs, including the heart, brain and blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). In some cases, brain and heart damage were also documented in COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) yet whether these injuries stem from direct viral activity or are due to an excessive immune response and virus-induced cytokine storm remains to be elucidated. Studies at our laboratory are now being performed to determine the presence and extent of organ injury in the hearts and brains of LDR-SARS-CoV-2 mice.</p>
<p id="P41">Taken together, our findings raise the intriguing question as to how the virus gains entrance into cells of CD-1 mice. Protection of LDR-SARS-CoV-2 mice by application of anti-RBD antibodies seems to imply that viral entry into cells of low dose ricin-treated mice is mediated <italic>via</italic> the RBD region of the viral spike. One may therefore be tempted to suggest that increased expression of ACE2 can compensate for the relatively poor binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD to this ACE2 species and that overexpression of this receptor in mouse lung cells can overcome this limitation and bring upon a successful viral infection. However, comparative flow cytometry analysis of lung cells derived from sham-treated and LDR mice failed to detect an increase in ACE2 expressing cells following application of low dose ricin. On the other hand, histochemical analysis of lung sections prepared from LDR mice did reveal a significant increase in the binding of viral RBD. The combination of these two findings may imply that in LDR mice (and possibly in bleomycin mice), there is a gain of receptors other than ACE2 that can serve as an effective binding site for SARS-CoV-2, perhaps with the aid of the high level of lung cell surface TMPRSS2 induced by low dose ricin application.</p>
<p id="P42">Various viruses use junction proteins as receptors and access epithelium cells through apical junction complexes which contain tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs) even if most of these proteins are not readily available, possibly by taking advantage of compromised epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Indeed, studies carried out in our laboratory demonstrated that intranasal application of a lethal dose of ricin (7mg/kg) to mice leads to rapid diminution of both adherens and tight junctions in the lungs, thereby precipitating the disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Intriguingly, altered expression of tight junction molecules in the alveolar septa has also been reported in bleomycin- and LPS-induced lung injury models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). In line with the notion that alterations in junction proteins integrity play a role in the acquired sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2, Gene Ontology analysis of the RNA-seq upregulated genes in lungs of LDR mice at the time of viral infection, demonstrated, amongst others, the enrichment of pathways involved in protein binding, including enrichment of gene clusters involved in cadherin binding pathway (molecular function in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P43">Whether aberrations of junction proteins indeed play a significant role in the sensitization of mice towards SARS-CoV-2 remains to be determined. Nevertheless, and irrespective of the exact mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 virus gains entrance to CD-1 mice lung cells, the existence of a second tier of entry points for SARS-CoV-2 in the case of pulmonary comorbidities, may have important implications on COVID-19 in humans, especially in high-risk populations. Decoding the process by which SARS-CoV-2 gains entrance into murine cells following sensitization by ricin or bleomycin is therefore a focal point of the ongoing research at our laboratory.</p>
<p id="P44">In summary, we established a unique mouse model for the study of the molecular pathways involved in comorbidity-dependent SARS-CoV-2-induced pathologies and for examining potential medical countermeasures for treatment of COVID-19 in high risk populations.</p>

<p>A-D: body weights of CD-1 mice (presented as percent of original weight determined at the time of viral instillation) were monitored over a period of 15 days following intranasal instillation of SARS-CoV-2 virus. A: Body weights of mice infected with virus at a dose of 5x10<sup>6</sup> PFU per mouse (black squares) compared to body weights of naïve mice (white squares). B: Mice were administered LPS (1.7 mg/kg body weight) and 1 day later were infected (black squares) or not (white squares) with virus (5x10<sup>6</sup> PFU/mouse). C: Mice were administered bleomycin (2U/kg body weight) and 4 days later were infected (black squares) or not (white squares) with virus (5x10<sup>6</sup> PFU/mouse). Due to significant mortality, only data of 0 to 6 days are presented for bleomycin-SARS-CoV-2 mice. D: Mice were administered ricin (1.7 mg/kg body weight) and 2 days later were infected with virus at a dose of 5x10<sup>5</sup> (black triangles) or 5x10<sup>6</sup> (black squares) PFU/mouse or not (white squares). E: Kaplan-Meier survival curves of the mice groups exhibiting mortality: thick dashed line-LDR-SARS-CoV-2 (5x10<sup>5</sup> PFU/mouse), black line-LDR-SARS-CoV-2 (5x10<sup>6</sup> PFU/mouse), thin dashed line-bleomycin-SARS-CoV-2 (5x10<sup>6</sup> PFU/mouse).

<p>RNAseq analysis of lung homogenates from naïve- and LDR-(2 days post-low-dose-ricin application) mice (n=4). A: Principal component analysis was performed for 8 samples with log2 transformed gene-level normalized counts data. PC, principal component. B: Volcano plot comparing differentially expressed genes, respectively, with a false discovery rate (q value) &lt; 0.05. Multiple comparisons were accounted for by calculation of a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate-adjusted P value (q value). Each dot in the volcano plot represents a single gene. C: Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of biological process (BP) terms enriched in upregulated genes from comparisons of LDR mice versus naïve. Terms were ranked by the false discovery rate (q value) and the immune and inflammatory terms are listed from the top 50 after eliminating redundant terms. Gray bars show the – log10[q value]. Red bars show the genes fold enrichment.</p>
