cross-reactive T-cell responses remains uncertain, while this knowledge may indicate how to adjust vaccines and maintain robust long-term protection against continuously emerging variants. To characterize CD8+ T-cell response to epitopes unique to SARS-CoV-2 (SC-unique) or shared with other coronaviruses (CoV-common), we trained a large number of TCR-epitope recognition models for MHC-I-presented SARS-CoV-2 epitopes from publicly available data. Applying those models to longitudinal COVID-19 TCR repertoires of critical and non-critical COVID-19 patients, we discovered that notwithstanding comparable CD8+ T-cell depletion and the sizes of putative CoV-common CD8+ TCR repertoires in all symptomatic patients at the initial stage of the disease, the temporal dynamics of putative SC2-unique TCRs differed depending on the disease severity. Only non-critical patients had developed large and diverse SC2-unique CD8+ T-cell response by the second week of the disease. Additionally, only this patient group demonstrated redundancy in CD8+ TCRs putatively recognizing unique and common SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Our findings thus emphasize the role of the <italic>de novo</italic> CD8+ T-cell response and support the argument against the clinical benefit of pre-existing cross-reactive CD8+ T cells. Now, the analytical framework of this study can not only be employed to track specific and cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cells in any TCR repertoire but also be generalized to more epitopes and be employed for adaptive immune response assessment and monitoring to inform public health decisions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The emergence of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 has led to the most prominent pandemic in recent history. The SARS-CoV-2 infection manifests as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with varying symptoms and severity and has caused substantial deaths all over the world.</p><p id="P4">The adaptive immune system is responsible for generating specific immunity against a viral infection. There is growing evidence that in case of SARS-CoV-2, T cells in particular might play a key role in infection control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gangaev et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Grifoni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kared et al., 2021</xref>) even without seroconversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Swadling et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), in moderation of COVID-19 severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chen and John Wherry, 2020;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Tan et al., 2021</xref>), and in the durability of natural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Peng et al., 2020</xref>) and vaccination-induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Afkhami et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Tarke et al., 2022</xref>) immunity, including protection against viral variants. Previously, coronavirus-specific T-cell responses were already described as an important factor in the long-term immunity during SARS and MERS outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Oh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Yang et al., 2006</xref>), with some of the T cells exhibiting robust cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 17 years later after the original infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">le Bert et al., 2020</xref>). Pre-infection presence of CD4+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Braun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Mateus et al., 2020</xref>) and CD8+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Lineburg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Nesterenko et al., 2021</xref>) T cells that broadly recognize epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 due to relatedness with previously encountered viruses have been widely reported. Furthermore, both cross-reactive CD4+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kundu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Loyal et al., 2021</xref>) and CD8+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Mallajosyula et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Schulien et al., 2021</xref>) T cells were suggested to have a protective effect in some individuals. Nevertheless, there are also conflicting findings questioning the clinical benefits of cross-reactive CD4+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bacher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dykema et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Saggau et al., 2022</xref>) and CD8+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Ferretti et al., 2020</xref>) T cells for other patients. Consequently, it is important to investigate the clinical impact of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and to be able to distinguish them from <italic>de novo</italic> responding T cells. In particular, understanding the contribution of CD8+ T-cell clones with a particular specificity could guide the design of new-generation vaccines or booster regimens to supplement weakening antibody-mediated neutralization (due to viral escape mutations) with an enhanced T-cell response and help stratify individuals into risk groups.</p><p id="P5">High-throughput T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing paired with TCR-epitope mapping enables insights into an individual’s TCR repertoire composition. However, only a handful of TCR sequences, so-called “public” TCRs, are found across different individuals, while the majority of a TCR repertoire consists of “private”, unique to an individual, TCRs. Experimental assessment of epitope specificity of every single “private” TCR is not feasible due to the high inter- and intrapersonal diversity of TCRs. Accordingly, despite the ongoing efforts of sequencing studies to decipher “public” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Schultheiẞ et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Snyder et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wu et al., 2022</xref>) and “private” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Minervina et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Shomuradova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Snyder et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wu et al., 2022</xref>) SARS-CoV-2 TCR sequences, specificity of most disease-associated T cells is yet to be resolved.</p><p id="P6">Recently, computational recognition models have been developed to connect T cells with their target epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dash et al., 2017</xref>; de Neuter et al., 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gielis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Glanville et al., 2017</xref>). These models are based on the concept that TCRs recognizing the same epitope tend to have similar amino acid sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Meysman et al., 2019</xref>). The advantage of the models is their ability to extract TCR-epitope interaction patterns from limited available experimentally validated data and to extrapolate them to previously unencountered TCRs. Thus, TCR repertoires can be easily screened to find potential epitope specificity of the unknown “private” and “public” TCRs. Here, we leverage such recognition models to track SARS-CoV-2 epitope-specificity in publicly available bulk TCR repertoires of COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Schultheiẞ et al., 2020</xref>) and in sorted CD4+ and CD8+ TCR repertoires of newly recruited COVID-19 patients. We report on the differential evolution of CD8+ T-cell response to unique SARS-CoV-2 epitopes (SC2-unique) and SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that are shared with common cold coronaviruses (CoV-common) in patients with critical and non-critical COVID-19 presentation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>SARS-CoV-2 epitope-TCR TCRex recognition models</title><sec id="S4"><label>•</label><title>Collection of the public TCR data with known SARS-CoV-2 epitope-specificity</title><p id="P7">A collection of experimentally validated TCR-epitope pairs was established by combining two primary sources: (1) The VDJdb database which contained tetramer-derived data from Shomuradova et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Shomuradova et al., 2020</xref>); access date: May 26th, 2020]; (2) The ImmuneCODE collection from Adaptive Technologies and Microsoft which contained pairs derived through MIRA assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Snyder et al., 2020</xref>); access date: June 25th, 2020].</p><p id="P8">For all extracted pairs, several data curation steps were performed.

Models were then evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation, and any epitope-specific model with an AUC ROC higher than 0.7 and a PR higher than 0.35 was retained as suggested by the default TCRex settings.

Repertoire depth was described as the relative frequency with which TCR sequences with a certain predicted specificity occur in the entire TCR repertoire. Repertoire breadth was calculated as the number of unique TCR sequences with a certain predicted specificity divided by the size of the unique TCR repertoire. Response diversity was represented as the number of putatively recognized SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Average response redundancy was estimated as TCR/Epitope ratio: the number of unique SARS-CoV-2-specific TCRs to the number of recognized SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Response metrics were calculated separately for SC2-unique and CoV-common epitopes. Repertoire metrics were rescaled so that proportions are consistent across data sets. Additionally, log2 fold change of a repertoire depth was monitored to evaluate the magnitude of temporal intrapersonal changes. Accordingly, for every patient for whom longitudinal data was available, TCR repertoire frequencies were shifted by 1 to enable subsequent calculation of fold changes between consecutive weeks and log2-transformation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S14"><title>SARS-CoV-2 epitope-TCR recognition models are robust and performant</title><p id="P22">To construct SARS-CoV-2 epitope-TCR recognition models, a collection of experimentally validated TCR-epitope pairs was established.

Twenty-four of these 47 epitopes match the SARS-CoV-2 replicase protein coded by ORF1ab, 16 match the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein encoded by ORF2 and the final 7 are distributed across the remaining proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1</xref>). In addition, 19 of the 47 epitopes are 100% unique to SARS-CoV-2 in our dataset of 119 Nidovirales species.

Whereas only 6 out of 24 are unique for the ORF1ab replicase protein, 9 out of the 16 epitopes derived from the spike protein are unique to SARS-CoV-2. Although mutations are 5 times more frequent in the spike protein compared to the genomic average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Amicone et al., 2022</xref>) and thus might weaken B-cell response, T-cell recognition appears to be retained against different variants including Omicron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Moss, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Redd et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Tarke et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, as previously evaluated for 3 SARS-CoV-2 variants, only 1 mutation overlapped with 52 MHC-I epitopes recognized by convalescent individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Redd et al., 2021</xref>). Together, this bodes well for the constructed TCRex models to stay relevant for the continuously emerging variants.</p><p id="P24">As we were integrating models from different resources and diverse experimental methods, we wished to confirm if these data were comparable. Interestingly, one epitope had both tetramer (315 TCRs) and MIRA data (366 TCRs), namely YLQPRTFLL (YLQ). However, in the case of the MIRA data, the TCRs were not uniquely assigned to this epitope, but all were assigned to the trio YLQPRTFL, YLQPRTFLL, and YYVGYLQPRTF. These 366 TCRs were thus excluded from the training data. Therefore, MIRA YLQ data can serve as an independent dataset for performance evaluation of the YLQ model based on tetramer YLQ data. In this manner, TCRex predicted 81 out of 366 TCRs in the YLQ MIRA dataset to be putatively YLQ-reactive. Notably, only 35 out of 81 TCRs had an exact sequence match between the two datasets based on CDR3 sequence (not accounting for V/J genes); hence, 46 additional TCRs were identified, indicating TCRex can indeed extrapolate from found TCR patterns. This number of predictions was assigned an enrichment p-value of 6.44e-246 based on the built-in TCRex enrichment test. As a negative control, no other epitopes present in TCRex (including both the 46 non-YLQ SARS-CoV-2 models and the 49 non-SARS-CoV-2 models) were predicted to have a single TCR target within the YLQ MIRA dataset. Thus, the data is comparable, and the models can be used irrespective of origin.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Recognition models can be used to track epitope-specificity in CD8+ TCR repertoires</title><p id="P25">As the constructed models predict specificity to epitopes presented on MHC-I molecules, we expected that TCRs predicted to recognize those epitopes will be enriched in CD8+ T cells.</p><p id="P26">To validate this assumption, we generated CD4+ and CD8+ TCR repertoires for 11 COVID-19 patients (“split” dataset) at multiple time points and applied our 47 SARS-CoV-2 TCRex models to this data.

We observed that critical and non-critical patients had the opposite dynamics during the first two weeks (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>): the median breadth and depth of SC2-unique TCR repertoires increased from week 1 to week 2 only in non-critical patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2-a, c</xref>), and the median breadth and depth of the CoV-common TCR repertoire decreased from week 1 to week 2 only in critical patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2-b, d</xref>).

Intriguingly, we have observed a lack of increase in CoV-common TCR repertoire depth and breadth and CoV-common response diversity in non-critical patients, despite the growth in the number of recognized epitopes.

When this parameter was normalized for the repertoire size, there was no difference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>) suggesting that the CD8+ T-cell response of critical patients was limited by the low number of available unique TCRs (diminished TCR diversity). Furthermore, non-critical patients, unlike critical patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5A,B</xref>, median=1 for both epitope groups), exhibited redundancy in the T-cell response to both SC2-unique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5A</xref>, median=10 TCRs “per average epitope”, range=[1-26]) and, although much less pronounced, CoV-common (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5B</xref>, median=2 TCRs “per average epitope”, range=[1-3]) epitopes.

Unsurprisingly, no epitopes were recognized by all the patients within any of the two disease severity groups. As epitope recognition depends not only on the TCR sequences but also on what epitopes can be presented given the HLA type that a person has, it is most likely that sets of recognized epitopes are unique for each patient. However, there were 9 epitopes, including 5 SC2-unique ones, that were recognized exclusively by non-critical patients, albeit by only 1 or 2 individuals for each epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5C</xref>).

As reported above, critical and non-critical symptomatic patients had comparable total numbers of sampled TCRs and proportions of unique TCRs at the beginning of their COVID-19. However, examination of all available data revealed that the proportion of all unique TCRs (irrespective of their epitope specificity) significantly increased in individuals with the non-critical disease over the entire period of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6</xref>, Spearman rho=0.62, p=3e-05) and became significantly higher after week 4, once patients entered recovery stage (Mann–Whitney U test p=2e-04, AUC=0.83).

For this subset, log2 fold change of TCR frequencies between consecutive data points was calculated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S5-a, b</xref>). This analysis revealed that the majority of non-critical (5/6) and critical (7/9) patients experienced decline in the frequency of CoV-common TCRs at least once during their active COVID-19. 33% (2/6) of non-critical and 56% (5/9) of critical patients didn’t have any changes in the depth of SC2-unique TCR repertoires. In all individuals, SC2-unique and CoV-common TCR repertoires were changing in the opposite directions 9 times, 5 times in the same direction and 8 times only one of the repertoires was changing between consecutive weeks while the other remained the same highlighting that TCR repertoires are constantly evolving.

Despite intra- and interpersonal variability of SARS-CoV-2 TCR repertoire expansion and contraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S6</xref>), there seemed to be some overall trends. In particular, multiple patients from both disease severity groups had a rise of SC2-unique and CoV-common TCR frequencies around weeks 2-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S7A,B</xref>). The depth of CoV-common TCR repertoires also seemed to increase around week 6 in some individuals with critical and non-critical COVID-19 severity (F<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">ig.S7A,B</xref>).

This was not the case for the non-critical patient group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7A</xref>, Spearman rho=-0.06, p=0.71) where the maximum frequency of SC2-unique TCRs was reached by weeks 2-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S7A</xref>).</p><p id="P39">The most prominent breadth changes occurred exclusively in SC2-unique TCR repertoires, while the breadth of TCR repertoires reactive to CoV-common epitopes remained relatively stable in both patient groups during the entire study period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S7C,D</xref>).

In this study, we combined our newly generated TCR sequences from COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a single center in Belgium with public datasets to gain insights into the specificity and evolution of CD8+ TCR repertoires in critical and non-critical symptomatic COVID-19 patients.</p><p id="P42">We observed that CD8+ T cells predicted to target CoV-common epitopes are mounted, despite T-cell depletion, in both critical and non-critical patients during the first week after symptom onset. Since the frequency of SC2-unique TCRs was significantly lower in our study samples at that time, we deduced that the depth of CoV-common TCR repertoires was higher in the first week due to more rapid clonal expansion of pre-existing cross-reactive memory CD8+ T cells. Thus, if an individual has encountered common cold coronaviruses before, memory CD8+ T cells are formed and may be the first to respond upon reactivation with CoV-common epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 while <italic>de novo</italic> induced SC2-unique CD8+ T-cell immunity has not been developed yet. This explanation falls in line with previous reports where T cells recognizing SARS-CoV and seasonal coronaviruses were found to be cross-reactive to SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Braun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Lineburg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Mateus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Nesterenko et al., 2021</xref>). Alternatively, individuals may have had previously developed cross-reactive CoV-common CD4+ T cells that might have facilitated more rapid CD8+ T cell development at the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, as has been recently demonstrated to be the case for antibody response to vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Elias et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P43">By the end of the second week after symptom onset, activation and expansion of SC2-unique TCRs seem to have occurred in non-critical patients despite T-cell depletion. This conclusion can be made since at week 2 but not week 1 we observed (1) a significant difference in the frequency of those TCRs between critical and non-critical patients; (2) no significant difference in the depth of SC2-unique and CoV-common repertoires and (3) increase in the median number of putatively recognized SC2-unique and CoV-common epitopes in non-critical patients. In contrast, critically ill patients experienced reduction in both the breadth of CoV-common and SC2-unique TCR repertoires and respective response diversities at this time. This disparity can partially be explained by lymphopenia which is known to be more pronounced in critical patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Tan et al., 2020</xref>) and seems to affect CD8+ T-cell population more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chen and John Wherry, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Previous research has provided evidence that T cells are dying during severe COVID-19 due to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">André et al., 2022</xref>), but the specificity of those T cells has not been addressed yet. We further speculate that during lymphopenia in critical patients, SARS-CoV-2 recognizing rather than any CD8+ TCRs might be specifically depleted. If random TCRs were dying, the breadth of SARS-CoV-2 TCR repertoires would not have decreased as specific TCRs constitute the minority of all unique TCRs in the repertoire. When longitudinal data were analyzed (8 weeks), a significant increase in the depth of SC2-unique TCR repertoires was also detected in critically ill patients, which is especially interesting in light of persisting T-cell depletion.</p><p id="P44">Overall, our findings align with previously proposed mechanisms of effective T-cell response development, where timely (within two weeks) activation and expansion of T cells allows control of the virus, corresponding to a milder form of COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Moss, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sette and Crotty, 2021</xref>). Conversely, if the activation and/or expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells is delayed, the virus multiplies unchecked, and the overactivated immune system results in inflammation worsening the symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Tan et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, we have observed the dominance of CD8+ T cells putatively recognizing SC2-unique rather CoV-common epitopes, which supports the previous report that in contrast to CD4+ T cells, most expanded CD8+ T cells did not cross-react with seasonal coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Ferretti et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, considering slight underrepresentation of SC2-unique epitopes in comparison to CoV-common in the trained TCRex models (19 SC2-unique vs 28 CoV-common), the dominance of SC2-unique TCRs in the evolution of T-cell response hints towards the relative immune response contribution of newly expanding T-cell clones compared to potentially pre-existing cross-reactive T cell clones in COVID-19 patients.</p><p id="P45">Despite the congruence of our results, they should be interpreted with caution: only 4 out of 8 critical and 2 out of 8 non-critical patients had the data available for both the first- and second-week post symptom onset, and among those, not everyone followed described group trends. For instance, half of the critical patients with continuous data (2 out of 4) demonstrated elevated CoV-common TCR frequency at week 2, which hints that even patients with the same disease severity do not have a uniform T-cell immune response to SARS-CoV-2. For example, while pre-existing cross-reactive CD8+ T-cells may provide clinical protection to some individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Mallajosyula et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Schulien et al., 2021</xref>), this protection has also been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chen and John Wherry, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Saggau et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sette and Crotty, 2020</xref>). In agreement with the latter outlook (detrimental role of T cells), we have observed that disease outcome was fatal in three critical patients who had reached the highest frequencies of CoV-common TCRs during the first two weeks of COVID-19.</p><p id="P46">The observed interpersonal variation in the CD8+ T-cell response within the same group in our dataset could also be attributed to the fact that current TCRex models do not cover the entire epitope space available to CD8+ T cells. It has been experimentally evaluated that every individual recognizes 17 MHC-I SARS-CoV-2 epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Tarke et al., 2021</xref>), which is more than was predicted with our recognition models. Hence, the magnitude of CD8+ T-cell response is likely to be underestimated in our analysis. Therefore, the response could become more uniform across patients once there is enough experimental data for more epitopes, and recognition models are built for them.</p><p id="P47">Another limitation inherent to the analysis of TCR repertoires from blood samples is that the migration of T cells from the circulation to tissues remains hidden. Consequently, the observed intragroup dissimilarities in SC2-unique TCR levels could be reflective of the differences in the distribution rather than in the speed of generation of the respective T cells. If the same number of SC2-unique T cells is generated equally promptly in both patient groups, but more of them are attracted to and retained at the site of the infection (lungs) in critical patients, our analysis cannot detect that. Further examination of TCR repertoires from recovered critical individuals could help shed light on this puzzle and reflect their potential to develop SC2-unique response more precisely.</p><p id="P48">Finally, it has been demonstrated that in case of some HLA-alleles, they strongly shape the response, resulting in a particular set of immunodominant T-cell epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Francis JM et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Lineburg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, our models will not suffice to track the response unless the models for those epitopes are available. However, there is evidence that multi-epitope T-cell response mitigates the effect of viral escape mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Redd et al., 2021</xref>). The broad and redundant response is more important for SARS-CoV-2 control than the recognition of particular epitopes in our observations as well. Thus, monitoring the TCR repertoire depth and breadth and response redundancy and diversity in infected, vaccinated and recovered individuals could be helpful to better assess current or future protection and the necessity for an additional intervention to prevent critical disease or preserve the protection against reinfection and emerging variants. <italic>In silico</italic> approach can be leveraged to extract information such as specificity faster and with more flexibility than <italic>in vitro</italic> testing. Accordingly, our study offers a generalizable computational framework that complements the current standard of antibody-based testing of COVID-19 immunity with TCR repertoire analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS94919-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d38aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Marianne Mangelschots, Sergio Garcia, Charlotte Drieghe, Cindy Van Hoyweghen and Niels Lonneville for excellent technical assistance.</p><sec id="S23"><title>Funding</title><p>Flemish Government under the ‘Onderzoeksprogramma Artificiele Intelligentie (AI) Vlaanderen’ program.</p><p>University of Antwerp Methusalem Funding.</p><p>Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) 1S38721N, 1S38723N to AP.</p><p>Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) 1861219N to BO.</p></sec></ack><sec id="S24" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p id="P49">The publicly available raw TCR sequencing data analyzed in this study were downloaded from iReceptor Gateway [https://gateway.ireceptor.org/login].
