<abstract>
<p id="P1">The main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) of SARS-CoV-2 is a validated antiviral drug target. Several M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors have been reported with potent enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity, including GC376, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, each containing a reactive warhead that covalently modifies the catalytic Cys145. In this study, we report an expedited drug discovery approach by coupling structure-based design and Ugi four-component (Ugi-4CR) reaction methodology to the design of non-covalent M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors. The most potent compound <bold>23R</bold> had cellular antiviral activity similar to covalent inhibitors such as GC376. Our designs were guided by overlaying the structure of SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> + ML188 (R), a non-covalent inhibitor derived from Ug-4CR, with the X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> + calpain inhibitor XII/GC376/UAWJ247. Binding site analysis suggests a strategy of extending the P2 and P3 substitutions in ML188 (R) to achieve optimal shape complementary with SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>. Lead optimization led to the discovery of <bold>23R</bold>, which inhibits SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> and SARS-CoV-2 viral replication with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.31 μM and EC<sub>50</sub> of 1.27 μM, respectively. The binding and specificity of <bold>23R</bold> to SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> were confirmed in a thermal shift assay and native mass spectrometry assay. The co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> with <bold>23R</bold> revealed the P2 biphenyl fits snuggly into the S2 pocket and the benzyl group in the α-methylbenzyl faces towards the core of the enzyme, occupying a previously unexplored binding site located in between the S2 and S4 pockets. Overall, this study revealed the most potent non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors reported to date and a novel binding pocket that can be explored for M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor design.</p>

<p id="P2">The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on global economy and public health, and there is an urgent need for therapeutic interventions. Encouraging progress has been made in developing mRNA vaccines including the Pfizer BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273. For small molecule antivirals, the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir gained FDA approval on Oct 22<sup>nd</sup> 2020. The combination therapy of remdesivir with a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor baricitinib also received the FDA emergency use authorization<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Among the other drug targets being explored at different stages of preclinical and clinical developments<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>, the viral main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>), also called 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL<sup>pro</sup>), is one of the most extensively explored high profile antiviral drug targets<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. M <sup>pro</sup> is a cysteine protease encoded in the viral polyprotein as non-structural protein 5 (Nsp5) that cleaves the viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab at more than 11 sites. Despite its multiple proteolytic sites, M<sup>pro</sup> was shown to have a high substrate specificity of glutamine at the P1 position<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. As such, the majority of the reported M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors were designed to contain a 2-pyrrolidone at the P1 substitution as a mimetic of the glutamine in the substrate<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. Most advanced M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors including PF-073048146, GC376<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup> and 6j<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup> all belong to this category. PF-07304814, an α-hydroxyl ketone prodrug, is being developed by Pfizer, which has optimal pharmacokinetic properties in humans and recently entered human clinical trials<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. GC376 has <italic>in vivo</italic> antiviral efficacy in treating cats infected with lethal feline infectious peritonitis virus<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. Recently, the GC376 analog 6j was shown to protect mice from MERS-CoV infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. These promising results highlight the translational potential of M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors as potent SARS-CoV-2 antivirals and validate M<sup>pro</sup> as an antiviral drug target for coronaviruses.</p>
<p id="P3">Drug discovery is a lengthy process, which involves iterative cycles of design, synthesis, and pharmacological characterization. In the event of COVID-19 pandemic, an expedited approach with a fast turnover of this development cycle is highly desired. Using SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> as a drug target, we report herein a fast-track drug discovery approach by coupling structure-based drug design and the Ugi four-component reaction (Ugi-4CR) methodology to the design of non-covalent M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors. Specifically, through a screening of a focused library of protease inhibitors, we recently discovered several non-canonical SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors including boceprevir, and calpain inhibitors II and XII<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. These inhibitors differ from classic M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors such as GC376 in that their P1 substitution does not contain a glutamine mimetic. The co-crystal structures of calpain inhibitors II and XII with SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> revealed a critical hydrogen bond between the methionine side chain from calpain inhibitor II and pyridinyl substitution from calpain inhibitor XII with the H163 side chain imidazole located at the S1 pocket<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. Similarly, the carbonyl from the pyrrolidone in GC376 also forms a hydrogen bond with the H163 side chain imidazole<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. Given the importance of this hydrogen bond with H163 for the high affinity binding of inhibitors to SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>, we hypothesize that non-covalent inhibitors without a reactive warhead targeting the Cys145, but retain the hydrogen bond capacity with H163 can be designed as potent SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors. In this study, we report the structure-based design of non-covalent M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors based on the overlaying structures of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> in complex with existing inhibitors or the peptide substrate. The design was based on the scaffold of ML188 (R)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>, a non-covalent SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor, which similarly contains a pyridinyl in the P1 substitution as calpain inhibitor XII. The overlaying structures revealed a strategy of extending the P2 and P3 substitutions in ML188 (R) to occupy the extra space in the S2 and S3/S4 pockets of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> in order to increase the binding affinity. The most potent inhibitor from this study <bold>23R</bold> showed enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity similar to the covalent inhibitor GC376. Its mechanism of action was characterized in the thermal shift-binding assay, native mass spectrometry binding assay, and enzyme kinetic studies. An X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M <sup>pro</sup> in complex with <bold>23R</bold> was solved, revealing a previously unexplored binding site in between the S2 and S4 pockets. Overall, this study led to the identification of the most potent non-covalent M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor <bold>23R</bold> with potent enzymatic inhibition and <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular antiviral activity with a novel mechanism of action.</p>

<title>Rational design of non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors</title>
<p id="P4">Among the non-canonical SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors we recently discovered, calpain inhibitor XII has an unexpected binding mode showing an inverted conformation in the active site<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Instead of projecting the norvaline and leucine side chains into the S1 and S2 pockets as one would expect from its chemical structure, the pyridinyl substitution snuggly fits in the S1 pocket and forms a hydrogen bond with the H163 imidazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). This hydrogen bond is essential, as replacing the pyridine with benzene led to an analog UAWJ257 with a significant loss of enzymatic inhibition<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. Examining the X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> in the PDB database revealed another compound ML188 (R)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>, which shares a similar binding mode with calpain inhibitor XII. ML188 (R) is a non-covalent SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor derived from a high-throughput screening hit<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. The pyridinyl from ML188 (R) similarly fits in the S1 pocket and forms a hydrogen bond with the H163 side chain imidazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In addition, the furyl oxygen and its amide oxygen both form a hydrogen bond with the G143 main chain amide amine. ML188 (R) was reported to inhibit the SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.5 ± 0.3 μM and the SARS-CoV viral replication in Vero E6 cells with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 12.9 μM<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. Several follow up studies have been conducted to optimize the enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity of this series of compounds, however, no significant improvement has been made<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">The similar binding mode of ML188 (R) with calpain inhibitor XII, coupled with the convenient synthesis through the one pot Ugi-4CR, inspired us to design non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors based on the ML188 (R) scaffold. Specifically, we leverage our understanding of the M<sup>pro</sup> inhibition mechanism based on the X-ray co-crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> with multiple inhibitors to guide the lead optimization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2a-d</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. Overlaying the X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> + ML188 (R) (PDB: 3V3M) and the SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> H41A mutant + the peptide substrate (PDB: 2Q6G) revealed that the furyl, 4-<italic>tert</italic>-butylphenyl, pyridinyl, and <italic>tert</italic>-butyl of ML188 (R) fit in the S1’, S2, S1, and S3 pockets respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2a and 2d</xref>). Therefore, the furyl, 4-<italic>tert</italic>-butylphenyl, pyridinyl, and <italic>tert</italic>-butyl substitutions in ML188 (R) were defined as P1’, P2, P1, and P3, respectively. Next, overlaying the structure of SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> + ML188 (R) (PDB: 3V3M) and SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> + GC376 (PDB: 6WTT) suggested that the <italic>tert</italic>-butyl at the P3 substitution of ML188 (R) can be extended to fit in the S4 pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2b and 2d</xref>). Previous structure-activity relationship studies of GC376 indicate that P4 substitution is important, while P3 substitution does not contribute significantly to the binding affinity, as it is solvent exposed<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Similarly, the overlaying structures of SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> + ML188 (R) (PDB: 3V3M) and SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> + UAWJ247 (PDB: 6XBH) suggested that the 4-<italic>tert</italic>-butyl at the P2 substitution of ML188 (R) can be replaced by phenyl to occupy the extra space in the S2 pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2c and 2d</xref>). Overall, the design mainly focuses on extending the P2 and P3 substitutions of ML188 (R) to achieve optimal shape complementarity with the SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). In practice, we adopted a stepwise optimization procedure in which the P3 and P2 substitutions were optimized individually in step 1, and then the optimal P2/P3 substitutions were combined in step 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">Guided by the design rationale elucidated above, a focused library of ML188 analogs were designed and synthesized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). As the P1’ furyl and P1 pyridinyl both form a critical hydrogen bond with the M<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3a-b</xref>), the P1’ and P1 substitutions were kept with minimal variations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). All designed compounds were synthesized using the one pot Ugi four-component reaction and tested as enantiomer/diastereomer mixtures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). To circumvent the need of relying on expansive chiral HPLC column for the separation of enantiomers, we strategically introduced the chiral isocyanide so that the diastereomer product mixture can be separated by convenient silica gel column or reverse phase HPLC column purification.</p>

<p id="P7">In total, 39 compounds were synthesized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4a-4e</xref>) and all compounds were initially tested as a mixture of enantiomers or diastereomers in the FRET-based enzymatic assay against SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> at 20 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Compounds showing more than 50% inhibition at 20 μM were further titrated to determine the IC<sub>50</sub> values. Next, compounds with IC<sub>50</sub> values lower than 5 μM were selected for cellular cytotoxicity profiling in Vero E6 cells, the cell line which was used for the SARS-CoV-2 antiviral assay. The purpose was to prioritize lead candidates for the <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular antiviral assay with infectious SARS-CoV-2. Compounds with potent enzymatic inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> &lt; 5 μM) but moderate to high cellular cytotoxicity (CC<sub>50</sub> &lt; 100 μM) were labeled in red. Compounds with both potent enzymatic inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> &lt; 5 μM) and low cellular cytotoxicity (CC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 μM) were labeled in blue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4a-4e</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>, the majority of the designed compounds showed more than 50% inhibition when tested at 20 μM. Specifically, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>lists compounds with P4 variations. As a reference, ML188 (<bold>1</bold>) (racemic mixture) inhibits SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 10.96 ± 1.58 μM. It was found that compounds <bold>2</bold>, <bold>3</bold>, <bold>5</bold>, <bold>6</bold>, <bold>7</bold>, <bold>8</bold>, <bold>10</bold>, and <bold>13</bold> had improved enzymatic inhibition compared to ML188 (<bold>1</bold>). These results suggest that: a) isopropyl (<bold>2</bold>), cyclopropyl (<bold>3</bold>), cyclopentyl (<bold>5</bold>), cyclohexyl (<bold>6</bold>), and phenyl (<bold>7</bold> and <bold>8</bold>) are the more favorable substitutions at the P3 position than <italic>tert</italic>-butyl; b) compound <bold>13</bold> with the (<italic>S</italic>)-α-methylbenzyl substitution at the P3 position had improved potency, which suggests that extending the substitutions to the S4 pocket might improve the enzymatic inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Given the advantage of convenient separation of diastereomers over enantiomers, we therefore decided to fix the P3/P4 substitution as α-methylbenzyl substitution during the P2 optimization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). All compounds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>were designed to have extended substitutions at the 4-position of benzyl to occupy the extra space in the S2 pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Consistent with the design hypothesis, several compounds including <bold>14</bold>, <bold>17</bold>, <bold>18</bold>, <bold>19</bold>, <bold>20</bold>, <bold>21</bold>, and <bold>23</bold> had significantly improved enzymatic inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> &lt; 3 μM) compared to compound <bold>13</bold>. Replacing the <italic>tert</italic>-butyl in compound <bold>13</bold> with the bulkier trimethylsilyl led to compound <bold>14</bold> with a 2.9-fold increase in M<sup>pro</sup> inhibition. Cyclohexyl (<bold>17</bold>), thienyl (<bold>19</bold>), pyrrolyl (<bold>20</bold>), pyridinyl (<bold>21</bold>), and phenyl (<bold>23</bold>) were found to be the most favorable substitutions at the S2 pocket. Compound <bold>16</bold> with piperidyl substitution had similar potency as compound <bold>13</bold>, while compound <bold>15</bold> with O-<italic>tert</italic> butyl was less active. Further extending the substitution to benzyl led to compound <bold>22</bold> that was inactive, suggesting biphenyl might be the largest substitution that can be accommodated at the S2 pocket.</p>
<p id="P8">The P1’ and P1 substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4c and 4d</xref>) were chosen to retain the critical hydrogen bonds in ML188 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). It was found that imidazole (<bold>24</bold>) was tolerated at the P1’ position (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.96 ± 0.09 μM), followed by isoxazole (<bold>25</bold>) (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.47 ± 0.27 μM), and oxazole (<bold>26</bold>) (IC<sub>50</sub> = 4.97 ± 0.78 μM). Pyrazine (<bold>27</bold>) was tolerated at the P1 position (IC<sub>50</sub> = 4.93 ± 0.79 μM); however, pyrimidine (<bold>29</bold>) and imidazole (<bold>30</bold>) were not preferred (IC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 20 μM).</p>
<p id="P9">Next, the above identified favorable P1’, P2, P1, and P3/P4 substitutions were combined and the designed compounds were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>. Compounds <bold>36</bold>, <bold>37</bold>, and <bold>38</bold> were the most potent leads with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.81 ± 0.24, 0.67 ± 0.15, and 0.28 ± 0.07 μM, respectively.

<p id="P10">Among the active compounds with IC<sub>50</sub> value lower than 5 μM, compounds <bold>3</bold>, <bold>6</bold>, <bold>14</bold>, <bold>17</bold>, <bold>18</bold>, <bold>19</bold>, <bold>26</bold>, <bold>34</bold>, and <bold>36</bold> had moderate to high cellular cytotoxicity in Vero E6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4a-4e</xref>red), while compounds <bold>5</bold>, <bold>20</bold>, <bold>21</bold>, <bold>23</bold>, <bold>24</bold>, <bold>25</bold>, <bold>27</bold>, <bold>31</bold>, <bold>32</bold>, <bold>37</bold>, <bold>38</bold>, <bold>39</bold>, and <bold>40</bold> were well tolerated and the CC<sub>50</sub> values were greater than 100 μM.</p>
<p id="P11">Next, compounds with potent enzymatic inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> ≤ 1 μM) and low cellular cytotoxicity (CC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 μM) were prioritized for the cellular antiviral assay with infectious SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells using the immunofluorescence assay as the primary assay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). ML188 (<bold>1</bold>) was included as a control. It was found that ML188 (<bold>1</bold>) was inactive in the antiviral assay (EC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 20 μM), probably due to its incomplete inhibition of the M<sup>pro</sup> in the cellular content. Gratifyingly, compounds <bold>20</bold>, <bold>23</bold>, <bold>37</bold>, <bold>38</bold>, and <bold>40</bold> all had potent cellular antiviral activity with EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.82 to 4.54 μM. Compound <bold>24</bold> was less active (EC<sub>50</sub> = 13.06 ± 2.30 μM), possibly due to the poor cellular membrane permeability.</p>
<p id="P12">Given the potent antiviral activity and a high selectivity index of these potent lead compounds, we then selected compound <bold>23</bold> for further characterization. The two diastereomers of <bold>23</bold> were separated by reverse phase HPLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Both diastereomers were tested in the FRET-based enzymatic assay. GC376 was included as a positive control. It was found that <bold>23R</bold> is the active diastereomer with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.31 ± 0.04 μM, while the <bold>23S</bold> diastereomer was more than 16-fold less active (IC<sub>50</sub> = 5.61 ± 0.71 μM) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). The stereochemistry of <bold>23R</bold> was determined by the co-crystal structure with SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> as described in the following section. Compared with the parent compound ML188 (<bold>1</bold>), the optimized lead <bold>23R</bold> had more than a 35-fold increase in enzymatic inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>. Compound <bold>23R</bold> also showed comparable potency against SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.27 ± 0.03 μM. Neither ML188 (<bold>1</bold>) nor <bold>23R</bold> inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PL<sup>pro</sup>) (IC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 20 μM) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), suggesting the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> by <bold>23R</bold> is specific.</p>
<p id="P13">Next, the antiviral activity of <bold>23R</bold> was tested against SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 isolate) in Vero E6 cells using the immunofluorescence assay. ML188 (<bold>1</bold>) and GC376 were included as controls. It was found that compound <bold>23R</bold> had an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.27 μM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), which was similar to the antiviral potency of the covalent inhibitor GC376 (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.51 μM). Compound <bold>23R</bold> was also not cytotoxic to Vero E6 cells at up to 100 μM. In contrast, the parent compound ML188 (<bold>1</bold>) had no detectable antiviral activity when tested at up to 20 μM. To further confirm the antiviral activity of compound <bold>23R</bold>, we performed secondary antiviral assay in the human lung epithelial Calu-3 cell line, which endogenously expresses TMPRSS2 and is widely used as a physiological relevant cell line for SARS-CoV-2 infection. It was found that compound <bold>23R</bold> inhibited SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 isolate) replication in Calu-3 cells with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 3.03 μM and it was not cytotoxic at up to 100 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). The 2.4-fold difference in antiviral potency between the Vero E6 and Calu-3 cell lines might due to differences in cell membrane permeability or metabolism.</p>

<title>X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> with 23R</title>
<p id="P15">Using X-ray crystallography, we successfully determined the binding pose of <bold>23R</bold> with SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> at 2.6 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a</xref>). Electron density reveals the body of <bold>23R</bold> extends throughout the substrate binding channel, with side chains occupying the S1’, S1, S2, and S3 sub-pockets. The binding pose is similar to the previously solved structure of SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> with ML188 (R) (PDB: 3V3M)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>, consistent with the similarities between the two compounds and between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8b</xref>). The furyl moiety of <bold>23R</bold> binds to a portion of the P1’ site, which normally accommodates small hydrophobic residues. While the furylamide carbonyl group of <bold>23R</bold> does not insert into the oxyanion hole, it does form a bifurcated hydrogen bond with the apical residue of this oxyanion hole, Gly143. However, the furan ring oxygen is likely a weaker hydrogen bond acceptor than the amide oxygen and it lies outside of the plane of Gly143’s amide NH. Directly attached to the furylamide moiety is a P2 biphenyl group and a P1 pyridinyl ring. The P2 biphenyl group projects directly into the S2 pocket, which prefers hydrophobic residues such as leucine and phenylalanine. As expected, the P1 pyridinyl ring occupies the S1 pocket, which is known for its strict preference for glutamine. While most M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors bear a pyrrolidinone glutamine mimetic at the P1 position, we determined that more hydrophobic residues can also bind to the S1 site, and that hydrogen bond formation with His163 is critical for inhibition<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. In this instance, the pyridinyl ring of <bold>23R</bold> is nearly superimposable with the same moiety from calpain inhibitor XII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>) forming a close (2.9 Å) hydrogen bond with His163. An amide bond connecting the pyridinyl ring to the α-methylbenzyl moiety forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain of Glu166. The benzyl ring of the α-methylbenzyl moiety is partially positioned both in the S2 and S3 pockets, a novel binding pose that has not been observed with existing M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors. Normally, a substituent at this position would be expected to flip away from the enzyme core towards the solvent-exposed S3 pocket, which explains why P3 substitutions have little to no influence on the enzymatic inhibition<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. However, the hydrophobic nature of the benzyl ring in <bold>23R</bold> causes it to project towards the core near the S2 pocket, forcing Gln189 to rotate outwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8d</xref>). This conformation is reinforced by pi-stacking interactions with the first phenyl of the biphenyl substituent. Notably, the binding pose of <bold>23R</bold> features continuous intramolecular pi-stacking, where the phenyl is sandwiched by furan and benzyl groups, potentially contributing to its potent inhibition of M<sup>pro</sup>. Meanwhile, the S4 pocket remains largely unoccupied by <bold>23R</bold>, leaving room for further improvement. In summary, the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> in complex with <bold>23R</bold> revealed two interesting structural features: 1) The P2 biphenyl is probably the largest substitution that can be accommodated in the S2 pocket, which is consistent with our design hypothesis. 2) The benzyl group from the terminal α-methylbenzyl fits in a previously unexplored binding pocket located in between the S2 and S4 pockets. As such, the benzyl group faces towards the core of the enzyme instead of solvent-exposed as seen with other existing M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors. Although this is unexpected from the design perspective, this novel binding mode suggests that the new binding pocket in between S2 and S4 that can be explored for inhibitor design.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P16">Given the social and economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the need for effective therapeutics is apparent. Researchers around the globe are racing to come up with intervention strategies. The viral M <sup>pro</sup> is a high profile antiviral drug target and several M <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors are now in animal model studies and human clinical trial<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. Among the known M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors, the majority of them are covalent inhibitors such as GC376 analogs that contain a pyrollidone in the P1 position as a glutamine mimetic. Several structurally distinct compounds including ebselen, disulfiram, carmofur, PX-12, tideglusib, and shiknonin were claimed as M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>, but were later invalidated as promiscuous non-specific cysteine protease inhibitors<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. In addition, non-covalent inhibitors such as ML188 (R) were developed and validated as SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. Several follow up studies have been conducted to optimize the enzymatic potency of this series of compounds against SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> and the SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>. However, no significant improvement has been made and ML188 (R) remains the only non-covalent inhibitor with moderate antiviral activity against SARS-CoV (EC<sub>50</sub> = 12.9 ± 0.7 μM)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. Nevertheless, given the sequence and structure similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>, and the common binding mode of ML188 (R) and calpain inhibitor XII, we hypothesize that ML188 (R) is a promising scaffold for lead optimization. In this study, we developed an expedited drug discovery approach to the design of non-covalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>. The design was based on the binding pose of calpain inhibitor XII with SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> (PDB: 6XFN). The highlights of this study include: 1) The overlaying X-ray crystal structures with multiple M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors revealed the chemical space that can be explored for drug design. 2) All designed compounds were synthesized by the one-pot Ugi-4CR, which greatly facilitated the lead optimization. Indeed, we were able to improve the enzymatic inhibition potency by 35-fold from a focused library of 39 compounds. This is a significant advantage compared to covalent inhibitors such as GC376, which involves at least a five-step synthesis. 3) By introducing the chiral isocyanide, the diastereomer product can be conveniently separated by either silica gel column or reverse phase HPLC column, bypassing the need for an expensive chiral HPLC column. This greatly speeds up the co-crystallization. 4) The X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> in complex with <bold>23R</bold> reveals a new binding pocket in between S2 and S4 sites that can be explored for drug design. Overall, using the expedited drug discovery approach, this study revealed a promising non-covalent M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor <bold>23R</bold> with a confirmed mechanism of action and potent cellular antiviral activity for further development.</p>
