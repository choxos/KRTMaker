potential to significantly reduce the burden of medical device-associated infections. Since bacterial surface attachment is known to be sensitive to surface topography, we experimentally survey 2,176 combinatorially generated shapes using an unbiased high-throughput micro topographical screen on polystyrene. This identifies topographies that reduce colonization <italic>in vitro</italic> by up to 15-fold compared with a flat surface for both motile and non-motile bacterial pathogens. Equivalent reductions are achieved on polyurethane, a polymer commonly used in medical devices. Using machine learning methods, a set of design rules based on generalisable descriptors is established for predicting bacteria-resistant micro topographies. In a murine foreign body infection model, anti-attachment topographies are shown to be refractory to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and to recruit a productive host response, highlighting the potential of simple topographical patterning of non-eluting implants for preventing medical device associated infections.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Infections caused by formation of bacterial biofilms on the surfaces of implanted medical devices lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality and constitute a global challenge for the healthcare sector.

Consequently, large diversity screening approaches to identify cell-instructive polymers for a range of biological applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> Successful approaches include identification of polymers for stimulating stem cell proliferation and phenotype control in regenerative medicine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> immune cell instruction for implant device control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and microbial biofilm controlling polymers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> Strongly predictive relationships linking molecular descriptors to biological responses have subsequently been identified, allowing the design of polymer chemistries with improved resistance to biofilm formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">In addition to materials chemistry, topography can strongly influence cellular responses to surfaces, with nano and micro topographic cues being successfully used to control human stem cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and immune cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> marine biofouling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and bacterial surface colonization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> Despite many studies, the lack of a general description of topography and its influence on cellular responses hinders the rational design of textured biomaterials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> Consequently, to identify design rules for topographical control of bacterial responses to surfaces beyond simple geometries or isolated bioinspired topographical designs, we applied an unbiased screen to investigate combinatorially generated shapes using an unbiased high-throughput micro topographical polymer chip screen that has previously been applied to human mesenchymal stromal cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup></p><sec id="S1"><title>The library of micro topographies</title><p id="P6">To sample a large range of topographical designs, topographies were comprised of primitives (circles, triangles and rectangles) combined in an algorithm-based approach, which were arrayed to form 300 μm square Topounits separated from each other by 40 μm high walls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> Two replicates of 2,176 different features were thermally embossed from a silicon master as 10 μm high shapes on each polystyrene TopoChip (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Micro topographical control of bacterial attachment</title><p id="P7">The screening methodology for measuring the attachment of representative Gram-negative (<italic>Pseudomonas_aeruginosa</italic>) and Gram positive (<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) bacterial pathogens to the different Topounits is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>. A 4 h incubation time and static conditions at 37°C was found to provide a sufficiently stringent assay for the identification of topographies with low and high initial bacterial cell attachment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3</xref>). <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> attachment to each Topounit on the polystyrene TopoChip (n = 22) revealed a wide range of bacterial attachment to micro topographies, plotted in rank order in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>. For <italic>S. aureus</italic>, a similarly broad range of attachment was indicated by the fluorescence intensity differences observed using a separate rank order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>). Comparison of the response to the two pathogens for all Topounits revealed a surprisingly good correlation, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>, suggesting a common attachment response between two quite different bacterial species, one motile (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>) and the other non-motile (<italic>S. aureus</italic>). Interestingly, most micro-patterns on the polystyrene TopoChip showed reduced bacterial attachment with respect to the flat control, especially for <italic>S. aureus</italic> where only ∼4% of the topographies exhibited increased cell attachment compared to flat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>). These findings suggested that by modifying surfaces with appropriate micro topographies, early cell attachment could be prevented and hence biofilm formation after longer incubation times.</p><p id="P8">By visual inspection of the high and low-adhering topographies, it appeared that fewer bacterial cells attached to topographies with small gaps between the Topo features (see examples of anti- and pro-attachment Topounits in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2a</xref>). This was unexpected since the presence of narrow grooves and cavities has been shown to support bacterial retention on surfaces under static growth conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> To elucidate the critical elements of the Topounit shapes from this rich library, we turned to machine learning to extract generalisable design rules.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Micro topographical design rules for bacterial attachment</title><p id="P9">Mathematical descriptors for the topographical shapes were created by co-opting the cell shape analysis functions of the widely used CellProfiler and ImageJ software packages, 242 shape descriptors were obtained from the analysis of the Topounit designs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> Those with Pearson correlations above 0.85 were removed to eliminate co-variant descriptors, resulting in 68 that were used to train models of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> attachment.

The Random Forest machine learning regression algorithm was used to identify correlations between the topographic descriptors and bacterial attachment to the Topounits, generating high values for the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) and low error values.

The models were trained using the most significant surface parameters identified by the descriptor selection method SHAP. The most important descriptors for predicting bacterial attachment were the total area of the topographical features (feature coverage), the size of the spaces between objects (defined using the radii of inscribed circles illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1b</xref>), and the radii of the maximum features. The topographical feature area was reflected in the model by a correlation with low bacterial attachment with both the pattern feature coverage and the maximum feature area within the unit cell in which the features are arranged. To extract design rules from the ML model, we plotted the individual top predictive descriptors in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4a</xref> which indicate that the lowest <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> attachment is associated with topographies with feature coverage &gt; 0.5, maximum <italic>inscribed circle radius</italic> ≤ 3 μm, although unique solutions were not found for maximum feature radius alone. For <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the lowest attachment was associated with feature coverage &gt; 0.4 and <italic>maximum inscribed circle radius</italic> ≤ 3 μm.</p><p id="P11">The strong correlation of low attachment with the proportion of the surface covered with features and radius partnered with the negative correlation with the measurement of the trough dimensions (maximum inscribe circle radius), are powerful. These observations form the basis for design rules that can be used to develop biofilm resistant surfaces primarily describing the size of the elevated features (<italic>feature coverage</italic> and <italic>maximum feature radius</italic>) and the gaps between them (<italic>maximum inscribed circle</italic>).</p><p id="P12">Previously, the Engineered Roughness Index (ERI) calculated from micro topography dimensions, has been proposed by Schumacher et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> to describe the decrease in microbial attachment for marine microorganisms (Ulva spore settlement) from a series of 4 pattern types and smooth silicone surfaces. The ERI encompasses three variables associated with the size, geometry, and spatial arrangement of the topographical features: Wenzel’s roughness factor (r) which is the ratio of the actual surface area to the projected planar surface area, multiplied by the depressed surface fraction (fD), and divided by the number of degrees of freedom for movement (df). Notably, these elements are similar to the dominant descriptors in the model generated by ML from our topography library, i.e. parameters representing the area of features and the depressed areas between them. We calculated the ERI for all our topographies and plotted the relationship with bacterial attachment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2i and 2j</xref> for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and S. <italic>aureus</italic> respectively. It is clear that the trends observed confirm the hypothesis of Schumacher et al. that topographical patterns with higher roughness indexes reduce bacterial attachment and a non-linear relationship exists. However, the lower R<sup>2</sup> values compared to our ML derived models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2a and 2e</xref>) indicate that the fit and therefore model is inferior likely due to the increased number of relevant topography description terms the ML model has identified.</p><p id="P13">The best performing micro topography from the Schumacher study was the bioinspired Sharklet pattern which they went on to test against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> Comparable wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> data are not available on Sharklet, but for <italic>S. aureus,</italic> this surface in silicone was shown experimentally to provide a 67% reduction which is surpassed by our best performing topographies presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2h</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Micro topographical performance is independent of pathogen, growth environment and material</title><p id="P14">Based on the screening data obtained from quantification of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> attachment to polystyrene Topounits, those exhibiting a 5 to 20-fold reduction in bacterial attachment compared with a flat control surface (anti-attachment Topounits) were chosen for further study. To compare bacterial responses to these topographies with other patterned surfaces, pro-attachment Topounits with similar attachment to those of flat controls were selected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>).

(Unadkat et al, 2011) Micro-pillars were constructed from three different microscale primitive shapes: circles, triangles and rectangles (3 μm widths). Topographies were assembled as periodical repetitions of the features within 290 × 290 μm micro-wells (TopoUnits - Topounits) surrounded by 40 μm tall walls in a 66 x 66 array containing duplicate Topounits for each topography together with flat control surfaces. TopoChips were fabricated on a 2 × 2 cm<sup>2</sup> chip divided into four quadrants as previously described.(Unadkat et al, 2011) Briefly, the inverse structure of the topographies was produced in silicon by standard photolithography and deep reactive etching. A mould fluorosilane release agent, trichloro (1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorooctyl) silane (Sigma Aldrich) was applied using vapour deposition. This silicon mould was then used to make a positive mould in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) from which a second negative mould in OrmoStamp hybrid polymer (micro resist technology Gmbh) was fabricated. This served as the mould for hot embossing polystyrene (PS) (DSM), polyurethane (PU) (Elastollan, GoodFellow) and cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) GoodFellow films to produce TopoChips with 3 different chemistries. After fabrication the arrays were subjected to oxygen plasma etching. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref> shows examples of Topounits micro topographies. Each micro topography was assigned a feature index (FeatIdx) number (from 1 to 2176).[<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bacterialweb.nottingham.ac.uk/node_list2/21005/">http://bacterialweb.nottingham.ac.uk/node_list2/21005/</ext-link>]</p><p id="P31">To ensure that the bacteria-material interactions observed were specifically dependent on surface topography, polystyrene TopoChips were analysed by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) together with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for quantitative elemental analysis. A low level of mould release agent (F = 2 at%) was found to be transferred to the surface by the Topounit production process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1a</xref>) which was unavoidable due to the moulding requirements. It is clear from the chemical images that this is distributed unevenly according to the specific topography, which would be problematic since it would provide uneven chemistry from one Topounit to another, but the oxygen etching used initially to increase mammalian cell attachment was found to provide a uniform distribution within (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1b</xref>) and between samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1c</xref>). The Topochips were therefore deemed suitable for investigating response to the micro topographies since the while the chemistry was not pure oxygen etched polystyrene, it was the same on each unit.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Surface chemical analysis</title><p id="P32">The surface chemistry of the TopoChips was assessed using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). ToF-SIMS measurements were conducted on an ION-ToF IV instrument using a monoisotopic Bi<sub>3<sup>+</sup></sub> primary ion source operated at 25 kV and in `bunched mode´.

CasaXPS (version 2.3.18dev1.0x) software was used for quantification and spectral modelling.

Static incubation was selected for screening experiments as this produced consistent bacterial attachment while reducing the formation of biofilm streamers on TopoChip corners which can induce cross contamination of Topounits under flow (Rusconi et al., 2010). At specific time points, TopoChips were removed and washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 to remove loosely attached cells. After rinsing with distilled water, attached cells were stained with Syto9 (50 μM; Molecular Probes, Life Technologies) for 30 min at room temperature. After staining, TopoChips were rinsed with distilled water, air-dried and mounted on a glass slide using Prolong antifade reagent (Life Technologies). The viability of attached cells was evaluated by fluorescent staining with the LIVE/DEAD® BacLight™ bacterial viability kit (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>TopoChip imaging and data acquisition</title><p id="P34">TopoChips were imaged using a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 CMOS camera and a motorized stage for automated acquisition. A total of 4,356 images (one per Topounits) were acquired for each chip using a 488 nm laser as light source. Since the bacterial cells may attach at different heights on the micro-patterns, images were initially acquired as 50 μm range Z-stacks (2 μm steps - 25 slides) from the Topounits using a 40× objective (Zeiss, LD Plan-Neofluar 40×/0.6 Korr Ph 2 M27). Although this method facilitates capture of the total fluorescence emitted by bacteria attached to the topographies, it significantly increased scanning times and file sizes (∼460 GB per chip). Hence, a lower ×10 magnification lens (Zeiss, EC Plan-Neofluar 10×/0.30 Ph 1) was routinely used as it provided sufficient depth resolution for capturing the total fluorescence per Topounits. This enabled the use of the auto-focus function, which considerably reduced scanning times and file sizes per TopoChip. Cropping the images into a smaller field of view (247 μm x 247 μm) and omitting the walls of the micro-wells reduced the artefacts arising from bacterial attachment to the walls and further improved the auto-focus function.</p><p id="P35">To identify out-of-focus images from each TopoChip dataset, individual topographical images were combined into composites using open source Fiji-ImageJ 1.52p software (National Institutes of Health, US).

The fluorescence intensity was established to correlate with the number of attached fluorescent bacteria, as shown previously (Hook et al., 2012). It was therefore used as the dependent variable in the models.

The Random Forest module was used with default parameters in Python 3.7. Bootstrapping without replacement was used to define training and test sets for 50 model runs. Seventy percent of each bacterial attachment dataset was used to train the model, and 30% were kept aside to determine the predictive power of the model.
