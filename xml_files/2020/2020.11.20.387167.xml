By imaging single-cell ERK activity dynamics in MCF10A acini, we find that these fates depend on the average frequency of non-periodic ERK pulses. High pulse frequency is observed during initial acinus growth, correlating with rapid cell motility. Subsequent decrease in motility correlates with lower ERK pulse frequency and quiescence. Later, during lumen formation, coordinated ERK waves emerge across multiple cells of an acinus, correlating with high and low ERK pulse frequency in outer surviving and inner dying cells respectively. Optogenetic entrainment of ERK pulses causally connects high ERK pulse frequency with inner cell survival. Acini harboring the PIK3CA H1047R mutation, commonly observed in breast cancer, display increased ERK pulse frequency, inner cell survival and loss of lumen formation. Thus, fate decisions during acinar morphogenesis are fine-tuned by different spatio-temporal coordination modalities of ERK pulse frequency.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Mammary organogenesis involves formation of a rudimentary gland during embryogenesis, followed by proliferation and branching invasion led by multi-layered terminal end buds (TEBs) during puberty. Cells in the inner TEB layers then undergo apoptosis to form the ductal lumen. During pregnancy, secretory alveoli are then formed at the ends of the ductal tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Inman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Paine and Lewis, 2017</xref>). Morphogenesis of this complex structure requires spatial and temporal control of cell fates such as proliferation, survival, migration and death. However, the spatio-temporal signaling events that regulate such fate decisions remain poorly explored. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) – mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade, that ultimately leads to activation of the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) is a key pathway involved in mammary gland development. EGFR-ERK signaling results in the upregulation of gene products involved in a wide variety of processes such as proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Lavoie et al., 2020</xref>). EGFR activity is required for mammary gland morphogenesis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Sebastian et al., 1998</xref>). Paracrine amphiregulin release by the matrix metallo-protease (MMP) ADAM-17 and its binding to EGFR mediates the effects of estrogen receptor α to promote mammary gland development and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ciarloni et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Sternlicht et al., 2005</xref>). EGFR-dependent ERK activity is enriched at the front of elongating tubes and coordinates cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Huebner et al., 2016</xref>). In 3D mammary acini, oncogenic ERK activation suppresses apoptosis and thus lumen formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Reginato et al., 2005</xref>). In primary mammary cell culture, ERK activity is also crucial for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Finlay et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Recent single-cell measurements of ERK activity dynamics in a variety of 2D epithelial monolayer cultures have revealed the existence of non-periodic ERK pulses of constant amplitude and duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aikin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Albeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gagliardi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Goglia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hiratsuka et al., 2015</xref>). These ERK pulses originate from MAPK network properties such as ultrasensitivity (leading to steep ERK activation at a threshold EGFR input), and negative feedback (leading to ERK adaptation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kholodenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Sparta et al., 2015</xref>). An emerging theme is that the average frequency of these non-periodic ERK pulses, referred to as ERK frequency from now on, control apoptosis (low frequency), survival (medium frequency) or proliferation (high frequency) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Albeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gagliardi et al., 2021</xref>). These ERK pulses can either exhibit a stochastic spatially uncorrelated behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Albeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Goglia et al., 2020</xref>), or can be organized as wave patterns that regulate collective cell migration in a wound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Aoki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hiratsuka et al., 2015</xref>), cell survival around sites of apoptotic cell extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gagliardi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Valon et al., 2021</xref>), or extrusion of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aikin et al., 2020</xref>). These ERK signaling patterns consist of trigger waves that involve sequential activation of ERK pulses in adjacent epithelial cells through paracrine signaling involving MMP-mediated cleavage of pro-EGF ligands.</p><p id="P4">In this work, we explore single cell ERK dynamics in 3D mammary acini. Culturing mammary MCF10A cells in a basement membrane matrix (Matrigel) produces acini that retain key features of in vivo breast alveoli. Based on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Debnath et al., 2003</xref>), we subdivided this process into four stages as depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1A</xref>. Stage 1 is characterized by high proliferation rates and basement membrane deposition; stage 2 consists of a quiescent state and presence of an outer cell layer with clear basolateral polarity; stage 3 consists of apoptosis of inner cells that allows formation of a hollow lumen in stage 4. The whole process takes approximately two weeks.</p><p id="P5">We document different spatio-temporal modalities of ERK signaling during different developmental stages of MCF10A acini formation. Stage 1 is characterized by high ERK frequency, robust proliferation and rapid collective motility. This is followed by a transition to lower ERK frequency and slower collective motility. During stage 2, formation of ERK wave patterns correlates with domains of different ERK frequencies: outer/inner cells display medium/low ERK frequencies, respectively controlling survival and apoptosis. Optogenetic control of ERK signaling shows that ERK pulses control collective migration during stage 1, and that a critical ERK frequency is necessary for survival during stage 2. We characterize a crosstalk between phospho-inositide-3 kinase (PI3K) and MAPK/ERK signaling that feeds into the regulation of ERK frequency. This provides insight into how oncogenic PI3K signaling crosstalks with ERK to contribute to loss of lumen formation. Our work reveals how spatio-temporal control of ERK frequency organizes mammary acinar morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Stage 1 proliferative acini exhibit non-periodic MMP/EGFR-dependent ERK pulses whose frequency correlates with collective cell migration speed</title><p id="P6">To explore single-cell ERK dynamics during acinar morphogenesis, we created MCF10A reporter lines expressing the nuclear marker histone 2B (H2B) fused to miRFP703 with either the ERK activity biosensor ERK-KTR fused to mTurquoise2, or a mCherry-geminin S/G2/M cell cycle marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2017</xref>). ERK-KTR reports on ERK activity through reversible nucleus/cytosol shuttling after its phosphorylation by active ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Regot et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). These lines were then used to grow acini according to a modified version of a previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Debnath et al., 2003</xref>). After three days, in which EGF, serum and insulin were required for initial acinar growth, these growth factors (GFs) were removed to study ERK signaling dynamics intrinsic to acinar morphogenesis. Using the geminin marker and a fluorogenic caspase substrate, we evaluated if our protocol recapitulated the proliferation, quiescence and apoptosis fates previously documented during acinar morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1B-E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Debnath et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Stage 1 acini (4 days post-seeding) displayed elevated levels of proliferation and absence of apoptosis. Stage 2 and 3 acini (7 and 11 days post-seeding) revealed quiescent cells and increased apoptosis leading to lumen formation. Stage 4 acini (14 days post-seeding) exhibited a mature lumen, abundant apoptotic debris, and a small increase in proliferation.</p><p id="P7">We then imaged single-cell ERK dynamics in stage 1 acini using confocal spinning disk microscopy of both the H2B and ERK-KTR channels with time resolutions of 3 - 5 minutes, until acini started to suffer from phototoxicity (observed after 10 - 23 hours). Cells in stage 1 acini displayed asynchronous, non-periodic ERK pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) as observed in 2D culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aikin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Albeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gagliardi et al., 2021</xref>). To extract single-cell ERK activity trajectories, we used a customized version of the open-source LEVERJS software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Wait et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Winter et al., 2016</xref>) that segments and tracks nuclei based on H2B signal; and calculates ERK activity as a ratio of ERK-KTR fluorescence intensities in cytosolic and nuclear voxel masks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Detrending of the ERK trajectories and normalization of the values to [0,1] generated a reliable input for automated detection of ERK pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Single cell ERK trajectories revealed spontaneous ERK pulses with slightly different amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Trametinib-mediated MEK, gefitinib-mediated EGFR, as well as Batimastat-mediated MMP inhibition abolished ERK pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). MEK or EGFR inhibition for multiple days led to massive cell death and disintegration of the acini (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S2A</xref>), suggesting that ERK provides a pro-survival signal. Acute stimulation with 1 ng/ml EGF induced ERK pulses of amplitudes similar to those of spontaneous pulses, while 100 ng/ml EGF induced ERK pulses of higher amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). These results document spontaneous, asynchronous EGFR- and MMP-depedent ERK pulses in stage 1 acini.</p><p id="P8">As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), stage 1 acini displayed collective cell motility correlating with a rotational movement of 360 degrees of whole acini over multiple hours. Later during stage 1, we observed a transition to a state of slower motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Movie S1</xref>). This was shown to correlate with deposition of basement membrane around the acinus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). The reduction in migration speed correlated with decreased ERK frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Movie S2</xref>), without having a significant effect on ERK pulse amplitude and duration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S3B,C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Stage 2 quiescent acini exhibit different ERK frequencies in inner and outer cells, which emerges from collective waves of ERK pulses</title><p id="P9">We then evaluated ERK dynamics in larger, stage 2 quiescent acini that are characterized by an outer layer of polarized cells, and a less organized inner cell mass destined for apoptosis for future lumen formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Debnath et al., 2002</xref>). When comparing low-motility stage 1 and stage 2 acini, we observed a further reduction in median ERK frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), while ERK pulse amplitudes and durations remained almost identical (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S3B,C</xref>). This change in ERK frequency resulted from a bimodal distribution in which a part of the cell population did not display any ERK pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Because ERK pulse frequency can regulate proliferation, survival and apoptosis fates in MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aikin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Albeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gagliardi et al., 2021</xref>), and because inner cells in stage 2 acini are destined to undergo apoptosis, we evaluated ERK pulse frequencies in inner versus outer cells. Outer cells exhibited a significantly higher ERK frequency than inner cells, with the latter often not exhibiting ERK pulses at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Similar ERK activity amplitude and duration were found in inner/outer cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S3D,E</xref>). Together with our characterization of fate decisions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S1</xref>), these results suggest a spatio-temporal mechanism that controls survival versus apoptosis fates through regulation of ERK frequency.</p><p id="P10">A striking feature of stage 2 acini was that they exhibited spatially correlated ERK pulses in the form of waves spreading across multiple cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Movie S3</xref>). We devised computational methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S3F-H</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Materials and Methods</xref>) to detect, track, and extract features that describe ERK waves. These ERK waves were observed in all of the stage 2 acini that we imaged (N=11), and exhibited different geometries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). While some ERK pulses remained restricted to single cells, most of the ERK pulses occurred within collective waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). ERK waves typically involved a median of 6 cells for a median duration of 54 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). However, a large variance was observed with some ERK waves involving as little as 2 and as many as 39 cells (almost the whole acinus). ERK waves, as well as isolated ERK pulses, were predominantly initiated in the outer cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). Further, ERK waves that originated in the outer layer displayed a higher bias to remain at that location than those originating in inner cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>). We have previously shown that in 2D MCF10A cultures, as well as in acini, apoptotic cells trigger ERK waves in their neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gagliardi et al., 2021</xref>). However, the ERK waves we observed here only rarely coincided with apoptotic events, suggesting that they originate through a different mechanism. Our results strongly suggest that ERK waves contribute to spatially position different ERK pulse frequencies in inner and outer acinar cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Optogenetic control of ERK frequency regulates collective motility, survival and apoptosis fates</title><p id="P11">To explore the role of ERK pulse frequency during stage 1 collective motility, as well as stage 2 apoptosis and survival fates required for lumen morphogenesis, we used two optogenetic actuators to evoke different ERK pulse frequencies in acini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Optogenetic fibroblast growth factor receptor (optoFGFR) is a Cry2-based light-activatable receptor tyrosine kinase that activates ERK, Akt and calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). OptoRaf is a CIBN/Cry2-based system in which a catalytic Raf domain is recruited to a plasma membrane targeted anchor in a light-dependent fashion to specifically activate ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Aoki et al., 2017</xref>). We generated stable lines expressing any of the two optogenetic constructs, a spectrally compatible ERK-KTR-mRuby, and H2B-miRFP. Application of a single blue light pulse evoked a discrete optoFGFR- or optoRaf-mediated ERK pulse with similar shape and duration as spontaneous ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Since ERK pulse wave patterns can coordinate collective cell migration through regulation of myosin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Aoki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hino et al., 2020</xref>), we hypothesized that the asynchronous ERK pulses we observed might coordinate the collective motility pattern in stage 1 acini. We therefore sought to disrupt this process by synchronizing ERK pulses across all the cells of an acinus. We imaged rotating stage 1 acini for 4 hours in the absence of blue light, and observed asynchronous ERK pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). We then applied high frequency light pulses at 30 minute intervals, which synchronized ERK pulses across cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Movie S4</xref>). This switch to synchronous high-frequency ERK pulsing in all cells immediately resulted in decreased cell migration speed and persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-F</xref>). This suggest that the asynchronous high frequency ERK pulses organize collective cell migration in stage 1 acini.</p><p id="P13">Next, we tested the hypothesis that the different ERK frequencies observed between outer and inner cells in stage 2 acini regulate survival vs apoptosis cell fates. Using optoFGFR and optoRaf, we evoked frequency-modulated, population-synchronous ERK dynamics in all the cells of an acinus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Movie S5</xref>). Endogenous collective ERK pulses were however still occurring. Because the regulation of apoptosis/survival fates required for lumen formation spans over one week, we could not use our live cell imaging platform to study this process. We therefore used LITOS (LED Illumination Tool for Optogenetic Stimulation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Höhener et al., 2022</xref>) to evoke frequency-modulated ERK pulse regimes in multiwell plates in a tissue culture incubator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S4A</xref>). This system evoked similar ERK pulses as observed in our live cell imaging system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S4B</xref>). We then stimulated stage 2 acini with light pulses delivered at different frequencies for 7 days and scored the distribution of acini that exhibited filled lumen, partially cleared lumen or cleared lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Using both optoFGFR and optoRaf, we observed that ERK pulses induced every 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 but not 10 hours led to survival of inner cells, increasing the number of acini with filled or partially cleared lumina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). These results further suggest that survival and apoptosis fates are regulated by a frequency encoded ERK signal. The optoRaf experiments indicate that high frequency ERK pulsing alone is sufficient to induce survival independently of PI3K/Akt signaling.</p><p id="P14">Because endogenous ERK pulses occur on top of optogenetically-induced ones, we used optoFGFR to evoke different ERK pulse frequencies in EGFR-inhibited acini that do not exhibit spontaneous ERK pulses. Here, unstimulated acini and those stimulated every 10 hours displayed cell death. In marked contrast, ERK pulses applied at 0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4 hours led to cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). These results show that cells in acini must experience at least one ERK pulse every 4 hours to survive.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>ERK frequency but not integrated ERK activity regulates the survival fate</title><p id="P15">Next, we explored if the frequency of ERK pulses or the total integrated ERK activity over time controls survival. To test this, we used optoFGFR to induce synthetic ERK pulses of different widths, that when applied at different frequencies can evoke the same integrated ERK activity over a specific time period. Since ERK pulses display an identical shape and promote survival for 4 hours both in serum-deprived 2D monolayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gagliardi et al., 2021</xref>) and 3D acini, we first identified light stimulation schemes capable of inducing ERK pulses of different widths in monolayers. We applied a series of 1 to 86 successive blue light pulses delivered at 2-minute intervals, and recorded the resulting ERK dynamics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S4C</xref>). We have previously shown that light stimulation applied at this frequency leads to sustained optoFGFR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dessauges et al., 2021</xref>). The integrated ERK activity (area under the curve = AUC) displayed a linear relationship with the number of light pulses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S4D</xref>). 20 blue light pulses delivered every 2 minutes led to a single ERK pulse with a three-fold increase in integrated ERK activity. We then applied 2 distinct optoFGFR stimulation schemes consisting of 1 AUC equivalent of ERK activity evoked every 3 hours versus 3 AUC equivalents of ERK activity evoked every 9 hours, resulting in the identical integrated ERK activity over a period of 9 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). We found that the first but not second optogenetic stimulation scheme induced cell survival in serum-deprived 2D cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). We then performed the identical experiment in stage 2 acini by applying the two optogenetic stimulation schemes using LITOS for 7 days. Quantification of lumen formation efficiency at day 14 revealed increased inner cell survival when the first, but not the second, optogenetic stimulation scheme was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). These results show that the frequency of ERK pulses rather than the integrated ERK activity regulates survival.</p><p id="P16">Finally, we also used our optogenetic toolkit to explore a number of scenarios of how different ERK frequencies in inner/outer cells might be regulated in stage 2 acini.

Consistently, we found that H1047R PIK3CA MCF10A knock-in cells cultured as monolayers displayed higher median ERK frequency than their wild-type (WT) counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-C</xref>), while maintaining similar ERK pulse shape, duration and amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S6A,B</xref>). The finding of a similar ERK pulse shape in WT and mutant cells indicates that the PI3K to MAPK crosstalk must occur upstream of Ras because the MAPK network structure that shapes ERK dynamics is maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kholodenko et al., 2010</xref>). The increased ERK frequency suggests the involvement of receptor level interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Sparta et al., 2015</xref>). To better understand the effect of the PIK3CA H1047R on acinar morphogenesis, we evaluated proliferation and apoptosis during different stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E-I</xref>). Stage 1 mutant acini displayed increased proliferation compared to their WT counterparts, as evidenced by augmented cell numbers, and geminin quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E-G</xref>). While remaining slightly higher than in WT acini, proliferation also diminished during stages 2 - 4, but displayed a small upshoot during stage 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E,G</xref>). In contrast to the steep apoptosis rise observed starting on day 7 in WT acini, apoptotic rates remained lower in PIK3CA mutant acini at all stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E,H</xref>). Increased proliferation at stage 1, and decreased apoptosis at stages 3 and 4, thus mostly contribute to increased cell number and absence of lumen formation in PIK3CA-mutant acini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6I</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We then evaluated ERK dynamics during the pathological acinar morphogenesis induced by PIK3CA H1047R. As in monolayers, PIK3CA-mutant acini displayed ERK pulses like those of WT acini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Stage 1 rotating PIK3CA-mutant acini displayed ERK frequencies as high as those observed in their WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). However, stage 1 non-rotating PIK3CA-mutant acini did not display the decreased ERK frequency observed in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>).

However, most likely due to their heterogeneity, we could not pinpoint a specific feature of ERK waves associated with the increased ERK frequency observed in PIK3CA-mutant versus WT acini. PIK3CA-mutant stage 2 displayed higher ERK frequencies than WT acini, leading the inner cells of PIK3CA-mutant to exhibit a similar ERK frequency than the outer cells of WT acini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). Amplitude and duration of ERK pulses were similar for both WT and PIK3CA H1047R acinar cells at all stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S6C,D</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Pictilisib-mediated PI3K or AZD5363-mediated Akt inhibition decreased ERK frequency in both WT and mutant acini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). Stimulation of WT acini with insulin-like growth factor (IGF1), that primarily activates PI3K-Akt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Myers et al., 1993</xref>), also resulted in increased ERK pulse frequency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S7A,B</xref>). Gefitinib-mediated EGFR inhibition abolished ERK pulses in PIK3CA-mutant acini, suggesting an EGFR-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S7C</xref>). Batimastat-mediated MMP inhibition in PIK3CA H1047R cells led to reduction of ERK phosphorylation to levels observed in WT cells, without affecting Akt signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S7D</xref>). PIK3CA H1047R MCF10A cells have been shown to exhibit increased expression of the EGFR-ligand amphiregulin in comparison to WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Young et al., 2015</xref>), possibly explaining the increase in EGFR-dependent ERK frequency. Consistently, we observed increased amphiregulin expression at mRNA level in PI3K-mutant when compared with WT cells. Amphiregulin expression levels were were decreased upon pictilisib-mediated inhibition of PI3K activity in PIK3CA mutant cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S7E</xref>). Together, these results strongly suggest that the PI3K to MAPK/ERK crosstalk that regulates ERK frequency involves amphiregulin/MMP-activation of EGFR. Increased survival in PIK3CA H1047R acini might therefore involve increased ERK frequency through this crosstalk mechanism, in addition to PI3K-Akt signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">Recent work in epithelial monolayers have revealed the existence of non-periodic single-cell ERK pulses, whose frequency controls apoptosis, survival or proliferation fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Albeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gagliardi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Valon et al., 2021</xref>). At the level of a cell population, these ERK pulses can be stochastic when cells are stimulated with EGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Albeck et al., 2013</xref>), or can be organized as collective ERK waves during collective cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Aoki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hino et al., 2020</xref>), cancer cell extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aikin et al., 2020</xref>), or spatial regulation of survival in response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gagliardi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Valon et al., 2021</xref>). Here we show that similar ERK pulses/waves coordinate fate decisions during mammary acinar morphogenesis. As in the cell systems mentioned above, ERK pulses are triggered by MMP-mediated cleavage of pro-EGF ligands and subsequent activation of EGFR. Downstream of EGFR, MAPK network properties such as ultrasensitivity and negative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Huang and Ferrell, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kholodenko et al., 2010</xref>) might allow to translate minute amounts of MMP-cleaved pro-EGF into clear cut digital ERK pulses. Consistently, the slightly lower amplitude of spontaneous ERK pulses versus those induced by acute EGF stimulation suggests that the EGFR/MAPK system functions at the threshold input to generate digital ERK pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). This might allow the MMP/EGFR/MAPK signaling network to translate small variations in the EGFR input into frequency-modulated regimes of ERK pulses that can specify proliferation, survival and apoptosis. Note that exogenous addition of EGF impedes apoptosis-mediated lumen formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gaiko-Shcherbak et al., 2015</xref>), further suggesting that small amounts of EGFR ligands synthesized by the acinus itself are necessary for self-organisation of its morphogenesis. This MMP/EGFR/MAPK network has also been shown to produce ERK trigger waves in which activated cells sequentially switch on ERK pulses in adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Aoki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Boocock et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hino et al., 2020</xref>). Our results strongly suggest that the ERK waves observed in stage 2 acini rely on this mechanism. Thus, a relatively simple signaling network might allow to produce conserved and sophisticated ERK behaviors in epithelial collectives. This excitable MMP/EGFR/MAPK network that generates pulsatile ERK activity strongly contrasts with the oscillatory ERK behavior observed in the segmentation clock in vertebrate embryos that is regulated on slower timescales by rhythmic transcriptional regulation of MAPK phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hubaud and Pourquié, 2014</xref>). We speculate that the pulsatile MAPK network observed in epithelia provides an opportunity to constantly sense and react to environmental inputs such as growth factors and insults to warrant epithelial homeostasis during acinar development. This illustrates how the MAPK network can be differently wired to produce distinct ERK dynamics at different timescales depending on the developmental context.</p><sec id="S9"><title>ERK dynamics regulate collective migration and proliferation in stage 1 acini</title><p id="P21">We found that stage 1 acini displayed high frequency, asynchronous ERK pulses during rapid collective cell migration that leads to a global rotation behavior of the acinus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This rotation behavior has previously been implicated in the morphogenesis of spherical tissue buds during mammary organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Fernández et al., 2021</xref>). During migration of 2D epithelial sheets, ERK waves co-ordinate myosin activity necessary for collective motility, and are shaped by a mechanochemical feedback from myosin to ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Aoki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Boocock et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hino et al., 2020</xref>). Further, ERK also has been shown to control myosin activity in MCF10A acini single-cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Pearson and Hunter, 2007</xref>). We therefore propose that asynchronous ERK pulses spatially coordinate myosin contractility necessary for this collective motility behavior. This is consistent with our result that optogenetic synchronization of ERK pulses immediately leads to decreased collective motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-F</xref>). The transition to a state of slower motility in late stage 1 acini has been shown to result from assembly of an endogenous laminin-rich basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). We speculate that assembly of this basement membrane might modify the myosin-ERK mechanochemical feedback loop mentioned above, leading to decreased ERK frequency and motility, allowing to regulate the transition from proliferation to quiescence. Assembly of the basement membrane might therefore act as a checkpoint coordinating ERK frequency-dependent regulation of motility and transition from proliferation to quiescence. Future experimental/modeling studies will be necessary to further refine this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>ERK waves spatially regulate apoptosis and survival fates during stage 2 acinar lumen morphogenesis</title><p id="P22">Our experiments in stage 2 acini suggest that spatial control of different ERK frequencies regulates survival in outer versus apoptosis fates in inner acinar cells. Outer cells display a median ERK frequency of one pulse every 4 hours, while inner cells display lower ERK frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). This is consistent with the ability of one ERK pulse to provide about 4 hours of survival in MCF10A monolayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gagliardi et al., 2021</xref>). Using optogenetic control of ERK pulses, we excluded mechanisms such as differential growth factor receptor sensitivity or refractory time of inner and outer cells for regulation of different ERK frequencies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Text, Figure S5A,B</xref>). Instead, our results suggest a role for collective ERK waves to define the outer and inner spatial domains of high and low ERK frequency, that respectively specify survival and apoptosis fates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-I</xref>). ERK wave properties such as that they are initiated mostly in the outer layer, and propagate more efficiently in the outer versus the inner layer, might dynamically specify the two domains of ERK frequencies on timescale of hours throughout the 7 days of the acinus cavitation process. While apoptosis is predominantly responsible for the clearance of luminal cells in acini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Debnath et al., 2002</xref>), we cannot exclude that an alternative mechanism such as autophagy resulting from metabolic defects in inner cells, which is regulated by EGFR - PI3K signaling might also contribute to this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Schafer et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>ERK pulse frequency but not integrated activity regulates survival versus apoptosis fates</title><p id="P23">To formally test if ERK frequency regulates survival/apoptosis fates, we used optogenetic stimulation of all the cells of acini to causally link ERK frequency with lumen formation. When used to evoke ERK pulses for up to at least every 4 hours, both optoFGFR and optoRaf led to loss of lumen formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). ERK pulses evoked every 10 hours were not sufficient to rescue apoptosis. These experiments also functioned when EGFR was completely inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). By optogenetically varying the ERK pulse width, we also showed that ERK frequency rather than the integrated ERK activity over time regulates survival versus apoptosis fates, both in monolayers and in stage 2 acinus lumen formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E-G</xref>). Our data therefore suggests that short ERK pulses are the signaling unit that allows cells in acini to commit to survival for about 4 hours. This might allow cells to integrate signaling inputs that fluctuate on timescales of minutes/hours, to dynamically control a morphogenetic program on timescales of days. Interpretation of a specific ERK frequency into survival/apoptosis fates might involve the ERK substrate Bcl-2-like protein 11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Harada et al., 2004</xref>) or ERK-dependent transcriptional control of immediate early genes (IEGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Avraham and Yarden, 2011</xref>). IEGs produce transcripts with lifetimes of around 30 minutes, that encode proteins with lifetimes of 1-3 hours. Notably, IEGs include Jun and Fos transcription factors which are important regulators of cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Shaulian and Karin, 2001</xref>). IEG’s short lifetime is compatible with the ERK frequency required for survival. Higher ERK frequencies as observed in stage 1 acini might control proliferation by regulation of IEGs such as Fra-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gillies et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Oncogenic PI3K signaling modulates ERK frequency contributing to aberrant acinar morphogenesis</title><p id="P24">Our results show that the breast cancer relevant PIK3CA H1047R mutation increases ERK frequency, which might contribute at least in part to increased proliferation and survival leading to larger acini without lumen formation, that phenocopies ductal hyperplasia observed in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Tikoo et al., 2012</xref>). We show that this crosstalk from PI3K to ERK signaling feeds into the control of ERK frequency both in WT and PIK3CA H1047R monolayers and acini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S6-7</xref>). This crosstalk also functions downstream of IGF1, that primarily activates PI3K-Akt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Myers et al., 1993</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S7A,B</xref>), suggesting that it is a conserved feature downstream of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases. During stage 1, PIK3CA H1047R acini display similarly high ERK frequencies as in WT acini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). During stage 2, PIK3CA H1047R acini then still display a substantial decrease in ERK frequency as in WT acini compared to stage 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>), which correlates with decreased proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E-H</xref>). However, ERK frequencies remain slightly higher both in outer and inner cells in PIK3CA H1047R versus WT acini, correlating with the strong survival phenotype in inner cells, and absence of lumen formation. These results suggest that the control of ERK frequency is still subject to some degree of regulation even when the crosstalk from PIK3CA H1047R is constitutively switched on. Because the ERK pulse shape is identical in WT and PIK3CA mutant cells, this crosstalk must occur upstream of the core Raf/MEK/ERK circuit. Consistently, ERK activation is sensitive to both EGFR and MMP inhibition in PIK3CA H1047R cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S7C,D</xref>). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Young et al., 2015</xref>), our data strongly suggests that constitutive PI3K activity in PIK3CA H1047R cells leads to increased expression of the EGFR ligand amphiregulin that in turn might increase ERK frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Sternlicht et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S7E</xref>). PIK3CA H1047R also has been found to decrease expression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F (PTPRF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Young et al., 2015</xref>), which might further augment EGFR excitability and thus ERK frequency. Further work is required to elucidate the specific contributions of PI3K and ERK signaling to control the survival/apoptosis fate decisions and how the PI3K/ERK crosstalk might spatially fine tune ERK frequency.

To normalize this and to allow for quantitative comparison and visual representation with different cell ERK-KTR expression levels we computed a detrended and normalized ERK-KTR signal as follows. The signal S was first detrended by subtracting the median filter signal, <sup><italic>S<sub>d</sub></italic> = <italic>S</italic> − median_filter(<italic>S</italic>)</sup>. The signal was then normalized to the range [0,1] using <sup><italic>S<sub>nd</sub></italic> = <italic>S<sub>d</sub></italic> / max(<italic>S<sub>d</sub></italic>)</sup>, unless the signal range in the detrended trajectory was below an empirically set threshold. Inner and outer cells in stage 2 acini were identified visually based on the 3D reconstructions in LEVERJS.</p><p id="P39">For segmentation and quantification of steady state Z-stacks, CellProfiler 3.1.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">McQuin et al., 2018</xref>) with 3D functionalities was used. Nuclei were identified based on H2B-miRFP signals. Apoptotic debris were identified using Caspase 3/7 Green Detection kit signals using adaptive thresholding and watershed segmentation. Geminin-mCherry intensities were measured within nuclei voxel masks. ERK-KTR cytosolic/nuclear intensity ratios were generated by measuring median ERK-KTR intensities in the nuclear area and in a spherical voxel mask 1 pixel around the nuclear objects. Imaris software (Bitplane) was used for 3D rendering of confocal stacks and to track and measure motility parameters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Image analysis of 2D cell cultures</title><p id="P40">Nuclei of monolayer cells were segmented using Ilastik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Berg et al., 2019</xref>) and CellProfiler 3.0. Ilastik was used for training a random forest classifier on different pixel features of the H2B-miRFP channel and background pixels. The training data was generated by manual annotation of 20 - 50 cells. The resulting probability map was imported into CellProfiler for thresholding and segmentation. Cytosolic ERK-KTR fluorescence intensities were measured by expansion of the nuclear objects. Cells were tracked using μ-track 2.2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="P41">All analysis and visualization of ERK activity peaks and time series was performed with custom R/Matlab/Python code.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>ERK activity pulse detection</title><p id="P42">ERK activity peaks were identified and counted by the following steps. 1. Application of a short median filter to smooth the time series. 2. Application of a long median filter to produce a bias estimate which was subtracted from the smoothed time series. 3. Detrended time-series with real peaks were then identified by selecting those with an activity difference above an empirical threshold. Those were rescaled to [0,1] and a local maxima detection algorithm was used to identify peaks above an amplitude of 0.1.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Identification of collective events</title><p id="P43">To identify waves of collective ERK activation we developed a custom code and implemented it in R. The algorithm works on a binarised signal that is calculated by detrending and normalising ERK-KTR cytosolic/nuclear intensity ratio time series as described above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S3F,G</xref>). The algorithm searches for the first occurrence of cells with ERK switched on (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S3H</xref>). If several such cells exist and they are located within a threshold radius, they initiate the first collective event. A single active cell can also become a collective event. In the next time point, the algorithm repeats the search for active cells and compares their distances to cells in the previous frame. If new active cells are located within the threshold distance to active cells at the previous time point, they are added to respective collective events. If new active cells are located outside of the threshold distance, they form new collective events. This process of growing clusters of collective activity is repeated for all remaining time points. The resulting statistics include the total number of cells involved in a collective event, the duration and the average size of an event and the location (inner or outer layer) of the cells that initiates the event.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Immunoblotting and qPCR</title><p id="P44">Cells were plated into 6-well dishes (2 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) and cultured for 48h. The resulting cell monolayers were washed twice with room temperature PBS, then starving medium was added. For immunoblotting 1uL/mL DMSO or 10ug/mL Batimastat was added together with the starving medium and cells were further cultured for 72h. Media was removed, monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, whole cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dessauges et al., 2021</xref>).

Secondary IRDye680LT- or IRDye800CW-conjugated anti-species specific IgGs were from LI-COR. For qPCR cells were first starved for 24h, then fresh starving medium containing 1uL/mL DMSO or 2uM and 10uM pictilisib was added and cells were cultured for 24h. Media was removed, monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent. Reverse transcription was done with the ProtoScript II reverse transcriptase kit (Bioconcept, M0368L).
