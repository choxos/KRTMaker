<abstract>
<p id="P1">Effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is the utmost importance in the current world. More than 1 million deaths are accounted for relevant pandemic disease COVID-19. Recent data showed that D614G genotype of the virus is highly infectious and responsible for almost all infection for 2<sup>nd</sup> wave. Despite of multiple vaccine development initiatives, there are currently no report that has addressed this critical variant D614G as vaccine candidate. Here we report the development of an mRNA-LNP vaccine considering the D614G variant and characterization of the vaccine in preclinical trial. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) data with spike protein as probe and competitive neutralization with RBD and S2 domain revealed that immunization generated specific antibody pools against the whole extracellular domain (RBD and S2) of the spike protein. The anti-sera and purified IgGs from immunized mice on day 7 and 14 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in ACE2-expressing HEK293 cells in a dose dependent manner. Importantly, immunization protected mice lungs from pseudovirus entry and cytopathy. The immunologic responses have been implicated by a balanced and stable population of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells with a Th1 bias. The IgG2a to IgG1 and (IgG2a+IgG2b) to (IgG1+IgG3) ratios were found 1±0.2 and 1.24±0.1, respectively. These values are comparatively higher than relevant values for other published SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in development,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup> and suggesting higher viral clearance capacity for our vaccine. The data suggested great promise for immediate translation of the technology to the clinic.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">A new infectious corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) has been first reported from Wuhan, China in December, 2019 that causes COVID 19.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup> The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 a global public health emergency situation on February 5, 2020 after getting growing evidence of continuous person-to-person transmission.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup> The virus has been spread worldwide quickly, and consequently WHO has declared it pandemic in March 11, 2020. As of September 29, 2020, the pandemic has resulted in 1,007,887,415 deaths among over 33,630,004 patients in 215 countries, with a case-fatality rate of 3%.</p>
<p id="P3">There will be a risk of pandemic as long as there is COVID-19 epidemic situation in any area of the world unless people are properly vaccinated. Therefore, effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are immediately required to control morbidity and mortality related with COVID-19. Generally, non-replicating viral vectors, inactivated virus, DNA-based and protein-based vaccines have been the major approaches for the development of stable and effective vaccines; though they have their inherent limitations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup> Recently, mRNA-based vaccines have become a promising approach because of their opportunity for rapid development, comparative low dose, logical better safety profile, and low capital expenditure (CAPEX).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup> Several other leading vaccines under development against SARS-CoV-2 are also mRNA-based.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup> Lipid nanoparticle technology has been developed for effective delivery of single-stranded therapeutics like siRNA, antisense oligo, mRNA etc. The first RNA-LNP therapeutic was approved in 2018 and has set the example for clinical safety of LNP-formulated RNA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup> Therefore, we have also opted for mRNA-based LNP-mediated vaccine development technology to support the initiative for preventing the ongoing wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p id="P4">The candidate mRNA vaccine ‘BANCOVID’ is a LNP–encapsulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA–based vaccine that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein stabilized in its prefusion conformation. Coronaviruses have genetic proofreading mechanisms, and SARS-CoV-2 sequence diversity is comparatively low;<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup> though, natural selection can adopt rare but favorable mutations. Since the outbreak in China, SARS-CoV-2 has gone through numerous mutations. Among these, the D614G amino acid change in the spike protein of Wuhan reference strain is caused by an A-to-G nucleotide substitution at position 23,403 of the relevant nucleotide sequence. Currently, D614G is the most prevalent circulating isotype of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide (more than 95%).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup> To date, there is no published report about the D614G-relevant vaccine development. Few studies have shown that antibody generated using D614 variant-target did not show significant difference between D614 and G614 variants in terms of cellular entry.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup> These studies did not use G614-specific antibody, and applied artificial systems for characterizing relevant functional experiments. Furthermore, how G614 variant vaccine behave in immunization and what would be the impact of relevant antibody on SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Therefore, developing of G614 variant-specific vaccine is a prime importance, and warrant characterization. To address this, we have incorporated D614G variant-targeted nucleic acid sequence, as well as few other immunogen-enhancing aspects in our mRNA design consideration. In this study, we described the design and preclinical characterization of ‘BANCOVID’ mRNA-LNP vaccine candidate.</p>

<title>Target selection</title>
<p id="P5">As of March 27, 2020, there were 170 surface glycoproteins (partial and complete sequence) out of 1661 SARS-CoV-2 proteins posted on NCBI Virus database. A comparative sequence alignment using Clustal Omega (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/</ext-link>) showed differences in several regions, notably in position 614 (D&gt;G). A total of 15 glycine containing surface glycoprotein were found instead of aspartic acid. A consensus sequence from multiple sequence alignment was identified (data not shown) using EMBOSS Cons (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/emboss_cons/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/emboss_cons/</ext-link>) and selected as primary target sequence for vaccine development. Hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity plot analysis was performed using GENETYX Ver8.2.0, protein 3D modeling using Phyre216 and visualized using UCSF Chimera 1.11.2rc.17 Finally, D614G mutation and double proline (2P) mutations (K986P and V987P) were incorporated to the target sequence.</p>

<title>Safety and efficacy in mice</title>
<p id="P16">A total number of 50 BALB/c swiss albino mice (male and female) of 6-8 weeks old, were selected randomly and isolated 5 days before immunization. After careful observation and conditioning, 30 mice (15 males and 15 females) were taken to the experiment room for immunization and subsequent safety and efficacy analysis. 9 male mice were also separated for local tolerance testing. The temperature in the experimental animal room was 26 °C (±2 °C) and the relative humidity was 60±5%. The room was HVAC controlled ISO class 7 room with 70% fresh air intake and full exhaust. The mice were individually housed in polypropylene cage with individual water bottle, provided with 5 g of in-house mouse feed daily and kept under 12 hours of day-night cycle. 30 mice were separated into 5 different groups consisting 6 mice (3 males and 3 females) in each group. There were 3 different treatment groups such as Treatment group 1, 2, and 3, 1 placebo group and 1 control group. Each mouse of treatment groups 1, 2, and 3 was immunized with sterile 0.1 μg/50 μL, 1.0 μg/50 μL and 3.0 μg/50 μL of BANCOVID, respectively. Each mouse of the placebo group was injected with the vehicle only and the control group mice were not injected with anything. Intramuscular (IM) injection in the left quadriceps was done for immunization. The flow of the experimental design is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 3</xref>. The study plan and procedures were approved by the internal ethical review board, which is complied with local ethical regulation. No treatment randomization and blinding methods were used in the study and sample sizes were determined by the resource equation method.</p>
<sec id="S14">
<title>Local tolerance</title>
<p id="P17">Local tolerance was confirmed by clinical signs, macroscopic and histopathology evaluations of injection sites in animals. 9 male mice were separated for local tolerance study and divided into 3 different groups consisting of 3 male mice in each group. There was 1 treatment group, 1 placebo group and 1 control group for the study. The treatment group was immunized with IM injection with 3.0 μg/50 μL of BANCOVID in the left quadriceps muscle whereas the placebo group was injected with 50 μL of vehicle and the control group with 50 μL of normal saline. Euthanasia and evaluation of lesions was performed in one representative mouse from placebo and control group and 3 from the treatment group at 48 hours post treatment. The inner thigh muscle of injected site of each mouse was excised and placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin until adequately fixed. After trimming, processing and paraffin embedding, the sections are HE stained and observed for erythema and edema under microscope.</p>

<sec id="S15">
<title>Immunogenicity</title>
<p id="P18">The immunogenicity of BANCOVID was evaluated in BALB/c mice, post administration to the quadriceps muscle. Approximately 200 μL blood was collected from facial vein and centrifuged at 1500 X g for serum isolation (10 minutes at 4 CC). All serums were aliquot, frozen immediately and stored at −80 °C until analysis. The reactivity of the sera from each group of mice immunized with BANCOVID was measured against SARS-CoV-2 S antigen (SinoBiologicals, China). Analysis revealed IgG binding against SARS-CoV-2 S protein antigens in the sera of the immunized mice. The serum IgG binding endpoint titers (EPTs) were measured in mice immunized with BANCOVID. EPTs were observed in the sera of mice at day 7 and day 14 after immunization with a single dose of the vaccine candidate.</p>

<title>Toxicity</title>
<p id="P19">Pre-immune whole blood (approximately 50 μL) from each mouse was collected for complete blood count (CBC) in 2% EDTA at 3 days before immunization. Similarly, whole blood was also collected after immunization at day 14 for CBC analysis using auto hematology analyzer BK-6190-Vet (Biobase, China). Pre-immune serum of 3 days before and 14 days after immunization were used for chemistry analysis using semi-automatic chemistry analyzer (Biobase, China) such as alanine transferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and blood nitrogen urea (BUN).</p>

S gene of SARS-CoV-2 was cloned into pAADV-B02 vector (Genemedi, China) that also contains a GFP gene downstream of the gene of interest. After construction, SARS-CoV-2 S gene containing plasmid p20017 and adenovirus backbone plasmid pAADV-C01 (Genemedi, China) were co-transfected into HEK293 based adapted viral production cell (ThermoFisher, USA). Viral production cells were seeded in a 6 well TC treated plate (Nest, China) at a concentration of 6 × 10<sup>5</sup> cell per well and cultured overnight.</p>
<p id="P21">Then co-transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher, USA) reagent according to manufacturer's protocol. Next day 1.25% low melting agarose in DMEM media was spread on the well and incubated until plaques were formed. After formation of plaques, multiple plaques were collected in DMEM media and titers were measured for plaque selection. Then selected plaque was added on the fresh pre seeded viral production cell. After few days, cells and supernatant were collected and performed repeated freeze thawing for collection of viruses (P1 pseudovirus). Similarly, infection was performed on fresh cells and virus was collected (P2 pseudovirus). These processes were repeatedly performed and P4 pseudoviruses were collected. After collection of P4 pseudoviruses, concentration and purification was performed by ultracentrifugation and sucrose gradient.<sup>

The IVT process was tuned to obtain desired mRNA with high yield and quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure: 1C</xref>). The mRNA was encapsuled in lipid nano particle (LNP) ranging from 60 – 140 nm with the final pH of 7.2. We did a pilot study with limited numbers of mice to identify the suitable mRNA-LNP size for our formulation. mRNA-LNP either smaller than 70 nm or larger than 110 nm did not generate considerable immunological response even with a dose of 10 ng/mice (data not shown). To obtain the best process control for the dose production, we therefore, set our mRNA-LNP size range at 85±10 nm.

Neutralization assay demonstrated that there is a correlation between the intensity of GFP and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody for vaccinated mice. Higher concentration of SARS-CoV-2 antibody efficiently neutralize the entry of the pseudovirus into the ACE2-HEK293 cell. IC<sub>50</sub> value for GFP-inhibition were found significantly higher for the anti-sera (~3 μg/mL) compared to the CR3022 and a commercially available polyclonal mouse antibody against S-protein (~7 μg/ml).

The anti-sera-treated SARS-CoV-2-S adenovirus produced lower copy of virus compared to the buffer-treated virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure: 6A</xref>, Treatment 2 and Treatment 1, respectively). The copy number of virus was found reduced further from day 2 to day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure: 6A</xref>, Treatment 4 and Treatment 3, respectively). These data clearly revealed that though the anti-serum has significant inhibitory capacity against viral infection but systemic immune-protection is essential for better protection. Lower copy number of virus over the time indicated that the cellular immunity is also necessary, along with humoral immunity, for viral clearance. The anti-sera treated with S1+S2 protein failed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2-S adenovirus infection in the placebo-injected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure: 6A</xref>, Treatment 5), and proved that the inhibition and neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2-S pseudo-type virus is correlated with the immunogenic response generated due to ‘BANCOVID’.</p>

Ribosome binding site, IgE-signal sequence by replacing the native 13 amino acids from the N-terminal of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, 3' UTR constituted with the 3'UTRs of alpha and beta globin gene in tandem are worth to mention. We have used 70 – 100 nm LNP to deliver the mRNA. LNPs out of this range did not elicit considerable antibody response in a separate pilot study (data not shown); the best range was observed with 85±10 nm of LNP. The LNP-sizes determine the delivery efficiency of the cargo to the target cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup> The pH (7.2) of our formulation buffer for mRNA-LNP is also lower than the other relevant references (7.4~8.0).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup> Lower pH helps quick release of the cargo from endosomal compartment and protects mRNA from acid hydrolysis and lysosomal digestion in intracellular milieu.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup> Together, numbers of minute changes in the design context likely playing in concert and produced quick, balanced, stable Th1-IgG2-biased antibody response.</p>
<p id="P46">‘BANCOVID’ immunization did not produce any noticeable effect for local or systemic toxicity as primarily evident by the absence of four cardinal signs of inflammation: redness (Latin rubor), heat (calor), swelling (tumor), and pain (dolor). There was no erythema or erythredema as well in any injection site. The CBC and blood chemistry data did not show significant changes in relevant profiles and has been suggesting that the vaccine behaves safely in animal.</p>
<p id="P47">A balanced response between Th1 and Th2 is desired to achieve safe and effective humoral immunity performance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup> ‘BANCOVID’ has produced well-balanced IgG1 and IgG2 response by 7<sup>th</sup> day postimmunization and remained similar on 14<sup>th</sup> day postimmunization sera, which is suggesting a stable antibody response during the sampling period. Along with opsonizing characteristics, IgG2 has higher affinity to its receptors and have superior complement system activation potential over IgG1.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup> Accordingly, ‘BANCOVID’-mediated higher ratio of IgG2 than IgG1 has suggested that higher capacity of the antibody pool to clear antigen from the system. The ratio of IgG2a and IgG1, and cytokine-stained CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population showed a Th1-bias response. Since mouse IgG2 is equivalent to human IgG1<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup> therefore, it is plausible that ‘BANCOVID’ will elicit effective cellular and humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 in human.</p>
<p id="P48">The early vaccine development initiatives were taken before the G614 variant became predominant. Therefore, there are no specific vaccine tested so far in human with G614 variant-related molecule. Studies with the sera obtained from COVID-19 patients showed variable results regarding the neutralization propensity of D614 and G614 genotype. With 88 sera from a high-incidence community, Sadtler <italic>et al.</italic>, showed that antibody pool did not differentiate between D614 and G614 binding.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup> However, a few data point stayed out of the correlation trend in their study, which might be linked with the functional variations associated with the SARS-CoV-2 variants. Korber <italic>et al.</italic>, with 6 convalescent sera, showed that D614 and G614 both types of VSV-pseudovirus can be inhibited by the sera; though G614 and D614 showed little variation in their responses to the assay<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. They further showed that the G614 genotype produced higher titers against pseudoviruses from <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. The variations observed in both of the studies might not be just a coincident rather suggesting potential differences in <italic>modus operandi</italic> between the G614 and D614 variants. The proposition is supported by the Huang <italic>et al.</italic>; they have showed that 7% of the convalescent sera out of their 70 samples failed to neutralize G614 variant of pseudovirus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup> All of these studies did not identify whether the subjects were infected by either D614 or G614 variant, which could have revealed better insight for the correlation of the observation.</p>
<p id="P49">The roles of G614 mutation on constitutive infection have been attributed to its conformational change. It has been proposed that the -COOH group of D614 forms hydrogen bond with the -OH group of T859 across the S1/S2 interface, which cannot form in G614.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup> On the contrary, structural modeling studies revealed that “the D614G substitution creates a sticky packing defect in subunit S1, promoting its association with subunit S2 as a means to stabilize the structure of S1 within the S1/S2 complex.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup> In other words, the D614G mutation in fact promotes the S1/S2 association and stabilize the spike.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup> The finding is in accordance with the observation that G614 has a greater stability originating from less S1 domain shedding and greater accumulation of the intact S protein into the pseudovirion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup> It has also been reported that G614 mutation promoted the interaction of two of the three S glycoprotein chains with the RBD whereas only one chain from D614 interacts with RBD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup> This interaction creates favorable conformation of the RBD to its partners resulting higher access for effective binding and infection.</p>
<p id="P50">Predecessor SARS-CoV virus entry and infection was shown promoted by protease-mediated processing of the spike protein.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup> It has been postulated that SARS-CoV-2 also likely be adopting such properties by acquiring G614 genotype by incorporating protease processing site.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup> Consequently, it has been shown that indeed G614 protein has been cleaved by serine protease elastase-2 more efficiently than the D614 variant.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup> They further showed that G614 pseudovirus infection of 293T-ACE2 was potentiated in the presence of elastase-2, which can be blocked by elastase inhibitor. These findings corroborate the fact that G614-targetted vaccine is necessary.</p>
<p id="P51">Two prominent antigenic sites on the S-protein have been proposed those are spanning 614 position: V515-D614 and D614-A647.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup> The role of V515-D614 domain is not known but the D614-A647 is a dehydron wrapped intramolecularly by residues D614, V615, T645, R646 and A647, and forms a salt bridge with D614. The salt bridge contributes to stabilize D614-A647 in the uncomplexed S1 and inhibits the S1/S2 association. G614 diminishes the salt bridge formation and S1/S2 association resulting interaction with the RBD to facilitate higher infection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup> Therefore, blocking of G614 with a specific antibody would inhibit such acquired fitness of SARS-CoV-2. ‘BANCOVID’ immunization has produced a pool of antibody that covers the whole length of the spike protein suggesting that highly likely relevant antibody-mix against these domains have been developed. Since relevant domains are highly glycosylated therefore, we could not obtain homotypic peptides for definitive characterization of the purified antibody pool against these predicted antigens. Further study will be attempted to reveal the relevant scientific aspects. Nevertheless, the findings clearly demonstrated that ‘BANCOVID’ is safe for <italic>in vivo</italic> administration, and elicits balanced and stable cellular and humoral response that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated infection. Currently, we have been preparing for the phase-1 clinical trial. Appropriate clinical trial will reveal further insight regarding the significance of G614-targetted vaccine for the efficient management of COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p id="P52">The recent metadata analysis on more than 5000 clinical samples revealed that 100% of the second-wave of infection has been associated with G614 variant, which is emphasizing the need for G614-targetted vaccine for managing this uncontrolled infection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup> Therefore, the rapid transition of the 1<sup>st</sup> G614-targetted vaccine ‘BANCOVID’ to clinical trial would be highly rewarding.</p>
