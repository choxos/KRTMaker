While genetic mutations provide explanations for some relapsed patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, mechanisms of resistance remain undefined in many cases. Drug-induced epigenetic reprogramming provides possible routes to resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. By analysing histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) profiles in models of ET resistance, we discovered that selective ER down-regulators (SERDs) such as fulvestrant promote epigenetic activation of <italic>VGLL1</italic>, a co-activator for TEAD transcription factors. We show that <italic>VGLL1</italic>, acting via TEADs, promotes expression of genes that drive growth of fulvestrant-resistant breast cancer cells. Pharmacological disruption of VGLL1/TEAD4 interaction inhibits VGLL1/TEAD transcriptional programmes to block growth of the resistant cells and prevents growth. Among the VGLL1/TEAD-regulated genes, we identify <italic>EGFR</italic>, whereby VGLL1-directed EGFR upregulation sensitises fulvestrant-resistant breast cancer cells to EGFR inhibitors.

As presence of H3K27ac flags active gene promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, we ranked genes according to the ratio of H3K27ac signal in MCF7 cells with acquired resistance to fulvestrant (FULVR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> relative to isogenic fulvestrant-sensitive MCF7 cells. H3K27ac was reduced at ER target genes in FULVR cells, as expected from the ER inhibitory action of fulvestrant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). <italic>VGLL1</italic> (rank=3) and <italic>VGLL3</italic> (rank=5) were among the genes with the greatest increase in H3K27ac signal. Functional annotation analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> showed that the HIPPO pathway is the most enriched signalling pathway (fold enrichment=4.7, FDR=7.9×10<sup>-6</sup>; Supplementary Table 1) in the H3K27ac-enhanced genes (576 genes with log2 fold change (FC) &gt;2). Consistent with the enhancer/promoter reorganisation implied by H3K27ac mapping, RNA-seq gene expression data revealed substantial increases in VGLL1 and VGLL3 expression in FULVR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Concordant with the H3K27ac results, gene ontology (GO) analysis of the RNA-seq data demonstrated downregulation of estrogen response pathways in FULVR cells (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Immunoblotting and RT-qPCR confirmed that VGLL1 and VGLL3 expression is extremely low in MCF7 cells, indicating that epigenetic reprograming accompanying development of fulvestrant resistance leads to their induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). In MCF7-FULVR cells, YAP and TAZ mRNA levels were substantially lower than those of VGLL1 and VGLL3 and their protein levels were not markedly different in FULVR and MCF7 cells. Interestingly, expression of three of the four TEAD genes was also increased in FULVR cells. Elevated expression of VGLL1 was also clear in other fulvestrant-resistant ER+ cell lines (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1c, d</xref>). However, VGLL3 was not commonly upregulated, as was the case for MCF7-FULVR cells, where YAP and TAZ expression was not increased.</p><p id="P8">RNA-seq analysis showed that VGLL1 expression is not induced in LTED cells (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>), suggesting that preventing ER activation is insufficient for VGLL1 expression. By contrast, fulvestrant stimulated VGLL1 expression in ER+ breast cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1f, g</xref>). The new generation SERDs GDC0810 (Brilanestrant), AZD9496 and RAD1901 (Elacestrant) also induced VGLL1 expression (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1h</xref>).

VGLL3, YAP, TAZ and TEAD expression was not impacted by ER knockdown. To determine if fulvestrant also promotes VGLL1 expression in tumours, we used RNAscope to measure VGLL1 mRNA in matched breast cancer biopsies taken prior to and after fulvestrant treatment. VGLL1 levels were consistently higher in post-fulvestrant samples than in the matched pre-treatment biopsies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g, h</xref>; Supplementary Table 2).

As VGLL1 is expected to be recruited via TEADs, we also profiled TEAD4, chosen since it is highly expressed in both MCF7 and FULVR cells and because successful TEAD4 ChIP-seq has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.

Seventy-five percent of the TEAD4 binding events in MCF7 cells were also present in FULVR cells, suggesting that VGLL1 expression (and/or ER downregulation) does not stimulate redistribution of TEAD4 but rather promotes TEAD binding at many new sites. As expected, <italic>de novo</italic> motif analysis of the TEAD4 ChIP-seq identified TEAD binding sites as the predominant enriched motifs in both MCF7 and MCF7-FULVR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a, b</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Transcription activation by TEADs requires the recruitment of specific co-activators, including YAP, TAZ and VGLLs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, a role for VGLL1 as a TEAD co-activator has largely been restricted to reporter gene assays and co-crystallisation studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. VGLL1 ChIP-seq of three biological replicates (Supplementary Table 3) identified 29,930 peaks common to all replicates in FULVR cells. There was a strong positive correlation between VGLL1 and TEAD4 binding events (<italic>p</italic>&lt;2.2×10<sup>-16</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).

Moreover, low H3K27ac signal in MCF7 cells at VGLL1/TEAD4 co-occupied regions (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>) is suggestive of low expression of these genes in MCF7 cells. Exemplifying this, TEAD4 was present at previously described TEAD target genes including CTGF (CCN2), AMOTL2 and ANKRD1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> in MCF7 and MCF7-FULVR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>), but there was substantially greater H3K27ac and expression of these genes in MCF7-FULVR cells.

Although VGLL1 expression was induced (ActCas9-VGLL1; <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 3c-d</xref>), this, in of itself was insufficient for an altered response to fulvestrant (see below). Treatment of ER+ breast cancer cells with fulvestrant causes rapid growth arrest and the establishment of resistance requires prolonged culturing with fulvestrant over many months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. In agreement with these reports, growth inhibition was maintained in vector control cells (MCF7-ActCas9-Vector) for &gt;100 days in the presence of 100 nM fulvestrant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 3e</xref>). By contrast, following an initial period of stasis, growth recovery was observed in fulvestrant-treated cells within just 20 days in VGLL1 expressing cells. Interestingly, development of fulvestrant resistance in these cells was accompanied by further increases in levels of VGLL1, together with reduced ER and PR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3d-e</xref>).

The majority (85%) of differential genes in ActCas9-VGLL1-FULVR100 cells were also significantly altered in ActCas9-VGLL1-FULVR1000 cells. Moreover, of the 360 genes up-regulated with log2FC≥1 in MCF7-FULVR cells, most were also up-regulated (log2FC≥1) in ActCas9-VGLL1-FULVR100 (341/360 (94%) genes) and ActCas9-VGLL1-FULVR1000 cells (338/360 (94%) genes) (Supplementary Table 5, <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 3h</xref>). A similar relationship was observed for the 175 downregulated genes (log2FC≤-1) in MCF7-FULVR, wherein 90% of these genes were also downregulated in the ActCas9-VGLL1-FULVR cells.</p><p id="P15">Our results show that although expression of VGLL1 alone is insufficient for resistance to fulvestrant, its expression promotes progression to fulvestrant resistance. It is possible that VGLL1 levels above a threshold achieved with ActCas9 targeting are needed for resistance to fulvestrant. Indeed, VGLL1 levels in the resistant cells were considerably higher than those in the MCF7-Act-Cas9-VGLL1 cells. Alternatively, other genes induced or repressed by prolonged fulvestrant treatment may be necessary for VGLL1 activation. One such requirement might be TEAD1, given that its expression is commonly elevated in the different fulvestrant-resistance models (Supplementary Table 5). Another possibility is that post-translational modification of VGLL1 controls its activity. Indeed, the levels and activities of the other major TEAD partners, YAP and TAZ, are critically dependent on their phosphorylation by the HIPPO pathway LATS1/2 kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. However, the lack of a LATS recognition motif in VGLL1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> makes it unlikely that VGLL1 is regulated by the HIPPO pathway. Taken together, downregulation of ER and its transcriptional programmes by fulvestrant appears to be a necessary first step for adaptation of ER+ breast cancer cells away from ER dependence to a requirement for VGLL1.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Transcriptional dependency of FULVR cells on VGLL1</title><p id="P16">For understanding the importance of VGLL1 in directing gene expression in fulvestrant resistant cells, we first stratified genes based on the presence or absence of VGLL1 ChIP-seq peaks.

The genes associated with VGLL1 peaks were also more highly expressed in ActCas9-VGLL1-FULVR cells (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 4a</xref>). To further assess VGLL1-regulated gene expression in MCF7-FULVR cells, we performed RNA-seq following VGLL1 knockdown using 3 VGLL1 siRNAs. Robust VGLL1 knockdown with each VGLL1 siRNA was confirmed in each biological replicate RNA (n=3; <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 4b</xref>). Expression of 3500-4000 genes was significantly (padj &lt; 0.05) altered by each VGLL1 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended data Fig 4c</xref>), with around half of these genes being downregulated. To identify direct VGLL1 targets we filtered genes that were downregulated with at least 2 independent siRNAs (1,372 genes, padj &lt; 0.05) for the presence of VGLL1 ChIP-seq peaks within 2.5 kb of transcription start sites (TSS). This defined 762 genes, which we termed VGLL1-activated genes. Not-VGLL1 targets, so-called because they were unaffected by VGLL1 knockdown and did not contain VGLL1 peaks, number 8,932. Comparing the VGLL1-activated genes showed that they were also more highly expressed in MCF7-FULVR cells than in the isogenic fulvestrant-sensitive cells, whereas there was no difference in levels of the not-VGLL1 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). As expected, VGLL1-regulated genes were also enriched for TEAD4 binding regions (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4d, e</xref>) and were associated with low H3K27ac at TSS in MCF7 cells but high H3K27ac in MCF7-FULVR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4c</xref>, <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4f, g</xref>). Functional annotation of the VGLL1-activated genes revealed enrichment for pathways associated with growth factor signalling, including growth factor binding and transmembrane receptor protein kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), exemplified by IGFBP3, ITGB6, TGFB2 and EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f, g</xref>; <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 4h</xref>). Taken together, our findings strongly support the premise that VGLL1/TEAD is a key driver of genes whose expression is increased in progression of ER+ breast cancer cells to fulvestrant resistance.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>VGLL1 induces EGFR expression in breast cancer cells to drive growth of FULVR cells</title><p id="P17">The above findings link high VGLL1 activity with genes implicated in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling, including EGFR. High expression of EGFR and/or its downstream effectors has been linked to reduced efficacy of ET, including tamoxifen and fulvestrant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Furthermore, ectopic expression of EGFR demonstrably promotes fulvestrant resistance in breast cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Indeed, EGFR expression was elevated in all our FULVR cell lines compared with their isogenic fulvestrant-sensitive counterparts (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 5a</xref>). Analysis of our ChIP-seq data revealed gain of TEAD4 binding at the EGFR gene in MCF7-FULVR cells, particularly at a region ∼50 kb upstream of the transcription start site where it was co-localised with VGLL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Enhanced TEAD4 binding at this region was confirmed by ChIP-qPCR in MCF7-ActCas9-VGLL1-FULVR cells, was accompanied by the presence of VGLL1 in this region and showed induction of H3K27 acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). VGLL1 and TEAD4 co-binding at this region was consistent with the substantial increases in EGFR levels in MCF7-ActCas9-VGLL1-FULVR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>).

Similarly, VGLL1 knockdown was sufficient to reduce levels of EGFR in the FULVR cells generated by long-term culturing with fulvestrant (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 5b-d</xref>). Consistent with high EGFR expression and activity, treatment of MCF7-ActCas9-VGLL1-FULVR cells with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, inhibited cell growth, accompanied by reductions in AKT and MAPK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f, g</xref>). By contrast, the isogenic fulvestrant-sensitive cells were substantially less sensitive to erlotinib. A similar difference in sensitivity to erlotinib was observed for MCF7-FULVR and ZR-75-1-FULVR cells compared with the isogenic fulvestrant-sensitive MCF7 cells (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 5e-f</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Our results reveal a mechanism explaining the induction of EGFR in ET-resistant breast cancer, in which epigenomic remodelling due to ER downregulation results in the induction of VGLL1 and consequent VGLL1-TEAD4 co-binding at the <italic>EGFR</italic> enhancer to induce EGFR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>).

VP potently downregulated the expression of VGLL1 activated genes, including EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>), findings that could be confirmed with RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). These results are consistent with reduced expression of these genes following VGLL1 knockdown (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6b, c</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Genes downregulated by VP were enriched for VGLL1 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). Indeed, expression of genes that contained promoter proximal VGLL1 peaks was significantly reduced by VP, compared to lack of change in expression for genes without VGLL1 binding (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 6d</xref>). The selectivity of VP in downregulating VGLL1 target genes was further confirmed by analysing all the high confidence VGLL1 targets and not-VGLL1 targets, revealing that VGLL1 activated genes were significantly downregulated by VP, compared to not-VGLL1 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f, g</xref>). Indeed, the majority of VGLL1 activated genes were downregulated by VP and displayed preferential sensitivity to VP (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 6e</xref>). In line with this, we also found that genes that were downregulated by VP were expressed at higher levels in FULVR cells, compared to genes not inhibited by VP (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 6f</xref>), consistent with VGLL1 activated genes being more highly expressed than not-VGLL1 targets in FULVR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Finally, genes downregulated by VP were enriched in functional categories attributed to VGLL1 activated genes including growth factor binding, extracellular matrix binding and transmembrane receptor protein kinase activity (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 6g</xref> and Supplementary Table 6).</p><p id="P22">Interestingly, expression of the 762 genes identified as likely VGLL1 activated genes was positively associated with VGLL1 levels in the METABRIC breast cancer cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6h</xref>).

Overall, our results show that VGLL1 transcriptional activity is sensitive to VP treatment and suggest that inhibition of VGLL1 recruitment to TEADs could provide an approach to treating VGLL1-dependent, endocrine-resistant breast cancer.</p><p id="P23">To test the efficacy of VP <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, KCC_P_3837, generated from an untreated grade 3, ER-positive, PR-positive, HER2-negative primary invasive ductal carcinoma, in which fulvestrant-resistant derivatives were generated through serial passaging in mice.

We further show that ER down-regulation by these drugs drives the epigenetic reprogramming that permits the establishment of VGLL1-directed transcriptional programs that support ER-independent cell survival and proliferation. These VGLL1-directed transcriptional programs involve its recruitment to TEAD binding regions. Indeed, reprograming of the epigenetic landscape in breast cancer cells resistant to fulvestrant is associated with increased TEAD4 recruitment to the chromatin and association of VGLL1 and TEAD4 co-binding with active enhancers in the resistant cells.</p><p id="P25">The well-established oncogenic role of TEADs in different cancers has been closely linked to the activities of YAP and TAZ as TEAD coactivators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. However, it is increasingly clear that the canonical functions of TEADs as downstream effectors of YAP and TAZ in the Hippo pathway do not provide the sole mechanism by which TEADs contribute to cancer progression in different cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. For instance, in ER+ breast cancer, a non-canonical function of YAP and TEAD4, has been reported, wherein they act as ER cofactors, regulating ER target genes rather than canonical TEAD target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Our results agree with these findings, as we found that canonical TEAD target genes were expressed only at low levels in ER+ breast cancer cells and we did not observe enrichment of YAP/TAZ binding at these genes. By contrast, many of the established TEAD target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> are upregulated in fulvestrant-resistant cells, yet YAP/TAZ binding is largely absent at these genes. Instead, VGLL1 was co-bound with TEAD at these genes in FULVR cells and the expression of these genes was dependent on VGLL1.</p><p id="P26">Demonstration of the importance of VGLL1/TEAD in promoting resistance to ER down-regulators also permits identification of targetable pathways engaged by VGLL1/TEAD, as exemplified herein for EGFR. EGFR expression was greatly elevated in FULVR cells, accompanied by enhanced TEAD4 binding proximal to the EGFR gene. VGLL1 was co-bound with TEAD4 at this region and EGFR expression in fulvestrant-resistant cells was dependent on VGLL1. ERK1/2 MAPK and AKT activities were elevated in FULVR cells, these activities being dependent on EGFR activity as demonstrated by the inhibition observed with erlotinib. Consistent with these results, FULVR cells were substantially more strongly growth inhibited by erlotinib than the fulvestrant-sensitive cells. VGLL1 knockdown reduced EGFR, as well as lowering phospho-AKT levels, indicative of the importance of VGLL1 for EGFR expression and activity in FULVR cells. Supporting our findings is the observation that EGFR is the most highly ranked gene co-expressed with VGLL1 in breast cancer samples. Recent studies show that EGFR and HER2 amplification, as well as mutations of genes in the downstream MAPK pathway are increased in metastatic, endocrine-resistant ER+ breast cancer, together accounting for 10-15% of cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> and demonstrating the importance of elevated EGFR signalling in acquired resistance to endocrine treatments.
