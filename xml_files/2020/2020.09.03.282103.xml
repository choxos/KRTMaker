<abstract>
<p id="P1">Viral replication is dependent on interactions between viral polypeptides and host proteins. Identifying virus-host protein interactions can thus uncover unique opportunities for interfering with the virus life cycle via novel drug compounds or drug repurposing. Importantly, many viral-host protein interactions take place at intracellular membranes and poorly soluble organelles, which are difficult to profile using classical biochemical purification approaches. Applying proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) with the fast-acting miniTurbo enzyme to 27 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549), we detected 7810 proximity interactions (7382 of which are new for SARS-CoV-2) with 2242 host proteins (results available at covid19interactome.org). These results complement and dramatically expand upon recent affinity purification-based studies identifying stable host-virus protein complexes, and offer an unparalleled view of membrane-associated processes critical for viral production. Host cell organellar markers were also subjected to BioID in parallel, allowing us to propose modes of action for several viral proteins in the context of host proteome remodelling. In summary, our dataset identifies numerous high confidence proximity partners for SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, and describes potential mechanisms for their effects on specific host cell functions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single stranded RNA (+ssRNA) Coronavirus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>. No specific therapeutics are currently available for this novel virus. A deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology at the molecular level will both provide critical insight into the strategies used by the virus to subvert and hijack host cell functions, and identify virus-host protein-protein interactions that are required for viral replication, many of which could represent useful drug targets.</p>
<p id="P3">The SARS-CoV-2 genome consists of a capped and polyadenylated RNA of approximately 30kb, containing one large 5’ open reading frame (ORF), which encodes two large “polyproteins”. The polyproteins are proteolytically processed by viral proteases to yield the non-structural proteins NSP1-NSP16. 13 additional smaller ORFs (n.b. whether ORF1O is expressed as a protein remains to be demonstrated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) encode the structural proteins - spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) - and other polypeptides. Together, these proteins comprise the SARS-CoV-2 proteome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>.</p>
<p id="P4">RNA (+) viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 effect a remarkable re-organization of host cell ER-Golgi membranes to form single membrane invaginations and double membrane vesicles (DMV), which serve to organize and protect the viral replication machinery, and which shield new virus particles from innate immune detection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>. Virus-host interactions that take place in replication organelles are obvious targets for therapeutic intervention, yet these membrane protein interactions have remained poorly characterized.</p>
<p id="P5">Three recent studies utilized affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to map over 1000 putative SARS-CoV-2 virus-host protein-protein interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> in HEK293T and A549 cells. While these traditional affinity purification approaches have been of immense value in characterizing biochemically stable protein complexes, this approach is less amenable to the identification of weak or transient interactions, and is not optimal for the identification of interactions that take place at poorly soluble intracellular locations, such as membranes or on chromatin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>. Of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, nine possess one or more predicted transmembrane domains. Relatively few interaction partners have been identified for this group of proteins to date (including in the aforementioned studies), suggesting that complementary interaction identification approaches could provide important additional insight into the virus-host interactome.</p>
<p id="P6">Proximity-dependent biotinylation approaches are well-suited for defining relationships between proteins in living cells. The BioID approach, which utilizes an abortive bacterial biotin ligase to mediate proximity-dependent biotinylation of proteins in the vicinity of a bait<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, has been particularly useful for mapping poorly soluble intracellular structures such as membranes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> and membraneless<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> organelles, and for characterizing the proximal interactomes of other virus proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>. In this approach, a cloud of activated biotin (with a ~5-10nm radius) is generated around the “bait” protein, resulting in the covalent biotinylation of lysine moieties in nearby “prey” proteins. Covalent biotinylation enables the use of harsh lysis conditions to solubilize all structural elements in the cell, including organelles, protein complexes and membranes, and permits the identification of biotinylated proteins using streptavidin affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry. The original BioID was performed with an <italic>E. coli</italic> BirA enzyme harboring a single mutation (R118G), and which displays relatively low catalytic activity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). The application of directed molecular evolution yielded new BirA variants such as miniTurbo, an N-terminally truncated BirA protein with a dozen additional mutations, and dramatically improved catalytic activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>. miniTurbo enables efficient biotinylation within minutes, rather than the many hours required for the “classic” BirA* enzyme. Also of critical importance, using our lentivirus-based toolkit (originally established for BirA*<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), miniTurbo-tagged bait proteins can be expressed in many different cell types.</p>
<p id="P7">Here, using our lentiviral delivery system, we conduct miniTurbo BioID on 27 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, tagged at both the N- and C-termini, characterizing their intracellular localization, and mapping virushost proximity interactomes in the A549 human lung alveolar epithelial cell line. We also include 17 host proteins previously used as subcellular compartment markers, allowing us to report more precisely on the location of the viral proteins, and in some cases propose mechanisms of action.</p>

<title>Proximity interactome of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in A549 cells</title>
<p id="P8">To generate a proximity interaction map of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, 27 viral ORFs (as defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) were cloned into lentiviral expression vectors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, enabling tetracycline-inducible expression of polypeptides fused in-frame with the miniTurbo enzyme<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> at their amino (_Nt) or carboxy (_Ct) termini. A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells were transduced with lentivirus (see Methods for details on optimization and validation), treated with doxycycline for 24 hours to induce transgene expression, then supplemented with biotin for 15 minutes to initiate proximity-dependent biotinylation. Cells were harvested using stringent lysis conditions for immunoblotting or BioID, or fixed for immunofluorescence. Bait expression, localization and induction of biotinylation were assessed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence (see below).</p>
<p id="P9">A pilot immunofluorescence study (using transient transfection in HEK293T cells; data not shown) indicated that several SARS-CoV-2 bait proteins localized generally to cytoplasm, but many proteins were instead clearly associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and possibly other intracellular membranes. Leveraging our previous study on the subcellular organization of a human cell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> (in which 192 subcellular markers were profiled by BioID in HEK293 cells, using the classic BirA* enzyme), 17 ER, Golgi, mitochondria and other organellar membrane and non-membrane “marker” ORFs were also cloned into the miniTurbo lentiviral vector, and BioID conducted as above. To model background and non-specific biotinylation, we used three different negative controls: an EGFP vector (not expressing miniTurbo), and miniTurbo fused to either EGFP or a Nuclear Export Sequence (NES).</p>
<p id="P10">The majority of the SARS-CoV-2 bait proteins were successfully expressed in A549 cells in both N-and C-terminal tagged configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended data Fig. 1</xref>), and all but NSP1 and NSP3 (which we profiled instead by transient transfection; see Methods) were well expressed in at least one orientation. For NSP1, this observation is consistent with a previously characterized strong suppression of host translation by the SARS-CoV ortholog<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>. A double point mutant defined in SARS-CoV NSP1 that prevents translational inhibition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> was introduced in SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 (K164A and H165A). These amino acid changes allowed for the successful production of lentivirus, and expression of the miniTurbo fusion gene in A549 cells. Catalytically inactive mutants of the proteases NSP3 (C857A) and NSP5 (C145A) were also created via mutation of active site residues, as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>. Together, our dataset thus comprises the proximity interactomes of 27 WT virus baits, mutant versions of NSP1, NSP3 and NSP5, and 17 host baits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">In addition to profiling the proximity interactome of each of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we assessed their subcellular localization using immunofluorescence microscopy in A549 cells. This revealed the localization of 11 baits to the endoplasmic reticulum (NSP4, E, ORF8), the Golgi (ORF3B, ORF7A) or both compartments (NSP6, S, ORF3A, M, ORF6, ORF7B); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1b-c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended data Fig. 2a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). NSP2 and Nucleocapsid (N) exhibited nuclear exclusion, ORF9B localized to mitochondria localized to the nucleus. NSPs 7-16 exhibited non-discrete localization, distributing throughout the cell. We note that some baits (including ORF3A, ORF7A, ORF14 and ORF8) were detected in different compartments depending on tag location. This is not completely surprising since ORF3A is a multipass membrane protein and ORF7A and ORF8 contain an N-terminal signal sequence. Overall, our results agree to a large extent with previous reports of the subcellular localization of these proteins, and suggest that the miniTurbo tag does not dramatically affect localization.</p>
<p id="P12">All viral baits, host subcellular markers and negative controls were profiled (≥2 biological replicates) by BioID and mass spectrometry (see Methods). The dataset was analyzed using Significance Analysis of INTeractome (SAINTexpress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), identifying 7810 high-confidence (i.e. Bayesian FDR ≤1%) proximity interactions (after merging N and C-terminal data) for the WT viral baits, with 2242 unique human proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The viral proteins recovered between 6 (NSP12) and 938 (M) proximity interactions, with a median of 205, consistent with the localization of many of these proteins to membranous compartments, which tend to produce rich BioID profiles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>. Across the entire dataset, including host subcellular markers (and without merging the viral bait orientations), 16503 high-confidence proximity interactions with 2715 unique prey proteins were uncovered.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Comparison to other datasets</title>
<p id="P13">We next compared our BioID results with those of recently reported AP-MS results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, as annotated in BioGRID<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>. A relatively high proportion (21.7%) of previously reported SARS-CoV-2 AP-MS interactions was recapitulated in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). However, this value varied widely between baits, ranging from 0 (e.g. NSP14) to 43.9% (for ORF8) of previously reported interactions recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data Fig. 3</xref>). At least 10% of previously reported interactions were recovered for 13 different virus proteins. This group of interactions, cross-validated in multiple approaches, may represent promising therapeutic targets (specific examples discussed below). As expected, BioID expands upon the previously reported AP-MS interactions (1976) to include 7810 proximal interactions, which encompass both direct interactors and proteins residing in the vicinity of the bait protein. We note that 94.5% of our interactions are novel for SARS-CoV-2 (94.1% when expanding to the complement of all coronavirus protein orthologs - SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS − annotated in BioGRID), providing opportunities to gain new insight into the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 proteins subvert and hijack cellular functions.</p>

<title>Website</title>
<p id="P14">To make this resource readily available to the scientific community, we created the covid19interactome.org, a website that can be used to explore the virus-host proximity interactome dataset. Users can explore the website from the point of view of a viral protein with a detailed report on proximity interactions for the WT or mutant variants, or by searching for a specific host prey protein, which will retrieve baits that identify the prey and offer a heat map profile view across the data set. A network exploration tool is also available that displays up to 25 of the most abundant preys (length normalized spectral counts) for each bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).

<sec id="S6">
<title>BioID enrichment and profile similarity between viral and host baits</title>
<p id="P15">As expected, BioID interactomes for each viral protein were enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) Cellular Compartment (CC) terms matching their immunofluorescence localization. Baits with more diffuse staining or low recovery of proximity interactors did not display any well-defined enrichment for a specific compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>; also see domain and region enrichments within this table). To more precisely define the localization of the viral proteins, both viral and host baits were subjected to clustering by pairwise Jaccard similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). This largely clustered viral baits with host bait proteins with known subcellular location and function, and whose BioID profiles serve as compartment reference signatures. These results also supported the immunofluorescence localization and the enrichment of specific GO terms.</p>
<p id="P16">A large, dense cluster of host and viral baits localized to the ER and Golgi compartments was clearly identified, defined by host baits that label the cytoplasmic face of these structures: DERL1 (Derlin-1; ER), B3GAT1 (Beta-1,3-Glucuronyltransferase 1, Golgi) and ERGIC2 (ER-Golgi intermediate compartment 2). Within this cluster, viral proteins M, NSP4, NSP6, ORF7A and ORF7B (both N- and C-tagged) most resembled DERL1, while E and ORF6 (both N- and C-tagged) more closely resembled the Golgi and ERGIC markers. Extension of this cluster to include the region marked by host baits localized to lysosomal and plasma membrane/recycling endosome systems (fragments of LAMTOR1 and CD44; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) revealed similarity to ORF3B. Additional baits (ORF3A, NSP5, NSP13) were associated with the larger endomembrane system.</p>
<p id="P17">Smaller clusters containing both host and viral proteins were also identified, including: the mitochondrial host baits (GRSF1, SLC25A37, AIFM1, MAVS) and SARS-CoV-2 ORF9B; and the RNA granule host baits (DCP1A, G3BP1, LSM14A, GRSF1) and the viral N protein (both discussed further below).</p>
<p id="P18">In most instances, interactome data generated by viral proteins tagged at the N- and C- termini clustered closely with one another, suggesting that both bait variants sample similar environments (as would be expected for non-membrane-spanning soluble proteins or multipass proteins with both termini facing the same side of a given membrane). This includes the aforementioned components of the ER-Golgi-endosome, mitochondria, and RNA granule clusters, but also pairs of viral proteins not associated with any host clusters, and in general recovering fewer proximity partners (i.e. NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP7, NSP8, NSP9 and NSP16).</p>
<p id="P19">While similarity in profiles between N and C-terminally tagged variants seemed to be the rule here, there were a few exceptions. First, some of the baits (S, NSP12, NSP13 and NSP14) were clearly better expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>) and recovered meaningful data in only one tagging orientation (e.g. S_Ct clustered with the Golgi-ERGIC and NSP12_Nt and NSP14_Nt were in the larger membrane cluster while only 0−1 confident proximity partners were recovered in the reverse orientation, precluding meaningful clustering). However, two viral proteins that were well expressed in both tag orientations displayed strikingly different profiles depending on tag location. When C-terminally tagged, ORF14 predominantly enriched ER components, while the N-terminally tagged form strongly enriched nucleolar and nuclear proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), consistent with their respective immunofluorescence results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). This protein (also known as ORF9c<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), was recently shown to associate with a variety of membranes when N-terminally tagged with two Strep-tag II peptides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, which is in contrast to our results for the N-terminal tag variant. Whether the fusion of the larger miniTurbo moiety to the N-terminus of ORF14 disrupts its localization, or (at least some of) this protein is also localized to the nucleolus remains to be determined. The other notable exception was ORF8, whose C-terminal fusion clustered with the ER lumen proteins CALR3 (Calreticulin-3) and PDIA4 (Protein disulfide-isomerase A4). Interestingly, ORF8_Ct was the only viral protein found to cluster with the ER lumen marker baits. These results are consistent with the fact that ORF8 possesses an N-terminal signal sequence (which would be masked by N-terminal tagging). The overlap between the proximity partners of ORF8_Ct and the two ER lumen markers was extensive (see comparison with CALR3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), though there were some proteins, especially in the lower abundance range, that seemed preferentially recovered with ORF8. Interestingly, these included components of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I complex; genes HLA-A, B and C), while several components of the peptide loading complex, including TAPBP (tapasin), PDIA3 (ERp57) and CALR (calreticulin) also seemed enriched. This is consistent with a recent report suggesting that ORF8 binds to and deregulates surface expression of MHC-I molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>.</p>

<p id="P21">In <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, RNA-templated RNA synthesis is executed by two enzymes, the canonical NSP12, which employs a primer-dependent initiation mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> and, unique to CoVs, NSP8, which is thought to provide low fidelity polymerase activity and has been suggested to work as a primase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>. NSP7 and NSP8 associate with one another (and with NSP12), but it remains unclear how each of these individual proteins interact with the host proteome. NSP7 and NSP8 did not display particularly informative localizations by immunofluorescence or BioID compartment enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 2a-b</xref>); however there is mild enrichment for a single GO term associated with the cell cycle (GO:0010564, regulation of cell cycle process, p-value 0.002 when proximity interactors for NSP7 and NSP8 are jointly analyzed). Indeed, NSP7/8 proximity interactors included several components of the MCM helicase, cohesin/condensin components, and proteins linked to the DNA damage checkpoint, histone binding, centrosome, and the anaphase-promoting complex. Interactors also included proteasome components, E1 and E3 ubiquitin system proteins, and an aminopeptidase implicated in MHC-I presentation, NPEPPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In particular, the proximity interactors of both NSP8_Nt and NSP8_Ct were remarkably similar, suggesting that these results are not an artefact of tagging. Only a handful of the interactions reported here were previously detected; NPEPPS with NSP7, and HECTD1, HERC1, PSMD2 and UBA1 with NSP8<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>. Our data therefore provides new avenues of investigation for these essential virus proteins.</p>

<title>NSP4 and NSP6</title>
<p id="P22">NSP4 and NSP6 of SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses were previously implicated in the formation of double-membrane vesicles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, a process that is critical for viral genome replication and transcription. Consistent with these observations, expression of SARS-CoV-2 NSP4, tagged at either terminus, resulted in regions with irregular membrane morphology and the formation of large vesicular structures in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). While the molecular details of this phenomenon await characterization, it is noteworthy that one of the most abundant proteins specifically enriched with NSP4 over the other viral proteins is MOSPD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), recently identified as a scaffolding protein for ER membrane contact sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>. Whether overexpression of NSP4 (or viral infection) disrupts ER integrity through MOSPD2 remains to be determined. Surprisingly, despite very similar interactomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), N-terminally tagged NSP6 was localized to small cytoplasmic punctae, while C-terminally tagged NSP6 localized to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Both NSP6_Ct and NSP6_Nt predominantly recover ER and Golgi proteins, suggesting that the two types of structures seen by microscopy are related. It is tempting to postulate that some of the differential interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>) may be responsible for this apparent formation of cytoplasmic punctae. Candidates could include proteins previously linked to membrane and trafficking dynamics (e.g. MYOF and ARF1), calcium or lipid signaling molecules (ATP2A2, ABCA1) or perhaps proteostasis regulators (KCTD9, USP19). Overall, the proximal interactome maps of NSP4 and NSP6 can serve as a resource to decipher the respective roles of these proteins in membrane reorganization and formation of viral replication organelles.</p>

<title>ORF9B</title>
<p id="P23">Consistent with its localization to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>) and a proximity interactome most similar to mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), ORF9B yielded a unique interaction profile enriched for mitochondrial proteins (GO CC p<sub>ad</sub>j 1.29e<sup>-28</sup> for the C-term and 3.10e<sup>-157</sup> for N-term interactomes, respectively). Tagged at either terminus, ORF9B recovered a number of outer mitochondrial membrane proteins, including TOMM70, a mitochondrial import receptor subunit shown to associate with ORF9B in three other studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, and whose binding can be recapitulated <italic>in vitro</italic> by purified proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>. ORF9B also recovers many peptides for MAVS, a protein required for innate immune defense against viruses (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) that we previously studied in the context of a BioID map of mitochondrial organization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>. This is consistent with a recently confirmed role of ORF9B in the regulation of innate immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>.</p>
<p id="P24">We next compared the ORF9B proximity interactome to that of MAVS: while both proteins recovered a large subset of common proximity partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>), there were some notable differences. Most strikingly, proteins that were ≤2 fold more abundant in the MAVS interactome were enriched for components of the mitochondrial fission machinery, the peroxisome, and the antiviral interferon response. This observation suggests that in the absence of viral infection, ORF9B either associates with a population of MAVS excluded from peroxisomes and innate immunity regulators, or that it may interfere with the ability of MAVS to interact with these proteins. Testing these non-mutually exclusive hypotheses will require profiling of the MAVS proximal interactome following expression of ORF9B.</p>

<title>Host cell RNA binding</title>
<p id="P25">Viruses must co-opt the host protein synthesis machinery to produce virions, and have evolved a number of elegant strategies to do so (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). While several SARS-CoV-2 bait proteins recovered ribosomal components, potentially as a consequence of their association with the ER (M, NSP2, NSP5, NSP13, NSP14 and ORF3A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), other baits (N, NSP1, NSP3, NSP9 and NSP16) displayed a more specific recovery of cytosolic RNA-binding proteins or their interaction partners. These observations may provide important clues regarding the molecular mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to effect host protein synthesis shutoff and/or usurpation of the translational apparatus.</p>
<p id="P26">The NSP1 interactome was uniquely enriched for eIF3G and eIF3A, two components of the eIF3 translation initiation complex, which bridges mRNA to the small ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Within the evolutionarily conserved eIF3 complex, eIF3G (Tif35p in yeast) localizes near the mRNA entry channel. Our results are in agreement with with a recent report indicating that SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 effects translational inhibition by binding to and obstructing this mRNA entry channel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>. The recovery of the largest eIF3 subunit, eIF3A, is consistent with the localization of its C-terminal domain (CTD) near this channel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>. As expected from studies of SARS-CoV, NSP1 K164A and H165A mutations prevented interactions with eIF3 and ribosomal small subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). Interestingly, however and proximity interactions with POLA1 (which were also detected by AP-MS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, and modelled in silico<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) were increased. The functional significance (if any) of these and the other gained proximity interactions with the mutant NSP1 remain to be discovered.</p>
<p id="P27">NSP3 (aka PLpro), a large (~200kDa) multi-domain polypeptide, performs proteolytic cleavage and removes ubiquitin/ISG15. While it recovered (either in its WT or proteolytically inactive form) very few partners, the RNA binding proteins FXR1 and FXR2 (related to the Fragile X mental retardation syndrome RNA binding proteins) were amongst the most abundant proximity partners of NSP3_Nt wild type and mutant proteins. Recovery of these two RNA-binding proteins and FMR1 was also detected prominently with NSP9 and N. NSP9 is a ssRNA binding protein with a unique fold<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>. In addition to the FXR/FMR proteins, NSP9 recovered several other proteins associated with RNA biology, notably LSM14A/B (implicated in the antiviral response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) and their direct binding partner EIF4ENIF1 (aka 4E-T<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), and the deadenylase associated protein TOB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, blue). IBTK (a protein found in immunoprecipitates of the translation initiation factor eIF4A<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), MEOIC (a partner of the only RNA helicase-containing m6A reader, YTHDC2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) and ANGEL1 (a binding partner of the mRNA cap binding protein eIF4E<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>) were found in proximity to NSP16, a methyltransferase that mediates 2’-O-ribose methylation of the viral mRNA 5’-cap structure. As expected, the nucleocapsid protein, N, also established multiple proximity interactions with RNA binding proteins (a subset is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> for comparison with other baits). With the aforementioned exceptions, most of these RNA binding proteins were recovered with N more efficiently than with any of the other baits.</p>
<p id="P28">The N protein proximity interactome was significantly enriched for proteins localizing to the ribonucleoprotein granule GO category (GO CC Padj = 0.0034). The stress granule nucleators G3BP1 and G3BP2 were amongst the most abundant N binding partners in either tag orientation (consistent with all three AP-MS studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>; other previously reported interactions include those with UPF1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> and CAVIN1/2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Using classic BioID (BirA* in HEK293 cells), we previously reported a proximity interactome of cytoplasmic RNA granules and bodies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>. One of these structures, the P-body, contains components of the decapping machinery (including DCP1A) and deadenylase complexes, and is present as visible structures by microscopy in untreated cells. Another of these structures, the stress granule, is marked by proteins such as G3BP1, and forms as a microscopically distinguishable structure only after cells are subjected to stress (e.g. exposure to sodium arsenite). While DCP1A and G3BP1 provide relatively clean definitions of P-bodies and stress granules by microscopy, several proteins associate with both structures by microscopy and BioID (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). These include LSM14A, a main component of P-bodies, but which is also found in stress granules. GRSF1, the first protein identified as a mitochondrial RNA granule component, also establishes proximity interactions with cytoplasmic granules.</p>
<p id="P29">Interestingly, we noted obvious differences in the recovery of proximity partners for N versus G3BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), LSM14A, GRSF1 and DCP1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>). In particular, CAPRIN1 and UBAP2L (and its paralog UBAP2), which bind to G3BP1 and are necessary for nucleating stress granules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, were proportionally depleted in the N BioID in comparison to that of G3BP1 BioID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), suggesting that N overexpression could oppose G3BP1-mediated stress granule formation. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the impact of the expression of N (tagged with mCherry) on the formation of stress granule foci (detected by endogenous G3BP1) upon treatment with sodium arsenite. After 30 min of arsenite treatment, G3BP1 forms punctae in cells not expressing N protein. However, expression of N drastically decreased the formation of these structures in response to arsenite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10</xref>). Interestingly, this phenomenon was rescued upon co-expression of GFP-tagged G3BP1, suggesting that N could titer functional G3BP1 away from its stress granule co-nucleators (note that in the context of G3BP1 overexpression, N localized to stress granules; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that a new function for N may be to prevent the formation of host cell stress granules, likely by competing with the association of proteins such as UBAP2, UBAP2L and CAPRIN1 that promote stress granule formation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P30">Here we report the proximal proteome of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, profiled as both N- and C-terminal fusions with the fast acting miniTurbo enzyme, in A549 cells, a widely used model system in coronavirus biology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>. We present the dataset as a resource accompanied by a user-friendly website (covid19interactome.org), and apply immunofluorescence microscopy, term enrichment and bait similarity profiling to assign each bait to a specific subcellular location. The resulting dataset identifies a number of new and confirmatory proximity interactions, and can be mined to shed light on the viral life cycle and to identify virus-host interactions that could represent important therapeutic targets.</p>
<p id="P31">A major challenge in the interpretation of proximity-dependent biotinylation is the complexity of the data that it generates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>. While some of the bait proteins (NSP1, for example; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>) yielded a short list of proximity partners that immediately suggested mechanistic insights, this is not always the case. In particular, baits localized to membranes recovered hundreds of proximity partners. While it may be tempting to report that the most abundant proximity partners detected in these analyses are more closely associated with the bait, this may not always be true. The extent of biotin labeling and recovery of each prey protein is dependent on a variety of factors, including its size, amino acid composition, abundance and propensity for biotinylation (i.e. the number of unmodified lysine residues on a given prey protein that are available for labeling, in the context of the specific cellular compartment). It is also important to note that a given bait protein may have multiple <italic>bona fide</italic> intracellular locations. In this case, some prey proteins with relatively low peptide counts can represent critically important interactors that provide extremely useful information on bait function and cellular context. To assist in data interpretation, we have leveraged our human cell map resource (humancellmap.org) to select host baits that profile different subcellular localizations. This data was very helpful for more clearly characterizing local virus bait environments, and allowed us to better understand more complex virus protein interactomes (as shown when we e.g. compared the ORF9B and MAVS interactomes, and compared the N interactome with those of G3BP1 and other RNA granule components). In particular, comparing virus and host marker protein interactomes allowed us to: (i) better refine modes of targeting to a particular subcellular structure (e.g. likely through TOMM70 for ORF9B targeting to the mitochondria) and; (ii) provided testable hypotheses regarding the functional consequences of these virus-host associations.</p>
<p id="P32">Applying this conceptual framework to SARS-CoV-2 protein N and host protein G3BP1, and in particular noting the relative depletion of proteins critical to the formation of stress granules (UBAP2L, its paralog UBAP2, and CAPRIN1 in the N BioID interactome), we postulated that N may bind to G3BP1 to interfere with the association of UBAP2L/2 and/or CAPRIN1, and potentially prevent stress granule formation. This hypothesis was further bolstered in our microscopy experiments. While future work will be required to determine whether this phenomenon results from direct competition between UBAP2L (and/or CAPRIN1) and N for a common binding site on G3BP1, this observation may be highly relevant to understanding the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.</p>
<p id="P33">An important component of the host response to viral infection is the activation of the kinase PKR (gene name EIF2AK2), which phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha at Ser51, resulting in translational arrest and the formation of stress granules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>. Multiple viruses have evolved strategies to interfere with this process, either through preventing PKR activation and eIF2alpha phosphorylation, or (as is being increasingly recognized) by modulating stress granule dynamics by other means. For example, the poliovirus 3C protease was shown to cleave G3BP1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>. How the recent characterization of a phase-separation phenomenon associated with N and viral RNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref> relates to our findings should be addressed in the context of viral infection, or at least viral RNA transfection.</p>
<p id="P34">Several recent AP-MS studies have identified biochemically-stable interactions for SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As with previous comparative studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, the overlap between the AP-MS and BioID datasets varies depending on the bait. This is not surprising, as, in addition to major differences in methodologies, BioID is a proximity-dependent detection method, and thus simply captures proteins in the same local environment as the bait. AP-MS conducted under standard, gentle lysis conditions is not optimal for the capture of labile protein-protein interactions, or proteins associated with membranes. Post-lysis artefacts, or in some cases associations that result from the extreme overexpression of transient transfection, can also explain some of the interactions captured by published AP-MS studies that are not recapitulated here. On the other hand, false negatives in BioID experiments can relate to the requirement for solvent-exposed lysines, and for sufficient engagement time to enable biotinylation. Lastly, the high stringency employed in our BioID experiments is expected to dissociate most protein-protein interactions, so that only those proteins marked by biotin will be identified: this results in a selective loss of stable but non-biotinylated components of protein complexes in our studies. Given these caveats, the detection of ~21% of the previously-reported AP-MS interactions (428) is not unexpected. Importantly, given the orthogonality of the approaches, hits detected with high confidence with both approaches are much more likely to represent bona fide interactions, and some illustrative examples are included in this manuscript.</p>
<p id="P35">There are limitations to the current study. First, as mentioned above, any epitope tagging may influence the behavior of the tagged protein, possibly affecting its localization and/or interactions. Here, we have attempted to mitigate this variable by separately tagging the N- and C-termini. This, however, still left some unanswered questions, for instance regarding the localization and proximity interactors of ORF14 (also called ORF9c in other studies). We have analyzed proximity interactomes for viral proteins expressed individually in uninfected cells. This is useful to illuminate individual connections of each viral protein with the host proteome, but it does not reveal new connections that could be formed by the association of viral proteins with one another. For viral proteins that dimerize (e.g. NSP7-NSP8), the next step could be to analyze the proximal proteome of the dimer rather than the monomer, a task that can be facilitated by using a Protein Complementation Assay strategy for BioID (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Ultimately, though, it will be critical to profile the proximal interactome of each viral protein in the context of a SARS-CoV-2 infection; this will also be particularly important for understanding the formation of viral factories.</p>
<p id="P36">While the majority of hospitalized COVID-19 patients present with compromised airway function, a wide variety of effects on other organs have been noted. The primary SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>), is expressed in a wide variety of cell types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, including cardiomyocytes, cardiac pericytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, hepatocytes and multiple cell types in the kidney<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, and kidney impairment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>, cardiac injury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref> and liver dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref> are commonly observed in COVID-19 critical care patients. While the virus-related cytokine storm has been linked to organ damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>, a recent report also indicated that SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA was found in autopsied lung, pharynx, heart, liver, kidney, and brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>. Our virus-host proximity map of a lung-derived cell line provides a comprehensive proximity interaction map for this model system, but the proteome of different cell types can vary significantly, and virus tropism and replication efficiency will likely vary dramatically across cells derived from different tissues. It will thus be of critical importance to characterize virus-host proximity interactomes in multiple human tissues/cell types. Our lentiviral delivery system for inducible expression of viral proteins will greatly facilitate cell type cross-comparisons, as well as comparisons of viral proteins from related coronaviruses, which could shed light on the unique properties of SARS-CoV-2. Lastly, use of the fast acting miniTurbo enzyme (which allows for a labeling duration of ≤15 minutes as compared to ~6 or more hours for BirA*) enables us to both generate more temporally resolved profiles, and will allow us in future to track changes in virushost proximity interactions following drug treatment, or to follow changes in associations throughout the viral life cycle.</p>

Proteins were resolved on 4−15% Criterion™ TGX™ Precast gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Cat# 5671085) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Life Science, Uppsala, Sweden, Cat# 10600001) for immunoblotting. Following Ponceau S staining, membranes were blocked in 4% skim milk in TBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). Bait proteins were probed using mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody, Sigma-Aldrich, F3165; used at 1:2500) in blocking buffer, washed in TBST and detected with Sheep anti-Mouse IgG-Horseradish peroxidase (HRP; GE Healthcare Life Science, Cat#NA931; used at 1:5000). Similarly, biotinylated proteins were probed using HRP-conjugated Streptavidin (GE Healthcare Life Science, Cat# RPN1231vs; used at 1:2500) in 2.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) blocking buffer. Membranes were developed using LumiGLO chemiluminescent reagent (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, Cat# 7003S).</p>

<p id="P48">Cells at 75% confluence in 15 cm plates were induced with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Dox) for 24 hours at which point biotin was added to the media at a final concentration of 50 μM for 15 minutes. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS on ice and lysed on plate using 1 ml of modified RIPA (modRIPA) buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 0.4% sodium deoxycholate] containing 1 mM PMSF, 1x Protease Inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# P8340), 25 U of TurboNuclease (BioVision Inc., Milpitas, CA, Cat# 9207) and 10 μg of RNase A (Bio Basic, Markham, ON, Canada, Cat# RB0473) and incubated on ice for 5 minutes with occasional agitation of the plate. Subsequently, 10% SDS was added to the plate to raise the SDS concentration to 1% SDS at which point the lysate was scraped, transferred to an 1.5 ml tube, flash frozen on dry ice and frozen at -80 °C for downstream processing.</p>
<p id="P49">For affinity purification, lysates were thawed at 4 °C, and sonicated for 15 seconds (5 seconds on, 3 seconds off for three cycles) at 30% amplitude on a Q500 Sonicator with 1/8” Microtip (QSonica, Newtown, Connecticut, Cat# 4422). To reduce and alkylate the samples, DTT was added to each tube to a final concentration of 5 mM and incubated at 60 °C for 30 minutes. Iodoacetamide was then added to a final concentration of 10 mM and the samples were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 20 minutes. Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 15 minutes and the supernatant was used for biotinylated protein capture using 15 μl of pre-washed Streptavidin agarose beads (GE Healthcare Life Science, Cat# 17511301). After 6 hours, the beads were transferred to a new tube, washed once with SDS-Wash buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2% SDS), once with RIPA (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 0.4% sodium deoxycholate), once with TNNE buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP40), and two times with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC buffer), pH 8.0, and finally with 50 mM ABC buffer supplemented with 0.0025% ProteaseMax (Promega, Cat# V2071) to facilitate sedimentation of agarose resin. On-bead digestion was performed overnight at 37 °C with 0.75 μg of trypsin (Sigma Aldrich, Cat# 6567) in 60 μl of ABC buffer, followed by further digestion with an additional 0.25 μg of trypsin for 3 hours. Peptide supernatants were collected into a new tube, beads were washed twice with HPLC grade water, pooled with the peptide supernatant, acidified by adding 0.1 volume of 50% formic acid, and subsequently dried using vacuum centrifugation.</p>

<title>Mass Spectrometry</title>
<p id="P50">The LC-MS/MS setup consisted of a TripleTOF 6600 (SCIEX, Framingham, MA, Canada) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source connected in-line to a 425 Nano-HPLC system (Eksigent Technologies, Dublin, CA). The fused silica column (15 cm x ID 100 μm, OD 360 μm) had an integrated emitter tip prepared in-house using a laser puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). The column was packed with ~15 cm of C18 resin (Reprosil-Pur, 3 μm, Dr. Maisch HPLC GmbH, Germany). Lyophilized samples were resuspended in 5% formic acid and 1/4th of sample was used per injection for DDA and 1/4th for DIA. IRT calibration mixture (Biognosys (Zurich, Switzerland)) was added to the mixture for calibration of retention times. Samples were loaded onto the column using the autosampler, and the LC delivered the organic phase gradient at 400 nl/min over 90 min (2-35% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid). The MS instrument was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode with 1 MS scan (250 ms; mass range 400-1250 m/z) followed by up to 20 MS/MS scans (50 ms each). Only candidate ions between two and five charge states were considered, and ions were dynamically excluded for 10 s with a 50 mDa window. The isolation width was 0.7 m/z, and minimum threshold was set to 200. Between sample injections, 2 blank samples were injected (5% formic acid), each with 3 rapid gradient cycles at 1500 nl/min over 30 min. Before another sample was injected, system performance was verified with a 30 min BSA quality control run and a 30 min BSA mass calibration run.</p>

For human samples, the database used for searches consisted of the human and adenovirus sequences in the RefSeq protein database (version 57). The database was supplemented with SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences, “common contaminants” from the Max Planck Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://141.61.102.106:8080/share.cgi?ssid=0f2gfuB">http://141.61.102.106:8080/share.cgi?ssid=0f2gfuB</ext-link>) and the Global Proteome Machine (GPM; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thegpm.org/crap/index.html">http://www.thegpm.org/crap/index.html</ext-link>), and with commonly used epitope tags. The search databases consisted of forward and reverse sequences (labeled “gi 9999” or “DECOY”); in total, 72,226 entries were searched for the human database. Spectra were analyzed separately using Mascot (2.3.02; Matrix Science) and Comet<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref> [2012.01 rev.3] with trypsin specificity and up to two missed cleavages; deamidation (Asn or Gln) and oxidation (Met) were selected as variable modifications and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was selected as a fixed modification. The fragment mass tolerance was 0.15 Da, and the mass window for the precursor was ±40 ppm with charges of 2+ to 4+ (both monoisotopic mass). The resulting Comet and Mascot results were individually processed by PeptideProphet<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref> and combined into a final iProphet<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref> output using the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP; Linux version, v0.0 Development trunk rev 0, Build 201303061711).

<title>Identification of High-confidence Proximity Partners</title>
<p id="P52">SAINTexpress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> (version 3.6.1) was used to calculate the probability that identified proteins were enriched above background contaminants. SAINTexpress uses a semi-supervised spectral counting model that compares the detection of putative proximal interactors in a BioID profile of a given bait against a series of negative control runs. For analysis with SAINT, only proteins with an iProphet protein probability of &gt;0.95 were considered, and a minimum of two unique peptides was required. For each cell type, bait proteins were profiled using independent biological duplicates and analyzed alongside six independent negative control runs from the same cell type. Negative control runs consisted of streptavidin purifications from cells expressing miniTurbo-EGFP only (this models promiscuous biotinylation), miniTurbo-NES (nuclear exclusion signal) or without miniTurbo transgene expression (this models endogenous biotinylation). For running SAINTexpress, the 12 independent negative controls were compressed to three, meaning that for each prey, its three highest counts across the 12 controls were selected for stringent evaluation with SAINTexpress (as detailed previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>). SAINTexpress scores were averaged across both biological replicate purifications of the baits, and these averaged values were used to calculate a Bayesian False Discovery Rate (FDR); proximity interactions detected with a calculated FDR of 1% or less were deemed of high confidence.</p>

<sec id="S23">
<title>SAINT processing</title>
<p id="P53">The SAINT file was filtered to remove contaminants, tags and viral bait genes detected as preys. Genes that are now obsolete since the Refseq version was released were also removed, as were fusion proteins, their composite genes, and protein isoforms whose peptides were not reliably assigned between replicates and/or baits. The SAINT file was supplemented with columns for the control subtracted spectral count, the control-subtracted and length adjusted spectral count (CLSC) and prey specificity. Control subtracted spectral counts were calculated as the average spectral count in controls subtracted from the average spectral count (AvgSpec), which could be no less than zero. The CLSC was calculated by taking the control subtracted spectral count for a prey and multiplying by the median prey sequence length (within each bait), divided by the sequence length of the prey in question. The specificity of a prey with a bait was calculated by dividing the control subtracted spectral count by the average control subtracted spectral count for that prey across all other bait genes. When calculating the specificity of a prey for bait <bold>X</bold>, other baits from the same gene as bait <bold>X</bold> were ignored, and other baits were consolidated by gene using the highest spectral count.</p>

<title>Experimental Design and Statistical Rationale</title>
<p id="P59">For each BioID experiment, biological duplicates were employed (each replicate generated through independent infections and harvests). Statistical scoring was performed against six negative controls compressed to two virtual controls using Significance Analysis of INTeractome (SAINT; SAINTexpress 3.6.1 was employed) as described above (“Identification of High-Confidence Proximity Partners”). Control samples (“No-miniTurbo”, “miniTurbo-EGFP”, “miniTurbo-EGFP-NES”) are described above. The average SAINTexpress score was used to determine the Bayesian FDR, which therefore requires a high-confidence interaction to be detected across both biological replicates.</p>

Only preys with a consistent direction of change between ORF9B_Nt and ORF9B_Ct are shown. Fold change was capped at +/- 5 since many values are infinite (i.e. only detected with MAVS or ORF9B). Preys in the image are sorted by ORF9B_Nt and then by prey name when preys have equivalent fold changes. Lower heatmap: control-subtracted spectral counts for each indicated bait-prey pair. Prey annotated to the peroxisome, innate immunity / interferon signaling and mitochondrial fission are highlighted with colored dots.</p>
