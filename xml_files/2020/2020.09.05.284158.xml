Why are unbiased spectra rare, and how do such diverse biases evolve? Our experiments show that changing the mutation spectrum allows populations to sample previously under-sampled mutational space, including beneficial mutations. The resulting shift in the distribution of fitness effects is advantageous: beneficial mutation supply and beneficial pleiotropy both increase, and deleterious load reduces. More broadly, simulations indicate that the evolution of a mutational bias in an unbiased ancestor is selectively neutral; but reversing the direction of a long-term bias is always selectively favoured. Indeed, we predict frequent spectrum changes in the bacterial phylogeny, typically involving reversals of ancestral bias. Thus, shifts in mutation spectra may evolve under selection, and can directly alter the outcome of adaptive evolution by facilitating access to beneficial mutations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The mutation spectrum describes the frequency of various classes of sampled mutations (e.g., transversions vs. transitions (Tv/Ts)), and is often determined by the action of DNA repair enzymes. By determining the pool of genetic variants available for selection, mutation spectra can shape key genome features (e.g., nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), codon and amino acid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>)), even under selection for thousands of generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>); determine the genetic basis of adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), driving convergent evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>); and shape the evolution of resistance to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) and anti-cancer drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Thus, mutation spectra are important for adaptive evolution, but their role is underappreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). The mutation spectrum is instantaneously and relatively easily altered by loss-of-function mutations in DNA repair genes, e.g., as observed in “mutators” that also have higher mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). The elevated mutation rate increases the supply of beneficial mutations, facilitating rapid adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). However, spectrum shifts also occur without associated mutation rate changes, such as with the loss of some bacterial DNA repair enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), and under nutritional or anaerobic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Diverse mutation spectra occur even across natural yeast strains and closely related species of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, despite similar mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p><p id="P3">In fact, most species analysed so far have a skewed mutation spectrum (i.e., some mutational classes are over-represented relative to the null expectation), with substantial variation in the direction and magnitude of bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) (experimental data from microbes summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). This diversity implies major evolutionary shifts in mutation spectra. However, the frequency, underlying evolutionary processes, and consequences of spectrum shifts are unknown. For instance, why are unbiased spectra rare? Do spectrum shifts – for example, a change from an unbiased to a biased state, or altered direction of bias – evolve under selection? A spectrum shift may persist if the new bias favours mutational classes that are inherently advantageous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), allowing the evolved bias to hitchhike with beneficial mutations. It has also been speculated that stress-induced changes in mutation spectra may enhance sampling of new beneficial mutations by altering the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). However, prior studies have failed to find consistent support for general selective benefits of specific mutational classes. For instance, transition mutations (Ts) are not consistently more beneficial (or less deleterious) than transversions (Tv) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>); and the fixation probability of Ts vs. Tv mutations in genomes is clade-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Hence, particular mutational classes do not seem to be universally beneficial, and the observed diversity in mutation bias remains puzzling.</p><p id="P4">We addressed these gaps using a combination of experiments, simulations, and phylogenetic analyses. To measure the immediate evolutionary impact of the mutation spectrum, we estimated the genome-wide DFE of new mutations in <italic>Escherichia coli.</italic> We manipulated the mutation spectrum by deleting a DNA repair gene (Δ<italic>mutY</italic>, “mutator” strain) from our wild type strain (“WT”), altering both the mutation spectrum and rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Allowing independent lineages of both strains to evolve under mutation accumulation (MA), we sequenced whole genomes of evolved isolates to identify strains carrying a single new mutation each. Thus, we minimized the impact of selection on the mutation spectrum and the DFE, while also decoupling the effects of the mutator’s spectrum from its high mutation rate. Measuring the effect of each single mutation on population growth rate, we determined the effects of mutation spectrum on the beneficial mutation supply, genetic load, and pleiotropic effects. Next, to test the generality and longer-term evolutionary consequences of shifts in mutation spectra, we performed both adaptive walk and full population simulations. Finally, we inferred evolutionary transitions in DNA repair enzymes across the bacterial phylogeny to estimate the frequency of shifts in mutation bias. Our results show that shifts in mutation spectra can evolve under selection and fuel adaptation via previously under-sampled evolutionary paths.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>The mutator DFE has more beneficial mutations that reduce the expected genetic load and alter pleiotropic effects</title><p id="P5">From MA experiments conducted in rich media (LB), we obtained 80 evolved WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) and 79 mutator strains, each carrying a single distinct mutation with respect to its ancestor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data</xref>). We measured the selective fitness effect (relative growth rate) of each mutation in the MA environment (LB) as well as 15 other environments with different carbon sources, including some that are used by <italic>E. coli</italic> in the mouse gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). With this large set of fitness effects, we constructed environment-specific empirical DFEs (WT data for some environments were previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>)). Since bacterial MA experiments can cause over-sampling of beneficial mutations and under-sampling of deleterious mutations, we used a correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) that retains the measured selective effect (s) of each mutation, but estimates and corrects for selection bias by changing the frequency of mutations with a given selective effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A–C, Supplementary Data</xref>). These corrected DFEs thus provide accurate estimates of the fraction of beneficial mutations (f<sub>b</sub>) and the average selective effect (s).</p><p id="P6">Correcting for selection bias during MA results in DFEs with coarsely binned fitness histograms, we calculated the fraction of neutral (−0.05 &lt; <italic>s</italic> &lt; 0.05, conservatively accounting for a maximum of ~5% fitness measurement error), beneficial (<italic>s</italic> &gt; 0.05), and deleterious (<italic>s</italic> &lt;−0.05) mutations for each strain in all 16 environments. The DFEs and f<sub>b</sub> values varied across environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>), but on average the mutator had a greater fraction of beneficial mutations (f<sub>b</sub> = 36% vs. 28%) and fewer deleterious mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Thus, compared to WT, the mutator had more beneficial-shifted DFEs. Mean fitness effects of mutations were also significantly more beneficial in the mutator (paired Welch’s two-sample test, p = 0.043; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>), although medians were not significantly different (p = 0.35, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>). Finally, mutations had larger absolute effects in WT than in the mutator (Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test, W = 662920, p = 1.4x10<sup>-14</sup>); hence, the mutator’s beneficial-shifted DFEs could not have arisen because of overall larger-effect mutations. These results indicate a broad selective advantage to the mutator, independent of its mutation rate. In addition, accounting for the skewed DFEs and order-of-magnitude higher mutation rate (μ<sub>WT</sub> = 9.3x10<sup>-11</sup> per bp per generation, μ<sub>mutator</sub> = 89x10<sup>-11</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>), we estimated (following (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>)) that on average the mutator should have an ~16-fold greater genome-wide supply of beneficial mutations, and ~6-fold higher genetic load than the WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S4, S5</xref>). In contrast, if we ignored the mutator’s distinct DFE and accounted only for its mutation rate, both the supply of beneficial mutations and the deleterious genetic load would be nearly 10-fold greater than WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S4, S5</xref>; only the load is significantly affected by the correct DFE). Thus, depending on their mutation rate and DFE, mutators may have a substantially higher supply of beneficial mutations and smaller genetic load than previously believed.</p><p id="P7">The high f<sub>b</sub> values observed in some environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) contradict the general expectation that beneficial mutations should be rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). However, many other studies – including with microbes and plants – have also reported a large number of beneficial mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Such large f<sub>b</sub> values have been partially attributed to an improved ability to measure small-effect beneficial mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) that are more common than expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), especially at low effective population sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Most prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) provide approximate or indirect estimates of the DFE via random mutagenesis of a single gene, and focus only on the beneficial part of the DFE, or infer the DFE by fitting a model to time series data from selection or MA lines. Further, they do not estimate the number of underlying mutations to account for epistasis. Our direct, genome-wide estimates of the DFE of single, randomly-sampled new mutations support the idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>) that new beneficial mutations may be more common than generally believed.</p><p id="P8">Next, we estimated the pleiotropic effects of mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), which are important because they can facilitate adaptation (via synergistic pleiotropic benefits) and shape fitness tradeoffs (via antagonistic pleiotropy) in new environments. The mutator had a distinct distribution of pleiotropic effects in all 16 environments (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C–D</xref>, chi-square tests: p &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup> in each case, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>), driven by a higher incidence of beneficial synergistic pleiotropy and lower deleterious synergistic pleiotropy. However, both strains had low antagonistic pleiotropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B–C</xref>). Beneficial mutations in the mutator were also beneficial across many more environments (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparing the two distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, D=0.41, p=3.1x10<sup>-6</sup>); whereas deleterious mutations were deleterious in fewer environments than WT (D=0.56, p=2.63x10<sup>-11</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Despite this qualitative association between mutational effects, overall, the magnitude of fitness effects was not correlated across environments (only 38 of 120 correlations were significant in WT and 22 of 120 significant in mutator, Spearman’s rank correlation, p &lt; 0.05). Thus, new beneficial mutations in the mutator are more likely to facilitate adaptation across many environments, but are no more likely to generate tradeoffs. Interestingly, simulating an increase in the median fitness effect of the WT DFE without changing its shape (“WT-beneficial shift”) mimicked pleiotropic effects observed in the mutator in all but two environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2E, Table S6</xref>). Conversely, simply reducing the median fitness effect in the WT DFE (“WT-deleterious shift”) lowered beneficial synergistic pleiotropy in all 16 environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F, Table S6</xref>). Ignoring the mutation spectrum can thus cause overestimation of a mutator’s genetic load, and underestimation of the supply and pleiotropic effects of beneficial mutations.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The mutator’s beneficial-shifted DFEs arise from its distinct mutation spectrum</title><p id="P9">We had hypothesized that the mutator’s distinct DFE could arise from its biased spectrum. However, other global effects of the initial <italic>mutY</italic> gene deletion could also lead to a DFE shift. For instance, if deleting <italic>mutY</italic> reduced the mutator’s fitness, a larger fraction of new mutations might be beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). However, the mutator ancestor had lower fitness than WT in only three environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S7</xref>). Alternatively, epistatic interactions with <italic>mutY</italic> could increase the deleterious effect of new mutations in the WT. However, paired WT and mutator strains carrying the same mutation had similar fitness in all but one environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S8</xref>). Thus, the observed shift in the mutator DFE cannot be explained by global effects of the <italic>mutY</italic> deletion. The difference across strains was also robust across mutational classes: mutations were more beneficial in the mutator even when comparing only base-pair substitutions, or coding, non-coding, synonymous, or non-synonymous mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Next, we asked whether the mutator is biased towards mutational classes that happen to be more beneficial (or less deleterious). We defined mutation bias as the proportion of mutations belonging to a specific mutational class (e.g., Tv bias = Number of Tv mutations / (Number of Tv + Number of Ts mutations)). Note that the null expectation ("unbiased" state) differs across each type of bias. For Tv bias, the null is 0.67 because 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of all possible single nucleotide changes are transversions. For GC→AT bias, the null is 0.5 because for a randomly generated genome half of all mutations should be GC→AT. For actual genomes with extreme GC content, the null expectation will change (e.g., in a GC-rich genome, the baseline probability of AT→GC mutations is less than 0.5 because there are few A or T bases that can mutate). This is not a major problem for <italic>E. coli</italic> since its genomic GC content is ~50%. Regardless of the type of bias, we could compare mutation biases across the new mutations sampled by WT and mutator, because barring the deletion of <italic>mutY</italic> both ancestral genomes were identical. The mutator strongly favours transversions, GC→AT mutations, base pair substitutions (BPS) and coding mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). Overall, transversions and GC→AT mutations were less deleterious than transitions and AT→GC mutations respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D–E</xref>; fitness effects pooled across environments, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S9</xref>), but the other mutation biases did not show consistent differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4, Table S9</xref>). Additionally, other aspects of the mutations (e.g., genomic location or specific amino acid changes) also did not differ across strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5, S6; Tables S10, S11</xref>). Thus, as predicted, the mutation spectrum – specifically the strong Tv and GC→AT bias – appeared to drive the distinct DFE of the mutator, because the mutator over-samples these specific mutational classes. However, it was unclear why Tv and GC→AT mutations should be more beneficial.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Simulations demonstrate a general benefit of reversing mutation spectra</title><p id="P11">To test the generality of our empirical results and uncover underlying mechanisms, we simulated adaptive walks in an NK fitness landscape ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>), modelling sequences of N nucleotides such that mutations could be classified as Ts vs. Tv or GC→AT vs. AT→GC. Starting from a randomly chosen ancestor sequence and mutation spectrum (Tv bias = fraction of transversions), we allowed populations to explore successive mutational steps at randomly chosen loci (bases). A mutation that confers a relative fitness increase of 1+s fixes (a step in the walk is taken) with probability 2s; that is, we assumed a strong-selection weak-mutation (SSWM) regime. At various points during the walk, we simulated mutations to generate a DFE, computed fitness effects given the underlying fitness landscape (affected by K other randomly chosen loci, to incorporate epistasis), and calculated the fraction of beneficial (f<sub>b</sub>) and deleterious (f<sub>d</sub>) mutations and their effect sizes. We initially set N=200 and K=1 (each locus epistatically coupled to 1/199=0.5% loci), and present the average outcomes for 500 adaptive walks on 500 randomly-generated fitness landscapes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A–B</xref> shows variation across walks).</p><p id="P12">As expected, mean population fitness increased during the adaptive walk, with a concomitant reduction in f<sub>b</sub> and beneficial effect size, an increase in f<sub>d</sub>, and a relatively constant deleterious effect size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Setting ancestral Tv bias to 0.45 (mimicking our WT), we compared the DFE generated by the ancestor at various time points, to the DFE that would be created if the bias were changed at that time point (mimicking our Δ<italic>mutY</italic> strain). The bias-shifted ("shifted") strain thus has the same fitness and sequence as the ancestor and an identical mutation rate, differing only in spectrum. As the ancestor evolved (i.e., f<sub>b</sub> decreased), a stronger bias shift (i.e., higher Tv) allowed the bias-shifted strain to sample proportionally more beneficial mutations than the ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). More generally, exploring well-adapted populations (f<sub>b</sub> = 0.04) but varying both the ancestral and shifted mutation spectra, we find that shifted strains that reverse the ancestral bias (i.e., have a strong bias in the opposite direction) have the greatest advantage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>). Our results hold across a different axis of the mutation spectrum (GC→AT bias, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>), and in more rugged fitness landscapes with higher epistasis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10A–B</xref>). Importantly, adapting populations did not “exhaust” a small set of beneficial mutations; rather, they fixed distinct mutations as they explored a large number of diverse pathways that represent a subset of many possible fitness peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10C</xref>). Our results also hold in full population simulations with multiple segregating mutations (relaxing the SSWM assumption), where deleterious mutations can fix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>). In fact, when more mutations are accessible, we observe the same beneficial effects of bias reversals, but these effects emerge more quickly. Finally, these effects are also observed in full population simulations when the fitness landscape is defined using a codon-based rather than a nucleotide model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Thus, our simulation results can be broadly generalized in the form of three key predictions: (1) reversing an ancestral mutation bias is always beneficial (2) the magnitude of the benefit increases with the degree to which the new bias opposes the ancestral bias, and (3) the magnitude of the benefit increases when the ancestor has evolved with a given bias for longer intervals of time (i.e., as the ancestor gets better-adapted over time). Our experimental data with the Δ<italic>mutY</italic> strain support the first prediction, since we found that overall the mutator (with a reversal of the Tv bias, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>) had higher f<sub>b</sub> values than WT. Interestingly, the WT GC→AT bias was reinforced in the mutator, rendering the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> puzzling. However, ~88% of all GC→AT mutations in the mutator are also transversions. Hence, our mutator’s observed beneficial-shifted DFE is explained by its strong Tv bias, which opposes the existing WT bias towards Ts.</p><p id="P14">Although our data are generally explained by the simulation results, some puzzling observations remain. The simulations predict that the mutator should have higher f<sub>b</sub> in all environments, but we do not observe this pattern as consistently as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Further, in apparent contradiction to prediction 3 above, the difference in f<sub>b</sub> between WT and mutator in lowest in LB (where ancestral growth rate is highest and presumably <italic>E. coli</italic> is best-adapted). However, note that our strains evolved for a very short time in LB under minimal selection, so LB is not an “ancestral” environment in an evolutionarily meaningful sense. Additionally, absolute growth rate is not a reliable indicator of the relative degree of or period of adaptation to an environment, because it is also strongly influenced by nutrient availability. Indeed, f<sub>b</sub> was not correlated with ancestral growth rate across environments in either strain (Spearman’s rank correlation test, WT: rho = −0.217, Mutator: rho = −0.18; p &gt; 0.05 in each case). Hence, to understand the environment-specific differences in DFEs, we need to explicitly test predictions 2 and 3 (described above) under conditions where the precise degree of bias change and the length of evolutionary time in an environment can be measured and/or manipulated.</p><p id="P15">Our simulation results demonstrate general conditions under which a change in mutational bias can be selectively advantageous. But how does mutation bias evolve in the first place? Starting from an unbiased ancestor, we find that introducing any bias is selectively neutral, regardless of how long the ancestor had evolved in the same fitness landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E–F</xref>). However, if the ancestor had previously evolved with a biased spectrum (e.g., our WT), the population would have already sampled many beneficial mutations within the class favoured by the existing bias. Hence, a shift in the opposite direction (e.g., in our Δ<italic>mutY</italic> strain) allows the population to explore mutational space that was previously under-sampled, increasing the probability of finding new beneficial mutations. Importantly, this means that the benefit of a specific mutation class (e.g., Tv) is not universal, but is context-dependent. Increased sampling of any mutational class that was previously poorly explored would therefore be beneficial. Thus, after a period of evolving with a new spectrum, a change in the fitness landscape (e.g., due to epistasis or environmental change) may again render a spectrum shift advantageous. Together, these results generate two additional, broad predictions: (a) starting from an unbiased spectrum, a biased spectrum can only evolve through drift, and (b) after a period of adaptation with a specific mutation bias (and/or following environmental change), reversing the bias becomes beneficial. We tested the second prediction using a broad phylogenetic analysis of bacterial taxa, expecting that evolutionary shifts in mutation spectra should be enriched in bias reversals.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Evolutionary transitions in DNA repair enzymes indicate mutation spectrum reversals in most bacterial lineages</title><p id="P16">Altering DNA repair function is a simple and instantaneous mechanism to generate spectrum shifts.

Broadly consistent with previous work with a few DNA repair genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>), we found frequent evolutionary transitions in most repair enzymes with known spectrum effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>), as well as for 33 other genes with unknown effects on mutation spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13</xref>). Using the predicted set of enzymes present in each hypothetical ancestor (nodes), we estimated the Tv and GC→AT bias at each node relative to WT <italic>E. coli</italic> and traced the change in relative bias over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S14A</xref>). Consistent with our simulation results, successive enzyme gain or loss events led to a bias reversal in &gt;80% lineages, and we observed only a few cases of reinforced bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). This is distinct from the pattern expected by chance (10,000 phylogenetic stochastic simulations using similar enzyme transition rates; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S14B</xref>). Notably, bias reversals are more frequent than expected (one-sample t-tests, Tv bias: t = - 72.38, p&lt;2x10<sup>-16</sup>; GC→AT bias: t = -59.42, p&lt;2x10<sup>-16</sup>) while reinforcements are less frequent than expected (Tv bias: t = -72.38, p&lt;2x10<sup>-16</sup>; GC→AT bias: t = -59.42, p&lt;2x10<sup>-16</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S14C–D</xref>). Hence, our results cannot be attributed to peculiarities of the enzyme set, tree topology, or number of evolutionary transitions. Instead, we suggest that such frequent bias reversals likely reflect selection on mutation rate and/or spectrum. Although it is difficult to separate these effects, two pieces of evidence suggest that the observed dynamics at least partly reflect selection for reversal of mutation spectra. First, enzymes with a weak effect on mutation rate but a strong impact on spectrum are also highly dynamic (e.g. <italic>ung</italic> and <italic>mutM;</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S12</xref>). Second, for enzymes with a strong impact on both mutation rate and spectrum, either bias reversals or reinforcements would change mutation rates. Hence, selection for mutation rate alone cannot explain the higher-than-expected frequency of bias reversals that we observe.</p><p id="P17">We discuss here a few limitations of this analysis. First, reconstruction of ancestral character states in phylogenetic datasets is not always accurate and does not account for uncertainty in the underlying phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). Second, the estimated biases do not account for other repair enzymes whose effects on the mutation spectrum are unknown, or for variation in the impact of enzyme loss or gain. We also likely underestimate the actual number of bias shifts because we could not include cases where repair function may be altered without gene deletion (e.g., due to loss-of-function point mutations). However, given the lack of relevant empirical data for most bacteria, the values we report are our best estimates of the mutation biases of diverse bacteria relative to <italic>E. coli</italic>, and quantify at least a proportion of the “true” changes in mutation spectra that have occurred across lineages. Available experimental data also show that the qualitative effects of deleting a specific DNA repair enzyme are largely consistent across species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S13</xref>), suggesting that the broad trends observed here should be robust. Finally, recent work indicates similar dynamics of genes involved in DNA repair in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>) and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Thus, sustained shifts in mutation spectra likely occur frequently, and their long-term impacts on the pool of genetic variants available for selection deserve further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P18">We show that pervasive mutational biases can evolve by genetic drift, whereas shifts in the strength and direction of bias could evolve under selection. Thus, a species’ evolutionary history may be sufficient to explain the evolution of genomic bias (e.g., in base composition), without invoking specific underlying mechanisms or selection favouring particular mutational classes. Previous work showed that the transversion-biased mutators Δ<italic>mutT</italic> and <italic>AmutY</italic> have distinct DFEs for antibiotic resistance compared to WT, but the effect was attributed to transversions being more beneficial for the specific antibiotic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). However, by recasting the puzzle of mutational biases as a problem of searching a vast and dynamic mutational space, our model allows broad generalization across mutation spectra. We suggest that the rarity of species with unbiased mutation spectra is not surprising, since shifts from unbiased to biased spectra may occur easily and frequently via changes in DNA repair function and are unopposed by selection. Hence, a biased spectrum should be the norm rather than the exception.</p><p id="P19">While it is well established that access to <underline><italic>more</italic></underline> mutations (through an increased mutation rate) is advantageous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), here we demonstrate that accessing <underline><italic>different</italic></underline> mutations can likewise provide an advantage. Our results have important implications for the evolution of mutator genotypes, in which shifts in mutation spectra and mutation rates are often (though not always) entangled. Mutator dynamics are governed by the genetic load and supply of beneficial mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). In a new environment (away from fitness optima), these parameters are primarily driven by mutators’ high mutation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>) – particularly under strong selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>) – allowing them to hitchhike with beneficial mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). We show here that the genome-wide beneficial supply rate is strongly influenced by the mutation spectrum across environments, and this effect is strongest in well-adapted populations. Further, we predict that the advantage of a high mutation rate should be enhanced if accompanied by a reversal of the ancestral spectrum, but diminished otherwise. A recent simulation study also predicts that differences in the mutation spectrum of mutators can change the magnitude of deleterious mutations; such differences can facilitate the loss of mutators under selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Thus, mutation rate and spectrum may jointly govern the observed rise, persistence, and fall of mutators under selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Such effects may explain why mutators with relatively small increases in mutation rate are also abundant in natural bacterial populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>), and deserve further attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>) with theoretical and experimental analyses to dissect the role of mutation rate vs. spectrum.</p><p id="P20">Together with studies showing that mutation biases are pervasive and influence the genetic basis of adaptation under diverse conditions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Introduction</xref>), our results demonstrate that mutation spectra may be important drivers of adaptation and innovation under myriad scenarios. When the beneficial mutation supply is limited by the existing spectrum, an antiparallel (opposite direction on the same axis) or orthogonal jump (on a different axis of the spectrum) could enhance sampling of new beneficial mutations, facilitating rapid adaptation. Our phylogenetic analysis likely underestimated such evolutionary shifts in mutation spectra, which may occur even more frequently on shorter timescales via horizontal transfer and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>), and drive polymorphism in spectra across natural bacterial isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). We predict multiple cascading effects of shifts in mutation spectra, including a reduction in the waiting time for beneficial mutations, decreased likelihood of mutational meltdown under genetic drift, and distinct genetic pathways of adaptation. We hope that future work will test these predictions.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Methods Summary</title><p id="P21">Here, we provide a summary of the methods important to understand our study.

In an NK fitness landscape, each locus in the sequence is randomly assigned K neighbours from among all loci in the model. The fitness contribution of locus i (ωi) then depends on the state of that locus and the state of its neighbours.

Some types of mutations occur more often than others, but the direction and degree of such mutational biases varies. How do mutational biases evolve, and do they influence evolution? We experimentally measured the immediate effects of changing the mutation bias of <italic>E. coli</italic>, and used simulations to test the long-term effects. Altering mutational bias is beneficial whenever the new bias increases sampling of mutational classes that were previously under-sampled. We also show that historically, bacteria have often experienced such beneficial bias switches. Our work demonstrates the importance of mutational biases in evolution. By allowing exploration of new mutational space, altered mutation biases could drive rapid adaptation even in constant environments.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Mutator DFEs have a larger fraction of beneficial mutations than WT.</title><p>Stacked bar plots show the observed proportion of beneficial (f<sub>b</sub>), deleterious and neutral mutations in WT and mutator (Mut).

Boxplots (colored by strain and mutation class) show median, quartiles and range of relative fitness effects of mutations (open diamonds: outliers). Each boxplot was constructed with n x 16 data points (n = number of mutations, shown below each plot; pooled effects from 16 environments). Black horizontal lines: fitness impact = 0.
