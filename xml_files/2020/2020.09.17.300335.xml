<abstract>
<p id="P1">The yeast <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> is a cost-effective and easily scalable system for recombinant protein production. In this work we compared the conformation of the receptor binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein expressed in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> and in the well established HEK-293T mammalian cell system. RBD obtained from both yeast and mammalian cells was properly folded, as indicated by UV-absorption, circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence. They also had similar stability, as indicated by temperature-induced unfolding (observed <italic>T<sub>m</sub>
</italic> were 50°C and 52°C for RBD produced in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> and HEK-293T cells, respectively). Moreover, the stability of both variants was similarly reduced when the ionic strength was increased, in agreement with a computational analysis predicting that a set of ionic interactions may stabilize RBD structure. Further characterization by HPLC, size-exclusion chromatography and mass spectrometry revealed a higher heterogeneity of RBD expressed in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> relative to that produced in HEK-293T cells, which disappeared after enzymatic removal of glycans. The production of RBD in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> was scaled-up in a bioreactor, with yields above 45 mg/L of 90% pure protein, thus potentially allowing large scale immunizations to produce neutralizing antibodies, as well as the large scale production of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The COVID-19 outbreak was first recognized in December 2019 in Wuhan, China<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Since then, this virus has spread to all parts of the world, resulting in a total of 29415168 infected individuals and 931934 deaths by September 14<sup>th</sup>, 2020 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.coronatracker.com">https://www.coronatracker.com</ext-link>). The causative agent is a coronavirus that causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) has been designated as SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p id="P3">Coronaviruses are enveloped non-segmented positive sense RNA viruses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup> that have four open reading frames (ORFs) for structural proteins -Spike, Envelope, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid-<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>, from which Spike is the primary determinant of CoVs tropism. Spike mediates the viral and cellular membrane fusion by binding mainly to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a homologue of ACE<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">The SARS-CoV-2 genome has 29903 nucleotides in length<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>, sharing 79% and 50% sequence identity with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV genomes, respectively<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. Genetic studies suggest that both viruses originated from bat CoVs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>, with civet cats as intermediate hosts in the case of SARS-CoV-1<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>, and pangolins in the case of SARS-CoV-2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. Among the structural proteins, the Envelope protein has the highest sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 (96% identity), while the Spike protein, responsible for the interaction with the host receptor, the largest sequence divergence (76% identity with SARS-CoV-1)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. It has been suggested that the divergence of Spike could be related to an increased immune pressure<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Consistently with the proposed role of pangolins as SARS-CoV-2 intermediate hosts, CoVs from pangolins share the highest genetic similarity with this virus in the region encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">Due to its important role for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell, Spike is the most studied protein of this virus. This transmembrane glycosylated protein is composed of 1273 amino acid assemblies as a homotrimer that forms spikes that protrude from the virus envelope. Spike has two domains, named S1 and S2. Residues 319-591 from S1 correspond to the RBD, responsible for the interaction with ACE2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. RBD binds with high affinity to the ACE2, located on the outer surface of the cell membrane, which acts as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor since it mediates the fusion of the virus to the cell membrane<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. Spike also includes a transmembrane domain and a fusion peptide<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that internal motions of the Spike trimer are important to expose the RBD domain so it can interact with the target receptor. However, part of the time RBD domain is hidden within the rest of the Spike protein, and this process is mediated by protein motions of high amplitude. The structure of RBD-ACE2 protein complex and the structure of Spike (as the full-length and trimeric form of the protein) were determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P7">RBD is a protein domain of 220 residues, it has nine cysteine residues (eight of them forming disulfide bonds) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and two <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites (N331 and N343). The addition of glycan moieties might have a relevant role on the <italic>in vivo</italic> protein folding process, on the dynamics, stability and solvent accessibility of RBD and also on its immunogenicity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. RBD is not a globular protein domain; it has a central twisted antiparallel beta-sheet formed by five strands decorated with secondary structure elements (short helices and strands) and loops<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. The secondary structure analysis of the protein shows 12.4% helix, 33.0% sheet, 19.1% turn, and 35.6% coil.</p>
<p id="P8">Despite its medium size of 25 kDa, RBD is an example of a challenging protein domain to express in heterologous systems due to its complex topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Nevertheless, it is of high importance to produce and purify RBD at low-cost and efficiently, since this domain is extensively used for the development of serological test kits as well as an immunogen, both for the production of animal immune sera and for vaccine development<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. While <italic>E. coli</italic> is a cost-efficient system for the expression of many proteins, it is unlikely to be the case for RBD due to its requirement of disulfide bond formation and glycosylation for its proper expression and folding. For this reason, RBD is usually expressed in mammalian as well as insect cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P9">The methylotrophic yeast <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> is an alternative cost-effective eukaryotic system that allows relatively easy scaling-up of recombinant protein production, and which has previously been used for the expression of SARS-CoV-1 RBD to produce a vaccine<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. This yeast can use methanol as an exclusive carbon source. This molecule is also an inductor of the strong and tightly regulated AOX1 promoter<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>, which can therefore be used to drive recombinant protein expression. When cultured in bioreactors, <italic>P. pastoris</italic> can reach high cell densities, and more importantly, this organism allows the efficient secretion of recombinant proteins to the culture medium, which contains relatively low levels of endogenous proteins, thus allowing the straightforward purification of recombinant secretory proteins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P10">In this work we expressed and purified SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD from two different systems -the yeast <italic>P. pastoris</italic> and mammalian cells- and compared their structure, stability, glycosylation status, and immunogenicity in mice. Our work provides useful insights on the production of a key protein used in diagnosis and therapeutics to fight COVID-19 pandemia.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 RBD Protein Sequence analysis</title>
<p id="P11">Prior to designing the constructs to express Spike RBD domain from SARS-CoV-2 we looked for possible variation in its coding sequence in genomes publicly available at the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gisaid.org">https://www.gisaid.org</ext-link>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. From a total of 75355 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences available at GISAID, 85.8% (64,707 genomes) have 100% coverage of RBD (non truncated Spike proteins) with 100% of amino acid identity to the first published RBD sequence (Uniprot: QHN73795.1)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. This data set includes 38 Argentinean SARS-CoV-2 genomes. RBD sequences from the remaining genomes (14.2%) were distributed as follows: 3.5 % (6199/64707) have more than 99% of amino acid sequence identity (up to 2 amino acid substitutions or InDels), 1.4% (925/64707) have more than 80% (up to 44 amino acid substitutions or InDels) and only 300 genomes have a lower amino acid identity relative to the first published sequence. Thus, we considered appropriate to express the predominant RBD form, spanning from residue 319 to 537 of Spike protein, which consists of a relatively compact domain, and includes a slightly disordered C-terminal stretch useful for protein engineering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Expression of RBD in mammalian and yeast cells</title>
<p id="P12">The expression of RBD in mammalian cells (HEK-293T cell line) and in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> yielded significant quantities of protein (~5 and 10-13 mg L<sup>-1</sup> of cell culture, respectively, at a laboratory scale). In both cases, the recombinant protein was fused to appropriate secretion signal peptides, IL2 export signal peptide for HEK-293T expression and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae α</italic>-factor secretion signal for <italic>P. pastoris</italic> expression. Both secretion signals allowed the recovery of mature RBD from cell culture supernatants.</p>
<p id="P13">Since RBD expressed in both eukaryotic systems included a C- terminal His tag, similar purification protocols were used in both cases. However, given that the physico-chemical conditions required for optimal growth of mammalian and yeast cells were completely different (HEK-293T cells were grown at 37°C in a medium buffered to pH 7.4, while <italic>P. pastoris</italic> were grown at 28°C, buffered to pH 6.0), the covalent structure, intactness, conformation, post translational modifications and stability of RBD might still differ depending on the expression system used. Additionally, both strategies involved the accumulation of soluble RBD in the supernatant, which can pose an extra challenge for unstable proteins. For these reasons, it was crucial to evaluate parameters such as protein aggregation, oxidation, and possible alterations in disulfide bond patterns of proteins obtained from the different media.</p>
<p id="P14">NTA-Ni<sup>2+</sup>-purified RBD from both HEK-293T and yeast exhibited high purity (&gt;90%), as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). RBD from HEK-293T cells migrated as a 35 KDa single-smear band in SDS-PAGE 12%, while RBD produced in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> migrated as one highly diffuse and more abundant band of ~45-40 kDa, and a less abundant band of ~35 kDa, the latter similar to that of RBD produced in HEK-293T cells.</p>
<p id="P15">HPLC profile analysis revealed that RBD produced in HEK-293T cells is highly homogeneous, as shown by its elution as a sharp peak at 48-49 % of acetonitrile in a reverse phase C18 column, while RBD produced in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> showed a considerably broader peak, although it eluted at very similar acetonitrile concentration. In addition, two very small peaks appeared in the chromatogram of RBD produced in <italic>P. pastoris.</italic> The area corresponding to the full-length protein was approximately 87%.</p>
<p id="P16">The SDS-PAGE analysis of RBD purified from yeast and mammalian cell culture supernatants suggested the existence of glycosylation as the main post-traslational modification in RBD, as its theoretical mass (deduced from the amino acid sequence) is ~26 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), while both recombinant RBD forms migrated as products of more than 32-35 kDa. This was expected, since two <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation consensus sequences (NIT and NAT) are present at RBD N-terminal region. RBD from SARS-CoV-1 also bears three glycosylation sites at its N-terminal region, and was found to be glycosylated<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>

<p id="P17">Even though Coomassie Blue staining showed heterogeneity in protein size, incubation with PNGaseF, a peptide-endoglycanase that removes high mannose, complex and hybrid N-glycans from proteins, homogenized all isoforms to a sharper band of ~25-26 kDa, compatible with the predicted MW of deglycosylated RBD (26.5 kDa, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The decrease in the molecular mass of RBD by endoglycanase digestion confirmed the existence of <italic>N</italic>-glycosylations in both proteins. Moreover, glycans from <italic>P. pastoris-</italic> RBD - and not from HEK-293T-RBD - were also removed by EndoH, an endoglycanase that eliminates only high-mannose type glycans, which are the expected type in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> yeasts. These results strongly suggest that RBD from mammalian cells bears only complex or hybrid glycans, while RBD from <italic>P. pastoris</italic> only bears high mannose glycans. Moreover, the persistence of two bands in RBD from HEK-293T cells after exhaustive deglycosylation with PNGaseF suggests the existence of heterogeneous <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation, although heterogeneity in amino acid sequence cannot be discarded either.</p>

<title>Conformational characterization of RBD forms by UV absorption</title>
<p id="P21">Different analytical techniques were used to characterize proteins produced in yeast or mammalian cells. The UV absorption spectra of both recombinant proteins were very similar; they are dominated by a high content of tyrosine residues (16 Tyr, 2 Trp, 15 Phe, 4 disulfide bonds), as indicated by bands at approximately 276.0 and 281.0 nm. The absence of light scattering -suggested by the absence of a typical slope between 340 and 300 nm- strongly indicated that the proteins do not form soluble aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). However, freezing and thawing resulted in protein precipitation when RBD concentration was higher than 80 μM (data not shown).</p>
<p id="P22">The fourth derivative of absorption spectra can be used to evaluate RBD native conformation. Spectra corresponding to RBD produced in HEK-293T cells and <italic>P. pastoris</italic> were superimposable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6B and C</xref>), suggesting a similar packing of the aromatic residues. In particular, the positive band at 290.4 nm corresponding to Trp residues observed in the native state of RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>) showed a significant red shift compared to the 288 nm band of N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide (NATA), suggesting that Trp residues in RBD are not fully exposed to the solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Also the negative band at 287.8 nm (a contribution of Tyr and Trp residues) showed a significant red shift compared to that observed for the fully exposed NATA and N-acetyl-L-tyrosinamide, NAYA. Similarly, a band corresponding to Tyr (280.4 nm) showed a shift to 279 nm (NAYA).</p>

<p id="P24">RBD produced in mammalian and <italic>P. pastoris</italic> cells showed superimposable far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>), suggesting a similar secondary structure. Moreover, the CD spectra are identical to that observed for RBD from SARS-CoV-1 produced in yeast<sup>

However, given the particular shapes of the <italic>P. pastoris</italic> and HEK-293T SARS-CoV-2 RBD far-UV CD spectra (which show a single minimum at 206 nm and a maximum at 230 nm, the latter suggesting the contribution of aromatic residues to the spectra), it is difficult to estimate the secondary structure content by using standard sets of spectra.</p>
<p id="P25">We further studied the conformation of RBD produced in HEK-293T cells or <italic>P. pastoris</italic> by tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy. Spectra corresponding to the native forms of RBD superimposed very well, suggesting that these aromatic residues are located in similar, apolar environments, as inferred by the maximal emission wavelengths observed (337 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>). The addition of 4.0 M GdmCl resulted in a red shift to 353-354 nm, a result compatible with the exposure of the aromatic side chains to the solvent, and the total unfolding of the protein forms. Interestingly, unfolding of RBD produced in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> showed reversibility when 4.0 M GdmCl was diluted to 0.7 or 1.0 M, as judged by the blue shift from 353 to 337 nm and form 353 to 342 nm, respectively. No reducing agents (<italic>e.g.</italic> DTT, 2-mercaptoethanol) were added to the protein sample, indicating that the dimension of the conformational space corresponding to the unfolded state of RBD was constrained by the native disulfide bonds.</p>
<p id="P26">The conformational stability of different RBD forms was studied through temperature unfolding experiments.

<p id="P28">The RBD crystallographic structure analysis indicates that residues have a particular distribution according to their type. The core subdomain (residues 333-442 and 504-526 on the Spike protein) is enriched in non-polar residues, whereas the receptor-binding motif (RBM) subdomain (residues 443-503) is enriched in polar ones. On the other hand, the charged residues are preferentially located close to the interface between the Core and RBM subdomains and form an electrostatic network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
<p id="P29">Among the 14 positively and negatively charged residue pairs interacting at a distance lower than 6 Å, 8 are in the core subdomain, 5 in the RBM, and 1 pair is between the Core and RBM subdomains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 3</xref>). The existence of 6 ionic pair interactions involving at least one occluded charged residue (D398, E406, D442, R454, D467, and R509) is also remarkable.</p>
<p id="P30">The importance of these interactions merits further analysis, as they may modulate the conformational dynamics of the RBM, the transitions of the RBD in the Spike trimmer, and/or the interaction with the ACE2 receptor.</p>

After a spike of dissolved oxygen, the glycerol fed-batch phase was initiated by regulating the feeding in response to the level of dissolved oxygen (DO %). Glycerol feeding was maintained for 22 h, when biomass concentration reached a value of 60.4 g DCW/L. After glycerol feeding was stopped, the transition stage was performed by feeding with a glycerol (600 g/L):methanol (3:1) mixture for 5 h, to allow a slow cell adaptation for the efficient utilization of methanol. At the end of this stage the biomass level reached 63.2 g DCW/L. Next, the methanol fed-batch phase was initiated to induce recombinant RBD expression, through regulation of pure methanol feeding according to DO %. After 48 h of methanol induction and a total fermentation time of 93 h, the culture reached a biomass concentration of 75.3 g DCW/L, which produced a final RBD yield of 45.0 mg/L (&gt;90% pure). Beyond that time point there was no significant change in cell concentration and antigen expression level (data not shown). At the end of the fermentation, a final volume of 5.5 liters of culture was reached, so that the total amount of RBD obtained was 247.5 mg, the volumetric productivity was 0.48 mg/L h, and the total productivity 2.66 mg/h.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P33">This work materialized the first two goals of our consortium assembled to fight COVID-19 pandemia: (a) to express and characterize RBD from SARS-CoV-2, and (b) to produce RBD at low cost with high yield. We were able to express this protein in two different systems: <italic>P. pastoris</italic> and mammalian cells (HEK-293T), which allowed us to gain useful insights concerning RBD conformation and stability.</p>
<p id="P34">We attempted to express RBD in <italic>E. coli,</italic> even though an examination of its structure suggested that this system would not be suited for its expression due to the existence of 4 disulfide bonds and a non-globular shape. The <italic>E. coli</italic> SHuffle expression system only yielded insoluble RBD (in inclusion bodies) as expected, which was not further characterized as it was unsuitable for downstream applications (data not shown). In agreement with our results, in a previous attempt to express the similar RBD from SARS-CoV-1 Spike in <italic>E. coli,</italic> this protein was also found in the insoluble fraction, and neither its fusion to thioredoxin, nor to maltose-binding protein, increased its solubility. Moreover, while tagging the protein with glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) increased its solubility<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>, it remained strongly bound to the bacterial chaperone GroEL even after affinity purification<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>, thus making it unsuitable for downstream applications.</p>
<p id="P35">By contrast, RBD expression in HEK-293T and <italic>P. pastoris</italic> eukaryotic cells produced soluble and properly folded polypeptides. Their UV-absorption, CD and Trp-fluorescence spectra showed high similarity with those previously described for SARS-CoV-1 RBD produced in <italic>P. pastoris<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>.</italic> RBD expressed in both eukaryotic systems was also characterized by controlled proteolysis and mass spectrometry analysis. Remarkably, the peptide of sequence FPNITNLCPFGEVFNATR was not easily detected by mass spectrometry. A plausible and straightforward explanation for this result is that glycosylation of this peptide at positions N331 (NIT) and N343 (NAT) increases its mass, and thus takes the peptide out of the range of mass analysis. The sequence coverage corresponding to a similar N-terminal peptide of RBD produced in HEK-293T cells was also lower than expected as the peptide VQPTESIVR was not detected, which might be due to the presence of <italic>O</italic>-glycosylations in this stretch.</p>
<p id="P36">Proteins translocated to the ER are <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated cotranslationally, and exactly the same glycan Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> is transferred to the N residue in the consensus sequence NXS/T (where X cannot be P) of mammalian, plant and yeast proteins. Glc residues are immediately removed in the ER, where glycans play a key role in the solubility of the glycoproteins and in the so-called “quality control of glycoprotein folding”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. Cycles of glucosylation and deglucosylation occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) until the glycoprotein is folded and continues the transit through the secretory pathway or, if unable to fold properly, is retrotranslocated to the cytosol and degraded by the proteasomes. This mechanism guarantees that only properly folded proteins are secreted. Once glycoproteins leave the ER, <italic>N</italic>-glycans are remodeled in the transit through the golgi apparatus and acquire glycan structures that are species specific. In yeast <italic>N</italic>-glycans in mature proteins are of high mannose type while in mammalian proteins are of complex or hybrid type<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>. <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation of S or T residues may also occur in the Golgi, but in this case the monosaccharides are added step by step, and are species specific. When RBD purified from <italic>P. pastoris</italic> and HEK-293T cells were treated with PNGaseF, which removes both high mannose and complex <italic>N</italic>-glycans, a similar band of ~26 KDa was observed by SDS-PAGE for both proteins, in agreement with the expected molecular weight of the proteins lacking <italic>N</italic>-glycans. However, only in the case of RBD obtained from <italic>P. pastoris</italic> the same band was observed when proteins were treated with EndoH, which removes high mannose glycans, indicating that RBD from <italic>P. pastoris</italic> bears only the expected high mannose <italic>N</italic>-glycans, while RBD from HEK-293T likely bears complex or hybrid ones. It has been previously reported that SARS-CoV-2 RBD is produced as two predominantly <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated forms of~34 and ~27 kDa when expressed in Sf9 insect cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P37">Exhaustive removal of <italic>N</italic>-glycans RBD obtained from HEK-293T cells produced two protein forms that migrated as distinct bands, suggesting the presence of either two <italic>O</italic>-glycosylated isoforms, or of two peptide isoforms. Shajahan and coworkers have evaluated the <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein produced in HEK-293 cells by searching LC-MS/MS data for common <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation modifications. These authors found <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation sites at positions T323 and S325, which provides further support to our suggestion<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P38">For secretory recombinant proteins produced in yeast, high mannose hyperglycosylation may be a major issue, as it may potentially alter functional properties of the proteins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup>. However, even though RBD expressed in HEK-293T and <italic>P. pastoris</italic> exhibited different glycosylation patterns, both conformational and stability studies carried out in the present work suggest that both polypeptides have similar structures. The stability of both forms was similarly sensitive to changes in ionic strength, a result in good agreement with our computational modelling, which predicts that a set of ionic interactions stabilizes RBD structure and most likely modulates its internal motions. Interestingly, when RBD was unfolded in the absence of reducing agents the process was reversible, as judged by the analysis of Trp fluorescence spectra, which suggests that Trp residue emission occurs in an apolar and likely more rigid environment upon refolding.</p>
<p id="P39">Previously, the thermal stability of a mutated version of RBD from SARS-CoV-1 Spike named RBD219-N1 (residues 319-536 from Spike, where the first Asn of RBD, residue 318, was deleted to avoid glycosylation at the N-terminal region of the protein) was analyzed by thermal shift monitoring of extrinsic fluorescence<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. Remarkably, the RBD219-N1 denaturation profile showed an average melting temperature of approximately 57°C, a value significantly higher than that observed for RBD from SARS-CoV-2 in this work (approximately 50°C), which might be due to the fact that denaturation of RBD219-N1 was carried out at a considerably lower ionic strength<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. In addition, the pH of the protein sample was not constant throughout the experiment, given that the p<italic>Ka</italic> of the Tris buffer used in this work is highly temperature dependent. Alternatively, the suppression of the N-terminal glycosylation in SARS-CoV-1 RBD might have an effect on its conformational stability. Nevertheless, the possibility that SARS-CoV-1 RBD has particular features that might increase its stability relative to that of SARS-CoV-2 RBD should not be excluded.</p>
<p id="P40">In our hands, RBD in its native state was stable under a broad range of pH and concentrations. Although it exhibited a low tendency to aggregate at high concentrations, no significant complications were observed during filter-protein concentration or dialysis, which was performed either to change the buffer or to remove imidazole after protein purification. Freezing (-80°C) and subsequent thawing of RBD did not result in protein aggregation at protein concentrations of 30-40 <italic>μ</italic> M or lower, therefore this strategy was used for its storage, as it made unnecessary the use of stabilizing molecules such as glycerol or trehalose. However, it should be noted that RBD precipitation was occasionally observed after thawing, at protein concentrations above 80 <italic>μ</italic> M.</p>
<p id="P41">
<italic>P. pastoris-produced</italic> RBD was able to stimulate antibody production in mice, and the resulting immune sera were capable of detecting RBD produced not only in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> but also in HEK-293T cells. Finally, scaling up of RBD expression in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> could be performed in a bioreactor with yields greater than 45 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, which potentially allows the large scale immunization of animals in order to produce neutralizing antibodies, or the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Future biotechnological developments will be facilitated by the inclusion of a Sortase-A enzyme recognition site within the RBD coding sequence, which allows the native covalent coupling of RBD to fluorescent probes, peptides, proteins, or modified surfaces, through an efficient transpeptidation reaction<sup>

After sterilization, 3.5 mL per liter of filtered biotin solution (0.02 % w/v) and 3.5 mL per liter of trace metal solution (PTM1) were added. PTM1 contained per liter: 6.0 g copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate, 0.08 g sodium iodide, 3.0 g manganese sulfate-monohydrate, 0.2 g sodium molybdate-dihydrate, 0.02 g boric acid, 0.5 g cobalt chloride, 20.0 g zinc chloride, 65.0 g ferrous sulfate-heptahydrate, 0.2 g biotin and 5 mL sulfuric acid 5.0 mL.</p>

The first stage consisted in a batch culture using LSM medium with 40 g L <sup>-1</sup> glycerol as carbon source and supplemented with 3.5 mL L<sup>-1</sup> PTM1 and 3.5 mL L<sup>-1</sup> biotin solution (0.02 % w/v). Under these conditions yeast cells grew and reached high biomass levels without expression of RBD, as it was under the control of <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter, which is repressed when glycerol is provided as an unlimited substrate. In the second phase, a glycerol solution (600 g L<sup>-1</sup> solution supplemented with 12 mL L<sup>-1</sup> PTM1) was fed into the culture at a growth-limiting rate to increase cell concentration. At the same time, a gradual derepression of <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter takes place under this glycerol-limited condition. This phase was initiated after glycerol depletion was evidenced by an oxygen spike. Glycerol feeding was automatically regulated according to the percentage of dissolved oxygen (DO %) in the culture, with a cut-off of 60 % saturation. Subsequently, a short transition stage was conducted by feeding a glycerol:methanol (3:1) mixture, thus allowing the adaptation of cells for the growth in the presence of methanol. Finally, the induction stage was carried out by adding pure methanol (supplemented with 12 ml L<sup>-1</sup> PTM1) in a fed-batch mode with a growth-limiting rate. Methanol feeding was also automatically regulated according to the level of DO % in the culture, with a cut-off 50 % saturation.</p>

Temperature was maintained at 30 ± 1°C throughout batch and glycerol fed-batch phases and at 25 ± 1°C during transition and induction stages. The pH was maintained at 5.0 during the first two phases, and at 5.5 in the last two, by adding H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (42.5%) and 14% (v/v) NH<sub>4</sub>OH, which also served as a nitrogen source. DO % was regulated by an agitation cascade (maximum of 1200 rpm) and supplemented with filter-sterilized (0.22 μm) air and pure oxygen when needed. The pH was measured using a pH electrode (Mettler-Toledo GmbH, Germany), and the oxygen concentration was measured with a polarographic probe (InPro6110/320, Mettler-Toledo GmbH). Foam formation was avoided by the addition of 3 % (v/v) antifoam 289 (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO).

After blocking with 8% non-fat dry milk PBS for 2h at 37°C the plates were washed 5 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). Serially diluted mouse sera were incubated at 37°C for 1.5 h in PBS containing 1% non-fat dry milk (blocking solution), and then the plates were washed with PBST. For total specific IgG determination, IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (DAKO P0447) was diluted 1/1000 in blocking solution and added to the wells. After incubation for 1 h at 37°C, plates were washed 5 times with PBST and developed with 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbiphenyldiamine (TMB) for 15 min. The reaction was stopped with 50 μl/well of 1.0 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (stop solution). The absorbance was measured in a microplate reader (Thermo Multiscan FC ELISA) at 450 nm (A<sub>450</sub>). The antibody titer was determined as the inverse of the last dilution that was considered positive, with a cut-off value defined as A<sub>450</sub>= 0.20, which was twice as high as that from a pool of Normal mice Sera (from 30 unimmunized animals). Statistical significance was evaluated by the Student’s t-test, using a logarithmic transformation of the ELISA titers. Differences were considered significant if p &lt; 0.05.</p>
