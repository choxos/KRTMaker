<abstract>
<p id="P2">The coronavirus spike glycoprotein, located on the virion surface, is the key mediator of cell entry. As such, it is an attractive target for the development of protective antibodies and vaccines. Here we describe two human monoclonal antibodies, 1.6C7 and 28D9, that display a remarkable cross-reactivity against distinct species from three <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> subgenera, capable of binding the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and the endemic human coronavirus HCoV-OC43. Both antibodies, derived from immunized transgenic mice carrying a human immunoglobulin repertoire, blocked MERS-CoV infection in cells, whereas 28D9 also showed weak cross-neutralizing potential against HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in a neutralization-sensitive virus pseudotyping system, but not against authentic virus. Both cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies were found to target the stem helix in the spike protein S2 fusion subunit which, in the prefusion conformation of trimeric spike, forms a surface exposed membrane-proximal helical bundle, that is antibody- accessible. We demonstrate that administration of these antibodies in mice protects from a lethal MERS-CoV challenge in both prophylactic and/or therapeutic models. Collectively, these antibodies delineate a conserved, immunogenic and vulnerabe site on the spike protein which spurs the development of broad-range diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic measures against coronaviruses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">The Coronavrius Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which emerged in China, in late 2019 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. The virus belongs to the subgenus <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> of the genus <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> within the subfamily <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. Two other zoonotic coronaviruses emerged in the last 20 years and cause severe acute respiratory disease in humans, similar to that seen with SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV, which also belongs to the subgenus <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> and is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, crossed species barriers to humans in China in 2002, and caused worldwide ~8000 cases with a 10% mortality rate before it was contained in 2003 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. Ten years later in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (subgenus <italic>Merbecovirus</italic>, genus <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>) surfaced in Saudi Arabia. This virus is recurrently introduced in the human population from a dromedary camel reservoir with limited human-to-human spread and has led to ~2500 cases with approximately 35% of reported patients succumbing to the infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. In addition, four endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) circulate in humans, including HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 (genus <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>) and HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (subgenus <italic>Embecovirus</italic>, genus <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>). While these viruses are typically associated with mild respiratory illnesses (common colds) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>, they can cause significant morbitity, and even mortality, in immunocompromised individuals <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. All these viruses made their way into humans from an animal reservoir, illustrating the zoonotic threat posed by coronaviruses and their pandemic potential <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. The devastating socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic urges the development of intervention strategies that can mitigate outbreak of future emerging coronaviruses.</p>
<p id="P4">Identification of antibodies that broadly react with existing (human) coronaviruses could be of relevance to increase our level of pandemic preparedness. Such antibodies might be useful for virus diagnostics in the early stages of a pandemic. Moreover, their epitopes may enable development of antibody-based therapeutics or vaccines that provide broad protection not only against contemporary pathogens but also against those that likely emerge in the future <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. Although being identified for other virus families <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>, exploration of broadly reactive antibodies against coronaviruses is still in its infancy. Analysis of human polyclonal sera indicated that such cross-reactive antibodies might exist as one study reported that 25% of the convalescent SARS patients sera had low titers of antibodies that could neutralize MERS-CoV<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. In addition, Barnes <italic>et al.</italic> <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup> reported reactivity of purified plasma IgG from ten convalescent COVID-19 patients with the MERS-CoV spike protein, and a study by Wec <italic>et al.</italic> <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup> demonstrated that a subset of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibodies isolated from a convalescent SARS-CoV donor could react with one or more of the endemic HCoV spike proteins. However, little, if anything, is known about the functionalities and epitopes of these cross-reactive antibodies.</p>
<p id="P5">Coronavirus neutralizing antibodies target the trimeric spike (S) glycoproteins on the viral surface that mediate virus attachment and entry into the host cell. Several cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of trimeric spikes have been determined, with each comprising three S1 receptor binding subunits that collectively cap the trimeric S2 fusion subunit <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. Most antibodies neutralize coronavirus infection by binding to the receptor-binding subdomain of S1 and blocking receptor interactions. These antibodies are highly species specific and often strain specific due to a high sequence diversity in the receptor binding sites among coronaviruses, even for those that engage the same receptor (e.g. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>. Recently S1-targeting monoclonal antibodies have been identified that bind regions distal to the receptor binding site and that cross-neutralize coronaviruses within the <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> subgenus <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup> with <italic>in vivo</italic> protective efficacy <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup>, providing potential new leads for development of a pan-sarbecovirus vaccine. Neutralizing antibodies that broadly target coronaviruses from distinct (sub)genera are less likely to be found as the overall sequence identity among all coronaviruses spike proteins is low. Relative to the S1 subunit, the membrane-anchored S2 subunit, which mediates fusion of the viral and cellular membrane through receptor-induced conformational rearrangements, exhibits a higher level of protein sequence conservation across coronavirus spike proteins. Structural studies show exposed sites on the S2 base of the spike trimer that might be targeted by antibodies with cross-species specificity <sup>

<title>Cross-reactivity of human monoclonal antibodies 28D9 and 1.6C7 to spike proteins of viruses in the <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus</title>
<p id="P7">Five out of seven coronaviruses that are currently known to cause disease in humans belong to the <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (subgenus <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>), MERS-CoV (subgenus <italic>Merbecovirus</italic>), and the endemic human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (subgenus <italic>Embecovirus</italic>). To elicit and isolate betacoronavirus spike-targeting antibodies with cross-species specificity, we earlier immunized mice with trimeric spike ectodomains (Secto) of three human infecting betacoronaviruses from different subgenera (HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) following a sequential immunization scheme as described in Suppl. Fig. 1a <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. Transgenic H2L2 mice that encode the human immunoglobulin repertoire were used for immunization to develop fully human antibodies. We selected 203 hybridomas based on reactivity against at least one of the three spike antigens and screened their supernatants for cross-reactivity against five distinct betacoronavirus spike proteins by ELISA (Suppl. Fig. 1b). Based on their broad ELISA reactivity profile towards multiple coronavirus spike proteins, we selected antibody 28D9 as well as a previously isolated MERS-S human monoclonal antibody 1.6C7 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup>. Antibodies 1.6C7 and 28D9 were recombinantly expressed as human IgG1-isotype antibodies, and compared for their cross-reactivity profile, cross-neutralization capacity, mechanism of action, epitope characteristics and <italic>in vivo</italic> protective efficacy in subsequent experiments.</p>
<p id="P8">To determine the cross-reactivity of the 1.6C7 and 28D9 monoclonal antibodies we tested their binding to spike proteins of viruses in the <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus by ELISA. Equimolar coating of the different antigens was verified by an antibody targeting the Strep-tag located at the C-termini of all antigens. The 1.6C7 and 28D9 antibodies reacted with spike ectodomains of betacoronaviruses from different subgenera including MERS-CoV (subgenus <italic>Merbecovirus</italic>), SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (subgenus <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>), and HCoV-OC43 and MHV (subgenus <italic>Embecovirus</italic>), whereas no reactivity was seen with the spike ectodomain (S<sub>ecto</sub>) of HCoV-HKU1 (subgenus <italic>Embecovirus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Both mAbs bound equally well to MERS-S<sub>ecto</sub> and OC43-S<sub>ecto</sub>, shown by the ELISA-based half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) values. Compared to 1.6C7, 28D9 was superior in its cross-reactivity profile, with stronger binding to SARS-S<sub>ecto</sub>, SARS2-S<sub>ecto</sub> and MHV-S<sub>ecto</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Both antibodies reacted to S2 ectodomains (S2<sub>ecto</sub>) of MERS and MHV, indicating that their epitopes were located on the S2 fusion subunit of CoV spike proteins.</p>
<p id="P9">Biolayer interferometry was used to characterize the binding kinetics and affinity of the cross-reactive antibodies to CoV S<sub>ecto</sub> trimers immobilized on the surface of biosensors. The 1.6C7 mAb bound to the S<sub>ecto</sub> of MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, SARS- CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with equilibrium dissociation constants (<italic>K<sub>D</sub>
</italic>) of 0.58, 5.28 nM and 25.22 and 26.18 μM, respectively, whereas <italic>K<sub>D</sub>’s</italic> of the 28D9 mAb with these spike proteins were 0.72, 7.45, 3.17 and 5.96 nM, respectively (Suppl. Fig. 2).</p>
<p id="P10">To assess whether the 1.6C7 and 28D9 antibodies could bind the full-length (i.c. membrane-anchored) version of spike proteins, we tested their reactivity to cells transiently expressing different (GFP-tagged) CoV spike proteins using immunofluoresence microscopy and flow cytometry. Binding of 1.6C7 was observed both in permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells expressing the spike proteins of HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV and MHV, whereas 28D9 additionally bound to cells expressing the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, Suppl. Fig. 3 and Suppl. Table 1). No reactivity was seen for both antibodies to cells expressing the HCoV-HKU1 spike protein. These data demonstrate that both antibodies can react with full length spike proteins, with specificities that are consistent with the CoV S<sub>ecto</sub> ELISA reactivities.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Cross-neutralization capacity of mAbs 28D9 and 1.6C7 and mechanism of action</title>
<p id="P11">Next neutralizing activity by both antibodies against the targeted human coronaviruses was assessed. The 1.6C7 and 28D9 antibodies neutralize infection of MERS-S pseudotyped VSV (IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.39 and 0.13 μg/ml, respectively) as well as of authentic MERS-CoV (IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.083 and 0.93 μg/ml, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a and b</xref>). No neutralization was seen against authentic SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 by either of these antibodies, yet 28D9 displayed low levels of cross-neutralizing activity in the neutralization-sensitive pseudovirus system. 28D9 inhibited OC43-S, SARS-S and SARS2-S pseudotyped VSV infection with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 68.4, 60.5 and 45.3 μg/ml, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">To understand the mechanism of virus neutralization, we assessed antibody interference with spike-mediated receptor binding and membrane fusion activity. In line with our earlier observations for 1.6C7 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup>, we found that 28D9 inhibits MERS-S driven cell-cell fusion but does not impede MERS-S<sub>ecto</sub>/DPP4 receptor interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c and d</xref>), suggesting that both S2-targeting antibodies prevent the membrane fusion function of the spike S2 subunit that is required for infection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>mAbs 1.6C7 and 28D9 target a linear epitope located in the stem region of the S2 fusion subunit</title>
<p id="P13">Both antibodies were tested for competitive binding to MERS-S<sub>ecto</sub> using biolayer interferometry. MERS-S<sub>ecto</sub> binding by 1.6C7 antibody compelety prevented binding of 28D9, and vice versa, suggesting that the antibodies target overlapping epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). To assess the epitope conformational specificity, we compared the ELISA reactivity of 1.6C7 and 28D9 to untreated MERS-CoV S<sub>ecto</sub> antigen versus antigen that was heat-denatured in the presence of SDS and DTT. Both antibodies reacted equally well with non-denatured and denatured proteins, unlike a MERS-S1 targeting antibody 7.7G6 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup> that only reacted with non-denatured antigen. These data indicate that 1.6C7 and 28D9 likely bind a linear, contiguous sequence of amino acids in MERS-S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">As both antibodies may bind a linear epitope, we aimed to map their epitope location by ELISA using an array of overlapping synthetic peptides (30-mer peptides with an overlap of 15 residues) covering the conserved C-terminal part of the MERS-S2<sub>ecto</sub> (residues 869-1,288). Both antibodies appeared to bind a 15-residue-long region (MERS-S residues 1,229-1,243) positioned just upstream of the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) region in the MERS-S2 fusion subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Analysis of 1.6C7/28D9 antibody binding to N- and C-terminally truncated versions of the 15-mer peptide fragment designated the D<sup>1233</sup>ELDEFFK<sup>1240</sup> MERS-S protein segment as the minimal epitope region still affording some binding by both antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Fine mapping the 1.6C7 and 28D9 antibody binding sites on the spike protein by mutagenesis</title>
<p id="P15">To map residues critical for binding by the 1.6C7/28D9 antibodies, we performed ELISA-based epitope alanine scanning mutagenesis on the 15-mer spike peptide fragment comprising the linear epitope. The alanine scanning analysis of the 15-mer peptide fragment defined three residues (D<sup>1236</sup>, F<sup>1238</sup> and F<sup>1239</sup>) as critical to binding by both antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> and Suppl. Fig. 4), with another four residues (D<sup>1233</sup>, E<sup>1234</sup>, L<sup>1235</sup> and E<sup>1237</sup>) that contribute to binding by 28D9 and - to a lesser extent - by 1.6C7. To corroborate the epitope alanine scanning data, we assessed ELISA reactivity of the 1.6C7/28D9 antibodies to single site MERS-S<sub>ecto</sub> mutants containing alanine substitutions in the core epitope region. Consistent to the peptide alanine scanning, alanine substitution of the three residues D<sup>1236</sup>, F<sup>1238</sup> and F<sup>1239</sup> abrogated MERS-S<sub>ecto</sub> binding by both antibodies, but not that of the anti-MERS-S1 control antibody 7.7G6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">To assess the individual contribution to antibody binding of identified residues in the context of the membrane-anchored full-length spike protein, a flow cytometrybased assay was performed measuring antibody binding to cell-surface expressed MERS-S mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). The anti-MERS-S1 7.7G6 antibody was used to control cell surface expression levels of the single-site mutants. With the exception of the L<sup>1235</sup>A mutant, all mutant spike proteins displayed surface expression levels similar to wildtype. Alanine substitutions of residues in the MERS-S core epitope region (D<sup>1233</sup>ELDEFFK<sup>1240</sup>) reduced binding by both antibodies to a varying extent, although analysis of binding data for the L<sup>1235</sup>A mutant was compromised by reduced cell surface expression level. Consistent with the ELISA-based analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a and c</xref>), mutation of D<sup>1236</sup>, F<sup>1238</sup> and F<sup>1239</sup> most strongly affected binding by both antibodies. Both antibodies showed similar binding patterns in all three antigen binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, c-d</xref> and Suppl. Fig. 4), yet subtle differences in the reactivities were observed that may rationalize differences between these two antibodies and their cross-spike binding properties.</p>
<p id="P17">The identified residues in the spike epitope region (D<sup>1233</sup>ELDEFFK<sup>1240</sup> in MERS- S) contributing to 1.6C7/28D9 binding are not fully conserved in the targeted betacoronavirus spike proteins, with variations found in three residues (D<sup>1233</sup>, D<sup>1236</sup> and F<sup>1238</sup> in MERS-S) that are key to binding by both cross-reactive antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). To assess contribution of these amino acid variations to antibody reactivity, single site substitutions were made in MERS-S.

Substitution of D<sup>1233</sup> in MERS-S to serine (S, found in HKU1-S) or glutamic acid (E, found in SARS-, SARS2-, OC43- and MHV-S) still allowed efficient binding by both antibodies. In addition, but contrary to the MERS-S F<sup>1238</sup>A mutant, the MERS-S mutants in which F<sup>1238</sup> was replaced by a tryptophan (W, found in HKU1-, OC43- and MHV-S) or tyrosine (Y, found in SARS- and SARS2-S) maintained antibody binding reactivity. These data indicate a degree of sequence variability that is allowed in the epitope region without compromising antibody binding. Particularly, different aromatic residues (Phe, Trp and Tyr) seem to be permitted at residue position 1238. Conversely, the D<sup>1236</sup>S substitution in MERS-S (found in HKU1-S) fully abrogated binding by both antibodies. The reciprocal S<sup>1236</sup>D substitution in HKU1-S was sufficient to rescue binding by 28D9, and to a lesser extend by 1.6C7 (Suppl. Fig. 5). These data rationalize the ability of both antibodies to bind spike proteins of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, HCoV- OC43 and MHV as well as the inability of both antibodies to bind the HCoV-HKU1 spike protein. Evidently, epitope mapping of the two antibodies raised in two different animal immunization experiment revealed that they target the same epitope. We identified a third cross-reactive monoclonal antibody from an independent mouse immunization experiment (DNA+protein immunization), that targets the same site on betacoronavirus spike proteins (<bold>mAb 18H2</bold>, Suppl. Fig. 6), indicating that this epitope is immunogenic and efficient in the induction of cross-reactive antibodies.</p>
<p id="P18">Sequence analysis of the variable regions of the 1.6C7, 28D9 and 18H2 antibodies identified that their heavy and light chains were derived from the IGHV6-1 and IGKV4-1 germline precursor, respectively. Six somatic hypermutation were found in the VH region for 28D9, and five for 1.6C7. Seven somatic hypermutation were found in the VL region for 28D9, and two for 1.6C7 (Suppl. Fig. 7).</p>
<p id="P19">Glycans on antigens are frequently found to be a determinant for antibody binding. We found that antigen deglycosylation resulted in lower binding of 28D9 to OC43-S<sub>ecto</sub>, MHV-S<sub>ecto</sub> and SARS-S<sub>ecto</sub> using western blotting (Supl. Fig. 8a), in contrast to 1.6C7. We tested the involvement of an N-linked glycan located one residue downstream of the core epitope region (D<sup>1233</sup>ELDEFFK<sup>1240</sup>) in MERS-S. This N-glycosylation sequon (NxS/T) is conserved among betacoronavirus spike protein orthologous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Deletion of the N<sup>1241</sup> glycosylation site in MERS-S<sub>ecto</sub> did not impair binding by both antibodies in ELISA (Suppl. Fig. 8b). In contrast, deletion of the orthologous glycosylation site (N<sup>1241</sup>) in OC43-S<sub>ecto</sub> fully abrogated ELISA-reactivity of 28D9, whereas that of 1.6C7 was virtually unchanged. These data collectively indicate that epitope features required for 28D9 binding varied among the betacoronavirus spike proteins, with differential involvement of an N-linked glycan in antigen binding.</p>

Spike protein peptide microarray analysis with five human and four dromedary camel MERS-CoV-positive sera on 905 overlapping peptides covering the entire spike protein ectodomain (MERS-S residues 1-1,296) identified sixteen linear core epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> and Suppl.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P25">We report two human monoclonal antibodies that are able to bind the spike proteins of betacoronaviruses from three different subgenera. Both antibodies were found to target a conserved and immunogenic epitope in membrane-proximal stem region on the S2 fusion subunit, that is also recognized by the immune system during natural infection. Antibodies targeting this antigenic site prevented mortality and disease in mice upon MERS-CoV infection, demonstrating the relevance of the epitope for providing protection.</p>
<p id="P26">The observed antibody cross-reactivities are remarkable since the spike protein sequences of the five targeted betacoronaviruses (MHV, HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) are highly divergent and share only about 15% overall protein sequence identity with 26% identity across the more conserved S2 fusion subunit. Three residues in the stem helix epitope region appeared to be critical for antibody binding. Two of those appeared fully conserved in the targeted betacoronavirus spike sequences (D<sup>1236</sup> and F<sup>1239</sup> in MERS-S), whereas only aromatic amino acids residues were found at the third position (F<sup>1238</sup> in MERS-S), indicative of functional conservation. Location of the epitope was corroborated by the gain-of- function binding for the HCoV-HKU1 spike protein upon serine substitution at MERS- S equivalent position D<sup>1236</sup>. The small number of (functionally) conserved key residues targeted by both antibodies and the involvement of a conserved N-linked glycan may rationalize their binding to these highly divergent antigens <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P27">We showed that the stem-helix targeting antibodies effectively blocked MERS- CoV infection in cultured cells and provided prophylactic and therapeutic protection to mice against a lethal dose MERS-CoV challenge. This epitope was hitherto not described as a target of neutralizing antibodies, although monoclonal antibodies with neutralizing activity were found to target the sequences flanking the stem-helix epitope, including the downstream HR2 region <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>
</sup>. Membrane fusion by the S2 subunit is mediated through extensive conformational rearrangements, particularly in the epitope containing region. Elucidation of pre- and post-fusion spike structures reveals that dissociation of the three epitope-containing stem-helices in the prefusion spike trimer is required for formation of the highly stable postfusion structure <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>
</sup>. Though the precise mechanism of neutralization by these two antibodies remains to be defined, at least two mechanisms of neutralization are conceivable: the binding of antibodies may destabilize the bundle of stem helices in the prefusion spike protein initiating premature spike activation. Alternatively, antibody binding may obstruct six-helix bundle formation of the spike protein during fusion <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>
</sup>. Intriguingly, despite having different conformations resulting from the structural rearrangement during fusion, the epitope in pre- and postfusion spike conformation could still be bound by both antibodies, suggesting either epitope recognition of the structurally conserved part of the epitope in the two spike conformations, or through an ‘induced fit’ mechanism at the binding interface <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P28">Neutralization of authentic human-infecting coronaviruses, other than MERS-CoV, was not observed by these two antibodies, although weak cross-neutralizing capacity against pseudotyped viruses was seen for 28D9. This monoclonal antibody displayed high ELISA-reactivity to the spike proteins of HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2. The lack of robust cross-neutralization by 28D9 may result from the approximately 5- to 10-fold higher equilibrium dissociation constants towards these spike proteins, relative to MERS-S, inferred by subtle differences in epitope composition. Structural insight into the 28D9 antibody binding mode to the stem helix epitope of targeted CoV spike proteins may guide antibody affinity improvement by structure-based design to increase breadth of neutralization.</p>
<p id="P29">The conserved stem helix epitope appears to be highly immunogenic. This is demonstrated by the independent isolation of three cross-reactive antibodies (28D9, 1.6C7 and 18H2) all targeting the stem-helix epitope from three independent mouse immunization experiments. In addition, antibodies towards this epitope are also elicited during natural infection, as demonstrated by the spike protein peptide microarray analysis using MERS-CoV-positive human and dromedary camel sera. Moreover, recent spike protein peptide microarray analyses by Li <italic>et al.</italic> <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>
</sup> revealed that the SARS- CoV-2 peptide F<sup>1148</sup>K<underline>EELDKYFK</underline>NH<sup>1159</sup> encompassing the 28D9/1.6C7 targeted stem helix epitope (underlined in sequence) was recognized by serum antibodies in ~90% of COVID-19 patients, whereas Ladner <italic>et al.</italic> <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>
</sup> also identifies the stem-helix epitope region - with F<sup>1148</sup>KEELDKYF<sup>1156</sup> as the minimal reactive SARS2-S peptide sequence - as the most widely-recognized SARS-CoV-2 linear epitope target in convalescent donors. It is tempting to speculate that the exceptionally high seroprevalence of stemepitope targeting antibodies in COVID-19 patients is due to boosting of pre-existing immune response towards this conserved epitope resulting from earlier encounters with betacoronaviruses such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 that are endemic in humans <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. Whether cross-reactive antibodies in humans towards the stem-helix or other conserved spike epitopes play a role in cross-protection or enhanced disease requires further investigation.</p>
<p id="P30">Together, the isolated cross-reactive antibodies define a conserved, immunogenic and vulnerabe site on the coronavirus spike protein. The discovery of eptiopes on viral glycoproteins targeted by cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies has fueled the design of broad range therapeutics and vaccines for other RNA viruses that display antigenic variation or show zoonotic potential, such as HIV-1 and influenza viruses <sup>

</sup>. We made a first step into the identification of conserved sites among antigenically highly divergent coronavirus spike proteins. These efforts may enable the new generation of broadly protective vaccines and therapeutics, that can mitigate the potential risk of antigenic drift upon continuous circulation of coronaviruses in the population, as well as the looming threat of novel coronavirus emergence in humans.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>
</sup>. In brief, HEK-293T cells at 70~80% confluency were transfected with the pCAGGS expression vectors encoding full-length MERS-S, SARS-S, SARS2-S or OC43-S with a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail truncation to increase cell surface expression levels. In case of OC43-S, cells were co-transfected with pCAGGS vector encoding the Fc-tagged bovine coronavirus hemagglutinin esterase (HE-Fc) protein at molar ratios of 8:1 (S:HE-Fc). Forty-eight hours post transfection, cells were infected with VSV-G pseudotyped VSVΔG bearing the firefly <italic>(Photinus pyralis)</italic> luciferase reporter gene at a MOI of 1. Twenty-four hours later, supernatant was harvested and filtered through 0.45 μm membrane. Pseudotyped VSV virus were titrated on monolayer African green monkey kidney VeroCCL81 cells (MERS-S pseudotyped VSV), VeroE6 cells (SARS-S and SARS2-S pseudotyped VSV) or on HRT-18 cells (OC43-S pseudotyped VSV). In the virus neutralization assay, serially diluted mAbs were pre-incubated with an equal volume of virus at RT for 1 h, and then inoculated on Vero/HRT-18 cells, and further incubated at 37°C. After 20 h, cells were washed once with PBS and lysed with cell lysis buffer (Promega). The expression of firefly luciferase was measured on a Berthold Centro LB 960 plate luminometer using D-luciferin as a substrate (Promega). The percentage of infectivity was calculated as the ratio of luciferase readout in the presence of mAbs normalized to luciferase readout in the absence of mAb. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>) were determined using 4-parameter logistic regression (GraphPad Prism v7.0).</p>

</sup>. In brief, mAbs were serially diluted and mixed with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour. The mixture was then added to Huh-7 cells (MERS-CoV) or VeroE6 cells (SARS-CoV and SARS- CoV-2) and incubated for 1 hr, after which the cells were washed and further incubated in medium for 8 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed, fixed, permeabilized and the infection was detected using immunofluorescent staining using antibodies specific for the viruses used. The signal was developed using a precipitate forming TMB substrate (True Blue, KPL) and the number of infected cells per well were counted using the ImmunoSpot® Image analyzer (CTL Europe GmbH). The half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>) were determined using 4-parameter logistic regression (GraphPad Prism version 8).</p>

Recombinant MERS-CoV S ectodomain and serially diluted mAbs were mixed and incubated for 1 h at RT. The mixture was added to the plate for 1 h at RT, after which plates were washed three times. Binding of MERS-CoV S ectodomain to DPP4 was detected using 1:1000 diluted HRP-conjugated anti-StrepMAb (IBA) that recognizes the Strep-tag affinity tag on the MERS-CoV S ectodomain. Detection of HRP activity was performed as described above (ELISA section).</p>

<sup>747</sup>SVR<sup>751</sup> at S1/S2 junction was mutated to <italic>K</italic>SVR to avoid the cleavage by endogenous proteases. At 48 h post transfection, cells were pre-treated with DMEM only or DMEM with 20 μg/ml mAbs for 1 h and subsequently treated with DMEM with 20 μg/ml of exogenous trypsin to activate the spike fusion function at 37°C for 2 h. Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde after observation of the syncytia formation. 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to stain the nuclei. The expression of MERS-S was confirmed based on the GFP signal, and the cell-cell fusion was monitored by large GFP-fluorescent muti-nucleated syncytia. The fluorescence images were recorded using the EVOS FL fluorescence microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, the Netherlands).</p>

<title>Spike protein peptide microarray analysis</title>
<p id="P44">Spike protein peptide microarray analysis to map linear epitopes of antibodies in convalescent sera was performed by PEPSCAN (Lelystad, The Netherlands). Overlapping peptides that cover the entire MERS-CoV spike ectodomain (residues 1-1,296) were synthesized with an offset of one or two residues. Order of these peptides was randomized, when synthesized on mini-cards. ELISA reactivity of 5 human (H1 to H5) and 4 dromedary camel (D1 to D4) MERS-positive sera was assessed, as well as a MERS-negative serum from human (H-CTRL) or camel (D-CTRL). The binding of antibody to each of the synthesized peptides was tested in a PEPSCAN-based ELISA. The peptide arrays were incubated with the primary antibody solution (overnight at 4°C). After washing, the peptide arrays were incubated with a 1/1000 dilution of an appropriate antibody peroxidase conjugate (goat anti-human HRP conjugate, Southern Biotech, cat. no.: 2010-05 or goat antilama HRP conjugate, Abcore, cat. no. AC15-0354) for 1 h at 25°C. After washing, the peroxidase substrate 2,2’-azino-di-3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate (ABTS) and 20 μl/ml of 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added. After 1 h, the color development was measured and quantified with a charge coupled device (CCD) - camera and an image processing system. The values obtained from the CCD camera range from 0 to 3000 mAU. Samples were scaled per serum sample using a cut-off of twice the mean absorbance obtained for each serum. The use of human materials was approved by the local medical ethical committee (MEC approval: 2014-414).</p>
<p id="P45">To map the epitopes of the monoclonal antibodies, 30-amino acid long peptides (with 15-a.a. overlap) were synthesized (Genscript) covering the conserved C-terminal part of the MERS-S2 ectodomain (residues 869-1,288). 100 ng/well of each peptide was coated onto 96-well NUNC Maxisorb plate at 4°C overnight. Followed by three washing steps with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20), plates were blocked with 5% milk (Protifar, Nutricia) in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 at RT for 3 h. Antibodies were allowed to bind to the plates at 4-fold serial dilutions, starting at 10 μg/ml, at RT for 1 h. Antibody binding to the peptides was determined using a goat anti-human IgG HRP conjugate (ITK Southern Biotech) for 1 h at RT and tetramethylbenzidine substrate (BioFX). Readout for binding was done as described in the ELISA section. To identify critical residues for mAb binding, a single alanine mutation was introduced on the 15- mer spike peptide fragment that comprises the linear epitope. Reactivity of antibodies with peptides with a single alanine substitution was measured by ELISA according to the method described above.</p>

<bold>a</bold> Antibody binding competition analysed by biolayer interferometry. Immobilized MERS-S<sub>ecto</sub> antigen was saturated in binding with a given mAb (step 1) and then exposed to binding by a second mAb (step 2). Additional binding of the second antibody indicates the presence of an unoccupied epitope, whereas lack of binding indicates epitope blocking by mAb1. As a control, the first mAb was also included in the second step to check for self-competition. Competitive binding was tested for the S2-targeting 1.6C7 and 28D9 antibodies and a MERS-S1 antibody control (7.7G6) <sup>
