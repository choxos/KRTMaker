The recent inclusion of bedaquiline into TB drug regimens has improved treatment outcomes, but this advance is threatened by the emergence of strains of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) resistant to bedaquiline. Clinical bedaquiline resistance is most frequently conferred by off-target resistance-associated variants (RAVs) in the <italic>mmpR5</italic> gene (<italic>Rv0678</italic>), the regulator of an efflux pump, which can also confer cross-resistance to clofazimine, another TB drug. We compiled a dataset of 3,682 <italic>Mtb</italic> genomes, including 150 carrying variants in <italic>mmpR5</italic> that have been associated to borderline (henceforth intermediate) or confirmed resistance to bedaquiline. We identified eight cases where RAVs were present in the genomes of strains collected prior to the use of bedaquiline in TB treatment regimes. Phylogenetic reconstruction points to multiple emergence events and circulation of RAVs in <italic>mmpR5</italic>, some estimated to predate the introduction of bedaquiline. However, epistatic interactions can complicate bedaquiline drug-susceptibility prediction from genetic sequence data. Indeed, in one clade of isolates where the RAV Ile67fs is estimated to have emerged prior to the antibiotic era, co-occurrence of mutations in <italic>mmpL5</italic> are found to neutralise bedaquiline resistance. The presence of a pre-existing reservoir of <italic>Mtb</italic> strains carrying bedaquiline RAVs prior to its clinical use augments the need for rapid drug susceptibility testing and individualised regimen selection to safeguard the use of bedaquiline in TB care and control.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>phylogenetics</kwd><kwd>bedaquiline</kwd><kwd>drug resistance</kwd><kwd>AMR</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) currently accounts for 450,000 of the 10 million new tuberculosis (TB) cases reported annually<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Treatment outcomes for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), resistant to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, have historically been poor, with treatment success rates of only 50-60% in routine programmatic settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The discovery of bedaquiline, a diarylquinoline antimycobacterial active against ATP synthase, which is highly effective against <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>
<italic>tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, was reported in 2004. Following clinical trials, which confirmed reduced time to culture conversion in patients with DR-TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, in 2012 bedaquiline received an accelerated Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licence for use in DR-TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Cohort studies of patients treated with bedaquiline-containing regimens against MDR-TB report success rates of 70-80%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Similar results have been achieved for extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB, traditionally defined as MDR-TB strains with additional resistance to fluoroquinolones and injectables), where treatment outcomes without bedaquiline are even worse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In light of these promising results, the World Health Organization (WHO) now recommends that bedaquiline be included in all MDR-TB regimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. It has played a central role in the highly successful ZeNix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and TB-PRACTECAL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> trials of bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid (+/- moxifloxacin) six-month all-oral regimens for DR-TB. These are now incorporated in WHO guidance. In addition, bedaquiline is positioned as a key drug in multiple phase III clinical trials for drug-susceptible TB (SimpliciTB, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03338621; TRUNCATE-TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>).</p><p id="P4">Resistance in <italic>Mtb</italic> is typically reported shortly after the introduction of a novel TB drug and often appears sequentially<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. For example, mutations conferring resistance to isoniazid – one of the first antimycobacterials – tend to emerge prior to resistance to rifampicin, the other major first-line drug. These also predate resistance mutations to second-line drugs, so termed because they are used clinically to treat patients infected with strains already resistant to first-line drugs. This was observed, for example, in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where resistance-associated mutations accumulated over decades prior to their identification, leading to a major outbreak of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Unlike other major drug-resistant bacteria, <italic>Mtb</italic> reproduces strictly clonally and systematically acquires resistance by chromosomal mutations rather than via horizontal gene transfer or recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. This allows phylogenetic reconstructions, based on whole genome sequencing data, to be used to infer the timings of emergence and subsequent spread of variants in <italic>Mtb</italic> that have been suggested to reduce drug susceptibility, termed resistance-associated variants (RAVs).</p><p id="P5">A number of mechanisms have been implicated in conferring bedaquiline resistance. For example, mutations conferring resistance have been selected <italic>in vitro</italic>, located in the <italic>atpE</italic> gene encoding the F1F0 ATP synthase, the target of bedaquiline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Off-target resistance-conferring mutations have also been found in <italic>pepQ</italic> in a murine model and potentially in a small number of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. However, the primary mechanism of resistance observed in clinical isolates has been identified in the context of off-target resistance-associated variants (RAVs) in the <italic>mmpR5 (Rv0678</italic>) gene, a negative repressor of expression of the <italic>mmpL5</italic> efflux pump. Loss of function of mmpR5 leads to pump overexpression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) to bedaquiline, along with the recently repurposed antimycobacterial clofazimine, fusidic acid, the azole class of antifungal drugs (which also have antimycobacterial activity), as well as to the novel therapeutic class of DprE1 inhibitors in clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Aligned with this mechanism of resistance, coincident mutations leading to loss of function of the <italic>mmpL5</italic> efflux pump can negate the resistance-inducing effect of MmpR5 loss of function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">A range of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and frameshift <italic>mmpR5</italic> mutations have been associated with resistance to bedaquiline and are often present as heteroresistant alleles in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. In contrast to most other RAVs in <italic>Mtb</italic>, which often cause many-fold increases in MIC and clear-cut resistance, <italic>mmpR5</italic> variants may be associated with normal MICs or subtle increases in bedaquiline MIC, although they may still be clinically important<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. These increases may not cross the current WHO critical concentrations used to classify resistant versus susceptible strains (0.25μg/mL on Middlebrook 7H11 agar, or 1μg/mL in Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube [MGIT] liquid media). The first version of the WHO tuberculosis drug resistance catalogue does not contain any bedaquiline RAVs, although a subsequent meta-analysis identified two RAVs (<italic>atpE</italic> Ala63Pro and <italic>mmpR5</italic> Ile67fs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Bedaquiline has a long terminal half-life of up to 5.5 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, leading to the possibility of subtherapeutic concentrations where adherence is suboptimal or treatment is interrupted, which could act as a further driver of resistance.</p><p id="P7">Bedaquiline and clofazimine cross-resistance has now been reported across three continents following the rapid expansion in usage of both drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, and is associated in some cases with poor adherence to therapy and inadequate regimens. However, baseline isolates in 8/347 (2.3%) patients from phase IIb bedaquiline trials demonstrated <italic>mmpR5</italic> RAVs and high bedaquiline MICs in the absence of prior documented use of bedaquiline or clofazimine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. This suggests that bedaquiline RAVs may have been in circulation prior to the usage of either of these drugs, which may be expected in the case of mutations which do not have major fitness consequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. While there have been isolated clinical reports from multiple geographical regions, the global extent of bedaquiline resistance emergence and spread has not yet been investigated.</p><p id="P8">In this study, we characterise and date the emergence of variants in <italic>mmpR5</italic>, including those implicated as bedaquiline RAVs, in the two global <italic>Mtb</italic> lineage 2 (L2) and lineage 4 (L4) lineages, which include the majority of drug resistance strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.

Based on genotypic profiling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, 911 strains within the L2 dataset were classified as MDR-TB (60%) and 295 (20%) as XDR-TB.

The full phylogenetic distribution of resistance profiles is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>. As is commonplace with genomic datasets, the proportion of drug-resistant strains exceeds their actual prevalence, due to the overrepresentation of drug-resistant isolates in public sequencing repositories.</p><p id="P11">Both the L2 and L4 phylogenetic trees displayed a significant temporal signal following date randomisation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>), making them suitable for time-calibrated phylogenetic inference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. We estimated the time to the Most Recent Common Ancestor (tMRCA) of both datasets using a Bayesian tip-dating analysis (BEAST2) run on a representative subset of genomes from each dataset (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). For the final temporal calibration of the L2 dataset we applied an estimated clock rate of 7.7x10<sup>-8</sup> (4.9x10<sup>-8</sup> – 1.03x10<sup>-7</sup>) substitutions per site per year, obtained from the subsampled BEAST2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> analysis, to the global maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. This resulted in an estimated tMRCA of 1332CE (945CE-1503CE). Using the same approach for the L4 dataset we estimated a clock rate of 7.1x10<sup>-8</sup> (6.2x10<sup>-8</sup> – 7.9x10<sup>-8</sup>) substitutions per site per year resulting in an estimated tMRCA of 853CE (685CE – 967CE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).

While we identified no nodes with a second emergence of <italic>mmpR5</italic> nonsynonymous/frameshift mutations across the L4 dataset, eight nodes were identified in the L2 dataset where a clade already carrying a nonsynonymous/frameshift variant in <italic>mmpR5</italic> subsequently acquired a second nonsynonymous/frameshift mutation.</p><p id="P18">In the L4 dataset, we noted one large clade of 66 samples, predominantly collected in Peru (henceforth Peruvian clade), which all carry the Ile67fs <italic>mmpR5</italic> resistance associated mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>.

Of significance, we identified a frameshift mutation in the adjacent <italic>MmpL5</italic> efflux pump (Arg202fs) in isolates from this Peruvian clade, the protein whose overexpression mediates bedaquiline resistance following loss-of-function of the MmpR5 regulatory protein. This frameshift, which leads to a premature stop codon at amino acid 206, is expected to counteract the otherwise resistance-conferring mutation. This epistatic interaction restoring bedaquiline susceptibility has recently been described elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. The <italic>mmpL5</italic> frameshift mutation was present in all isolates in the Peruvian clade bar one (ERR7339051) which had <italic>mmpL5</italic> Arg202Leu. This event of reading-frame restoration is likely explained by a recent secondary duplication of a T downstream of the initial deletion (777876 GGCAT &gt; GGAT, GGAT &gt; GGATT). We considered the phenotype of this strain as unknown.

The epidemiological cut-off (ECOFF, defined as MIC of 95-99% of wild-type isolates) for bedaquiline has been proposed to be 0.12 or 0.25 μg/mL depending on the method used, although the final decision was to use an ECOFF of 0.25 μg/mL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">We were able to identify 30 L4 isolates from Peru (including the aforementioned Peruvian clade) for MIC testing, and a further 9 MICs for L4 that had recently been published by the Cryptic consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.

Hence, we denote isolates from this clade as having a hypersusceptible phenotype. The second oldest predicted resistance mutation (Arg90Cys, dated to 1940) was however associated with MICs ≥0.12 μg/mL in 6/7 (85.7%) instances, and in 3/4 (75%) instances for the third oldest predicted resistance associated mutation for which data were available (Asn98Asp, dated to 1987).

We identified up to 11 cases where RAVs have emerged prior to the first clinical trials of bedaquiline in 2007 and a further four cases of variants emerging prior to the clinical use of bedaquiline which are expected to give rise to an intermediate phenotype. These are highlighted red and orange respectively in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table S7</xref>, not including the oldest emergence of Ile67fs as its resistant phenotype is negated by the epistatic interaction. Phylogenetic inference estimated the oldest clade containing <italic>mmpR5</italic> mutations, composed mostly of samples from Peru carrying the Ile67fs RAV, to have emerged around 1702 (1657-1732). We identify two further early emergences of <italic>mmpR5</italic> mutations, estimated to 1871 and 1940 (Asp141fs and Arg90Cys; point estimates), with samples from the latter clade confirmed to have MICs above the wild-type range justifying classification of an intermediate phenotype. The phenotypic implications of Asp141fs remains unclear. However, together this suggests the likely circulation of variants exhibiting borderline resistance even prior to the first clinical trials for clofazimine. Our phylogenetic inference method, which points to multiple emergences of <italic>mmpR5</italic> nonsynonymous/frameshift variants predating the use of bedaquiline, is also confirmed by the direct observation of eight <italic>Mtb</italic> genomes carrying <italic>mmpR5</italic> RAVs sampled prior to 2007. We also identified, within the aforementioned Peruvian clade, a consistent frameshift mutation in mmpL5, which seemed to counteract the resistance phenotypic through an epistatic interaction (MIC &lt;0.12 μg/mL). While Ile67fs is central for bedaquiline resistance in <italic>Mtb</italic>, and this mutation has clearly emerged well prior to the use of bedaquiline and clofazimine in this clade, its phenotypic impact is influenced by the strain genetic background.</p><p id="P23">We identified other localised clusters with <italic>mmpR5</italic> mutations, reinforcing the need for concern even in situations where such mutations are globally rare. This included 19 isolates with a Met146Thr mutation found in lineage 4 isolates from Eswatini. Met146Thr mutations have been previously associated with a clade that has a rifampicin-resistance conferring mutation located outside of the canonical rifampicin-resistance determining region, and these isolates exhibit elevated bedaquiline MICs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. The emergence of the Met146Thr mutation has previously been dated to have emerged in approximately 2003<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. This is in reasonable agreement with our analysis on a much larger dataset which inferred an emergence in 2005.6 (95% confidence intervals 2004.8 – 2006.0). The long-standing presence of variants implicated in resistance and borderline resistance to bedaquiline predating the use of the drug and at high prevalence in geographically notable cases is of concern, as it suggests that non-synonymous mutations in <italic>mmpR5</italic> exert little fitness cost.</p><p id="P24">Together, our work suggests the existence of pre-existent reservoirs of bedaquiline resistant <italic>Mtb</italic>. These may have been selected for through historic clofazimine use, though we note at least one case of intermediate resistance to bedaquiline emerging as early as 1930-1947. We also note that detected variants in mmpR5 tend to exist in strains already displaying rifampicin-resistance, although also include otherwise fully susceptible strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). Together this suggests the important role of prior drug exposure in selecting for strains with pre-existing (cross-)resistance potential. This reservoir of putatively adaptive variants is expected to expand under drug pressure with the increasing use of bedaquiline and clofazimine in TB treatment. Further, these reservoirs may also pose a threat for other candidate TB agents from different drug classes that are also exported by <italic>mmpS5</italic> and mmpL5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P25">The identification of resistance variants occurring before the clinical use of a drug is not limited to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>mmpR5</italic> alone. To illustrate, within <italic>M. bovis</italic>, there is evidence indicating that the <italic>pncA</italic> H57D mutation, which is associated with resistance to pyrazinamide (PZA), emerged approximately 900 years ago, providing inherent resistance to PZA in <italic>M. bovis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Similarly, variations in intrinsic susceptibility to pretomanid have been observed across the MTBC, including <italic>Mtb</italic> lineages, even without prior exposure to nitroimidazoles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. It is likely that there are numerous other instances of such loss of function mutations with minimal or no impact on fitness, similar to the case of <italic>mmpR5</italic>. Furthermore, the existence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in different forms has persisted throughout the natural history of various bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">Nevertheless, it is crucial to determine the age and diversity of variants that have been implicated in drug resistance to gain a better understanding of the potential for widespread resistance as a contemporary challenge. We identified a large number of different <italic>mmpR5</italic> nonsynonymous/frameshift variants across both of our <italic>Mtb</italic> lineage cohorts; 46 in L2 and 67 in L4. This suggests the mutational target leading to bedaquiline resistance is wider than for most other current TB drugs and raises concerns about the ease with which bedaquiline resistance can emerge during treatment. It is further concerning that resistance to the new class of nitroimidazole drugs, such as pretomanid and delamanid, is also conferred by loss of function mutations in any of at least six genes, suggesting that they may also have a low barrier to resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">While we identified many non-synonymous variants in <italic>mmpR5</italic>, only one (Ile67fs) has been previously definitively linked to resistance. We acknowledge that several of our detected variants have no associated MIC values available in the literature and are thus currently not fully phenotypically validated. We hope by presenting these as ‘unknown’ our work, estimating the age of emergence of non-synonymous mutations, can be of value as further variants are phenotyped in the future. It is however true that determining the phenotypic consequences of <italic>mmpR5</italic> variants that have previously been described is challenging as there are often only limited reports correlating MICs to genotypes. Moreover, at least four different methods are used to determine MICs, some of which do not have associated critical concentrations. Even where critical concentrations have been set, there is an overlap in MICs of isolates that are genetically wild type and those that have mutations likely to cause resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. We also note that as we purposefully enriched our dataset for <italic>mmpR5</italic> mutations, the sampling precludes estimation of the overall prevalence of these mutations in genome sequencing databases.</p><p id="P28">Prediction of phenotypic bedaquiline resistance from genomic data is further complicated by the existence of hypersusceptibility variants. For example, the c-11a variant located in the promoter of mmpR5, which appears to increase susceptibly to bedaquiline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, was observed to be fixed throughout a large clade within L2. The early emergence of this variant and its geographical concentration in South Africa and Eswatini may suggest the role of non-pharmacological influences on mmpR5 which regulates multiple MmpL efflux systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Further, analysis of hypersusceptibility is limited by the truncated lower MIC range of the UKMYC microtitre plates, with many isolates giving MICs below the lower end of the measured range. While large-scale genotype/phenotype analyses will likely support the development of rapid molecular diagnostics, targeted or whole genome sequencing, at reasonable depths, may provide the only opportunity to detect all possible <italic>mmpR5</italic> RAVs, and possible co-occurring mutations, in clinical settings.</p><p id="P29">Bedaquiline resistance can also be conferred by other RAVs including in <italic>pepQ</italic> (bedaquiline and clofazimine), <italic>atpE</italic> (bedaquiline only)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> and <italic>Rv1979c</italic> (clofazimine only). We only found <italic>atpE</italic> RAVs at low allele frequency in one patient who also had <italic>mmpR5</italic> variants (sample accession ERR2677436), which is in line with other evidence suggesting they rarely occur in clinical isolates, likely due to a high fitness cost. Likewise, we only identified <italic>Rv1979c</italic> RAVs in three patients in China, although there were other variants in <italic>Rv1979c</italic> for which ability to cause phenotypic resistance has not been previously assessed.

We then computed a linear regression between root-to-tip distance and the time of sample collection using BactDating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>, which additionally assesses the significance of the regression based on 10,000 date randomisations. We obtained a significant temporal correlation for both the L2 and L4 phylogenies, both with and without imputation of dates for samples with missing metadata (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P43">We employed the Bayesian method BactDating v1.01<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>, run without updating the root (updateRoot=F), a mixed relaxed gamma clock model and otherwise default parameters to both global datasets. The MCMC chain was run for 1x10<sup>7</sup> iterations and 3x10<sup>7</sup> iterations. BactDating results were considered only when MCMC chains converged with an Effective Sample Space (ESS) of at least 100. The analysis was applied to the datasets both with and without considering imputed and non-imputed collection dates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p><p id="P44">To independently infer the evolutionary rates associated with each of our datasets, we sub-sampled both the L4 and L2 datasets to 200 isolates, selected so as to retain the maximal diversity of the tree using Treemmer v0.3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup>. As before, we excluded all variants currently implicated in drug resistance from the alignments. This resulted in a dataset for L4 comprising 25,104 SNPs and spanning 232 years of sampling and for L2 comprising 8,221 SNPs and spanning 24 years of sampling. In both cases the L3 sample SRR1188186 was used as an out-group given this has an associated collection date. Maximum likelihood trees were constructed using RaXML-NG v0.9.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>, as previously described, and a significant temporal regression was obtained for both sub-sampled datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>).</p><p id="P45">BEAST2 v2.6.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> was run on both subsampled SNP alignments allowing for model averaging over possible choices of substitution models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>. All models were run with either a relaxed or a strict prior on the evolutionary clock rate for three possible coalescent demographic models: exponential, constant and skyline. To speed up the convergence, the prior on the evolutionary clock rate was given as a uniform distribution (limits 0 to 10) with a starting value set to 10<sup>-7</sup>. In each case, the MCMC chain was run for 500,000,000 iterations, with the first 10% discarded as burn-in and sampling trees every 10,000 chains. The convergence of the chain was inspected in Tracer 1.7 and through consideration of the ESS for all parameters (ESS&gt;200). The best-fit model to the data for these runs was assessed through a path sampling analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref></sup> specifying 100 steps, 4 million generations per step, alpha = 0.3, pre-burn-in = 1 million generations, burn-in for each step = 40%. For both datasets, the best supported strict clock model was a coalescent Bayesian skyline analysis. The rates (mean and 95% HPD) estimated under these subsampled analyses (L2 7.7x10<sup>-8</sup> [4.9x10<sup>-8</sup> – 1.03x10<sup>-7</sup>] substitutions per site per year; L4 7.1x10<sup>-8</sup> [6.2x10<sup>-8</sup> – 7.9x10<sup>-8</sup>] substitutions per site per year) were used to rescale the maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees generated across the entire L2 and L4 datasets, by transforming all branch lengths of the tree from per unit substitution to per unit substitutions per site per year using the R package Ape v5.3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>. This resulted in an estimated tMRCA of 1332CE (945CE-1503CE) for L2 and 853CE (685CE – 967CE) for L4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P46">The resulting phylogenetic trees were visualised and annotated for place of geographic sampling and <italic>mmpR5</italic> variant status using ggtree v1.14.6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref></sup>. All nonsynonymous/frameshift mutations in <italic>mmpR5</italic> were considered, with the phenotypic status assigned in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>. For the purpose of this analysis, and to be conservative, ‘unknown’ variants classified using XGBoost were still considered ‘unknown’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). Clades carrying shared variants in <italic>mmpR5</italic> were identified and the distributions around the age of the node (point estimates – mean – and 95% HPDs) were extracted from the time-stamped phylogeny. For isolated samples (single emergences) exhibiting variants in <italic>mmpR5</italic>, the time of sample collection was extracted together with the date associated with the upper bound on the age of the next closest node of the tree, allowing for the mutation to have occurred anywhere over the length of the terminal branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S11-S12</xref>). For the Peruvian clade Bayesian skyline analysis was implemented through the skylineplot analysis functionality available in Ape v5.3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplement</label><media xlink:href="EMS160052-supplement-Supplement.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d22aAdEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Table S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS160052-supplement-Table_S1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d22aAdEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Table S7</label><media xlink:href="EMS160052-supplement-Table_S7.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" id="d22aAdEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Table S8</label><media xlink:href="EMS160052-supplement-Table_S8.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" id="d22aAdEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>CN and JM are supported by the Wellcome Trust (203583/Z/16/Z and 203919/Z/16/Z, respectively).
