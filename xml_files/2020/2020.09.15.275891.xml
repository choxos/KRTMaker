Postulating a benefit for a preorganized backbone conformation, we designed new ketoamide-based M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors based on central proline rings.

In particular, SARSCoV2 has already caused more than 800,000 deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). For SARSCoV2 and future coronavirus outbreaks, until effective vaccines have been administered to most of the world’s population, antiviral drugs will be needed to reduce morbidity and death.</p><p id="P3">Orally available anti-coronavirus drugs would be highly desirable, as they can be given in an outpatient setting, i.e. without requiring hospitalization. As such they can be given upon diagnosis, which could prevent progression to more severe or protracted disease and thereby greatly reduce morbidity and mortality. However, the only antiviral drug with proven efficacy against SARSCoV2, remdesivir, is an intravenous drug that can only be administered to hospitalized patients. Even then it only reduces disease duration and risk of death by ~30% each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Dexamethasone has proven efficacy in improving survival in late-stage COVID-19 by suppressing the late hyperinflammatory responses that cause respiratory and organ failure rather than inhibiting viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). However, it is ineffective if given earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), and even possibly harmful by inhibiting immune responses directed against the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Thus, drugs that can effectively suppress coronavirus replication in an outpatient setting during the entire post-infection period do not exist, but are urgently needed.</p><p id="P4">Inhibitors of the coronavirus main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>), a key protein in the coronavirus life cycle, could be especially effective as antiviral agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). M<sup>pro</sup> (also called 3C-like protease due to its homology with enterovirus 3C protease) is a cysteine protease that cleaves the large nonstructural polyprotein of coronavirus into smaller pieces to assemble the RNA replicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Experimental inhibitors of coronavirus M<sup>pro</sup> protect mice and cats from lethal coronavirus disease, validating M<sup>pro</sup> as a medicinal target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).</p><p id="P5">There is currently intense interest in discovering effective inhibitors for SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup>. As coronavirus M<sup>pro</sup> species all share similar substrate specificity profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), previously characterized inhibitors for other coronaviruses have, unsurprisingly, demonstrated inhibitory activity on SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> as well. For example, the Michael acceptor compound N3, developed in 2005 as an inhibitor of SARSCoV1 M<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), also inhibits the 96% identical SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). A series of ketoamide-based inhibitors developed for SARSCoV1 M<sup>pro</sup> were also effective against SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), and gave rise to the modified SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor 13b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Finally, GC376, a broad-spectrum aldehyde prodrug of various coronavirus M<sup>pro</sup> species, and 11a, an aldehyde compound designed to inhibit SARSCoV1 M<sup>pro</sup> were found to inhibit SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p><p id="P6">However, it is not clear if known coronavirus M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors have the necessary attributes to be safe and effective oral therapeutics for human coronavirus diseases. In 11a and the active form of GC-376, an aldehyde reactive group (warhead) reacts with the active site cysteine, but aldehydes are generally considered nonideal drug candidates due to toxicity caused by off-target reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). For example, the high reactivity of aldehyde warheads has been shown to drive non-specific inhibition of cysteine proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Protease inhibitors with ketoamide and Michael acceptor warheads can exhibit better specificity, stability, and oral bioavailability than those with aldehydes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), and examples have progressed to late-stage clinical trials or regulatory approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Compounds 13b and N3 utilize ketoamide and Michael acceptor warheads respectively, but they appear to have insufficient efficacy to be therapeutically useful. While 13b demonstrates a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) on M<sup>pro</sup> <italic>in vitro</italic> of 670 nM, the 50% effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) in blocking SARSCoV2 replication in human cells is ~4 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). This compares unfavorably to the achieved concentration in mouse lungs of &lt;0.1 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). For N3, while it demonstrates a low IC<sub>50</sub> <italic>in vitro</italic>, its EC<sub>50</sub> for SARSCoV2 replication is 17 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), indicating poor cell permeability. This is not surprising given its large size (mw 681) and numerous polar groups. Thus, the development of new M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor designs with low toxicity and low EC<sub>50</sub> in cells remains an urgent priority.</p><p id="P7">Multiple clinically approved protease inhibitors incorporate cyclic structures to improve affinity by pre-organizing the inhibitors into a conformation favorable for binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). In energetic terms, this is considered paying the entropic penalty of conformational rigidification prior to binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), and cyclization has been experimentally confirmed to increase protease inhibitor affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). In this study, we explore the ability of a cyclic moiety to improve the affinity of coronavirus M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors. We developed a novel inhibitor, ML1000, with molecular weight of 549 Da and IC<sub>50</sub> value of 12 nM on SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup>. ML1000 inhibits SARSCoV2 replication in human cells with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.1 μM, and thus is the highest-potency non-aldehyde M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor reported so far. ML1000 represents a new structural class of potent ketoamide inhibitors of coronavirus M<sup>pro</sup>, and may serve as a promising starting point for the development of drug candidates against human coronavirus diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P8">While visualizing the co-crystal structure of 13b and SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), we noticed that 13b adopts a pronounced kink in its main chain at the P2 residue, i.e. the 2<sup>nd</sup> residue N-terminal to the scissile bond facing the enzyme’s S2 pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Due to our previous work with HCV protease and its small-molecule inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), we recognized this kink to be similar to that created by proline analog rings in the clinically approved anti-HCV drugs boceprevir, narlaprevir, and telaprevir (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-D</xref>). Like 13b, these drugs are ketoamide-based covalent inhibitors, serving as substrates for nucleophilic attack by the deprotonated active-site cysteine.</p><p id="P9">Manual rigid docking of boceprevir showed that it could fit into the active site of SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> with good shape complementarity by its P1, P2, and P4 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). In addition, the urea group of boceprevir at the P3-P4 junction could engage in a bidentate hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of M<sup>pro</sup> Glu-166. The boceprevir derivative narlaprevir also demonstrated complementary in its P1 and P2 groups, which are identical to boceprevir, but its P4 group was clearly too large for the S4 pocket. Telaprevir could also be manually docked with good complementarity of its P1 sidechain and of its P2 group, which is a different proline analog from that of boceprevir (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), whereas its P4 group appeared slightly too large for the S4 pocket. The P3 group of coronavirus M<sup>pro</sup> substrates face out into solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), as does the t-butyl group in the analogous position of boceprevir, telaprevir, and narlaprevir. Interestingly, the Φ and Ψ angles of the proline ring in boceprevir precisely retraced the backbone atoms of 13b in the bound configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). We thus hypothesized that boceprevir and, to a lesser extent, narlaprevir and telaprevir, may be able to inhibit SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup>.</p><p id="P10">To address this hypothesis, we performed a preliminary rapid assessment using a live-cell assay of M<sup>pro</sup> function. We co-expressed SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> and a substrate protein comprising green fluorescent protein (GFP), a substrate site, and the membrane-targeting CAAX sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Cleavage at the substrate sequence liberates GFP, allowing quantitation of activity by immunoblotting. We could then assess the ability of drugs to inhibit M<sup>pro</sup> activity in cells. In HEK293A cells, we found boceprevir and telaprevir to inhibit SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> at micromolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). These results provided evidence of the ability of HCV inhibitors with a P2 proline group to inhibit SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup>.</p><p id="P11">We next performed a pilot test of the ability of HCV inhibitors with a P2 proline group to inhibit SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). As controls, we also tested GC-376 as a known broad-spectrum coronavirus M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor, ebselen and disulfiram as compounds recently reported to inhibit SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), and ritonavir as a protease inhibitor without any structural homology to coronavirus M<sup>pro</sup> substrates. Indeed, we observed that boceprevir, narlaprevir, telaprevir, GC-376, disulfiram, and ebselen (at 150 μM concentration in air-equilibrated buffer) were able to inhibit SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup>, whereas ritonavir showed no inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Incidentally, disulfiram and ebselen showed no inhibitory effect in the presence of DTT, whereas other compounds were unaffected by DTT. These results are consistent with proposals of disulfiram and ebselen forming a reducible bond with M<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). As the interior of the cell is reducing, reduction of ebselen adducts could contribute to its relatively high EC<sub>50</sub> of 4.7 μM for blocking SARSCoV2 replication in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We then performed full inhibition curves SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> to obtain IC<sub>50</sub> values for the above compounds. The initial pilot test above was performed with SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> with a C-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag for rapid purification, but the presence of a C-terminal extension may have an inhibitory effect on protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). We thus performed inhibition curves on both C-terminally extended and fully mature SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). We tested drugs in the presence of DTT, except for ebselen and disulfiram, for which we omitted DTT. Our results showed that the proline-containing HCV protease inhibitors boceprevir, telaprevir, and narlaprevir all could inhibit activity to some extent in both C-terminally extended and fully mature forms of SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup>. Among these, boceprevir was the most potent, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 4.1 μM on mature SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Having established that the P2 proline analogues in boceprevir, telaprevir, and narlaprevir were compatible with binding to the SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> active site, we next sought to design next-generation coronavirus inhibitors that could combine the entropic stabilization conferred by these P2 rings with side groups optimized for coronavirus M<sup>pro</sup> binding. A P1 Gln residue is strongly preferred by all coronavirus M<sup>pro</sup> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). In fact, this preference is conserved with the related enterovirus 3C proteases such as human rhinovirus (HRV) protease and even with the more distantly related potyvirus proteases such as tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Beginning with the HRV protease inhibitors AG7088 (rupintrivir) and its derivative AG7404 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), enterovirus and coronavirus protease inhibitors have incorporated a γ-lactam group to mimic the hydrogen bond acceptor function of Gln in the P1 position. Enzyme-inhibitor cocrystal structures have confirmed that the <bold>γ</bold>-lactam amide group is positioned similarly to the Gln amide group in natural structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). We thus designed a novel inhibitor, ML1000, with the ketoamide warhead of boceprevir, the <bold>γ</bold>-lactamyl P1 group of rupintrivir, and the P2 through P4 moieties (including backbone and side chains) of boceprevir (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). We also designed a second inhibitor, ML1100, composed of the ketoamide warhead of boceprevir, the <bold>γ</bold>-lactamyl P1 group of rupintrivir, the P2 cyclic structure of telaprevir, and the P3 and P4 moieties of boceprevir (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). We retained the P3 and P4 structure of boceprevir as these groups did not demonstrate any clashes with the enzyme pocket in the manually docked boceprevir model, and as their hydrophobicity likely contributes to membrane permeability.</p><p id="P14">ML1000 and ML1100 proved to be highly potent inhibitors of SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup>. In the presence of 100 nM of enzyme, ML1000 and ML1100 produced IC<sub>50</sub> values of 34 nM and 147 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), compared to 54 nM for GC-376 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Against the M<sup>pro</sup> enzyme from the distantly related coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), ML1000 and ML1100 exhibited IC<sub>50</sub> values of 130 and 301 nM, respectively, compared to 67 nM for GC-376 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 1</xref>). These results demonstrate that ketoamide inhibitors with proline ring analogs at the P2 position can function as broad-spectrum coronavirus M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors with potency approaching that of aldehyde inhibitors.</p><p id="P15">We noted that the measured IC<sub>50</sub> values of ML1000 and GC-376 for SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> were within experimental error of the theoretical limit of half of the enzyme concentration in the assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), hindering the ability to discern differences in potency between them. We thus also measured IC<sub>50</sub> values at a lower SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> concentration of 20 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). In these conditions, ML1000 and GC-376 still demonstrated comparable IC<sub>50</sub> values of 12 and 14 nM, respectively, below the concentration of M<sup>pro</sup> (i.e. the tight binding limit). Physiological temperature, compared to the 30 °C at which these assays are usually performed, could potentially increase structural flexibility and alter drug affinity of M<sup>pro</sup>. However, we found no significant difference in potency between 37 °C and 30 °C for each inhibitor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 2</xref>). These results indicate that ML1000 has high potency <italic>in vitro</italic> and represents the tightest-binding non-aldehyde SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor discovered so far.</p><p id="P16">Next, we tested the efficacy of the new inhibitors against SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> in human Huh7 cells by measuring the extent of cleavage of coexpressed substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Here, we observed the rank order of effectivenss to be GC-376 &gt; ML1000 &gt; ML1100 &gt; boceprevir (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). It should be emphasized that this assay does not directly measure the fraction of active M<sup>pro</sup>. If a small fraction of active M<sup>pro</sup> is sufficient to result in substrate cleavage, this would effectively increase the measured concentration needed to suppress protease activity. However, the assay does provide an assessment of the relative ability of a set of drugs to cross the cellular membrane and inhibit M<sup>pro</sup> within living cells.</p><p id="P17">Finally, we tested the ability of ML1000 and ML1100 to inhibit SARSCoV2 virus replication in Caco-2 human intestinal cells. For comparison, we tested boceprevir and GC-376. Boceprevir inhibited viral replication with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.2 μM, while GC-376 was even more potent, with a remarkably low EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.1 nM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). ML1000 and ML1100 inhibited SARSCoV2 replication with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.1 and 0.2 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). While the enhancement in anti-viral efficacy of ML1000 relative to boceprevir is not as large as the enhancement in enzyme inhibition observed <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), the EC<sub>50</sub> value of ML1000 is nevertheless the lowest reported to date for any non-aldehyde inhibitors of SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup>. In addition, ML1000 and ML1100 exhibited no cytotoxicity at the highest dose tested of 100 μM in Caco-2 cells and Huh-7 cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 3</xref>), resulting in selectivity indices of &gt;1000 and &gt;500 respectively. These results confirm that ML1000 is a potent and selective ketoamide inhibitor of SARSCoV2 replication.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">There is strong interest in discovering non-aldehyde inhibitors of SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> with the potential for oral administration. In this study, we developed ML1000 as a ketoamide inhibitor that is more potent against SARSCoV2 replication than previously described ketoamide or Michael acceptor compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Although its safety profile remains to be determined, ML1000 was designed to minimize toxicity by using only chemical motifs from drugs with established safety records in humans. Likewise, ML1000 was designed with the potential for oral dosing in mind. ML1000 is essentially the approved drug boceprevir with its P2 group altered to that of AG-7404. Of note, both boceprevir and AG-7404 have been proven to have high oral bioavailability and to be safe in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). In particular, boceprevir is taken 3 times daily for over 300 consecutive days on an outpatient basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Our findings that GC376 potently inhibits SARSCoV2 replication in Caco-2 cells adds to other recent data supporting its potential utility for treating COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>).

In addition, the presence of off-target effects, evidenced by suppression of tooth eruption in GC376-treated cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), suggests the need to develop additional classes of protease inhibitors.</p><p id="P20">In the course of our study, three other groups reported that boceprevir can inhibit SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> at low micromolar concentrations <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Two of these studies included crystal structures of SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> complexed with boceprevir (PDB 6WNP and 7C6S) that validate our manually docked model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Alignment of these structures to that of 13b complexed with SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> indicates that the proline ring of boceprevir can indeed mimic a turn taken by the backbone of linear protease inhibitors at the P2 position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig 4</xref>), confirming our original hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Two of the studies also demonstrated that boceprevir suppresses SARSCoV2 viral replication in monkey cells with EC<sub>50</sub> values between 2 and 16 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Our work demonstrates the unexpected favorability of incorporating proline-like rings into coronavirus protease inhibitors, specifically at the P2-analogous position. This finding is unexpected because proline is never found at this position in coronavirus M<sup>pro</sup> substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). One explanation could be that proline itself naturally lacks the bulk to fully occupy the deep S2 pocket, which prefers long aliphatic side chains such as leucine and phenylalanine. Thus, the proline analogs of boceprevir and telaprevir, which have a bicyclic structure, not only lock the backbone of the inhibitor into its bound conformation, but through their large bulk also fill the S2 pocket.</p><p id="P22">The ability of ML1000 and its structural variant ML1100 to bind to SARSCoV2 M<sup>pro</sup> more effectively than larger compounds with the same ketoamide warhead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) suggests that introduction of a cyclic structure can be a chemically parsimonious method to improve molecular recognition. The pre-rigidification of an inhibitor using a cyclic structure may provide enhanced affinity compared to a non-cyclic structure of the same size through prepayment of the entropic penalty of binding, and therefore can be an efficient strategy for potency improvement.</p><p id="P23">One parameter for potential further improvement of ML1000 is cell permeability. The conversion of the cyclobutyl group in the P1 position of boceprevir to the γ-lactamyl group in ML1000 adds an additional hydrogen bond acceptor and donor, which would be expected to decrease cell permeability. While ML1000 is ~340-fold more potent on enzyme inhibition than boceprevir <italic>in vitro</italic>, it is only ~2-fold more effective on viral suppression in Caco- 2 cells. We speculate that improving the permeability of ML1000 would further enhance antiviral efficacy in cells.</p><p id="P24">In summary, ML1000 can be considered an example of a new class of coronavirus M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors that feature a cyclic P2 group, high affinity, and solubility. Taken together, our results suggest that ML1000 is a promising scaffold for the development of anti-coronavirus drugs, and additional structures incorporating proline ring analogues can be explored as coronavirus M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S5"><title>Inhibitors</title><p id="P25">ML1000 and ML1100 were synthesized under fee-for-service agreements by ACME Bioscience (Palo Alto, CA, USA), and Chempartner (Shanghai, China), respectively.
