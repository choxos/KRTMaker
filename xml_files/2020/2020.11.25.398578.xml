<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus consisting of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of ~30 kb. From the positive strand genomic RNA, two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) are translated, ORF1a (pp1a) and ORF1b (pp1ab). The translation of ORF1b is mediated by a -1 frameshift that allows translation to continue beyond the stop codon of ORF1a. These generate continuous polypeptides which are cleaved into a total of 16 nonstructural proteins (NSP 1-16, Snijder et al., 2016; Sola et al., 2015; Stadler et al., 2003; V’kovski et al., 2020). Among them are the subunits that constitute the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which in turn transcribes subgenomic RNAs that contain a common 5' leader fused to different segments from the 3′ end of the viral genome <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. The different subgenomic RNAs encode 4 conserved structural proteins-spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N)-and several accessory proteins and non-canonical protein products <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">Translation of viral proteins relies solely on the cellular translation machinery; therefore, viruses must commandeer this machinery to translate their own mRNAs. In addition, viruses need to counteract the antiviral response cells mount upon infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. The first line of defense applied by infected cells engages the interferon (IFN) pathway, which amplifies signals resulting from detection of intracellular viral components to induce a systemic anti-viral response. Specifically, cells contain various sensors that detect the presence of viral RNAs and promote nuclear translocation of transcription factors, leading to transcription and secretion of type I IFNs <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. Binding of IFN to its cognate receptor in autocrine and paracrine manners leads to the propagation of the signal and to the transcription and translation of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes that act to hamper viral replication at various stages of the viral life cycle <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, interferon response seems to play a critical role in pathogenesis <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup>. In addition, the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 suppresses the IFN response is a key characteristic that distinguishes it from other respiratory viruses <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">Viruses utilize various strategies to cause shutoff of host mRNA translation <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>, including hampering mRNA processing steps and export, inducing degradation of mRNAs and inhibiting translation. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are known to cause host shutoff <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup> and several strategies have been proposed for how the beta CoVs may shut-off host protein synthesis and evade immune detection. These include degradation of host mRNA in the nucleus or the cytosol and inhibition of host translation <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. Nonetheless, the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 uses these or other strategies remains unclear.</p>
<p id="P5">NSP1 is the best characterized and most prominent coronavirus host shutoff factor <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. Several recent studies showed SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 binds the 40s ribosome and inhibits translation <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. In addition, other SARS-CoV-2 proteins were shown to interfere with cellular gene expression. For example, one of the SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins, ORF6, was suggested to disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport leading to inhibition of gene expression <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup> and several viral proteins have been demonstrated to antagonize IFN-I production and signaling <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>. Although, different SARS-CoV-2 proteins are implicated in host expression shutoff, a comprehensive picture of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cellular gene expression is still lacking.</p>
<p id="P6">Here we employ RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling along SARS-CoV-2 infection to explore the mechanisms which the virus utilizes to interfere with host protein synthesis. We reveal SARS-CoV-2 uses a multi-faceted approach to shutoff cellular protein production. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces global translation inhibition but surprisingly the translation of viral transcripts is not preferred over their cellular counterparts. Instead we reveal that infection leads to accelerated cellular mRNAs degradation, likely conferred by NSP1. Viral transcripts are refractory to these effects, an evasion potentiated by their 5’UTRs, enabling viral dominance over the mRNA pool in infected cell. Finally, we show that the translation of transcripts whose expression is induced in response to infection, including innate immune genes, is severely impaired. Overall these findings reveal the key mechanisms SARS-CoV-2 is applying to suppress cellular protein synthesis and host defenses.</p>

<title>Simultaneous monitoring of RNA levels and translation during SARS-CoV-2 infection</title>
<p id="P7">To gain a detailed view of the changes that occur in viral and host translation over the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we infected Calu3 cells with SARS-CoV-2 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 and harvested infected cells at 3, 5, and 8 hours post infection (hpi) as well as uninfected cells. This high MOI infection results in infection of the majority of the cells and thus a synchronous cell population, allowing for molecular dissection of the events along infection. We designed our experiment to simultaneously monitor both RNA levels and translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Deep sequencing of mRNA (RNA-seq) generates a detailed depiction of transcript levels during infection and this was paired with ribosome profiling, which allows accurate measurement of protein synthesis by capturing the overall <italic>in-vivo</italic> distribution of ribosomes on a given message <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. In order to assess the reproducibility of our experiments we prepared two independent biological replicates for the uninfected and 8hpi time points and both the mRNA and footprint measurements were reproducible (Figure S1A and S1B). Metagene analysis, in which gene profiles are aligned and then averaged, revealed the expected profiles of footprints along mRNAs; ribosome density accumulates from the start codon along the gene body ending at the first in-frame stop codon with pronounced accumulation of ribosomes at the initiation sites and 3 bp periodicity along the gene body (Figure S1C). Using this data, we quantitatively assessed the expression pattern of 8627 cellular transcripts and 12 canonical viral ORFs that are expressed from the genomic and sub-genomic RNAs along SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P8">Analysis of the mRNAs and footprints originating from cellular and viral transcripts illustrates SARS-CoV-2’s unprecedented dominance over the mRNA pool. At 8 hpi viral mRNAs comprise almost 90% of the mRNAs in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Surprisingly, however, at the same time point, viral mRNAs account for only ~34% of the RNA fragments engaged with ribosomes in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). In order to quantitatively evaluate the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to co-opt the host ribosomes we calculated the relative translation efficiency (TE) of viral and cellular RNA along infection. TE is defined as the ratio of footprints to mRNA reads for a given gene and reflects how well a gene is being translated. We then compared the TE of human genes to that of viral genes at each of the time points along infection. The analysis shows that at 3 hpi viral gene translation efficiencies fall within the general range of cellular gene translation. This indicates that when infection initiates, viral transcripts are translated with efficiencies similar to those of host transcripts. As infection progresses, viral gene translation efficiency relative to cellular genes is significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Since it seems improbable that the virus will promote conditions that are unfavorable to the translation of its mRNA, this relative reduction in translation of viral genes at 5 and 8 hpi may indicate that not all viral RNAs are accessible for translation. Since double-membrane sealed replication compartments are formed to accommodate viral genome replication <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>, an appealing possibility is that these compartments sequester a sizable fraction of the viral RNA molecules and thus prevent them from being a part of the translated mRNA pool.</p>
<p id="P9">By their nature, deep sequencing measurements provide relative values but not absolute quantification of RNA and translation levels. Since SARS-CoV-2 encoded protein, NSP1, was recently shown to interfere with translation by blocking the mRNA entry channel of ribosomes <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>, and since the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 interferes with the overall levels of cellular mRNA was not assessed, we next examined if SARS-CoV-2 infection affects global translation and RNA levels. To quantify absolute translation levels, we measured nascent protein synthesis levels using an analogue of puromycin, O-Propargyl Puromycin (OPP), which incorporates into elongating polypeptide chains <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>. The nascent polypeptides with incorporated OPP are fluorescently-labeled via a Click reaction and the levels of OPP incorporation into elongating polypeptides is quantified by flow cytometry (Figure S2A and S2B). We infected Calu3 cells with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 3 and measured nascent protein synthesis levels in uninfected cells and at 3, 5 and 8 hpi. We observed a significant reduction in global translation levels already at 3 hpi which was augmented with time, and at 8 hpi translation activity was reduced by 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). In parallel we measured the total RNA levels and rRNA levels extracted from uninfected cells and at 3, 5, and 8 hpi. This analysis illustrated there are no major changes in total RNA or in rRNA levels along SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure S3A and S3B). Since the vast majority of RNA in cells originates from rRNA and this dominance of rRNA may mask changes in mRNA levels we sequenced total RNA, without rRNA depletion, to assess the relative abundance of cellular and viral mRNAs in uninfected cells and at 3, 5, and 8 hpi. This analysis demonstrates that the pool of mRNA molecules relative to rRNA is growing during infection, due to the massive production of viral transcripts but at the same time the relative fraction of cellular mRNA is reduced by approximately 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1F</xref>). This suggests that during infection there is both massive production of viral transcripts and a concomitant substantial reduction in the levels of cellular transcripts.</p>
<p id="P10">Next, we quantitatively assessed the expression pattern of cellular genes along SARS-CoV-2 infection. We clustered the mRNA levels of genes that showed the most significant changes along infection using partitioning clustering, allowing grouping of cellular transcripts into three distinct classes based on similarities in temporal expression profiles in the RNA-seq. Overall, we found that changes in ribosome footprints tracked the changes in transcript abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>), with some exceptions that will be discussed in detail below. This shows that part of the reduction in cellular protein synthesis is driven by the reduction in cellular RNA levels. Interestingly, although the levels of the majority of host transcripts were reduced during SARS-CoV-2 infection, we identified numerous transcripts that were significantly elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>, cluster 3). We carried out pathway enrichment analysis for each of these three clusters. As expected, the group of upregulated mRNAs (cluster 3) was significantly enriched with genes related to immune response, including Toll receptor Signaling, chemokine and cytokine signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref> and Table S1) and these upregulated genes include IL6 and IL8 which play a significant role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup> and several IFN stimulated genes like, IFIT1, 2 and 3, IRF1, ISG15 and TNF alpha induced proteins. These measurements and analyses reveal that the shutoff in host protein synthesis is driven by several mechanisms including; general reduction in the translation capacity of infected cells and reduction in the levels of most cellular mRNAs.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Viral gene expression dynamics along infection</title>
<p id="P11">We next analyzed viral gene expression dynamics along SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral ORFs are translated from the 30kb genomic RNA or from a nested series of subgenomic RNAs that contain a common 5′ leader fused to different segments from the 3′ end of the viral genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and V’kovski et al., 2020). Viral transcripts and translation levels significantly increased from 3 to 5 hpi but the relative abundance of some viral transcripts and their translation rates were reduced from 5 to 8 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). This relative reduction in translation rates of some viral transcripts prompted us to assess the relative translation efficiency of viral genes along infection. Since, as indicated above, the translation efficiency of viral genes compared to their cellular counterparts is relatively reduced along infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), here we examined how the translation of viral genes is distributed between different viral transcripts at different times post infection. This focused analysis revealed an interesting connection between changes in translation efficiency of viral ORFs and their relative location on the viral genome. ORFs that are located at the 5’ end of the genome showed relative increase in their translation efficiency along infection whereas ORFs that are encoded towards the 3’ end of the genome showed relative reduction in their translation efficiencies and ORFs located in the middle of genome showed no major changes in their relative translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Since all viral subgenomic RNAs share the same 5’UTR these differences in translation capacity according to the location in the genome point to a potential unappreciated role for the 3’UTR (the 3’ portion of which is shared between all transcripts) or for the length of viral transcripts, which varies greatly between viral transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). To examine if this phenomenon reflects a general beta CoVs feature, we analyzed the expression and translation of Mouse Hepatitis Virus strain A59 (MHV) ORFs along MHV infection using published RNA-seq and ribosome profiling data along MHV infection <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>
</sup>. MHV has a similar genomic organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) and the increase in viral mRNA and translation between 5 and 8 hpi varied between viral ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). Although this phenomenon was not as strong, also in the case of MHV, ORFs that are located at the 5’ end of the genome showed relative increase or no change in their translation efficiency along infection whereas ORFs that are encoded towards the 3’ end of the genome showed relative reduction in their translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). Together these results indicate that the 3’UTR or viral gene length are likely regulating the translation efficacy of viral mRNAs along infection.</p>
<p id="P12">Most SARS-CoV-2 ORFs are 3′-proximal and translated from dedicated subgenomic mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). However several subgenomic RNAs encode for additional out-of-frame ORFs, likely via a leaky scanning mechanism <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>. These include ORFs 7b and ORF9b, which are translated from the ORF7a and N subgenomic RNAs, and two ORFs we recently identified by ribosome profiling <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>, that are supported by additional evidence <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>, ORF3c and ORFS.iORF that are translated from ORF3a and ORF-S subgenomic RNAs. Since scanning efficiency can be regulated by stress conditions <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
</sup> we examined if the ratio between the translation of a 3′-proximal ORF and its corresponding out-of-frame ORF (encoded by the same subgenomic RNA) changes during infection. Since ORF9b expression was low in our measurements it was excluded from this analysis. The translation of ORF7b, ORF3c and ORFS.iORF correlated with the expression of the 3′-proximal main ORF, indicating there are no major changes in the efficiency of ribosome scanning of viral transcripts along infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Cellular mRNAs are degraded during SARS-CoV-2 infection</title>
<p id="P13">Our results indicate that the levels of the majority of cellular RNA are reduced during SARS-CoV-2 infection and this reduction contributes to the shutoff of cellular protein synthesis. Reduction in cellular RNA levels could be due to interference with RNA production or accelerated RNA degradation. To explore the molecular mechanism, we analyzed if the reduction in cellular transcripts is associated with their subcellular localization. We used measurements of the subcellular localization of transcripts by cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionation <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup> to assess the importance of subcellular localization. The levels of transcripts that mostly localize to the cytoplasm were more reduced in infected cells compared to transcripts that are mostly nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) and there was a clear correlation between subcellular localization and the extent of reduction in transcript levels following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure S4A). Furthermore, compared to transcripts encoded in the nuclear genome, mitochondrial encoded transcripts were refractory to the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The specific sensitivity of cytosolic transcripts implies these transcripts may be specifically targeted during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In CoVs, the most prominent and well characterized cellular shutoff protein is NSP1 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>. So far, studies on SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 demonstrated it restricts translation by directly binding to the ribosome 40S subunit <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>, thereby globally inhibiting translation initiation. For SARS-CoV, on top of this translation effect, NSP1 interactions with the 40S was also shown to induce cleavage of translated cellular mRNAs, thereby accelerating their turnover <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. To examine if the reduction in cellular transcripts in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells is coupled to their translation we compiled a list of 14 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that localize to the cytoplasm and are well expressed in our data but, as expected, poorly translated (Figure S4B). Relatively to cellular mRNAs, cytoplasmic lncRNAs were less affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating accelerated turnover of cellular transcripts in infected cells may be related to their translation. Recently, ribosome profiling and RNA-seq were conducted on cells transfected with NSP1 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup>. Analysis of the RNA expression from this data revealed that ectopic NSP1 expression leads to weaker but similar signatures to the ones we identified in infected cells; stronger reduction of cytosolic transcripts compared to nuclear transcripts, stronger sensitivity of nuclear encoded transcripts, and stronger reduction of translated mRNA compared to cytosolic lncRNAs (Figure S5A-C).</p>
<p id="P14">We further noticed SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to increased levels of intronic reads in many cellular transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>) indicating SARS-CoV-2 may interfere with cellular mRNA splicing, as was recently suggested <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. However, massive degradation of mature cytosolic mRNAs may also generate a relative increase in intronic reads. We therefore analyzed the ratio of intronic and exonic reads relative to rRNA. Whereas relative to rRNA levels, exonic reads showed drastic reduction along SARS-CoV-2 infection, the intronic reads levels showed a more subtle change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Furthermore, the increase in the ratio of intronic to exonic reads was greater in genes whose expression was reduced along infection compared to genes whose expression was induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref> and Figure S6A), illustrating the relative increase in intronic reads is mostly independent of newly transcribed RNAs. Finally, we also detected more intronic reads in cells that exogenously expressed NSP1 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>
</sup> (Figure S6B). Together these results indicate that the increase in intronic reads compared to exonic reads during SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely driven by accelerated degradation of mature cellular transcripts that leads to relative reduction in exonic reads. It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 also directly regulates splicing efficiency, as was recently proposed <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>, but this effect seems more subtle. Together these findings indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to accelerated degradation of cytosolic cellular mRNAs and that this degradation significantly affects the production of cellular proteins.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR protects viral RNA from NSP1 induced RNA degradation</title>
<p id="P15">An important aspect of host shutoff during infection is the ability of the virus to hamper the translation of cellular transcripts while recruiting the ribosome to its own transcripts. Although it has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs are refractory to the translation inhibition induced by NSP1 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup> our measurements indicate that SARS-CoV-2 transcripts are not preferentially translated in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>), that RNA degradation plays a prominent role in remodeling the mRNA pool in infected cells and that SARS-CoV-2 dominates the mRNA pool. All SARS-CoV-2-encoded subgenomic RNAs contain a common 5′ leader sequence that is added during negative-strand synthesis <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>
</sup>. We therefore explored whether the 5’UTR sequence protects viral mRNAs from NSP1 induced degradation. We fused the viral 5’UTR sequence or a short control 5’UTR to the 5′ end of a GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) and transfected these constructs together with expression vectors encoding NSP1 or NSP2 (that was used as a control) into 293T cells. We found that NSP1 expression suppresses the production of the control-GFP but not of the 5’UTR-containing GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). We extracted RNA from these cells and observed that the NSP1 induced reduction in control-GFP expression was associated with 15-fold reduction in the RNA GFP levels whereas the levels of the GFP RNA with the SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR were not reduced, and were even slightly increased, by NSP1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). The plasmid we used also contains an mCherry reporter expressed from an independent promoter. Reassuringly NSP1 also induces a reduction in both mCherry protein (Figure S7A and S7B) and RNA levels (Figure S7C) when compared to NSP2. These results indicate that the 5′ UTR of viral RNAs provides them protection from NSP1 induced degradation and that this protection contributes to the ability of the virus to dominate the mRNA pool in infected cells.</p>

<title>The translation efficiency of transcriptionally induced genes is impaired during infection</title>
<p id="P16">Our results so far exemplify how SARS-CoV-2 remodels the transcript pool in infected cells. To quantitatively evaluate the role of translational control along SARS-CoV-2 infection, we calculated relative translation efficiency (TE, ratio of footprints to mRNAs for a given gene) along infection. We then centered on genes that showed the strongest change in their relative TE along infection. We clustered these genes into four clusters, based on similarity in their temporal TE profiles, which largely reflect genes whose relative TE is reduced along infection and genes whose relative TE is increased. The mRNA and footprint temporal profiles of these genes reveal a clear signature; the genes whose relative TE along infection was reduced were genes whose mRNA increased during infection but did not show a corresponding increase in footprints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> and Figure S8). These genes were enriched in immune response genes (FDR &lt; 10<sup>-4</sup>) like IRF1, IL-6 and CXCL3. Comparing changes in mRNA and TE levels of cellular genes along infection demonstrates that generally transcripts which are transcriptionally induced following infection show a reduction in their relative TE and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). This inability of RNA that is elevated in response to infection to reach the ribosomes, may explain why infected cells fail to launch a robust IFN response <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. These data demonstrate that the overall capacity of infected cells to generate new proteins is severely impaired.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P17">Many viruses developed varied and sophisticated mechanisms to repress host mRNA translation in order to block the cellular innate immune response and concomitantly allow the translation of viral mRNAs. Specifically, CoVs have evolved specialized mechanisms to hijack the host gene expression machineries, including inhibition of host protein synthesis and induction of endonucleolytic cleavage of host mRNAs <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
</sup>. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 several viral ORFs have been suggested to interfere with viral gene expression <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup>, but what occurs during viral infection remained an open question.</p>
<p id="P18">Using unbiased measurements of translation and RNA expression along SARS-CoV-2 infection, we identified three major courses by which SARS-CoV-2 interferes with cellular gene expression in infected cells; 1. global inhibition of protein translation, 2. degradation of cytosolic cellular transcripts and 3. specific translation inhibition of newly transcribed mRNAs. Disruption of cellular protein production using these three components may represent a multi-pronged mechanism that synergistically acts to suppress the host antiviral response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). These mechanisms may explain the molecular basis of the potent suppression of IFN response observed in animal models and in severe COVID-19 patients <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P19">Despite differences in protein size and mode of action, NSP1 proteins from alpha- and beta- CoVs suppress host gene expression <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>
</sup>, making Nsp1 a central host shutoff factor of CoVs. Indeed, several studies focused on SARS-CoV-2 encoded NSP1, showing it binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit, leading to reduction in mRNA translation both in vitro and in cells <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
</sup>. Still, how the virus can overcome the NSP1-mediated block of translation and how NSP1 effects come into play during infection remained unclear. We reveal here that in resemblance to what had been described for SARS-CoV NSP1, SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 induces shutdown of host protein translation by two mechanisms: first, it stalls canonical mRNA translation as was reported by others <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
</sup> leading to general reduction in the translation capacity of infected cells. Second, NSP1 leads to accelerated cellular mRNA degradation. SARS-CoV NSP1 induces endonucleolytic cleavage and subsequent degradation of host mRNAs and this activity depends on its binding to the 40S ribosome subunit <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
</sup>. Our results indicate a similar mechanism operates in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells as we show cytosolic RNAs, specifically ones that are being translated, are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2-mediated degradation. several studies have shown that mRNAs with viral 5′ UTR are translated more efficiently compared to control 5’UTR in the presence of NSP1 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>
</sup> <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup> but it was further demonstrated that NSP1 inhibits translation of both cellular and a viral 5′ UTR-containing reporter mRNA <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup> <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup> implying viral mRNAs do not simply evade translation inhibition in the context of the 5′ UTR sequence. Our measurements from infected cells support these findings as we show viral RNA are not preferentially translated in infected cells. Instead, using a reporter, we show that the viral 5’UTR renders mRNAs refractory to RNA degradation mediated by NSP1. Together these results support a model in which NSP1 acts as a strong inhibitor of translation, tightly binding ribosomes and reducing the pool of available ribosomes that can engage in translation. At the same time ribosome bound NSP1 leads to accelerated degradation of cellular but not of viral mRNAs providing means for viral mRNA to quickly take over and dominate the mRNA pool. This accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs explains how infected cells switch their translation towards viral mRNAs. In support of this model, we show that within 8 hours 88% of the mRNAs in infected cells is viral. Notably, interactions between SARS-CoV NSP1 and the viral 5′ UTR prevent NSP1-induced RNA cleavage <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>
</sup>, indicating that likely similar mechanisms are applied by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses.</p>
<p id="P20">On top of the general translation reduction and cellular mRNA degradation which are likely mediated by NSP1, we also observed that in mRNAs that are being induced in response to infection there is no corresponding increase in footprints, indicating these newly generated transcripts are less likely to engage with ribosomes. Since mRNAs that are induced in infection are enriched in cytokines and IFN induced genes, this distinctive mechanism may provide additional explanation why infected cells fail to mount an efficient anti-viral response. Although we do not know the underlying molecular mechanism, one appealing hypothesis is viral inhibition of cellular mRNA nuclear export. Since SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the cytoplasm, inhibiting the nuclear export of mRNAs can provide unique advantages as it will specifically inhibit cellular mRNA translation and more explicitly it will lead to suppression of the host’s antiviral response genes which are transcriptionally induced and therefore fully depend on efficient nuclear export. ORF6 was recently shown to co-purify with host mRNA export factors <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
</sup> and by over expression it disrupts nucleocytoplasmic export <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
</sup>, providing a candidate that may explain the phenotype we observe in infection. Another possibility is that NSP16, which was recently shown to inhibit cellular RNA splicing <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>, is driving this phenotype as interference with splicing will prevent efficient nuclear export. Indeed, we show here that infection leads to increased levels of intronic reads in many cellular transcripts. Although our analysis reveals some of this signature is attributed to accelerated degradation of mature cellular transcripts it is likely there is also a processing and splicing defect that leads to more intronic reads and eventually aberrant export.</p>
<p id="P21">Overall, our study provides an in-depth picture of how SARS-CoV-2 efficiently interferes with cellular gene expression, leading to shutdown of host protein production using a multipronged strategy.</p>

For heatmaps and clustering, gene filtering was done according to mRNA as described above, and genes with zero reads in any of the samples (mRNA and FP of all time points) were excluded. Histone genes were excluded. Read coverage on genes was normalized to units of RPKM in order to normalize for gene length and for sequencing depth.

For analysis concentrating on cellular genes alone, the RPKM was calculated based on the total number of host reads, and the RPKM values were further scaled to keep the number of total reads equal across samples.
