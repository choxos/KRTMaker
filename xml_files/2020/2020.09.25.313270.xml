<abstract>
<p id="P2">Since the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in several somatic cells, little is known about the infection of SASRS-CoV-2 and its related pangolin coronavirus (GX_P2V). Here we present for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V could infect lung progenitor and even anterior foregut endoderm cells causing these cells death, which differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V were inhibited when treated with whey protein of breastmilk and Remdesivir, confirming that these two viruses could infect lung progenitor and even anterior foregut endoderm. Moreover, we found that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could infect endoderm and ectoderm. We found that whey protein blocked SARS-CoV-2 infecting these cells. In line with the SARS-CoV-2 results, GX_P2V could also infected endoderm and ectoderm, and also was inhibited by Remdesivir treatment. Although expressing coronavirus related receptor such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2, mesoderm cells are not permissive for SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection, which needed further to study the mechanisms. Interestingly, we also found that hESCs, which also express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 markers, are permissive for GX_P2V but not SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection and replication, indicating the widespread cell types for GX_P2V infection. Heparin treatment blocked efficiently viral infection. These results provided insight that these stem cells maybe provided a stable repository of coronavirus function or genome. The potential consequence of SARS-CoV-2 and animal coronavirus such as GX_P2V infection in hESCs, germ layer and induced progenitors should be closely monitored.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was declared a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) and resulted in over 30 million confirmed cases and more than 800 thousand deaths over the world since its outbreak. Although respiratory failure is the most common mortality outcome in COVID-19 patients, other fatal manifestations are also existed in multiple organ systems, including the heart, brain and gastrointestinal tract <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. It’s reported that nearly 25% of the 400 COVID-19 patients had suffered in-hospital cardiac injury <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. Nearly 25% of the COVID-19 patients had gastrointestinal symptom, including anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may infects gastrointestinal cells <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. Interestingly, a recent Germany study demonstrated that positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected in human brain biopsies in 36.4% of fatal COVID-19 cases <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. Recently, a group found that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could infect pancreatic endocrine cells, liver organoids, cardiomyocytes and dopaminergic neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. All these findings highlight the potential of viral infection in several organs and even stem cells. However, there has been no direct experimental evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different differentiation stages of human embryonic stem cells. A recent clinical study showed that SARS-CoV-2 related receptors, such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2, also express in the trophoblast of the blastocyst and tiotrophoblast and hypoblast of the implantation stages, indicating that the embryo may support SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting potential risks for vertical transmission and fetal health <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. Importantly, a recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2 could also infect human neural progenitor cells, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 could infect and replicate in widespread cell types even stem cells. Together, these findings suggest that the different stages of human embryonic stem cells differentiation might also be the susceptible for SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p id="P17">To investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 infects human lung progenitor cells (hLPCs), we first evaluated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in hLPCs. Our data suggested that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, as well as lung progenitor markers of Sox2, FoxA2 and NKx2.1, were detected in hLPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A and C</xref>). Then, we infected the hLPCs with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus at viral inocula of 650 TCID<sub>50</sub>/well as previously described<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. As a result, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could infect hLPCs and the infection could be inhibited by breastmilk (2 mg/ml), which was reported to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In line with the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus results, we also infected hLPCs with SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin coronavirus (GX_P2V) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>at 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) and found that GX_P2V RNA could be detected in hLPCs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. After Remdesivir (1.5 μM) and human breastmilk (2 mg/ml) treatment, GX_P2V RNA level decreased significantly compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). In addition, we also analyzed the cell viability of GX_P2V infected hLPCs. Accordingly, GX_P2V infection reduced the viability of hLPCs. Next, we challenged the earlier stage cells of human anterior foregut endoderm (hAFECs) with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (650 TCID<sub>50</sub>/well) and GX_P2V (MOI=0.1) for viral infection assessment. We found that hAFECs markers and also ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressed in the differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Luciferase activity could be detected and decreased after breastmilk (from both human and goat) treatment in hAFECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Interestingly, GX_P2V RNA levels decreased during the Remdesivir (1.5 μM) and human breastmilk (2 mg/ml) treatment in the hAFECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). In addition, we also found that heparin could also significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-C</xref>), indicating heparins potential for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the heparan sulphate could be the potential co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. These findings suggest that hLPCs and also hAFECs are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V infection.</p>
<p id="P18">To explore the possible permissive of endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm to SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection, we generated hESCs into endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm according to the manufacturer’s instructions, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, the immunofluorescent assay showed that Sox17, Brachyury, nestin was detected in endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm, respectively. In addition, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were also expressed in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). Next, we challenged these cells with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V virus. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could be detected in endoderm and ectoderm, but not mesoderm. The SARS-CoV-2 infection could be inhibited by whey protein of human and goat both in endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>) and ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). However, the cells activity from hESCs, endoderm and ectoderm was influenced by human breastmilk (data not shown). Interestingly, GX_P2V RNA was positive in endoderm and ectoderm cells but not mesoderm, indicating the potential inhibitory activity or lack key factors of mesoderm to SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection. After Remdesivir (1.5 μM) treatment, GX_P2V RNA level was significantly lower compared to those without any drug treatment both in endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>) and ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>). We found that GX_P2V nucleoprotein (NP) could be detected in endoderm and ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>), but not in mesoderm (data not shown) by western blot assay. In addition, we also challenged the Vero E6 cells with the supernatant collected from infected endoderm and ectoderm to perform plaque assay. As results, both endoderm and ectoderm could reproduce infectious viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1N</xref>). These results indicated that the germ layer cells such as endoderm and ectoderm are also permissive for both SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection.</p>
<p id="P19">To further investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V infect hESCs, the cultured hESCs were challenged by these two viruses. Firstly, we detected the stem cell markers of OCT-4 and SSEA-4 by immunofluorescent assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, OCT-4 and SSEA-4 staining were identified in the hESCs cells. We infected the hESCs with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V, respectively. Unfortunately, luciferase activity was undetected in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infected hESCs cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). However, GX_P2V RNA was relative positive at 48 and 72 hours post infection (hpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1L</xref>) and NP was positive in hESCs cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1M</xref>). Remdesivir also showed inhibitory activity to GX_P2V in these cells. Plaque assay results showed that hESCs could also produce infectious GX_P2V. These results indicated that hESCs are not permissive for SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus but permissive for the pangolin coronavirus of GX_P2V infection.</p>

<sec id="S18" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P20">We demonstrated that induced endoderm, ectoderm, hAFECs and hLPCs are permissive for both SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection. The hESCs are permissive for GX_P2V but not SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection. Extensive viral protein expression and infectious viral particles were also detected in these infected cells. Breastmilk and Remdesivir could inhibit viral infection and replication in these cells. In addition, heparin could also inhibit both SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection, indicating its potential usage as a direct-acting inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection. These results may explain why SARS-CoV-2 could infect many organs. Moreover, these results provided insight that these stem cells maybe provided a stable repository of coronavirus function or genome. Coronavirus persistence in human stem cells confers the possibility that coronavirus may eventually become a passenger in the human germline and even vertical transmission to new born. Surprisingly, the pangolin coronavirus of GX_P2V could not only infect human mature somatic cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>, but also infect the hESCs, endoderm, ectoderm, hAFECs and hLPCs, indicating the possibility of the cross-species transmission and potential danger of coronavirus from animals. However, both viruses could not infect mesoderm, even though it expresses viral recptor of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, indicating the potential inhibitory activity of mesoderm to these coronaviruses, which may explain why mesenchymal stem cells could be used as a therapy tool for COVID-19 treatment<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. The potential consequence of SARS-CoV-2 and animal coronavirus such as GX_P2V infection in hESCs, germ layer and induced progenitors should be closely monitored.</p>

(N)</bold> Infectious virus titer of the supernatant samples from hESCs, endoderm and ectoderm infected with GX_P2V for 72h were determined by plaque assay. Data were obtained from three independent experiments. hESCs, human embryonic stem cells; hAFECs, human anterior foregut endoderm; hLPCs, human lung progenitor cells; MOI, multiplicity of infection; hpi, hours post-infection; NP, nucleoprotein. Values are shown as mean of triplicates ± SD, *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01 by unpaired two-tailed t test.</p>
