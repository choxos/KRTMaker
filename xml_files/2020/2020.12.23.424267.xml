<abstract>
<p id="P1">SARS-CoV-2 infection in minks has become a serious problem, as the virus may mutate and reinfect humans; some countries have decided to cull minks. Here, the virus sequencing data in minks were analysed and compared to those of human-virus. Although the mink-virus maintained the characteristics of human-virus, some variants rapidly mutated, adapting to minks. Some mink-derived variants infected humans, which accounted for 40% of the total SARS-CoV-2 cases in the Netherlands. These variants appear to be less lethal and infective compared to those in humans. Variants that have mutated further among minks were not found in humans. Such mink-viruses might be suitable for vaccination for humans, such as in the case of the smallpox virus, which is less infective and toxic to humans.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), infects not only humans but also several other animal species <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. Infection in minks has become a particularly serious problem <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>; symptoms in minks appear to be lethal in the USA and Denmark, <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup> but are milder in Spain <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>; those in the Netherland seem to have been varied <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. Minks are culled because of the suspicion that the mink-virus can mutate and infect humans again <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. Here, we report the results of principal component analysis <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup> of the mink-and human-virus sequences. Many of the mink-viruses were identical to that of humans; however, some variants mutated rapidly. One such variant that was closer to the human-SARS-CoV-2 variant (human-virus) was prevalent in humans of the Netherlands, amounting to approximately 40% of the total cases. This variant was probably less lethal. Other variants that have mutated further among minks are unlikely to infect humans. If mink farming continues, more variants that have a low affinity to humans will become available. It is possible that such mink-SARS-CoV-2 variants (mink-viruses) could be used for vaccination in humans, such as in the case of the smallpox virus, which is less infective and toxic to humans.</p>
<p id="P3">Mink livestock have been farmed for a long time as their fur has a commercial value <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. Although mink farming has been declining recently, up to 50 million animals are farmed worldwide, mainly in Europe.</p>

<sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion">
<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p id="P4">The two highest axes of principal component (PC) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> (for basics of the methodology, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S3">Materials and Methods</xref> section). As is apparent, viral variants in human and mink appeared into four groups that are temporarily numbered as 0–3. Mink-virus in the Netherlands consisted of all groups, whereas those in Denmark belonged only to group 1. The highly infective variants of the second wave, which was the pan-European variant in both Denmark and the Netherland <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>, were not found from minks. In the sequence data from both countries, variations in mink-virus that appeared in those axes were limited, forming concentrated points stacked with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The limited number of variations reflects that viral transmission from humans to minks is rare and that the migration of the virus is also rare. The contribution of the viral samples from minks to these axes was small, and the viral samples from minks appeared in exactly the same PC as one of the humans. The axes represent the process by which SARS-CoV-2 adapts to humans <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>; group 3 includes the earliest variants, group 0 includes the first variant transferred to Europe <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>, and groups 1 and 2 were derived from group 0. The routes of virus migration and mutation presented in these axes were completed in April, and all groups could be found on all continents.</p>
<p id="P5">However, mutations also occurred in mink-virus in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The directions of mutations among mink-and human-viruses are completely different from one another as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A and 1B</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, this difference suggests that the parental strain of SARS-CoV-2 did not originate from minks, otherwise the reversion mutation would return to the direction that occurs among humans. None of the bases or amino acids were unique to mink-virus <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. They can be recognised as characteristic rearrangements that have collected parts of the human-virus. Such directed mutations were only found in group 2 variants of the Netherlands and were not found in mink-virus in Denmark.</p>
<p id="P6">These mutations may be the result of adaptation during viral transmission between minks, and the mutation rates were high (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>) <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. The differences are comparable to half of those between peaks of the seasonal H1N1 influenza virus, which usually takes a few years among humans to gain enough cumulative mutations that allow escaping herd immunity <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. In addition, the rates of the missense mutations were high <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. These phenomena were also observed in mutations in human-virus <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. The direction strongly suggests that the mutations are meaningful rather than random. These properties could be due to the positive selection of variants that are more infectious among new hosts, minks.</p>
<p id="P7">Viruses that mutate and leave the human-virus population can also reinfect humans. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, variants that were mainly prevalent in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) at one time, accounted for approximately 40% of total virus present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>); the variant may have been overlooked by the previous study <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. However, these are apart from other human-virus, and no such direction of mutations has been observed among (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Rather, the seventeen thousand human samples formed a concentrated mass in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B and 1C</xref>. Furthermore, human-to-human infectivity seemed to decrease and become sporadic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, variants indicated by IDs). Variants further away than those from humans' mass have not yet been identified in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Conversely, highly infective viral variants of the second wave in humans <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup> have not yet been identified in minks. These human and mink variants could have adapted specifically to their respective hosts.</p>
<p id="P8">In many countries, the variants mutated before the second wave <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. This phenomenon has also been confirmed in the Netherlands and Denmark, where similar variants were prevalent and waves occurred similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). However, there is one difference; the variant that seems to be derived from minks appeared mainly in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). This variant has disappeared to be replaced by the variant belonging to group 0 that caused the second wave. This is also the case in Denmark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 1B</xref>). This shows that the mink-derived variant is less infective than the second wave variant.</p>
<p id="P9">After the mink-derived variant disappeared, the fatality rate in the Netherlands increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). In the first wave, many of the cases might have been ignored; hence, the rate became very high, and then decreased. The confidence intervals showed that the increase was substantial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). This difference may correspond to the proportion of the mink-derived human-virus present; if the variant is not lethal to humans, this difference can be explained by its disappearance. Actually, many mink farmers positive by PCR did not show heavy symptoms, and variants that related to the clusters of mink sequences found on the mink farms did not spill over to people living in close proximity to mink farms had occurred <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>. Those would relate to the variants that have been adapted to minks. Since lower infectivity suggests a slow spread in the human body, it could allow sufficient time for the immune system to function, achieving lower lethality. Unfortunately, no data are available regarding individual human medical conditions; hence, we were unable to verify this lethality directly. However, data from 360 human samples with these mink-derived variants are shown in Figshare <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup> to enable clinical verification. Additionally, to check the toxicity of other variants, PCs of other human samples from each continent are available on the same page in Figshare.</p>
<p id="P10">Low lethality can also be expected, as the virus was derived from minks maintained in dense populations <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. Lethal viruses, such as those in the USA and Denmark <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>, eventually die with the host. Therefore, a pathogenicity that is excessively strong becomes a selective pressure. This could be the reason why adaptation was not observed among mink-virus in Denmark, where only limited variants were found. This pressure is not as effective for humans as it is for minks, as some patients do not show symptoms. However, because most farmed minks are of the same age and have similar genetic backgrounds, the disease status can be expected to be fairly uniform. Minks showed limited pathological traits in some countries, <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup> which suggested that this selection and attenuation is progressing within the mink population, or attenuated variants of human-derived virus are becoming apparent in minks.</p>
<p id="P11">The mink-derived human-virus in the Netherlands differ by only eight amino acids and 14 nucleotides from the closest human-virus. Although the mink-derived variant disappeared in Europe, if the variant remained in humans, the difference would not be safe enough for reverse mutations to re-adapt to humans.</p>
<p id="P12">Mutations of the group 2 mink-virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) appeared to adapt to the new host, minks. Accumulating mutations will further reduce infectivity to humans. Variations among these strains can be increased by mink farming. Such strains could be maintained in minks or in Vero cells; among them, we could identify a combination of a strain and dosage that infects, but does not cause symptoms in humans. If this is achieved, vaccination will become possible by infecting the intestinal tract via oral administration. Therefore, local governments should encourage farmers to maintain their minks, rather than culling them. However, as minks can also carry human-virus as is, sequence analysis would be required to avoid this risk. It may be advisable to artificially infect minks with a known safe strain to restart farming. Human SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to change independently in each region <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>. Although some of the mink-virus from Denmark appear to be highly toxic to minks <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>, the same group 1 variants would be the most adapted to humans, and they continue to mutate among humans in regions such as South Africa and Brazil. Some of these may have lower toxicity in minks.</p>

<p id="P13">PCA represents a sequence matrix, which is inherently multivariate data on multiple axes <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. Each axis covers a certain set of base positions with specific weights. These are PCs for the bases. A sample is given a value on each axis, PC for samples. PCs for bases and samples are inextricably linked to each other. The high-level axes, such as PC1, represent differences associated with more samples and bases; conversely, the lower axes represent a minor difference, for example, a feature that appears only in a particular country or region.</p>
<p id="P14">Sequence data of 1,832 human-virus in the Netherlands, 6,980 in Denmark, and mink-virus of 188 Netherlands and 63 Denmark were downloaded from GISAID <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup> on December 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2020. Sequences from 17,571 European human-virus downloaded previously were also used. The list of samples and acknowledgements are available in Figshare <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. The sequences were aligned using DECHIPER <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
</sup> then analysed using PCA <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. The axes were identified using 103 mink-virus and 6092 human-virus that were proportionally selected from each continent. These data may be comparable to 130 million animals; since the mink population is estimated to be 50 million <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>, the axes provide two to three times the weight toward minks, which might have enabled the identification of unique mutations in mink-virus. Following this, the axes were applied to all data.</p>
<p id="P15">All calculations were performed using R <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
</sup>. All the codes used are presented in the author's page in Figshare <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. The number of confirmed cases and deaths were obtained from the homepage of the WHO <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. The rate of fatality was estimated as the rate between deaths in the following week and the number of cases during the week. The 95% and 50% confidence intervals of the rate were estimated using the binomial test <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>, according to the estimation that deaths occur randomly among patients; if history repeats in the area with the same conditions, the observed rates will most likely vary as in this estimate. The mink-derived human-virus were found to have sPC8 &gt; 0.003 and sPC9 &gt; 0.001, and the rate was estimated within the countries. The weekly estimation of rates varied, as the numbers of infected and dead, and especially the number of sequences registered, were not very high. Therefore, the line representing the status changes was smoothened using the LOWESS function of the R <sup>
