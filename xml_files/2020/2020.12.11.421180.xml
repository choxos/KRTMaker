Standard event-related potential analysis assumes <italic>fixed-duration</italic> responses relative to experimental events. However, recent single unit recordings in animals have revealed neural activity <italic>scales</italic> to span different durations during behaviours demanding flexible timing. Here, we employed a general linear modelling approach using a novel combination of fixed-duration and variable-duration regressors to unmix fixed-time and scaled-time components in human magneto/electroencephalography (M/EEG) data. We use this to reveal consistent temporal scaling of human scalp-recorded potentials across four independent EEG datasets, including interval perception, production, prediction and value-based decision making. Between-trial variation in the temporally scaled response predicts between-trial variation in subject reaction times, demonstrating the relevance of this temporally scaled signal for temporal variation in behaviour. Our results provide a general approach for studying flexibly timed behaviour in the human brain.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title/><p id="P2">Action and perception in the real world require flexible timing. We can walk quickly or slowly, recognize the same piece of music played at different tempos, and form temporal expectations over long and short intervals. In many cognitive tasks, reaction time variability is modelled in terms of internal evidence accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], whereby the same dynamical process unfolds at different speeds on different trials.</p><p id="P3">Flexible timing is critical in our lives, yet despite several decades of research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] its neural correlates remain subject to extensive debate. Due to their high temporal resolution, magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) have played a particularly prominent role in understanding the neural basis of timing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], and the method typically used to analyze such data has been the event-related potential (ERP), which averages event-locked responses across multiple repetitions. For example, this approach has been used to identify the presence of a slow negative-going signal during timed intervals. This signal, called the contingent negative variation (CNV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], is thought to be timing related because its slope depends inversely on the duration of the timed interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Crucially, the ERP analysis strategy implicitly assumes that neural activity occurs at <italic>fixed-time</italic> latencies with respect to experimental events. However, it has recently been shown that brain activity at the level of individual neurons can be best explained by a <italic>temporal scaling</italic> model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], in which activity is explained by a single response that is stretched or compressed according to the length of the produced interval. When monkeys are cued to produce intervals of different lengths, the temporal scaling model explains the majority of variance in neural responses from medial frontal cortex (MFC) single units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. This suggests that one mechanism by which flexible motor timing can be achieved is by adjusting the speed of a common neural process, a perspective readily viewed through the lens of dynamical systems theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Consistent with the broad role played by dynamical systems in a range of neural computations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], recent studies in neural populations have revealed</p><p id="P5">time-warping as a common property across many different population recordings and behavioural tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. For example, temporal scaling is also implicit in the neural correlates of evidence integration during sensory and value-based decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] (which itself has also been proposed as a mechanism for time estimation in previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]).</p><p id="P6">Successfully characterising scaled-time components in humans could open the door to studying the role of temporal scaling in more complex, hierarchical tasks such as music production or language perception, as well as in patient populations in which timing is impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Yet it is currently unclear how temporal scaling of neural responses may manifest at the scalp (if at all) using non-invasive recording in humans. This is because of the fixed-time nature of the ERP analysis strategy. Again, one component of the ERP called the CNV has been found to ramp at different speeds for different temporal intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], suggestive of temporal scaling. Crucially though, any scaled activity would appear mixed at the scalp with fixed-time components due to the <italic>superposition problem</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>].</p><p id="P7">We therefore developed an approach to <italic>unmix</italic> scaled-time and fixed-time components in the EEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>). Our proposed method builds on recently developed least square regression-based approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] that have proven useful in unmixing fixed-time components that overlap with one another, such as stimulus-related activity and response-related activity. To overcome the superposition problem, these approaches use a convolutional general linear model (GLM) to deconvolve neural responses that are potentially overlapping. Following this work, we estimate the fixed-time ERPs using a GLM in which the design matrix is filled with time-lagged ‘stick functions’ (a regressor which is valued 1 around the timepoint of interest, and 0 otherwise). Importantly, the stick functions can overlap in time to capture overlap in the underlying neural responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>), and the degree of fit to neural data can be improved by adding a regularisation penalty to the model estimation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. In situations without any overlap, the GLM would exactly return the conventional ERP.</p><p id="P8">The key innovation that we introduce here is to allow for <italic>variable-duration</italic> regressors in such models, in addition to fixed-duration regressors, to test for the presence of scaled-time responses. In particular, we allow the duration of the stick function to vary depending upon the interval between stimulus and response, meaning that the same neural response can span different durations on different trials. Thus, rather than modelling the mean interval duration of each condition (e.g., via traditional ERPs), the proposed method captures trial-to-trial response variability. The returned scaled-time potential is no longer a function of real-world (‘wall clock’) time, but instead a function of the <italic>percentage of time elapsed</italic> between stimulus and response.</p><p id="P9">As a proof of concept, we simulated data at a single EEG sensor for an interval timing task, consisting of two <italic>fixed-time components</italic> (locked to cues and responses), and one <italic>scaled-time component</italic> spanning between cues and responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>). Our proposed method was successful in recovering all three components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>), whereas a conventional ERP approach obscured the scaled-time component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d</xref>). Crucially, in real EEG data we repeated this approach across all sensors, potentially revealing different scalp distributions (and hence different neural sources) for fixed-time versus scaled-time components.</p><p id="P10">By unmixing fixed and scaled components, our method goes beyond previous approaches for dealing with timing variability in EEG experiments. For example, the event-related timing of EEG trials can be aligned by translating either the entire waveform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] or individual ERP components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Such methods allow for component alignment, but do not involve any scaling. On the other hand, raw EEG can be scaled to align trials to a common time frame, e.g., through upsampling/downsampling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] or dynamic time warping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. However, these methods are not designed to <italic>unmix</italic> fixed-time and scaled-time components. Finally, the effect of a continuous variable on EEG can be quantified using the method of temporal response functions (TRFs), another regression-based approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. TRFs are particularly flexible in capturing different types of delay activity, e.g., during periods of growing expectancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] or while listening to fast/slow speech [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Our method is related to TRFs in that it involves the convolution of a to-be-estimated input signal with a continuous regressor. Unlike TRFs, however, the proposed method involves an additional scaling step in which the input signal is stretched or compressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 1</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We also note that a time-frequency decomposition might also readily separate the responses at higher and lower-frequencies. Indeed, a wide range of neural oscillations have been implicated in time perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. One might reasonably expect stretched/compressed signals to manifest differently in the time-frequency domain, e.g., as they correlate more strongly with different stretched/compressed versions of the same wavelet function. Unlike our proposed approach, however, a time-frequency decomposition is not readily designed to look for temporal scaling of the scaled-time response, namely the <italic>same</italic> neural response unfolding over <italic>different</italic> timescales on different trials. Nor will a time-frequency decomposition separate fixed-time responses from scaled-time responses if the signals occupy the same frequency band [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>].</p><p id="P12">We used our approach to analyze EEG recorded across four independent datasets, comprising three interval timing tasks and one decision-making task. In the first task, participants produced a target interval (short, medium, or long) following a cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>). Feedback was provided, and participants were able to closely match the target intervals. In the second, participants evaluated a computer-produced interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b</xref>). The closer the produced interval was to the target interval, the more likely participants were to judge the response as ‘on time’. In the third (previously analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]) task, participants made temporal predictions about upcoming events based on rhythmic predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In the fourth task (also previously analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]) participant chose between pairs of snack items (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2d</xref>) – a process in which reaction time variability can be modelled as a process of internal evidence accumulation across time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Neural activity related to evidence accumulation is measurable on the scalp as ramping activity that scales with decision difficulty. EEG for fast, easy trials increases at a faster rate compared to EEG for slow, difficult trials, indicating a higher rate of internal evidence accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Thus, we predicted that the EEG would contain an underlying scaled component associated with different rates of evidence accumulation.</p><p id="P14">In all four tasks, we observed a scaled-time component that was distinct from the preceding and following fixed-time components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>), which resembled conventional ERPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 3</xref>). Typically, ERP components are defined by their polarity and scalp distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. The observed scaled-time components shared a common polarity (negative) and scalp distribution (central). In each task, cluster-based permutation testing revealed that the scaled-time component differed significantly from zero. The differences were driven by clusters spanning 36-87% in the production task (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), 42-100% in the perception task (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), 18-27% in the prediction task (<italic>p</italic> = .004), and 36-55% in the decision-making task (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). For each task, including a scaled-time component improved model fit compared to a model with fixed-time components only: production: <italic>t</italic>(19) = -3.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = -0.89; perception: <italic>t</italic>(19) = -5.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = -1.14; prediction: <italic>t</italic>(18) = -4.90, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = -1.12; decision-making: <italic>t</italic>(17) = -7.77, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = -1.83 (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 8</xref> for model errors). In many cases, scaled-time components were reliably observed at the single-subject level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 5-8</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To further validate our method, we quantified temporal scaling by computing a ‘scaling index’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] for each task and participant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). To calculate this, we stretched/compressed each epoch to match the longest interval in each task, averaged by condition, then calculated the coefficient of determination for predicting the longer interval using stretched versions of the shorter intervals. We did this first on the raw data (‘Original’), then separately for the data containing only the fixed-time components (‘Fixed-only’, i.e., scaled-time components regressed out) and the scaled-time components (‘Scaled-only’, i.e., fixed-time components regressed out). In three out of four tasks, the scaling index for the scaled component exceeded the scaling index for the fixed component (production: <italic>t</italic>(19) = 2.95, <italic>p</italic> = .008, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.66; perception: <italic>t</italic>(19) = 2.63, <italic>p</italic> = .017, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.59; prediction: <italic>t</italic>(18) =5.45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 1.27; decision-making: <italic>t</italic>(17) = 5.45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 1.29).</p><p id="P16">We then examined how the scaled-time component relates to behavioural variability: does the latency of the scaled-time component predict participants’ response time? We focussed on the temporal production and decision-making tasks, in which the interval duration was equal to the response time. As response time varied from trial to trial, so did the modelled scaled component. To measure component latency, we applied an approach developed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>], using principal component analysis (PCA) to model delay activity over central electrodes in the temporal production task.. The approach works by detecting latency shifts in a common underlying component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Unlike simple peak detection, PCA can account for a range of waveform dynamics (e.g., multiple peaks). We first regressed out the fixed-time component as identified by the GLM, resulting in a dataset that consisted only of the residual scaled-time activity. We then computed the average scaled-time activity for each of the three interval conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a-c</xref>). PCA was applied separately to each interval. This consistently revealed a first principal component that matched the shape of the scaled-time component and a second principal component that matched its <italic>temporal derivative</italic>. This analysis confirms the presence of the scaled-time component in our data, as it is the first principal component of the residuals after removing fixed-time components. Crucially, adding or subtracting the second principal component captures variation in the <italic>latency</italic> of the scaled-time component (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 4</xref>). Across response time quantiles, we found that PC2 scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>) were significantly related to response times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5d</xref>), <italic>F</italic>(2,38) = 6.18, <italic>p</italic> = .005, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.25, η<sub><italic>g</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.19). This implies that the earlier in time that the scaled-time component peaked, the faster the subject would respond on that trial. This result was replicated in the decision-making task, <italic>F</italic>(2,34) = 4.18, <italic>p</italic> = .02, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.20, η<sub><italic>g</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Our results provide a general method for recovering temporally scaled signals in human M/EEG, where scaled-time components are mixed at the scalp with conventional fixed-time ERPs. We focused here on tasks that have been widely used in the timing literature, namely interval production, perception, and prediction, as well as an example of a cognitive task that exhibits variable reaction times across trials (value-based decision making). Distinct scaled-time components and scalp topographies were revealed in all four tasks. These results suggest that flexible cognition relies on temporally scaled neural activity, as seen in recent animal work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p><p id="P18">The existence of temporally scaled signals at the scalp may not be surprising to those familiar with the study of time perception. Because of its excellent temporal resolution, EEG has long been used to study delay activity in interval timing tasks. As discussed, one signal of interest has been a ramping frontal-central signal called the CNV, which we observed in our conventional ERP analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 3</xref>). Notably, CNV slope has been interpreted as an accumulation signal in pacemaker-accumulation models of timing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Our work differs from these previous studies in one important respect. In a conventional ERP analysis, delay activity is assumed to occur over fixed latencies. The CNV is thus computed by averaging over many cue-locked EEG epochs of the same duration. In contrast, we have considered the possibility that scalped-recorded potentials reflect a mixture of both fixed-time and scaled-time components. By modelling fixed-time and scaled-time components separately, we revealed scaled activity that was common across all timed intervals. This, in turn, is consistent with a recent class of models of timing that propose time estimation reflects the variable speed over which an underlying dynamical system unfolds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p><p id="P19">We also observed temporally scaled activity in a decision-making task, a somewhat surprising result given that the task did not have an explicit timing component (participants made simple binary decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]). Nevertheless, time is the medium within which decisions are made [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Computationally, the timing of binary decisions can be captured in a drift diffusion model as the accumulation of evidence in favour of each alternative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. This accumulation is thought to be indexed by an ERP component called the central parietal positivity (CPP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. There is evidence that the slope of the CPP – which can be either stimulus-locked or response-locked – captures the rate of evidence accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. For faster/easier decisions the CPP climbs more rapidly compared to slower/harder decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Perhaps these effects can also be explained by stretching/compressing a common scaled-time component while holding stimulus- and response-related activity constant. Furthermore, variation in the scaled-time component is relevant to decision making according to our results: it predicts <italic>when</italic> a decision will be made. However, we also note that the topography observed in our scaled-time component was a negative-going potential rather than positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3d</xref>). This can potentially be explained by the standard CPP-like ERP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] being a mixture of our observed negative scaled-time topography with the positive fixed-time topographies.</p><p id="P20">Although our approach makes no assumptions about the overall shape of the scaled-time component, it does assume a consistent, linear scaling across intervals. This is an assumption that could be relaxed in a more complex model, e.g., using spline regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. We also note that although we made no a priori predictions about waveform shape, some between-task similarities and differences were noted in the resulting scaled-time components. For example, similar responses were seen in the tasks for which the interval of interest ended with a motor response (temporal production and decision making – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a,d</xref>). In both cases, activity immediately preceding the response depended on a ramping, fixed-time, motor-related component, with little contribution from a scaled component. A similar observation was made in the temporal prediction task – activity just before the appearance of the target depended on anticipatory fixed-time activity, not scaled activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref>). In contrast, pre-probe activity in the temporal perception task showed almost no fixed-time activity, but a robust scaled-time component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b</xref>). The reason for this difference cannot be identified by the current experiments, however. First, the perception and prediction tasks involved different tasks instructions (‘listen for the probe’ versus ‘respond to the target’). Second, the probe/target distributions differed in the two tasks; the mean duration was 75% likely in the prediction task, but only 20% likely in the perception task. We therefore speculate that scaled activity may be somewhat task dependent.</p><p id="P21">Our approach is not only conceptually different from previous work that models variability in timing using a regression framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], it is also a mechanistically important finding. It indicates the brain may support flexible timing by adapting the duration of an otherwise consistent neural response. This can be understood as varying the rate of a dynamical system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] during interval estimation. Although there is evidence for such temporally scaled responses in the monkey neurophysiology literature (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], which inspired the current study), we are not aware of any direct evidence in support of this idea in humans. Indeed, it goes against the dominant framework of fixed-duration responses that has thus far dominated M/EEG analysis.</p><p id="P22">Although we have focused here on interval timing and decision-making tasks, we anticipate other temporally-scaled EEG and MEG signals will be discovered for cognitive processes known to unfold over varying timescales. For example, the neural basis of flexible (fast/slow) speech production and perception is an active area of research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>], and may involve a form of temporal scaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Flexible timing is also important across a vast array of decision-making tasks, where evidence accumulation can proceed quickly or slowly depending on the strength of the evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Flexible timing helps facilitate a range of adaptive behaviours via temporal attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], while disordered timing characterizes several clinical disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>], underscoring the importance of characterising temporal scaling of neural responses in human participants.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S4"><title>Simulations</title><p id="P23">We simulated cue-related and response-related EEG in a temporal production task using MATLAB 2020a (Mathworks, Natick, USA). Cue and response were separated by either a short, medium, or long interval. During the delay period, we simulated a scaled response that stretched or compressed to fill the interval. All three responses (cue, response, scaled) were summed together at appropriate lags (short, medium, or long), with noise – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>.

In our case, <italic>X</italic> was populated by ‘stick functions’ – non-zero values around the time of the modelled events, and zeros otherwise. We included in <italic>X</italic> two fixed-time components, the cue and the response, as stick functions of fixed EEG duration (with variables set to 1). In other words, the height of the fixed-time stick function was constant across events of the same type and equal to its width. To model a temporally-scaled response, we used the MATLAB <italic>imresize</italic> function (Image Processing Toolbox, R2020b) with ‘box’ interpolation to stretch/compress a stick function so that it spanned the duration between cue and response (other interpolation methods were tried – see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 1</xref> – but this choice had little effect on the results). Thus, the duration of the scaled stick function varied from trial to trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>). The goal here was to estimate a single scaled-time response to account for EEG activity across multiple varying delay periods. For the fixed-time responses, each column of X represents a latency in ms before/after an experimental event; by contrast, for the scaled-time responses, each column of X represents the <italic>percentage</italic> of time that has elapsed between <italic>two</italic> events (stimulus and response).

The goal of the production task was to produce a target interval and the goal of the perception task was to judge whether or not a computer-produced interval was correct.</p><p id="P28">The experiment was blocked with ten trials per block. There were 18 production blocks and 18 perception blocks, completed in random order. Prior to each block, participants listened to five isochronic tones indicating the target interval. Beeps were 400 Hz sine waves of duration 50 ms and an onset/offset ramping to a point 1/8 of the length of the wave (to avoid abrupt transitions). The target interval was either short (0.8 s), medium (1.65 s), or long (2.5 s).</p><p id="P29">In production trials, participants listened to a beep then waited the target time before responding. Feedback appeared after a 400-600 ms delay (uniform distribution) and remained on the display for 1000 ms. Feedback was a ‘quarter-to’ clockface to indicate ‘too early’, a ‘quarter-after’ clockface to indicate ‘too late’, or a checkmark to indicate an on-time response. Feedback itself was determined by where the participant’s response fell relative to a window around the target duration. The response window was initialized to +/- 100 ms around each target, then changed following each feedback via a staircase procedure: increased on each side by 10 ms following a correct response and decreased by 10 ms following an incorrect response (either too early or too late).</p><p id="P30">In perception trials, participants heard two beeps, then were asked to judge the correctness of the interval, that is, whether or not the test interval matched the target interval. Test intervals (very early, early, on time, late, very late) were set such that each subsequent interval was 25% longer than the previous (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

The delay between cue and target was either short (700 ms) or long (1300 ms) and, in some conditions, congruent with a preceding stimulus stream. Only congruent trials were included in the current analysis (i.e., the ‘valid’ trials in the ‘rhythmic’ and ‘repeated’ conditions). Each trial was preceded by a 500 ms fixation cross subtending 0.6° of visual angle. During the pre-cue period, participants were shown a flashing stimulus for 4-6 repetitions to indicate the target interval. The stimulus was a centrally presented black disc (1.2°) that appeared on the display for 100 ms. In the rhythmic condition the black disc appeared every 700 ms or 1300 ms (‘short’ or ‘long’). In the repeated condition, a red disc appeared either 700 ms or 1300 ms after the appearance of the black disc, followed by a variable delay period of either 1500-1900 ms (short) or 1900-2700 ms (long). Following the pre-cue period participants were then shown the warning cue, a white disc (1.2°) that appeared for 100 ms. After either a short or long delay (700 ms or 1300 ms) the target appeared – a green 1.2° disc – for 100 ms, followed by the participant’s response.

The EEG was then re-referenced to the average of the left and right mastoids (and AFz recovered in the production/perception tasks). Ocular artifacts were removed using independent component analysis (ICA). The ICA was trained on 3-second epochs of data following the appearance of the fixation cross at the beginning of each trial.

Cue-locked ERPs extended from 200 ms pre-cue to either 800, 1650, or 2500 ms post-cue (the short, medium, and long targets) in the perception/production tasks, 700 or 1300 ms in the prediction task (the short and long targets), and 600 ms in the decision-making task. Epochs were baseline-corrected using a 200 ms pre-cue window. We also constructed epochs from 800, 1650, or 2500 ms prior to the response/probe in the production/perception tasks, 700 or 1300 ms prior to the target in the prediction task, and 600 prior to the decision in the decision-making task to 200 ms after the response/probe/target/decision. A baseline was defined around the event of interest (mean EEG from -20 to 20 ms) and removed in all cases except for the decision-making task, in line with the original analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. We then removed any trials in which the sample-to-sample voltage differed by more than 50 μV or the voltage change across the entire epoch exceeded 150 μV. We then created conditional cue and response/probe/target/decision averages for each participant and task: production/perception (short, medium, and long), prediction (short and long), and decision-making (early and late, via a median split [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]). Finally, participant averages in the timing tasks were combined into grand-average waveforms at electrode FCz, a location where timing-related activity has been previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] and Pz in the decision-making task, in line with the previously published analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>rERPs</title><p id="P40">To unmix fixed-time and scaled-time components in our EEG data, we estimated regression-ERPs (rERPs) following the same GLM procedure we used with our simulated data, but now applied to each sensor. We used a design matrix consisting of a regular stick functions for cue and response/probe/target and a stretched/compressed stick function spanning the interval from cue to response/probe/target/decision. In particular, we estimated cue-locked responses that spanned from 200 ms pre-cue to 800 ms post-cue. The response/probe/target/decision response interval spanned from -800 to 200 ms. Each fixed-time response thus spanned 1000 ms, or 200 EEG sample points. The scaled-time component, as described earlier, was modelled as a single underlying component (set width in <italic>X</italic>) that spanned over multiple EEG durations (varying number of rows in <italic>X</italic>). Thus, our method required choosing how many scaled-time sample points to estimate (the width in <italic>X</italic>). For the production/perception tasks, we chose to estimate 330 scaled-time points, equivalent to the duration of the ‘medium’ interval. For the prediction task, we chose to estimate 200 scaled-time points, equivalent to the mean of the short and long conditions (700 ms, 1300 ms). For the decision-making task, we estimated 153 scaled-time points (roughly equivalent to the mean decision time). Unlike the conventional ERP approach, this analysis was conducted on the continuous EEG. To identify artifacts in the continuous EEG, we used the <italic>basicrap</italic> function from the ERPLAB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>] toolbox with a 150 μV threshold (2000 ms window, 1000 ms step size). A sample was flagged if it was ‘bad’ for any channel. Flagged samples were excluded from the GLM (samples removed from the EEG and rows removed from the design matrix). Additionally, we removed samples/rows associated with unusually fast or slow responses in the production task (less than 0.2 s or more than 5 s). On average, we removed 10.16 % of samples in the production task (95% CI [8.90, 11.42]), 3.75 % of samples in the perception task (95% CI [2.39, 5.10]), 5.57% of samples in the prediction task (95% CI [4.94, 6.20]), and 5.56% of samples in the decision-making task (95% CI [4.99, 6.12]).</p><p id="P41">To test for multicollinearity between the regressors we computed the variance inflation factor (VIF) for each regressor, i.e., at each timepoint in the estimated waveforms. This was done using the <italic>uf_vif</italic> function in the Unfold toolbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. We were concerned about multicollinearity because the fixed-time and scaled-time components occurred over the same ‘real time’ durations. For example, in the production task the early and later parts of the scaled waveform always coincided with the start of the cue-locked and end of the response-locked responses, respectively. The overlap was not consistent, however; alignment between the fixed and scaled regressors was lessened due to distortions in the scaled stick function (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 1</xref>). As a result, the VIF was low (&lt; 10) at nearly all points other than the start/end (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 9</xref>). This was true in all tasks except for the temporal prediction task (VIFs &gt; 10), as these tasks incorporated greater temporal variability across trials. We therefore expected the waveform estimates in the temporal prediction task to be noisier relative to the other tasks. We note that future studies could use VIF to evaluate the likelihood of successfully unmixing fixed-time and scaled-time components. Introducing elements of experimental design (such as increased interval variability across trials) could help to address concerns over multicollinearity.</p><p id="P42">To lessen the effect of multicollinearity and impose a smoothness constraint on our estimates, we used a first-derivative form of Tikhonov regularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>].

Lower alpha values were used for the production and perception tasks to better isolate the effect; using an alpha value of .05 yielded longer windows of significance but did not change our results. Clusters were identified both spatially and temporally. For each electrode, we defined a cluster by identifying neighbouring electrodes according to a template available in the FieldTrip toolbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. For each spatial cluster, we then identified temporal clusters for which the <italic>t</italic>-values of all the included electrodes exceeded the critical value. Within this common window we computed the ‘cluster mass’, defined as the spatial mean of the sum of the absolute values of the <italic>t</italic>-values within the temporal cluster. To determine whether the observed cluster masses exceeded what could occur by chance, we permuted the scaled components by randomly flipping (multiplying by -1) the entire waveform. We then computed and recorded the cluster masses for 1000 permuted waveforms. If more than one temporal cluster was found within a spatial cluster, only the maximum cluster mass was recorded. A value of zero was recorded if there were no clusters. We then labelled our observed cluster masses as ‘significant’ if they exceeded 95% of the maximum cluster masses of the permuted waveforms. Finally, we examined and reported the cluster extents and <italic>p</italic>-values for the clusters of maximum cluster mass: (P3, CP5, CP1) in the production task, (F3, Fz, FCz, C3, Cz) in the perception task, (FC1, FCz, FC2, C1, C2, CP1, CPz, CP2) in the prediction task, and (Cz, FC1, FCz, FC2, C1, C2, CP1, CPz, CP2) in the decision-making task.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Scaling Index</title><p id="P48">To validate the unmixing procedure, we regressed out either the scaled-time component or the fixed-time components from the EEG in each task and participant to create ‘fixed-only’ or ‘scaled-only’ data sets. We then quantified the amount of temporal scaling present in each task, participant, and data set (original, fixed-only, scaled only) using a similar procedure as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Specifically, we constructed epochs spanning the intervals of interest (e.g., cue to response), then stretched or compressed each epoch to match a common duration (the longest duration in the interval timing tasks; the mean of the ‘late’ responses in the decision-making task, as defined above). For each task and participant, we averaged by condition (e.g., short, medium, long) to create conditional ERPs with a common duration, then computed a scaling index defined as the coefficient of determination. Specifically, we asked how well the ‘long’ waveform could be predicted by the ‘short’ waveform. If there was also a ‘medium’ waveform (the production/perception tasks) another coefficient of determination was computed, and the two coefficients were averaged. A larger scaling index can therefore be interpreted as a greater post-scaling similarity between conditions. Scaling indices in the fixed-only and scaled-only data sets were compared via paired-samples <italic>t</italic>-tests.

Epochs within each condition (short, medium, long) were further grouped into three equal-sized response-time bins (early, on time, late) and averaged for each electrode and participant.

The PC2 score ranges were -21 to 15 (short), -41 to 38 (medium), and -40 to 55 (long). To assess the relationship between PC2 score and behaviour, we binned PC2 scores according to our response time bins (early, on time, late) and collapsed across conditions (short, medium, long). This gave us as single mean PC2 score for each participant and response time bin (early, on time, late), which we analyzed using a two-sided repeated-measures ANOVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5d</xref>) after verifying the assumption of normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Two different effect sizes, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> and η<sub><italic>g</italic></sub><sup>2</sup>, were computed, according to: <disp-formula id="FD6"><label>6</label><mml:math id="M6"><mml:mtable columnalign="left"><mml:mtr columnalign="left"><mml:mtd columnalign="left"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mtd><mml:mtd columnalign="left"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P51">where <italic>SS</italic><sub>Q</sub> is the sum of squares of the quantile effect (early, on time, late), <italic>SS<sub>sQ</sub></italic> is the error sum of squares of the quantile effect, and <italic>SS<sub>S</sub></italic> is the sum of squares between subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>].</p><p id="P52">We then replicated the PCA procedure for the decision-making task using an epoch extending 800 ms from the cue at a central electrode cluster (FC3, FC1, FC2, FC4, C3, C1, Cz, C2, C4, CP3, CP1, CP2, CP4, P3, P1, Pz, P2, and P4). Note that the assumption of normality was violated for ‘early’ responses in the decision-making task. However, as repeated-measures ANOVA is robust to violations of normality, no statistical correction was made.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS153341-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d38aAdDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was funded by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC: https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/) Postdoctoral Fellowship to C.D.H.

Statement</title></caption><p>Neural activity is traditionally thought to occur over fixed time scales. However, recent animal work has suggested that some neural responses occur over varying timescales. We extended this animal result to humans by detecting temporally scaled signals non-invasively at the scalp in four different tasks. Our results suggest that temporal scaling is an important feature of cognitive processes known to unfold over varying timescales.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Regression based unmixing of simulated data successfully recovers scaled-time and fixed-time components</title><p>(a) EEG data were simulated by summing fixed-time components (cue and response), a scaled-time component with differing durations for different trials (short, medium, or long), and noise. (b) The simulated responses were unmixed via a GLM with stick basis functions: cue-locked, response-locked, and a single scaled-time basis spanning from cue to response (i.e., variable duration). (c) The GLM successfully recovered all three components, including the scaled-time component. (d) A conventional ERP analysis (cue-locked and response-locked averages) of the same data obscured the scaled-time component.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS153341-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Datasets from three time-estimation and one decision-making paradigm were analyzed</title><p>In the temporal production task (a) participants successfully produced one of three cued intervals.

To visualize the unmixing of scaled-time and fixed-time components, the residual (noise) was recombined with either the scaled-time component (b) or the fixed-time components (c). PCA was run on the ‘scaled-time plus residual’ EEG. The second principal component resembled the temporal derivative or ‘rate’ of the scaled component (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 5</xref>). (d) PC2 scores depended on response time, implying the scaled-time component peaked earlier for fast responses and later for slow responses. (e) The effect replicated in a decision-making task.
