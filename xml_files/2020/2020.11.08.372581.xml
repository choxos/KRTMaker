<title>Rationale</title>
<p id="P3">The secondary thrombotic/vascular clinical syndrome of COVID-19 suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infects not only respiratory epithelium but also the endothelium activating thrombotic pathways, disrupting barrier function and allowing access of the virus to other organs of the body. However, a direct test of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 of authentic endothelial cell lines has not been performed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Objective</title>
<p id="P4">To determine infectibility of primary endothelial cell lines with live SARS-CoV-2 and pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Methods and Results</title>
<p id="P5">Expression of ACE2 and BSG pathways genes was determined in three types of endothelial cells; blood outgrowth, lung microvascular and aortic endothelial cells. For comparison nasal epithelial cells, Vero E6 cells (primate kidney fibroblast cell line) and HEK 293T cells (human embryonic kidney cells) transfected with either ACE2 or BSG were used as controls. Endothelial and Vero E6 cells were treated with live SARS-CoV-2 virus for 1 hour and imaged at 24 and 72 hours post infection. Pseudoviruses containing SARS-CoV-2, Ebola and Vesicular Stomatis Virus glycoproteins were generated and added to endothelial cells and HEK 239Ts for 2 hours and infection measured using luminescence at 48 hours post infection. Compared to nasal epithelial cells, endothelial cells expressed low or undetectable levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 but comparable levels of BSG, PPIA and PPIB. Endothelial cells showed no susceptibility to live SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (but showed susceptibility to Ebola and Vesicular Stomatitis Virus). Overexpression of ACE2 but not BSG in HEK 239T cells conferred SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry. Endothelial cells primed with IL-1ß remained resistant to SARS-CoV-2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p id="P6">Endothelial cells are resistant to infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus, in line with relatively low levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, suggesting that the vascular dysfunction and thrombosis seen in severe COVID-19 is a result of factors released by adjacent infected cells (e.g. epithelial cells) and/or circulating, systemic inflammatory mediators.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P7">COVID-19 represents one of the most important clinical challenges the scientific community has faced in recent memory. In the absence of an effective vaccine and no clear evidence that prior infection confers long-term immunity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>, there is an urgent unmet need to understand disease pathology and to establish therapeutics that mitigate COVID-19 severity and reduce associated lethality<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to host cells via ACE2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup> and viral entry is facilitated by the cell-surface protease TMPRSS2<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup> or lysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B/L (CTSB, CTSL)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
</sup>. It has also been suggested that, as an alternative pathway, SARS-CoV-2 binds to cells via BSG (Basigin; also known as CD147 or EMMPRIN)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
</sup>, although firm evidence for BSG as a standalone receptor for SARS-CoV-2 remains the subject of investigation with a recent study noting no ‘direct’ binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to BSG<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P8">Initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurs via the respiratory epithelium<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. In most people symptoms are mild but in a significant minority COVID-19 progresses to severe disease and in those that ‘recover’ symptoms can persist leading to a syndrome recently defined as ‘long-COVID’<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. In severe COVID-19 and in long-COVID multiple organs including the cardiovascular system are affected<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. This secondary thrombotic/vascular clinical syndrome of COVID-19 suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infects not only respiratory epithelium but also the endothelium disrupting barrier function and allowing dissemination to other organs of the body<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
</sup>. This notion is supported by early reports showing that SARS-CoV-2 infects endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup> and <italic>in vivo<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>
</italic>. However, for the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies performed to date, non-physiological cell lines were used and for <italic>in vivo</italic> studies serious concerns have been raised regarding the validity of the interpretation of data and the resulting conclusions<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. Currently, therefore, it is not clear if endothelial cells are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 or not. Only by addressing this can biomarkers, mechanisms and therapeutic targets directed at the vasculopathy and thrombosis associated with COVID-19 be established.</p>
<p id="P9">We have recently shown that blood outgrowth endothelial cells express relatively low levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 but high levels of BSG and speculated that if endothelial cells are infected by SARS-CoV-2, BSG, rather than ACE2, would act as the receptor for viral entry<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. However, in our previous work and that of others, a direct test of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 of authentic endothelial cell lines has not been performed.</p>
<p id="P10">Here we have performed the first infection study using primary endothelial cell lines with live SARS-CoV-2 and pseudoviruses (PV) expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Specifically, we used (i) blood outgrowth endothelial cells, selected for their utility as biomarkers and in personalised medicine, (ii) lung microvascular endothelial cells, selected based on likely points of access of the virus and (ii) aortic endothelial cells, selected as representative of systemic vessels. For comparison we used positive control cells including nasal epithelial cells, Vero E6 cells (primate kidney fibroblast cell line) and HEK 293T cells (human embryonic kidney cells) transfected with either ACE2 or BSG.</p>

Aortic and blood outgrowth endothelial cells were maintained on uncoated plates in Endothelial Cell Growth Medium-2 (EGM-2; Lonza, UK), while lung microvascular cells were maintained on uncoated plates in Microvascular Endothelial Cell Growth Medium-2 (EGM-2 MV; Lonza, UK). Nasal epithelial cells were maintained in Airway Epithelial Growth Media (Promocell, Germany) while MucilAir™ nasal epithelial cells were maintained in MucilAir Culture Medium (Epithelix, Switzerland). All media for endothelial and epithelial cells were supplemented with their appropriate BulletKits, 10% FBS (Biosera, UK) and 1% P/S (Gibco, UK). Treatment protocols (except for those using MucilAir™ cells) were conducted using ‘treatment media’ (EGM-2 medium (Promocell, Germany) supplemented with 2% FBS (Promocell, Germany) and 1% P/S (Gibco, UK). For all experiments, endothelial and nasal epithelial cells were used between passage 4-6. All cells were maintained at 37°C, 5% CO2.</p>

Inoculum was then removed and cells maintained as described above. At each timepoint in the infection, virus was collected from the apical surface of the cultures by washing with pre-warmed PBS for 10 minutes at 37°C and quantified by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS then serial dilutions of inoculum, diluted in serum-free DMEM, 1% NEAA, 1% P/S, were overlayed onto cells for one hour at 37°C. Inoculum was then removed and replaced with SARS-CoV-2 overlay media (1x minimal essential media (MEM), 0.2% w/v bovine serum albumin, 0.16% w/v NaHCO3, 10mM Hepes, 2mM L-Glutamine, 1x P/S, 0.6% w/v agarose).

Primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer and incubated on cells at room temperature for 1 hour. Primary antibodies used were against spike protein (S) (Mouse monoclonal, Gene tex (1A9)) or nucleoprotein (N) (Rabbit monoclonal, Sino Biological). Following 3x PBS washes, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit 488, anti-mouse 594) diluted 1:500 and DAPI (diluted 1 in 1000) in PBS with 2% BSA at room temperature for 1 hour in the dark.

<title>Results</title>
<p id="P23">In our recent study, where we performed a systematic analysis of online transcriptomic databases in endothelial cells and nasal and bronchial epithelium, we found endothelial cells express relatively low levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 but high levels of BSG and PPIA/PPIB (also known as cyclophilin A/B; CypA/B)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
</sup>. PPIA and PPIB are potential co-ligands for pathogen entry to cells via the BSG pathway. Here we have validated and extended our earlier studies by measuring gene expression using qPCR in blood outgrowth endothelial cells, lung microvascular endothelial cells, aortic endothelial cells and, for comparisons, nasal epithelium. In line with our previous observations, compared to nasal epithelial cells, endothelial cells expressed low or undetectable levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 but comparable levels of BSG, PPIA and PPIB, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). These observations suggest that if endothelial cells are suspectable to infection with SARS-CoV-2 it may be occur in an ACE2-independent pathway, for example via the putative BSG receptor pathway.</p>
<p id="P24">Next, using experimental conditions where nasal epithelial cells grown in liquid: air interface culture were highly susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), we inoculated endothelial cells and, in parallel, Vero E6 cells, with live SARS-CoV-2. Initially we performed pilot studies using blood outgrowth endothelial cells and Vero E6 cells incubated for 24 hours after a 1 hour inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). These were followed by separate experiments using each of the 3 endothelial cell types incubated for up to 72 hours post inoculation with live SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). In both studies by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (IF) we could see cells staining positive for viral antigens (nucleocapsid protein or spike) in Vero E6 cells, indicating virus replication, but not in the endothelial cell types at any of the time points tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). These results suggest that endothelial cells have a block to SARS-CoV-2 infection, however it is not clear whether this block is at virus entry or upon a post-entry step in replication.</p>
<p id="P25">To investigate whether the block to virus infection was at entry we performed studies using pseudoviruses based on lentiviral vectors, expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and, by way of positive controls for viral infectability, pseudovirus expressing the glycoproteins of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV-G), which shows broad cell-type tropism and Ebola, which has previously been shown to efficiently infect endothelial cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. As with the virus infection, endothelial cells were not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated entry, showing similar levels of luciferase signal as bald pseudovirus expressing no viral glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), but were found to be susceptible to pseudovirus expressing Ebola glycoprotein and VSV-G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">D</xref>). Furthermore, HEK 293T cells stably expressing ACE2 showed high susceptibility to all 3 pseudoviruses. These observations are in line with low level ACE2 expression across our endothelial cell lines and suggest that the high levels of BSG expression do not compensate to allow infection with SARS-CoV-2. To address this assumption, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry into HEK 293T cells transiently transfected with either ACE2 or BSG (successful transfection was confirmed using western blot analysis; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). From this data it was clear that transfected ACE2 but not BSG efficiently mediated SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
<p id="P26">Finally, to investigate how an inflammatory environment might facilitate virial entry of SARS-CoV-2 into endothelial cells additional protocols were performed where cells were primed with IL-1ß. At 24 hours IL-1ß primed endothelial cells released increased levels of IL-6 and IL-8, demonstrating a positive inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). However, under these conditions each of the endothelial cell types remained resistant to SARS-CoV-2 spike mediated entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P27">There is mounting speculation that the vascular and thrombotic sequela associated with severe COVID-19 is a result of endothelial cell infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, there is currently no direct evidence to support this idea. In response to this, we have used standard virology protocols to directly address the question of <italic>‘are endothelial cells permissive to infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus?</italic>’ We have used 3 carefully selected primary endothelial cells lines from 3 separate donors for each line. The results were unambiguous and interpreted alongside data from robust positive control cells infect with live virus and pseudoviruses. Taken together our data suggest that endothelial cells are not susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 because they express insufficient levels of ACE2. Our findings that endothelial cells remain non-susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 despite expressing high levels of BSG suggests that the BSG pathway is not a functional entry pathway for SARS-CoV-2 in endothelial cells. This idea is confirmed from our studies using HEK 293T cells transiently transfected with BSG which, in contrast to ACE2, did not make cells susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated entry.</p>
<p id="P28">Our results showing that endothelial cells are not susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 virus suggests that the vascular dysfunction and thrombosis seen in severe COVID-19 is a result of factors released by adjacent infected cells (e.g. epithelial cells) and/or circulating, systemic inflammatory mediators. In addition, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 virus may act as an inflammatory stimulus either via the spike protein or other structural components without the requirement for conventional binding, cell entry or virus replication<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. Our study does not rule out this possibility and this remains the subject of further investigation. Our work also suggests that where viremia occurs in COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 passes through the endothelium facilitated by loss of barrier function, as a result of local inflammation at the site of infection.</p>
<p id="P29">While we have worked to the highest standards with empirical virology protocols, there are limitations in our approach, and we cannot definitively conclude that endothelial cells are non-susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 in some individuals or in some highly specific conditions <italic>in vivo.</italic> This is because the assay systems we used did not take account of critical factors present in at risk populations and/or at the site of inflammation. In an attempt to take account of basic inflammatory conditions we performed experiments in cells primed with IL-1ß, which did not confer infectability to any of our endothelial lines. However, as we find more about the complex mix of inflammatory mediators present in the lung and circulation in COVID-19 and the specific biological factors that predispose certain groups of individuals to severe disease, these can be recapitulated within <italic>in vitro</italic> assay systems. Nonetheless what our study does prove is that if endothelial cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 at some distant point in the natural history of COVID-19, the pathways of viral entry are more complex than for airway epithelium.</p>

<title>mRNA expression of <italic>ACE2</italic>, <italic>TMPRSS2</italic>, <italic>BSG</italic>, <italic>PPIA</italic> and <italic>PPIB</italic> in human nasal epithelial cells (NEC) and endothelial cells (aortic, microvascular and blood outgrowth).</title>
<p>Expression levels for the genes <italic>ACE2</italic>, <italic>TMPRSS2</italic>, <italic>BSG</italic>, <italic>PPIA</italic> and <italic>PPIB</italic> were obtained from aortic (AoEC), microvascular (HMVEC) and blood outgrowth (BOEC) endothelial cells and nasal epithelial cells (NEC). Data for each donor were normalised using the average of the housekeepers (18S and Gapdh) and analysed using a comparative Ct method (2ΔΔCt). Data are shown as the mean +/- SEM fold change compared to nasal epithelium (n=3 wells using cells from 2 donors) for AoEC (n=3 wells using cells of 3 separate donors), HMVEC ((n=3 wells using cells of 3 separate donors and BOECs (n=2 wells using cells of 2 separate donors).</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 live virus infection in human airway epithelial cells in air:liquid interface, Vero E6 and endothelial cells.</title>
<p>Human airway epithelial cells grown in an air:liquid interface environment from MucilAir™ were infected with SARS-CoV-2 live virus (MOI 0.1) and the plaque forming units (measure of infectious virus obtained from permissive cells) was determined over time (6, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-infection). In separate studies, the levels of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid or spike protein in Vero E6 and endothelial cells (treated with media only (untreated) or IL-1ß (10ng/ml; 3hrs)) at 24 (B) and 72 (C) hours post infection with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.1) were determined using florescent imaging. Mock controls (media only) experiments were run simultaneously using each endothelial cell line. Data is shown as n=3 (pooled donors) for Mucilair cells (A) and n=3 (separate donors) for human aortic (AoEC), lung microvascular (HMVEC) and blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOEC). Data are shown are mean +/- SEM for panel A and representative images shown for panel A and representative images for panels B and C.</p>

<p>SARS-CoV-2 (A) and VSV-G and Ebola (B) pseudovirus levels were measured using a Luciferase Assay System 48 hours post-transduction. Data were from n=12 wells using cells from 3 donors separate donors in experiments performed on 2 separate occasions for aortic (AoEC), microvascular (HMVEC) and blood outgrowth (BOEC) (A-C); ACE2-HEK-2932T and BSG-HEK-2932T are n=3.
