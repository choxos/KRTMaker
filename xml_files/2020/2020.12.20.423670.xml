<title>Background</title>
<p id="P1">Immune system conditions of the patient is a key factor in COVID-19 infection survival. A growing number of studies have focused on immunological determinants to develop better biomarkers for therapies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Aim</title>
<p id="P2">The dynamics of the insurgence of immunity is at the core of the both SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and therapies. This paper addresses a fundamental question in the management of the infection: can we describe the insurgence (and the span) of immunity in COVID-19? The in-silico model developed here answers this question at individual (personalized) and population levels.</p>
<p id="P3">We simulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and analyze the impact of infecting viral load, affinity to the ACE2 receptor and age in the artificially infected population on the course of the disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Methods</title>
<p id="P4">We use a stochastic agent-based immune simulation platform to construct a virtual cohort of infected individuals with age-dependent varying degree of immune competence. We use a parameter setting to reproduce known inter-patient variability and general epidemiological statistics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Results</title>
<p id="P5">We reproduce <italic>in-silico</italic> a number of clinical observations and we identify critical factors in the statistical evolution of the infection. In particular we evidence the importance of the humoral response over the cytotoxic response and find that the antibody titers measured after day 25 from the infection is a prognostic factor for determining the clinical outcome of the infection.</p>
<p id="P6">Our modeling framework uses COVID-19 infection to demonstrate the actionable effectiveness of simulating the immune response at individual and population levels. The model developed is able to explain and interpret observed patterns of infection and makes verifiable temporal predictions.</p>
<p id="P7">Within the limitations imposed by the simulated environment, this work proposes in a quantitative way that the great variability observed in the patient outcomes in real life can be the mere result of subtle variability in the infecting viral load and immune competence in the population.</p>
<p id="P8">In this work we i) show the power of model predictions, ii) identify the clinical end points that could be more suitable for computational modeling of COVID-19 immune response, iii) define the resolution and amount of data required to empower this class of models for translational medicine purposes and, iv) we exemplify how computational modeling of immune response provides an important view to discuss hypothesis and design new experiments, in particular paving the way to further investigations about the duration of vaccine-elicited immunity especially in the view of the blundering effect of immunesenescence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P9">The global pandemic set up by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the early months of the year 2020 has reached considerable proportions and, to date, does not show signs of slowdown when considered globally. In fact, as of 9:45am CET, 19 December 2020, there have been 73,996,237 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1,663,474 deaths, reported to WHO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covid19.who.int">https://covid19.who.int</ext-link>).</p>
<p id="P10">The mortality rates, of the SARS-CoV-2 greatly differ across the globe, ranging from 0.5 to 13% (Johns Hopkins University, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality">https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality</ext-link>), as a result of many factors including the ability to react to the pandemic by the various national health systems.</p>
<p id="P11">The COVID-19 disease has a quite variable clinical presentation: while the majority of individuals present with a very mild disease, often asymptomatic, a few patients develop a life-threatening disease requiring intensive care. The strongest determinant of disease severity is age, with children presenting almost exclusively with mild disease, while individuals over 70 years of age are much more likely to develop severe COVID-19 (Reference?). This variation is likely due to both host and pathogen factors. Host factors may include differences in the immune response due to genetic determinants and immunological history. On the other hand, pathogen factors include transmission, entry and spread within the host, cell tropism, virus virulence and consequent disease mechanisms.</p>
<p id="P12">To better understand what impact these factors may have in the differences observed in the host response to SARS-CoV-2, we set up the analysis of the dynamics generated by a computer model that considers both, the magnitude of the viral harm, and the subsequent innate and adaptive response set up to attempt achieving control of the infection. Thus we used computer simulations to create a virtual cohort of infected individuals to study the effects on the pathogenesis of both host and pathogen factors. Note that this approach goes beyond the machine learning paradigm as the knowledge is generated through a set of equations/algorithms confirmed by the scientific literature and by past models. The simulation allows systems-level, multi evidence analyses to simultaneously capture the dynamics of the major immune cell populations and the many protein mediators by which cells communicate, in order to sort out the determinants of disease severity.</p>

<title>Simulating SARS-CoV-2 course of events in the host</title>
<p id="P13">The simulation model that we used in this study, C-IMMSIM, is a derivation of an established software system for the simulation of the immune response to generic pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. It is equipped with a fundamental innate immune response consisting in macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer cells, and represents the adaptive immunity by B lymphocytes, plasma B antibody-producing lymphocytes, CD4 T helper and CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes. It is a polyclonal model as it embodies the primary sequences of binding sites of B-cell receptors (BCRs) and T-cell receptors (TCR), as well as the peptides and epitopes of the infectious agent (i.e., the SARS-CoV-2 in this case).</p>
<p id="P14">It represents a portion of, i) primary lymphatic organs where lymphocytes are formed and mature (i.e., mainly the red bone marrow and the thymus gland), ii) secondary lymphoid organs (e.g., a lymph node), which filters lymph, and where naïve B and T-cells are presented to antigens, and, iii) peripheral tissue which is dependent on the pathogen considered (in this case the lung).</p>
<p id="P15">While primary organs are just the source of lymphocytes equipped with a randomly generated receptor (actually only its complementarity-determining region, CDR), the secondary organs and the tissue are mapped onto a three-dimensional Cartesian lattice. The thymus is implicitly represented by the positive and negative selection of immature thymocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] before they enter the lymphatic system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], while the bone marrow generates already immunocompetent B lymphocytes.</p>
<p id="P16">C-IMMSIM incorporates several working assumptions or immunological theories, most of which are regarded as established mechanisms, including the clonal selection theory of Burnet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], the clonal deletion theory (e.g., thymus education of T lymphocytes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], the hypermutation of antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], the replicative senescence of T-cells, or the Hayflick limit (i.e., a limit in the number of cell divisions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], T-cell anergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] and Ag-dose induced tolerance in B-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], the danger theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], the (generally unused) idiotypic network theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p>
<p id="P17">Being more a general-purpose modeling platform rather than just a model, C-IMMSIM lend itself to characterise the role of the immune response in different human pathologies such as viral infections (e.g., HIV or EBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]), cancer immuno-prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], type 1 hypersensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] and the chronic inflammation associated to type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] as well as specific aspects of the immune dynamics such as lymphocytes homing in lymph nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], the gene regulation leading to cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], clonal dominance in heterologous immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] and also vaccination-eliciting fish immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Relevant to the present study, the model has recently being used to simulate the response to a multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].</p>
<p id="P18">In C-IMMSIM each simulated time step corresponds to eight hours of real life. Cells diffuse randomly in the represented volume and interact among them. Upon specific recognition through receptor bindings, they perform actions which determine their functional behaviour. These actions are coded as probabilistic rules and define the transition of the interacting cell entities from one “condition” to another. In fact, each rule is executed only if the parts involved are in specific states (e.g., naïve, active, resting, antigen-presenting).</p>
<p id="P19">Besides cell-cell interaction and cooperation, this model simulates the intra-cellular processes of antigen uptake and presentation. Endogenous antigens are fragmented and combined with MHC class I molecules for presentation on the cell surface to CTLs’ receptors (this is the cytosolic pathway), whereas exogenous antigens are degraded into small pieces, which are then bound to MHC class II molecules for presentation to T helpers’ receptors (this is the endocytic pathway).</p>
<p id="P20">The stochastic execution of the algorithms coding for the dynamical rules, results in a sequence of cause/effect events culminating in the production of effector immune cells and setup of immunological memory. The starting point of this series of events is the injection of an antigen which, here, consists of the virus. This may take place any time after the simulation starts (the sequence of events of the SARS-CoV-2 simulation is reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix A</xref>). Initially the system is “naïve” in the sense that there are neither T and B memory cells nor plasma cells and antibodies. Moreover, the system is designed to maintain a steady state of the global population of cells (homeostasis), if no infection take place.</p>
<p id="P21">Besides the parameters defining the characteristics of the virus related to attachment, penetration, replication and assembly (i.e., its fitness), the SARS-CoV-2 virus in this model is defined as a set of B-cell epitopes and T-cell peptides consisting of amino acid 9-mers and defining its antigenicity. If the infection is stopped or becomes persistent or even kills the virtual patient it depends on the dose of the virus, its fitness, and the strength of the immune response aroused. All of these variables determine if, and to what degree, the success of the immune system requires the cooperation of both the cellular and the humoral branch, as shown in past simulation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</p>
<p id="P22">With respect to previous version of the model described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] the most important difference is that to improve the peptide-prediction performance, rather than using position-specific-score-matrices (PSSM) to weight the binding contribution of the amino-acids composing the protein segments in the bounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], we resort to pre-computed ranked lists of T-cell epitopes calculated with the original neural network NetMHCpan method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. This feature, which is described below, follows the choice of a definite HLA set.</p>

<title>Selecting the HLA haplotype</title>
<p id="P23">The C-IMMSIM model accounts for differences in the HLA haplotype when determining which peptides are presented by antigen presenting cells. To this end, it takes in input a list of such peptides for each HLA molecule considered together with a propensity of each peptide to bind to it. This list is computed by using third party immunoinformatics tools as described in the next <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">section 2.2</xref>.</p>
<p id="P24">The “HLA haplotype freq search” in the “Allele Frequency Net Database” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.allelefrequencies.net">http://www.allelefrequencies.net</ext-link>) was used in order to select two HLA-A, two HLA-B and two DRB alleles which are most prevalent in US population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. The result pointed to the following alleles: HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*24:02, HLA-B*35:01, HLA-B*40:02, DRB1*07:01 and DRB1*15:01.</p>

<title>Computing the peptide immunogenicity</title>
<p id="P25">The strain of SARS-CoV-2 used in this study corresponds to the reference sequence <italic>NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2</italic>. The primary structure of these proteins have been used to identify cytotoxic T peptides (CTL peptides) and helper T peptides (HTL peptides). To this aim we have employed two immunoinformatics tools. In particular, for the definition of CTL epitopes, the “ANN 4.0 prediction method” in the online tool MHC-I binding prediction (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tools.iedb.org/analyze/html/mhc_binding.html">http://tools.iedb.org/analyze/html/mhc_binding.html</ext-link>) of the <italic>IEDB Analysis Resource</italic> was used for the prediction of 9-mer long CTL peptides which had an affinity for the chosen set of HLA class I alleles (i.e., HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*24:02, HLA-B*35:01 and HLA-B*40:02) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. The peptides were classified as strong, moderate and weak binders based on the peptide percentile rank and IC50 value. Peptides with IC50 values &lt;50 nM were considered to have high affinity, &lt;500 nM intermediate affinity and &lt;5000 nM low affinity towards a particular HLA allele. Also, lower the percentile rank, greater is meant the affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. The list of peptides is reported in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix B</xref>.</p>
<p id="P26">For what concerns the HTL peptides, the NetMHCIIpan 3.2 server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCIIpan">www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCIIpan</ext-link>) was used for the prediction of 9-mer long HTL peptides which had an affinity for the HLA class II alleles (i.e., DRB1*07:01 and DRB1*15:01) used in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. The predicted peptides were classified as strong, intermediate and non-binders based on the concept of percentile rank as given by NetMHCII pan 3.2 server with a threshold value set at 2, 10 and &gt;10%, respectively. In other words, peptides with percentile rank ≤2 were considered as strong binders whereas a percentile rank between 2 and 10% designate moderate binders; peptides with percentile score &gt;10 are considered to be non-binders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. The list of CTL and HTL peptides and the relative affinity score is reported in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix C</xref>.</p>

<title>Quantifying the immunological competence</title>
<p id="P27">It is widely accepted that ageing is accompanied by remodelling of the immune system. With time, there is a decline in overall immune efficacy, which manifests itself as an increased vulnerability to infectious diseases, a diminished responses to antigens (including vaccines), and a susceptibility to inflammatory diseases. The most important age-associated immune alteration is the reduction in the number of peripheral blood naïve cells, accompanied by a relative increase in the frequency of memory cells. These two alterations, are extensively reported in the literature and account for the immune repertoire reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Along with the process called "inflamm-aging", the reduction of immune repertoire is considered the hallmark of immunesenescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>].</p>
<p id="P28">To model the reduction of immune efficacy we first defined the parameter “immunological competence” <italic>IC</italic>∈(0,1] and assumed it in a simple linear relationship with the age. Specifically we set <italic>IC</italic> ≡ <italic>IC</italic>(<italic>age</italic>) = −<italic>α</italic> ∙ <italic>age</italic> + 1 with the value of the parameter <italic>α</italic> = 45 ∙ 10<sup>−4</sup> determined using epidemiological data as described below. Given the age, the parameter <italic>IC</italic> is then used to modulate both innate and adaptive immunity as follows: i) the phagocytic activity of macrophages and dendritic cells, represented by a probability to capture a viral particle, is rescaled respectively as <italic>p<sub>M</sub>
</italic> = <italic>IC</italic> ∙ <italic>u</italic> and <italic>p<sub>DC</sub>
</italic> = <italic>IC</italic> ∙ <italic>v</italic>, where <italic>u~U<sub>[a.b]</sub>
</italic> and <italic>v~u</italic>
<sub>[5×<italic>a</italic>,5×<italic>b</italic>]</sub> are two random variables uniformly distributed in the ranges [<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>] and [5 ∙ <italic>a</italic>, 5 ∙ <italic>b</italic>] with <italic>a</italic> = 25 × 10<sup>-4</sup> and b = 10<sup>-2</sup>; ii) as for the adaptive immunity it is adjusted according to the immunological competence parameter <italic>IC</italic> by decreasing the lymphocyte counts (hence B, Th and Tc) to reflect a reduction in the repertoire of “naïve” cells with immunological history due to accumulation of memory cells filling the immunological compartment. In particular, the number of white blood cells <italic>N</italic> is computed as <italic>N</italic>~<italic>IC</italic> ∙ <italic>&#119977;</italic>(<italic>μ</italic>, <italic>σ</italic>
<sup>2</sup>) = <italic>&#119977;</italic>(<italic>IC</italic> ∙ <italic>μ</italic>, <italic>IC</italic>
<sup>2</sup> ∙ <italic>σ</italic>
<sup>2</sup>) where <italic>&#119977;</italic>(<italic>μ</italic>, <italic>σ</italic>
<sup>2</sup>) is a normal distribution with average <italic>μ</italic> and standard deviation <italic>σ</italic> (for each lymphocyte type B, Th and Tc) chosen to reflect the reference leukocyte formula for an average healthy human adult (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>].</p>

<title>Adapting the model to SARS-CoV-2 characteristics</title>
<p id="P29">The infection and the dynamical features of the SARS-CoV-2 viral strain has been characterised by two parameters: i) <italic>V</italic>
<sub>0</sub> corresponding to the infectious viral load at time zero, and, ii) the affinity of the virus spike protein to the ACE2 receptor on target cells, called <italic>p<sub>A</sub>
</italic>. In particular, <italic>V</italic>

<italic>~U</italic>
<sub>[<italic>c</italic>

<sub>2</sub>]</sub> in the interval [<italic>c</italic>
<sub>2</sub> = 10<sup>−3</sup>, <italic>d</italic>
<sub>2</sub> = 10<sup>−1</sup>].</p>
<p id="P30">Upon choice of the age class determining the immunocompetence value <italic>IC</italic>(<italic>age</italic>) hence <italic>p<sub>A</sub>
</italic> and <italic>p<sub>DC</sub>
</italic> as well as the lymphocyte counts, the simulations depict the immune-virus competition eventually culminating in a successful, or not, virus-clearing response controlling its growth. Sometimes this control is not perfectly efficient. In those cases the result is a longer viral persistence possibly going much beyond the length of the observation period of 30 days (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p id="P31">The sequence of events from viral infection leading to a full fledged immune response is detailed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix A</xref>. At each time step of the simulation C-IMMSIM dumps all variables allowing for a detailed analysis of the dynamics. A full output example of a simulation is reported and described in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix D</xref>.</p>

<title>Modeling a representative cohort of infected individuals</title>
<p id="P32">We have simulated a large number of infections by varying the parameters identifying both the viral characteristics and the individual immunological competences. The seven age classes considered were 0-9, 10-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79 and 80+. As already mentioned, the age class determines the immunocompetence parameter <italic>IC</italic> which, in turn, sets <italic>p<sub>M</sub>
</italic> and <italic>p<sub>DC</sub>
</italic> as well as the lymphocytes counts in the <italic>in-silico</italic> individual, we can characterize each simulation by the set of parameters (<italic>IC</italic>(<italic>age</italic>), <italic>V</italic>
<sub>0</sub>, <italic>p<sub>A</sub>
</italic>). Moreover, due to the stochasticity of the model depending on the random number realisations, each simulation corresponds to a different trajectory in the space of the variables. It follows that each simulation coincides with an <italic>in-silico</italic> patient with variable immunological characteristics (<italic>IC</italic>) and, at the same time, infected by a slightly different viral burden (<italic>V</italic>
<sub>0</sub> and <italic>p<sub>A</sub>
</italic>).</p>
<p id="P33">The intervals within which these parameters vary have been chosen to reproduce the age-class incidence of disease severity of infected individuals. The age-class incidence varies wildly among regions mostly due to a different definition of COVID-19 related deaths. Moreover, due to the lack of confirmation of the causes of death in many cases in periods of high emergency as that of March/April 2020 in Italy, these rates should not be considered strictly but rather indicative of the negative exponential-like relationship of the death incidence with age.

<p id="P34">To reproduce this age-related incidence of <italic>in-silico</italic> cases we linked the simulated viral load at a certain time to the clinical status (<italic>clinical endpoint</italic>). This has been done according to the rationale that a patient whose viral load is still quite high after thirty days from infection can be considered at very high risk of death. In fact in most mild cases, the clinical signs and symptoms (mostly fever and cough) have been reported to resolve within 3 weeks from the diagnosis (which translates in approximately 30 days from infection). Instead after 3 weeks several authors have described severe cases with progressive deteriorating multi-organ dysfunction with severe acute respiratory dyspnea syndrome, refractory shock, anuric acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]<sup>.</sup>

<title>Stratifying the <italic>in-silico</italic> cohort of patients</title>
<p id="P35">The analogy of some simulation variable to a realistic <italic>clinical endpoint</italic> allow us to stratify the in-silico patients for a more concrete interpretation of the results. We were able to classify the virtual patients on the basis of the viral load observed at day thirty (indicated by <italic>V</italic>
<sub>30</sub>) and a threshold <italic>θ</italic> in one of the three classes: <list list-type="bullet" id="L1">
<list-item>
<p id="P36">
<underline>Critical</underline>: if <italic>V</italic>
<sub>30</sub> &gt; <italic>θ</italic>, namely, the viral load at day 30 is still high; this class includes weak and late responders;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p id="P37">
<underline>Partially recovered</underline>: those who are still positive but have a low viral load, meaning that the immune response is controlling the viral replication (i.e., 0 &lt; <italic>V</italic>
<sub>30</sub> ≤ <italic>θ</italic>); note that this class includes the asymptomatic;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p id="P38">
<underline>Fully recovered</underline> (or just Recovered): those who have cleared the virus (i.e., <italic>V</italic>
<sub>30</sub> = 0).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p id="P39">According to this definition by choosing the cutoff θ =120 viral particles per micro-litre of simulated volume, we obtain the stratification of the virtual individuals shown in panel A of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. Altogether, i.e., of all <italic>in-silico</italic> individuals, we get 4.3% of critical cases (broken down in age-classes in panel A), 46.8% of partially recovered (panel B), and 48.8% recovered cases (panel C). These figures sound very much in line with current epidemiological statistics when considering that the recovered cases here simulated include asymptomatics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>].</p>
<p id="P40">This results shows an interesting and surprisingly high fraction of in-silico patients in the partially recovered class. This class, in fact, includes patients that, at the end of the simulated period of thirty days, are still positive albeit manifesting an active immune response, regardless being asymptomatic or not. This question is discussed below.</p>
<p id="P41">These special cases can be better examined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, which shows four distinct exemplifying runs with different outcomes. In the panel A the viremia is shown as a function of time. Red lines correspond to individuals who reach the critical condition <italic>V</italic>
<sub>30</sub> &gt; <italic>θ</italic> thus falling in the class critical. The green line corresponds to a viral clearance corresponding to a fully recovered case, and the blue line shows a situation in which the virus is not completely cleared but stays below the threshold value <italic>θ</italic>. This case corresponds to one of what we call partially recovered as it represents virtual individuals that produce an immune response (cf. same figure, panel B showing the corresponding antibody titers) which turns out to be insufficient to clear the virus. These “unresolved infections” include asymptomatic cases and are worth the further analysis described below.</p>
<p id="P42">To note that the two examples of critical outcome (red curves) originate from a quite different initial viral load. Also to note that the fully recovered (green) case starts with a viral load that is higher than one critical case, still the immune response manage to control the infection. The blue curve shows a partially recovered case which greatly decrease the viral load (inset plot of panel A) but does not clear it completely.</p>

<title>How the model explains symptoms</title>
<p id="P43">It is worth to clarify that the term “symptom” has no meaning in the <italic>in-silico</italic> framework until we specify the link between model variables and possible <italic>clinical endpoints</italic>. Also we should note that we have no concept of comorbodity here that would help in defining the “status” of the virtual patient. To overcome this limitation, besides the viral load at day 30, we think up the following quantities (or variables) as <italic>clinical endpoints</italic>: (a) the damage in the epithelial compartment, namely, percent of virus-target cells that are dead at the time of observation as surrogate marker of vascular permeability; (b) the concentration of pyrogenic cytokines as a <italic>surrogate marker</italic> of fever, i.e., Prostaglandins TNFa, IL-1 and IL-6 causes fever people get varying degree of severity with COVID-19.</p>
<p id="P44">Of these two potential surrogate marker of criticality, the first appear more appropriate. In fact, while the amount of pyrogenic cytokines (surrogate clinical endpoint b.) correlates with the severity of the disease, the most striking difference in the critical cases versus the non critical (i.e., recovered plus partially recovered) is seen when comparing the accumulated damage in the epithelial compartments (<italic>ɸ</italic>) computed as the fraction of depleted epithelial cells due to the immune cytotoxicity of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells during the whole observation period (surrogate clinical endpoint a.), <disp-formula id="FD1">

<title>IL-6 correlates with disease severity but youngers generate more</title>
<p id="P46">Significantly, in most critically ill patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a severe clinical inflammatory picture based on a severe cytokine storm that is mainly characterised by elevated plasma concentrations of interleukin 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. In this scenario, it seems that IL-6 owns an important driving role on the cytokine storm, leading to lung damage and reduced survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>].</p>
<p id="P47">The simulation agrees on this finding as the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> shows. Plotting the peak value of the viral load (i.e., the maximum value attained in the observed period) versus the logarithm of the integral of IL-6 over the whole period (cf. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2">eq(2)</xref> in next <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">section 3.5</xref>), we see a positive correlation no matter the outcome (recovered, partially recovered, critical).</p>
<p id="P48">For all age-classes, a critical clinical course is associated to a significantly higher concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Panel B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> shows the same information for all age-classes lumped together and the difference is statistically significant. The cytokine concentration on the y-axis is calculated as the integral over the whole simulated period (definition in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2">eq(2)</xref> of <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">section 3.5</xref>). The positive correlation between inflammation and severity of the clinical course is a consequence of the struggle of the immune system to cope with the infection. However what panel A of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> reports is a generic higher production of IL-6 in younger individuals compared to elders. The explanation of this outcome becomes visible following the line of consequences starting from a stronger cytotoxic activity (see panel B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12</xref> below) that killing infected cells cause a stronger release of danger signal to which macrophages respond by secreting IL-6. Since younger have a higher immunological competence (IC), they respond with both stronger cytotoxic response and better innate (i.e., macrophage) activity. The result is the somehow counterintuitive observation that while younger individuals are more inflammed, they have a smaller propensity to experience severity of the disease.</p>

To justify the apparent contrast of this finding with the fact that elder acute infected individuals are more prone to experience a cytokine storm we should openly regard to one of the limitation of the model, namely, the lack of further cytokine feedbacks that are activated during the course of an extended pneumonia.</p>

<p id="P52">IFNg is released by natural killer (NK) cells upon bystander stimulation by danger signals (Rule n.5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix A</xref>) which, in turn, is released by infected/injured epithelial cells upon viral infection (Rule n.3) and when killed by cytotoxic cells (Rule n.18).

<p id="P54">Compared with asymptomatic cases, the symptomatic ones more frequently have a markedly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines.

This result seems to contrast what stated in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">section 3.5</xref>, namely that younger individuals produce more cytokines but have a less-severe course of the disease. However the explanation provided by the simulation is that those who deal with the infection more rapidly (those including asymptomatics) produce, overall, a smaller amount of cytokines, thus are at lower risk of having a “cytokine storm”. On the other hand, an inconclusive immune response chronicisizing the inflammation results in pronounced symptoms (e.g., extended epithelial damage) and ultimately in a cytokine storm.</p>

<title>Why the immune response is quicker in younger individuals</title>
<p id="P55">It has been suggested that in younger individuals several factors contribute to the lower numbers of patients obseved with severe disease, namely: lower number of ACE receptors, overlapping immunity against coronaviruses and a more efficient intact immune system.</p>
<p id="P56">Indeed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11</xref> shows that the immune response is quicker in younger virtual individuals compared to elder ones. The speed of the immune response is calculated in terms of the time (in days) the viral load V(t) reaches its maximum (indicated <italic>t<sup>V<sub>max</sub>

<title>The key role of the humoral response</title>
<p id="P57">
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12</xref> shows that younger individuals have a higher production of antibodies when compared to elder individuals. This is evidente for both critical and recovered (partial or fully recovered) individuals. However the most striking observation when considering the difference between recovered and critical cases is the gap in antibody titers present in virtually all age classes (panel A). This indicates a strong protective role of the humoral response making a split between recovered and critical patients.</p>
<p id="P58">Panel B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12</xref> shows the corresponding statistics for the cytotoxic T cell (peak value) count per age-class and critical status. This plot consistently evidences that youngers have a stronger response than elders. Interestingly, in contrast to the humoral response, in all age classes the cytotoxic response in critical individuals is higher than in recovered ones revealing the attempt of the immune system to counterbalance the unefficacy of the humoral response.</p>

<p id="P60">It should be noted, however, that there are still substantial uncertainties on the data available due to the variable diagnostic accuracy of different serological tests for COVID-19, therefore more well designed large clinical studies are warranted to address this matter ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]).

Interestingly, before day 10 after the infection it is not possible to find a meaningful classification criteria which predicts the outcome, while the Sørensen-Dice coefficient increases to a high value already at day 25 indicating that 25 days after infection the level of immune activation represented by the antibody titers and cytotoxic counts is predictive of the clinical outcome.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p id="P65">The immunological correlates of COVID-19 are far from being clearly elucidated in clinical studies. Simulation studies can help disentangling the importance of factors such as a reduced ability to mount an efficient (i.e., not off target) immune response due to age or the infective viral load determining the initial viral burden.</p>
<p id="P66">We have set up a computational model that simulates the infection with a varying dosage of the virus and with a slightly different affinity to the ACE2 receptor of target cells, in individuals with different immunological competence.</p>
<p id="P67">The results of a large number of simulations that we call <italic>virtual</italic> or <italic>in-silico cohort</italic>, demonstrates that the great variability observed in the real pandemic can be the mere result of such diversity in both viral and human characteristics.</p>
<p id="P68">The computational model used is able to explain a number of clinical observations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to evidence the importance of the humoral response in discriminating an efficient from a poor immune response failing to completely clearing the infection and, in some cases, bringing the viral load down below a threshold value and, at the same time, without showing markers of symptoms.</p>
<p id="P69">The model has been tuned for parameters able to reproduce the relationship of age with the disease severity (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Starting from that, any other observation revealed an emergent property of such complex simulation environment. In particular we observe the correlations among infective viral load V<sub>0</sub> and severity, among immunological (in)competence (thus age) and severity, among the overall cytokine levels and symptoms (i.e., a virtual cytokine storm), and, finally, the key role of the humoral response in clearing the infection yet sustained by the cytotoxic activity (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12</xref>). Importantly, we have identified day 25 after infection (which we can roughly associate to about day 15<sup>th</sup>-18<sup>th</sup> after the appearance of the symptoms) as the time for a predictive measurements of the antibody response to assess the risk of developing a severe form of the diseases. Before that time, our data suggest that the prediction is not statistically meaningful.</p>
<p id="P70">The model is restricted in a number of aspects. It simplifies reality and works with a limited number of mechanisms and a reduced diversity. Moreover, it does not reproduce diverse organs and tissues and therefore we cannot observe site-specific pathological problems, including the spatial extension of pneumonia. Nevertheless the analysis conducted in the present work accounts for such limitations and the results obtained can be reasonably considered independent of such restrictions.</p>
<p id="P71">Of course there are some cases reported in the literature in which the course of infection has been extremely long, expecially in severly immunocompromised patients. However, the very complex and lenghty dynamics taking place in those cases are beyond the scope of this study, which instead represent at large the majority of observed cases.</p>
<p id="P72">Finally, we should consider that the clinical ground of observation inevitably starts much later than in our model, as people ask for medical attention only after developing symptoms or after knowing of accidentally having been in contact with patients/carriers. Therefore the window of observation we consider in this paper is recapitulating more precisely the infection dynamics of the early days.</p>
<p id="P73">Potential study directions should cover the duration of immunity, either natural or induced by the vaccine, including ways to indirectly verify it, the impact of immunesenescence on the elicited immunity or the combined effect of monoclonal antibody and vaccines in potential future terapies.</p>
<p id="P74">Despite the extraordinary complexity of the immune system dynamics, the progress of simulation platforms suggests that a more intense interaction between clinicians and researchers in computational model could bring these models to the desidered quality for deployment in the medical field.</p>

<p>Diagram of the <italic>in-silico</italic> model components and accepted input. The model embodies functions to calculate the clonal affinity to precomputed viral peptides of the selected pathogen (defined by its primary sequence) with respect to a specific HLA set. The population-dynamics of the elicited lymphocytes clones, resulting from the infection by the SARS-CoV-2, provides a varying degree of efficiency of the immune response which, as it turns out, correlates with the parameters defining both the immunological competence (IC) of the virtual host and the virus definition.</p>
