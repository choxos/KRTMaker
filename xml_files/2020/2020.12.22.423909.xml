<abstract>
<p id="P1">An ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now the greatest threat to the global public health. Herbal medicines and their derived natural products have drawn much attention to treat COVID-19, but there has been no natural product showing inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection with detailed mechanism. Here, we show that platycodin D (PD), a triterpenoid saponin abundant in <italic>Platycodon grandiflorum</italic> (PG), a dietary and medicinal herb commonly used in East Asia, effectively blocks the two main SARS-CoV-2 infection-routes via lysosome- and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-driven entry. Mechanistically, PD prevents host-entry of SARS-CoV-2 by redistributing membrane cholesterol to prevent membrane fusion, which can be reinstated by treatment with a PD-encapsulating agent. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of PD are recapitulated by a pharmacological inhibition or gene-silencing of <italic>NPC1</italic>, which is mutated in Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) patients displaying disrupted membrane cholesterol. Finally, readily available local foods or herbal medicines containing PG root show the similar inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study proposes that PD is a potent natural product for preventing or treating COVID-19 and that a brief disruption of membrane cholesterol can be a novel therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">SARS-CoV-2 expresses spike glycoprotein (S) on their surface and uses it to bind to the host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Hoffmann et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Li et al., 2003</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 is known to enter host cells during infection via two pathways: 1) the endocytic pathway followed by a cathepsin B/L-mediated cleavage of S protein in lysosomes, and 2) a direct fusion of the virus envelope with the host plasma membrane after a TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage of S protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Cai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Hoffmann et al., 2020a</xref>). The cleavage of S protein by cathepsin B/L or TMPRSS2 or both is the critical step to release the viral RNA into the cytosol of host cells. Therefore, the abundance and availability of the two host proteases, cathepsin B/L and TMPRSS2, and the host receptor, ACE2, are the most critical determining factor for the host susceptibility to COVID-19. For example, chloroquine, a well-known anti-malaria drug, was initially suggested to be a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug due to its ability to block the lysosomal cathepsin-dependent virus-entry by elevating the lysosomal pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>). Unfortunately, the most of clinical trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine failed to show beneficial effects in COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Pathak et al., 2020</xref>). The failure of chloroquine was attributed to its inability to block the TMPRSS2-mediated SARS-CoV-2-entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Hoffmann et al., 2020b</xref>). Subsequently, TMPRSS2 inhibitors such as camostat and nafamostat emerged as the next generation blockers of SARS-CoV-2-entry. However, they also fell short due to their inability to block SARS-CoV-2-entry into certain cell-types that express only ACE2 without TMPRSS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Ko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Yamamoto et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, discovery and development of drugs that block both lysosome- and TMPRSS2-driven SARS-CoV-2-entry are desperately needed.</p>
<p id="P3">Herbal medicines and their derived natural products have drawn much attention to treat COVID-19 because they have been shown to possess antiviral properties against a broad range of pathogenic viruses including influenza, HIV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). To date, numerous natural products have been proposed to inhibit one of the essential components of SARS-CoV-2, including main protease (Mpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), ACE2, and TMPRSS2, although most of them are based on <italic>in silico</italic> screening through molecular docking approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Joshi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Khan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Vivek-Ananth et al., 2020</xref>). Only very few of them have been verified for their inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Senthil Kumar et al., 2020</xref>), and none of them have been reported with detailed molecular mechanism of action. Among thousands of Korean traditional herbal medicines, we have focused on the root of <italic>Platycodon grandiflorum</italic> (PG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), which has been described in the Dongui Bogam, the most famous 17<sup>th</sup> century Korean medical textbook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Song et al., 2016</xref>). The Dongui Bogam reports that PG can be used to treat patients with disorders in respiratory tracts and the lung, the major target sites of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Ziegler et al., 2020</xref>). Even in the present day, PG is widely used in East Asia including Korea, China, and Japan to treat several respiratory diseases such as asthma, airway inflammation, and sore throats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Choi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ishimaru et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Shin et al., 2002</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated that the root of PG is enriched with platycodin D (PD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), a glycosylated triterpenoid saponin (colored in blue; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), which is the major active natural product in mediating those biological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Nyakudya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, PD has been reported to exhibit a potent antiviral activity against Type 2 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). However, its inhibitory activity against coronaviruses and its mechanism of action have not been explored. In this study, we set out to investigate whether PG and PD show an anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity by blocking both lysosome- and TMPRSS2-driven SARS-CoV-2-entry.</p>

<title>PD, a triterpenoid saponin present in Platycodon grandifloras, has a specific inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 entry</title>
<p id="P4">To test for an anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, we first developed a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (pSARS-CoV-2), which carried the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV-2 on the HIV-based lentiviral particles and the luciferase gene as a reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Crawford et al., 2020</xref>), to mimic the S protein of the native SARS-CoV-2 virus and retain its ability to bind to the host cell surface receptors for viral infection. We then examined whether PG and PD can prevent pSARS-CoV-2-entry into H1299, a human lung cell line known to be susceptible to coronavirus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Tay et al., 2012</xref>). Luciferase activity assay after infection with pSARS-CoV-2 revealed that virus-entry into H1299 required overexpression of ACE2 (ACE2<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). In ACE2<sup>+</sup>, we found that 1-hour treatment with PG and PD effectively reduced pSARS-CoV-2-entry in a dose-dependent manner with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 5.01 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) and 0.69 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), respectively. In contrast, PD did not block the entry of the control lentiviral particles driven by the glycoprotein (G proteins) of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). PD showed no cytotoxic effect on H1299 <italic>per se</italic> at the tested concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of PD on virus-entry requires both S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 in the host cells. To test the specificity of PD among other saponins, we compared it with ginsenosides, which are a group of saponins from <italic>Panax ginseng</italic>, also known as Korean ginseng. Ginsenosides are known to exhibit antiviral activity against multiple types of virus such as rhinovirus, influenza virus, HIV, hepatitis virus, and herpesvirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Im et al., 2016</xref>). In the pSARS-CoV-2 entry assay, none of the ginsenosides we tested including Rb1, Rg3, and ginsenoside mixture, prevented pSARS-CoV-2 from entering ACE2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">I</xref>), suggesting that PD, a triterpenoid saponin only present in <italic>Platycodon grandifloras</italic>, possesses a specific inhibitory activity against infection of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Herbal medicine and foods containing PG inhibit both lysosome and TMPRSS2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways through the action of PD</title>
<p id="P5">To determine which one of the two entry pathways is the target of PD, we prepared additional cell lines, H1299 and HEK293T, overexpressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (ACE2/TMPRSS2<sup>+</sup>) and compared the inhibitory effect of various drugs with ACE2<sup>+</sup>. We found that E64d and chloroquine, inhibitors of lysosomal cathepsins, effectively blocked pSARS-CoV-2-entry only in ACE2<sup>+</sup>, but not in ACE2/TMPRSS2<sup>+</sup>, whereas camostat and nafamostat, inhibitors of TMPRSS2, effectively blocked pSARS-CoV-2-entry in ACE2/TMPRSS2<sup>+</sup>, but not in ACE2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref>). In contrast, 5 μM PD completely inhibited pSARS-CoV-2 entry in both ACE2/TMPRSS2<sup>+</sup> and ACE2<sup>+</sup>. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref>). The actual potency of PD for inhibition of pSARS-CoV-2-entry in terms of IC<sub>50</sub>’s in ACE2/TMPRSS2<sup>+</sup> was determined to be 0.72 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), which was almost identical to that in ACE2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results suggest that PD targets any one of the events that is common to both entry pathways.</p>
<p id="P6">Yonggaksan (YGS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), whose main ingredient is an extract powder from the PG root, has been available as an over-the-counter medicine and used for treatment of phlegm, cough, and sore throat for more than 50 years in Korea and 200 years in Japan. Thus, we examined whether YGS can be a potential nonprescription medicine to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that a dilute solution of YGS effectively inhibited pSARS-CoV-2-entry into both ACE2<sup>+</sup> and ACE2/TMPRSS2<sup>+</sup> in a dose-dependent manner with similar IC<sub>50</sub>’s of 3.17 mg/ml in ACE2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) and 3.72 mg/ml in ACE2/TMPRSS2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>), suggesting a therapeutic potential of YGS for SARS-CoV-2. Another main ingredient of YGS is an extract powder from the liquorice roots, whose active compound is glycyrrhizin with an inhibitory action in replication and penetration of SARS-CoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cinatl et al., 2003</xref>) and a suggested therapeutic potential for COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Luo et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we tested the effect of glycyrrhizin as well as isoliquiritigenin, other major components of liquorice roots, on the entry of pSARS-CoV-2. We found that both compounds exhibited no significant inhibitory activity against pSAR-CoV-2-entry in both ACE2<sup>+</sup> and ACE2/TMPRSS2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">H</xref>). Moreover, mixing the two compounds with 1 μM PD did not either enhance or reduce pSARS-CoV-2-entry in ACE2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>). Quantification of components in YGS by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) further revealed that PD is the main active compound of YGS to block pSARS-CoV-2-entry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>). The common daily dosage and regimen of YGS are by taking one spoonful (0.3 gram) of YGS powder on the throat surface without water, waiting for 20 ~ 30 minutes, and repeating 3 ~ 6 times a day. To mimic this usage, we treated the cells with YGS four times for 20 min each time at 4-hour interval before adding pSARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>). Under this dosage and regimen, YGS effectively reduced pSARS-CoV-2-entry with similar IC<sub>50</sub>’s of 13.49 mg/ml in ACE2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2K</xref>) and 15.26 mg/ml in ACE2/TMPRSS2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2L</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that YGS, through the action of PD, can be a high potential, nonprescription, over-the-counter medicine to fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P7">In Korean culture, the root of PG is often served as a side dish in daily meals. For example, PG syrup (PGS) has been considered as a folk remedy for relieving several symptoms of respiratory diseases. PGS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2M</xref>) is prepared by chopping PG roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) into small pieces and marinating them in sugar or honey for several months to be mixed with warm water and served as a drink. To test if PGS also shows inhibitory effect on pSARS-CoV-2-entry, we treated ACE2<sup>+</sup> and ACE2/TMPRSS2<sup>+</sup> with serial three-fold dilutions of PGS stock solution containing 15 mg/ml of the PG root for 1 h, before infection of pSARS-CoV-2. We found that PGS effectively inhibited pSARS-CoV-2-entry with similar IC<sub>50</sub>’s of 2.91 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2N</xref>) in ACE2<sup>+</sup> and 3.69 mg/ml in ACE2/TMPRSS2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2O</xref>). Moreover, HPLC analysis demonstrated that PD is the main active compound in PG root with inhibitory activity against pSARS-CoV-2-entry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>). These results suggest that even dietary foods containing PG roots might also have beneficial effects on COVID-19 patients.</p>

<title>PD blocks SARS-CoV-2 entry by preventing cholesterol-dependent membrane fusion.</title>
<p id="P8">To delineate the detailed molecular and cellular mechanism of PD action, we explored two possible events that are common to both entry pathways; 1) the initial binding of S protein to ACE2 at the plasma membrane and 2) the fusion of viral membrane onto host-cell membrane for the entry of viral RNA into the cytosol of host cell. Of the two events, we eliminated the possibility of PD influencing a specific interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2 by using the GFP-tagged receptor binding domain (RBD) of S protein and FACS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We then investigated the possible mechanism of PD action during the membrane fusion. It has been reported that PD helps lower cholesterol levels in the mouse model of hypercholesterolemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>) and that depletion of membrane cholesterol content inhibits TMPRSS2-mediated coronavirus-fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Zang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Zu et al., 2020</xref>), raising a possibility that PD directly influences the membrane cholesterol content to disturb membrane fusion. To test the role of cholesterol in SARS-CoV-2 entry, we performed the entry assay with the ACE2<sup>+</sup> grown in lipoprotein-free culture media and compared to the control media. Lipoprotein-free culture conditions caused a significant reduction of pSARS-CoV-2 entry in ACE2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) and a significant depletion of cholesterol in plasma membrane as well as in other intracellular compartments revealed by staining of ACE2<sup>+</sup> with filipin-III, a fluorescent dye that binds to free cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results support the idea that PD’s inhibitory action on SARS-CoV-2 entry could be due to its effect on the membrane cholesterol.</p>
<p id="P9">As another example of disrupted cholesterol trafficking, we explored the cellular model of Niemann-Pick type C (NPC), which is characterized by a redistribution of free cholesterol from the plasma membrane and an accumulation in the late endosome and lysosome compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Carstea et al., 1997</xref>). NPC is caused by loss-of-function mutations in either <italic>NPC1</italic> or <italic>NPC2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Sleat et al., 2004</xref>). After generating <italic>NPC1</italic> or <italic>NPC2</italic> specific shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), we performed pSARS-CoV-2-entry assay and found that gene-silencing of <italic>NPC1</italic> or <italic>NPC2</italic> by each shRNA caused a significant reduction in pSARS-CoV-2 entry in ACE<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Staining with filipin-III showed the expected altered trafficking of membrane cholesterol and accumulated endolysosomal cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). We next utilized U18666A, a well-known inhibitor of NPC1 to pharmacologically disturb the membrane cholesterol. U18666A is known to inhibit NPC1 function by directly binding to sterol-sensing domain of NPC1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, treatment with U18666A has been shown to disrupt the entry of a variety of enveloped viruses, including Dengue virus, Ebola virus, Hepatitis C virus, Influenza A virus, Zika virus, Chikungunya virus, and HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Salata et al., 2017</xref>), as well as coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Type I Feline Coronavirus (F-CoV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Takano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Wrensch et al., 2014</xref>). We found that 12-hour treatment with 10 μM U18666A completely blocked pSARS-CoV-2-entry in both ACE2<sup>+</sup> and ACE2/TMPRSS2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Intriguingly, the slow time course of blocking effect by U18666A on pSARS-CoV-2-entry in ACE2/TMPRSS2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>) coincided very well with the slow time course of the disappearance of membrane cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>). This slow time course of U18666A was in marked contrast to the fast-acting effect of PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). These results suggest that disturbing the membrane cholesterol can be an effective target to block SARS-CoV-2-entry.</p>
<p id="P10">To test if PD blocks SARS-CoV-2-entry by disrupting the membrane cholesterol, we utilized methyl β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), whose doughnut-shaped structure makes it a natural complexing agent that can encapsulate cholesterol and other large molecules such as hormones, vitamins and natural hydrophobic macro-compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Dai et al., 2017</xref>). It has been demonstrated that when cells are exposed to high concentration of MβCD (5-10 mM) for more than 2 hours, 80–90% of total cellular cholesterol can be removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Zidovetzki and Levitan, 2007</xref>). However, at much lower concentrations and 1-hour incubation time, MβCD should not encapsulate cholesterol. Indeed, under the condition of 100 μM and 1-hour incubation time, MβCD treatment showed no significant effect on pSARS-CoV-2-entry in ACE2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref>). Under the same condition, MβCD completely reverted the blocking effect of PD on pSARS-CoV-2-entry to the level of control DMSO condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref>). PD alone induced a dramatic redistribution of membrane and endolysosomal cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3K</xref>), which was somewhat different from the U18666A’s effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>, 12 h). These results indicate that 100 μM MβCD completely sequestered 5 μM PD, without affecting the membrane cholesterol content. Indeed, staining with filipin-III showed no alteration of membrane cholesterol by 100 μM MβCD alone, a significant redistribution of membrane cholesterol by 5 μM PD, and complete reversion by 100 μM MβCD plus 5 μM PD condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">To understand the detailed molecular mechanisms of how PD prevents pSARS-CoV-2-entry at the level of chemical structure of PD, we utilized the dynamic molecular modelling techniques. Based on the previously reported crystal structure of cholesterol-βCD encapsulation complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Christoforides, 2018</xref>), we performed a homology-modeling of cholesterol-MβCD and PD-MβCD complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">E</xref>) and calculated the binding energy for each molecular pair in terms of Glide G score and Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) free energy scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). We found that out of 21 hydroxyl groups in βCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), 12 ~ 18 hydroxyl groups could be methylated at different positions, while MβCD with 14 methyl groups showed the greatest encapsulating capacity. Therefore, we chose tetradeca-2,6-O-methyl-β-cyclodextrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) as the representative MβCD to model the cholesterol-MβCD and PD-MβCD complexes. The cholesterol-MβCD encapsulation complex was formed by two MβCD molecules arranged co-axially, forming a head-to-head dimer via intra-molecular hydrogen bonds and one cholesterol molecule fitted snugly in the hydrophobic cavity of MβCD, whose methoxymethyl groups encapsulated cholesterol better in comparison to the cholesterol-βCD complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). In the PD-MβCD encapsulation complex, the hydrophobic core of PD fitted well into the MβCD host dimer, whereas PD’s hydrophilic sugar tail was fully exposed to the solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Overall, the molecular modeling of MβCD, PD, and cholesterol revealed that a homodimer of MβCD snugly encapsulated PD and cholesterol with a higher affinity to PD than cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>), supporting the possibility that MβCD preferentially sequesters PD over cholesterol. In particular, the predicted orientation of PD revealed that the hydrophobic triterpenoid saponin moiety of PD was completely encapsulated within the homodimeric MβCD capsule, whereas the hydrophilic sugar moiety was extruded through a hole of the capsule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). A similar molecular modeling of membrane-inserted PD and cholesterol in an explicit lipid bilayer model also predicted the similar orientation of the partly-embedded PD and fully-embedded cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). In particular, unlike cholesterol, the hydrophilic sugar moiety of PD was sticking out of the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>), creating a protrusion on the surface of membrane, which might act as a hindrance to membrane fusion. Furthermore, none of other natural triterpene compounds without any sugar moiety but with similar backbone structure as PD, including echinocystic acid, oleanolic acid, and ursolic acid, showed inhibitory activity against pSARS-CoV-2 entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">I</xref>) and altered distribution of membrane cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J</xref>), implying that the sugar moieties attached to the saponin backbone of PD might be responsible for its action against pSARS-CoV-2-entry via altering membrane cholesterol. These results raise a strong possibility that PD might prevent membrane fusion in a cholesterol-dependent manner.</p>

<title>PD inhibits exocytosis-mediated membrane fusion</title>
<p id="P12">As a proof-of-concept experiment, we tested the effect of PD on the well-known membrane fusion event of spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSC) in acute brain slices. We performed slice patch-clamp recordings from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) and recorded sIPSCs before and during an application of PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). We found that PD effectively inhibited the frequency of sIPSC without affecting the amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">D</xref>). The time course of the inhibition by PD was relatively fast with about 10-15 second after the onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). The concentration-response relationship showed that PD effectively inhibited sIPSC frequency with IC<sub>50</sub> of 6.724 μM, whereas PD did not inhibit the amplitude of sIPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">F</xref>). These results support the idea that PD’s inhibitory action on pSARS-CoV-2-entry might be due to its ability to interfere with membrane fusion. What is the possible inter-molecular relationship between PD and cholesterol? Cholesterol appears to assist PD in incorporating into membrane as evidenced by a 2.5-fold increase in IC<sub>50</sub> value for inhibition of pSARS-CoV-2-entry under lipoprotein-free condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that PD blocks pSARS-CoV-2-entry via interacting with cholesterol and preventing membrane fusion of viral membrane onto host-cell membrane.</p>

<title>PD inhibits authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection into Vero and Calu-3 cells.</title>
<p id="P13">As a final measure, we evaluated the antiviral activity of PD on the authentic SARS-CoV-2 viruses obtained from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We performed immunocytochemistry-based assessment of the infection of SARS-CoV-2, using an antibody against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid N protein, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Ko et al., 2020</xref>). Infected host cells were automatically counted using an in-house image analysis software. For the host cells, we utilized both monkey-originated Vero and human-originated Calu-3 cell lines, whose western-blot analysis showed abundant expression of ACE2 in both cell types, the lack of TMPRSS2 expression in Vero cells, and high expression of TMPRSS2 in Calu-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). We found that PD caused a significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection in both TMPRSS2-negative Vero and TMPRSS2-postive Calu-3 with IC<sub>50</sub>’s of 1.19 μM and 4.76 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">D</xref>). YGS also effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection into Vero cells with IC<sub>50</sub> of 10.9 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">D</xref>). These IC<sub>50</sub> values obtained from the authentic SARS-CoV-2 were within the similar range as those IC<sub>50</sub> values obtained from pSARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), indicating that PD is equally effective against the authentic SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Unlike other previously reported drugs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), PD shows the unique property of equal high potency against SARS-CoV-2 infection in both TMPRSS-negative Vero and TMPRSS-positive Calu-3 cells. This is in marked contrast to other drugs, which show only one-sided potency in either TMPRSS-negative Vero (chloroquine) or TMPRSS-positive Calu-3 (camostat, nafamostat). Taken together, these results indicate that PD has an important advantage over other known drugs in that it can potently prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection by inhibiting both lysosome- and TMPRSS2-driven SARS-CoV-2-entry pathways at the common process of viral membrane fusion by disrupting the host-cell membrane cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P14">SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 and enters into host cells via membrane fusion after proteolytic cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein by 1) cathepsin B/L in the lysosomal membrane or 2) TMPRSS2 in the plasma membrane. We have demonstrated that PD effectively inhibits both of the SARS-CoV-2-entry pathways almost equally in ACE<sup>+</sup> and ACE/TMPRSS2<sup>+</sup> cells with IC<sub>50</sub>’s ranging from 0.69 μM to 4.76 μM against both pseudo- and authentic-SARS-CoV-2 viruses. To the best of our knowledge, PD is the first single compound that simultaneously blocks the two main pathways of SARS-CoV-2 infection. As the 1<sup>st</sup> generation inhibitor, chloroquine was introduced as a potential inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, clinical trials with this drug have mostly failed because it blocks only cathepsin-mediated viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Hoffmann et al., 2020b</xref>). To date, TMPRSS2 inhibitors such as camostat and nafamostat have been considered as the 2<sup>nd</sup> generation inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2-entry. However, it has been recently reported that they are not effective in preventing viral entry into TMPRSS2-negative cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Ko et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we propose PD as the next generation inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which blocks both of the entry pathways with much higher potency than the existing drug candidates such as chloroquine, camostat, and nafamostat.</p>
<p id="P15">One of the highlights of our study is that PD alters the distribution of membrane cholesterol, which contributes to PD’s anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Our finding is consistent with the very recent reports showing that 25-hydrocholesterol (25-HC) has antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection by accumulating cholesterol in the late endosomes and potentially restricting the S-protein-mediated membrane-fusion via depletion of membrane cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Zang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Zu et al., 2020</xref>). These reports strongly support our notion that alteration of membrane cholesterol can be an effective strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it is still unclear how PD interacts with membrane cholesterol and inhibits membrane fusion. Although a pharmacological inhibition of NPC caused a depletion of membrane cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>), PD did not deplete membrane cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3K</xref>). These results raise a possibility that PD’s action mechanism involves cholesterol-independent mechanism. On the other hand, PD’s potency decreases by 2.5 fold when cholesterol was depleted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>), suggesting that cholesterol might help PD as PD intercalates into membrane. Based on the molecular modeling, one can make a reasonable prediction that PD and cholesterol behave similarly because the hydrophobic triterpenoid saponin moiety of PD and cholesterol show similar size and hydrophobicity. The major structural difference comes from the fact that PD contains an additional elaborate sugar moiety that is strongly hydrophilic due to the multiple hydroxyl groups of the sugar moiety, which cholesterol lacks. This raises an interesting possibility that while PD behaves similarly as cholesterol within the lipid bilayer, PD behaves profoundly different outside the lipid bilayer, creating a physical hindrance due to the elaborate sugar tail that extends out from the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). Considering the fact that the thickness of lipid bilayer is about 10 nm, the sugar tail of PD could extend out by about 2-3 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). Such conspicuous protrusions on the membrane could greatly hinder any membrane fusion events that require a close proximity and direct contact between two membrane structures, e.g., SARS-CoV-2 membrane and host-cell membrane. A classic example of such fusion event is the synaptic release due to a membrane fusion of synaptic vesicle membrane onto presynaptic terminal membrane during the exocytosis. Indeed, we found that PD can also inhibit the synaptic release event due to membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), supporting our hypothesis that PD’s sugar-tail-protrusion hinders membrane fusion. Future investigations are needed to systematically test this exciting possibility.</p>
<p id="P16">Recent studies have revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are highly expressed in nasal epithelial cells with lesser amounts in the lung tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Hou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Sungnak et al., 2020</xref>). These reports provide a plausible explanation for why viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract peaks before the onset of symptoms and why presymptomatic transmission occurs. Therefore, reducing the viral load in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients at the early and asymptomatic stages must be the most effective strategy to stop the current pandemic. Here, we tested an anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity of Yonggaksan (YGS), a commercially available herbal medicine containing PG as the main ingredient and obtained IC<sub>50</sub>’s of 3.17 and 3.72 mg/ml for ACE2<sup>+</sup> and ACE2/TMPRSS2<sup>+</sup> with pSARS-CoV-2, respectively, and 10.9 mg/ml in Vero cells with authentic SARS-CoV-2. The formulation of YGS is a fine powder and the traditional usage of YGS is to apply a spoonful of 300 mg YGS on the throat membrane without drinking water and wait for several minutes. Through this unique formulation and usage, an effective PD concentration can be reached at regions around throat mucus membrane and along the epithelium lining of upper respiratory airways. Alternatively, if applicable, PD can be easily and directly administered into the nose in the form of nasal drops or spray for a therapeutic purpose. These ideas should be tested immediately in animal models and COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we suggest that PG-containing herbal medicines or foods as well as PD compound itself can be a promising therapeutic option to exert a powerful brake on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and between individuals.</p>
<p id="P17">It has been predicted that the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 from the bat-originated SARS-CoV is probably due to naturally occurring mutations during its natural course of spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Menachery et al., 2015</xref>). Such an alarming concept forebodes further emergence of more virulent versions of SARS-CoV-2. However, what is comforting from our study is that Mother Nature has already prepared natural products such as PD, which is capable of protecting human kind from SARS-CoV-2 infection. This raises an important point that it might be advantageous to find a cure from the vastly diverse natural products in addition to developing vaccines, which might become ineffective when new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Menachery et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>Molecular modelling of MβCD inclusion complexes</title>
<p id="P28">Schrodinger Maestro software 2017 suite (Maestro, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY) was used to prepare and score the MβCD binding complexes. The software tools were applied using the default settings and pH 7.4, unless stated otherwise below. The binding complex models were prepared based on the crystal structure of the β-cyclodextrin (βCD) cholesterol inclusion complex (CSD entry: KEXQUC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Christoforides et al., 2018</xref>). The crystal structure of tetradeca-2,6-O-methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CSD entry: BOYFOK03) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Stezowski et al., 2001</xref>) was used to represent MβCD in the binding complex. Both crystal structures were obtained from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) and all water molecules were removed. The ligands cholesterol and PD were drawn in ChemDraw Professional 16.0 and imported as structure data files into the Maestro LigPrep module. The Ligprep module was used to prepare all ligands for further use: determine the ligand partial charges, optimize the geometry and perform energy minimization using the OPLS3 force field. The MβCD binding complexes were prepared using the βCD-cholesterol complex as a template. First, the atomic coordinates of the two template βCD units were copied onto two corresponding MβCD units. Cholesterol was added inside the complex by copying atomic coordinates of the template guest cholesterol molecule, whereas PD was placed using a rigid alignment, maximum common structure molecular overlay tool. To account for the increase of the macrocycle size, as well as remove molecular strain and atomic bumps and relax the binding complex structures, a restrained energy minimization algorithm was applied using the OPLS3 force field and heavy atom RMSD restriction of 2 Å. The obtained ligand binding poses were scored in place by the Glide SP (standard precision) dock score and afterwards the relative ligand binding affinity was estimated by the Prime MM-GBSA tool with a variable-dielectric generalized Born (VDGB) continuum solvation model and OPLS3 force field. The binding affinity is calculated using the equation: ΔG<sub>bind</sub> E<sub>complex(minimized)</sub>-(E<sub>ligand(minimized)</sub> + E<sub>host(minimized)</sub>). More negative scores indicate stronger binding. The binding complex visualization was done using the Discovery Studio Client 2020 package (Dassault Systèmes; BIOVIA. Discovery Studio Modeling Environment; Release 2020; Dassault Systèmes: San Diego, CA, 2020).</p>

<title>PD and cholesterol orientation in the cell membrane</title>
<p id="P29">The Discovery Studio Client 2020 package (Dassault Systèmes; BIOVIA. Discovery Studio Modeling Environment; Release 2020; Dassault Systèmes: San Diego, CA, 2020) was used to optimize the position and orientation of PD and cholesterol in an explicit membrane bilayer, consisting of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) lipid molecules. Before running the membrane addition and molecule orientation algorithm, the 3D conformations of PD and cholesterol were prepared using the standard ligand preparation protocol and energy minimized with the general CHARMm force field. The molecules were first re-oriented to an implicit membrane by doing a step-wise search for the minimum solvation energy of the molecule, which was calculated by the charmm36 force field and Generalized Born Implicit Membrane (GBIM) module. The membrane thickness was set to 35 Å. After finding the optimal molecule position in the implicit membrane, the lipid bilayer was constructed by adding the POPE lipid molecules, water molecules and counterions (Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup>) without performing system equilibration.</p>

<p id="P30">For the brain acute slicing, 5 weeks C57BL/6J mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. The The 300 μm transverse slice of hippocampus were prepared in ice-cooling NMDG-based cutting solutions (93 mM NMDG; 2.5 mM KCl; 1.2 mM NaH2PO4; 30 mM NaHCO3; 20 mM HEPES; 25 mM Glucose; 5 mM Sodium ascorbate, 2 mM Thourea, 3 mM Sodium pyruvate, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2 , pH adjust to 7.3 with HCl, 310 mOsm) on D.S.K Linear Slicer pro7 (Dosaka EM Co., Ltd) and recovered 15 minutes at 32°C in the same solution. Slices were re-recovered in oxygenated ACFS solution (126 mM NaCl; 24 mM NaHCO3; 2.5 mM KCl; 1 mM NaH2PO4; 2 mM MgCl2; 10 mM Glucose). Spontaneous IPSC was recorded under oxygenated ACFS solution by whole-cell voltage-clamp. Recording electrodes (6-8 MΩ) fabricated from standard-wall borosilicate glass (GC150F-10, Warner Instrument Corp., USA) were filled with an CsCl-based internal solution (135 mM CsCl; 4 mM NaCl; 0.5 mM CaCl2; 10 mM HEPES; 5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM Na2-GTP; 2 mM Mg-ATP; 1 mM QX-314). For the acute PD treatment and sIPSC recording, 10uM PD containing-ACSF were applicated after setup the baseline. For the long-term PD treatment and sIPSC recording, slices were incubated in PD containing-ACSF (0, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 μM, respectively) at least c one hour and whole-cell voltage-clamp recording in the same solutions. sIPSC was recorded at least 5 minutes. For sIPSC frequency and amplitude analyzing, Mini Analysis Program software (Synaptosoft) were used. Under -300 pA of holding current at baseline data were rule out for analysis.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p id="P31">Data in this study were representative of two or three independent experiments with triplicate samples and presented as the mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant (*P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.01; ***P &lt; 0.001; ****P &lt; 0.0001; NS, not significant). For all statistical analyses, the Prism v.9.0.0 was used (GraphPad Software).</p>
