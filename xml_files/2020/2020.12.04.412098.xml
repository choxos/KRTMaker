<abstract>
<p id="P2">Potential effects of teas and their constituents on SARS-CoV-2 infection were studied <italic>in vitro</italic>. Infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 was significantly reduced by a treatment with green tea, roasted green tea or oolong tea. Most remarkably, exposure to black tea for 1 min decreased virus titer to an undetectable level (less than 1/1,000 of untreated control). An addition of (-) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) significantly inactivated SARS-CoV-2, while theasinensin A (TSA) and galloylated theaflavins including theaflavin 3, 3’-di-gallate (TFDG) had more remarkable anti-viral activities. Virus treated with TSA at 500 μM or TFDG at 100 μM showed less than 1/10,000 infectivity compared with untreated virus. TSA and TFDG significantly inhibited interaction between recombinant ACE2 and RGD of S protein. These results strongly suggest that EGCG, and more remarkably TSA and galloylated theaflavins, inactivate the novel coronavirus.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">The pandemic of novel coronavirus is expanding across the world with more than 65 million confirmed cases, and global death toll from COVID-19 has exceeded 1.5 million. Preventive and therapeutic procedures to conquer the virus infection is urgently needed. Repositioning of existing anti-viral agents and use of corticosteroid have markedly improved therapeutic outcome, while novel medicines including neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are being intensively developed.</p>
<p id="P4">We have explored food ingredients that inactivate SARS-CoV-2, because, if such materials are available, patients as well as healthy people can safely ingest them to eliminate virus from oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract and to prevent person-to-person transmission of the virus. Active components in such food ingredients may also be used as lead compounds to develop novel feasible and safe medicines to treat COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p id="P5">Teas, including green, black and oolong tea, reportedly have beneficial effects to human health, such as prevention of neoplasms as well as cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological, and infectious diseases <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>. Tea catechins are polyphenolic compounds contained in green tea and contribute to most of its biological effects <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. (-) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is regarded a representative tea catechin with the highest activity. Tea catechins are quite unstable under certain environments such as alkalic solution and quickly form various multimers by oxidization. Theasinensin A (TSA) is a biologically active black and oolong tea polyphenol, produced by enzymatic oxidation of EGCG. It is one of the major compounds that are formed by incubating EGCG in culture medium <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. Theaflavins, typically theaflavin 3, 3’-di-gallate (TFDG), are contained in black tea at high concentrations, because catechins are converted into theaflavins by enzymatic oxidation during the manufacturing of tea leaves into black tea <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">In the present study we examined whether SARS-CoV-2 can be inactivated by an exposure to tea. We also identified active components that contribute to the anti-viral effect.</p>

<sec id="S2" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p id="P7">To explore natural substances or food ingredients that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, virus was treated with various food ingredient materials of botanical origins for 1 min, and the mixtures were subjected to TCID<sub>50</sub> assays to determine viral titers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1B</xref>, the viral titer fell to undetectable levels by the treatment with black tea, while Matcha green tea, roasted green tea (Hojicha) and oolong tea also decreased virus infectivity albeit to lesser extent.</p>
<p id="P8">In the following experiments, freeze-dried powders of each tea were used and osmotic pressure was adjusted by an addition of x2 DMEM. Virus was pretreated with each tea for 1 min, and the virus/tea/DMEM mixtures were immediately diluted 10-fold. After an addition of the diluted virus/tea/DMEM mixtures to the cells for 1 h, the supernatants were replaced by fresh culture medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The TCID<sub>50</sub> values indicated that black tea strongly inactivated the SARS-CoV-2, followed by green tea, Oolong tea and roasted green tea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">Next, virus was treated with various doses of each tea, and after infection cell viability was estimated by WST-based analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Green tea, roasted green tea, black tea and oolong tea prevented SARS-CoV-2 from damaging VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells in a dose-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), confirming that teas significantly inactivated the virus.</p>
<p id="P10">Then we tried to identify active components that are involved in the anti-virus function. We tested catechins and theaflavins that are well-known functional ingredients in teas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, TCID<sub>50</sub> assay indicated that SARS-CoV-2 was significantly inactivated by EGCG but not by other catechins, i.e., (-) epigallocatechin (EC), (-) epicatechin gallate (ECG) and (-) epigallocatechin (EGC). We also prepared theasinensin A (TSA) and examined its effect on SARS-CoV-2. TSA more strongly inactivated the virus than EGCG did. Among theaflavins that we tested, theaflavin 3-O-gallate (TF3G), theaflavin 3’-O-gallate (TF3’G), and theaflavin 3,3’-di-gallate (TFDG) strongly inactivated the virus, whereas theaflavin (TF) failed to do so. The anti-virus effects of EGCG, TSA and TFDG were comparatively analyzed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, TAAS and TFDG were more effective than EGCG in suppressing SARS-CoV-2, and the treatment with TSA at 500 μM or TFDG at 100 μM caused a significant drop in virus titer to undetectable levels (less than 1/10,000 compared with control).</p>
<p id="P11">These findings were confirmed by cell viability analysis, which clearly indicated that cell viability was not significantly reduced by infection with the TSA- or TFDG-treated virus. A higher concentration of EGCG was required to effectively protect cells compared with TSA and TFDG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A and B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">In the next experiment, we preincubated cells with the three catechin derivatives for 10 min, followed by removal of the catechin-derivatives and infection with untreated virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Cell viability analysis showed that the cells pretreated with EGCG, TSA, or TFDG were susceptible to virus as highly as non-treated cells were (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). This is in sharp contrast to the experiments using pretreated virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>), strongly suggesting that the three catechin-derivatives may directly inactivate virions rather than interact with cell surface.</p>
<p id="P13">Real time RT-PCR analysis was performed to evaluate viral RNA in the culture supernatant and the cells that had been infected with the EGCG-, TSA- or TFDG-treated virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, treatment with 500 μM of TSA or TFDG resulted in significant suppression of RNA replication in the cells and virus release in the supernatant, while EGCG treatment did so less remarkably.</p>
<p id="P14">To figure out the mechanisms of inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by EGCG, TSA and TFDG, we estimated influence of these catechin derivatives on the interaction between recombinant angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, TSA and TFDG strongly inhibited the interaction between these proteins, while EGCG also inhibited the protein interaction but to lesser extents than TSA and TFDG.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P15">The present study demonstrated that EGCG inactivated SARS-CoV-2, while TSA and TFDG more significantly did so. Concentrations of tea catechins and theaflavins in tea beverages may considerably differ depending on the cultivars of tea plants, procedure and period of cultivation of the tea plants, levels of enzymatic oxidation during processing of tea leaves, etc <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. But green tea, oolong tea and black tea may contain enough high concentrations of EGCG, TSA and TFDG, respectively, for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, considering the effective doses of the catechin derivatives shown in this study.</p>
<p id="P16">As for the mechanisms of the virus inactivation, our data strongly suggest that the catechin-derivatives may interact with virions rather than cells, because pretreatment of virion but not cells with catechin derivatives significantly suppressed infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Moreover, TSA and TFDG inhibited interaction between recombinant ACE2 and RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), strongly suggesting that these catechin derivatives may interact with RBD of S protein to prevent viral attachment to ACE2 on the cell surface. Our results are not consistent with previous in silico docking simulation studies that suggested high affinity binding of EGCG and non-galloylated theaflavin to RBD <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P17">Tea catechins are reported to exert various biological effects including anti-oxidation, regulation of lipid metabolism, anti-inflammation, tumor suppression, and suppression of various viruses <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>. Tea catechins are well known to suppress influenza virus infection by inhibiting attachment of the virions onto the cell surface <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>. TSA has similar functions to EGCG, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, anti-cancer and anti-bacterial functions <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. TFDGs are known to have anti-virus activity in addition to anti-obesity, anti-tumor, anti-atherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory functions <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P18">So far as we know, etiological correlation between tea consumption and SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been reported. At the beginning of this study, we assumed that green tea may be most effective among the tea beverages, because green tea is ordinally and heavily consumed by a lot of people in Japan and Asian countries where remarkably less people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared with Europe and North and Latin America <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>. Unexpectedly, black tea that is consumed worldwide was more effective than green tea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, it remains unclear whether tea consumption influences on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p id="P19">SARS-CoV-2 may frequently undergo mutation, and it remains to be clarified whether the tea catechin-derivatives are effective in suppressing mutated virus.</p>
<p id="P20">Clinical significance and application of the present study should be carefully examined in future studies. After oral intake of tea, catechins and theaflavins are metabolized by intestinal microbiota and poorly absorbed and transported into blood stream in the gastrointestinal tract <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. Serum concentrations of catechins reach only quite low levels after a person ingest some cups of tea <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. The serum levels are substantially lower than the effective concentrations for suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Nevertheless, oral intake of tea, EGCG, TSA and TFDG could inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. Infection at the gastrointestinal tract is regarded as an important characteristic of COVID-19 <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>
</sup>. Gargling with tea or catechin derivatives may also effectively block person-to-person transmission of the virus by eliminating virions from saliva. Tea is available at a large amount with low costs in broad area in the world including developing countries.</p>
<p id="P21">For many years, a lot of people ordinarily have tea beverages in the world, suggesting that teas and their constituents may be readily used as dietary-supplements, and potentially used as lead compounds to develop novel medicines with a relatively lower risk of causing severe toxic events compared with other chemicals. But it should be noted that intake of a large amount of catechins could cause adverse events including liver toxicity <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>, while excess intake of caffein may also result in unbeneficial outcome.</p>

<p>Catechin derivatives inactivated SARS-CoV-2, but didn’t render cells resistant to intact virus.</p>
<p>a and b) Virus was treated with each tea catechin derivatives at the indicated concentrations for 1 min, and the mixture was added to VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells at MOI=3 for 1 h. After removal of the supernatant, cells were cultured in fresh MS for 27 h, followed by cell viability evaluation as described in the Materials and Methods. c and d) Cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of the catechin derivatives for 10 min, followed by a removal of the supernatant, wash with PBS, and an addition of virus suspension (MOI=5). One h later, supernatant was replaced by fresh MS, and cells were culture for 27 h until cell viability was evaluated. Values are means ± S.D. (N=3). *P&lt;0.05, and ***P&lt;0.001 between groups.</p>
