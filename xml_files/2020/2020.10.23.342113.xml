<abstract>
<p id="P1">The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over one million deaths thus far. There is an urgent need for the development of specific viral therapeutics and a vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is highly expressed upon infection and is essential for viral replication, making it a promising target for both antiviral drug and vaccine development. Here, starting from a functional proteomics workflow, we initially catalogued the protein-protein interactions of 21 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in HEK293 cells, finding that the stress granule resident proteins G3BP1 and G3BP2 co-purify with N with high specificity. We demonstrate that N protein expression in human cells sequesters G3BP1 and G3BP2 through its physical interaction with these proteins, attenuating stress granule (SG) formation. The ectopic expression of G3BP1 in N-expressing cells was sufficient to reverse this phenotype. Since N is an RNA-binding protein, we performed iCLIP-sequencing experiments in cells, with or without exposure to oxidative stress, to identify the host RNAs targeted by N. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 N protein binds directly to thousands of mRNAs under both conditions. Like the G3BPs stress granule proteins, N was found to predominantly bind its target mRNAs in their 3’UTRs. RNA sequencing experiments indicated that expression of N results in wide-spread gene expression changes in both unstressed and oxidatively stressed cells. We suggest that N regulates host gene expression by both attenuating stress granules and binding directly to target mRNAs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the ongoing global pandemic of ‘Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), is an enveloped, positive-sense, single stranded RNA virus<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
</sup>. The SARS-CoV-2 virion includes genomic RNA (~30 kb) and four structural proteins, the crownlike spike (S) glycoprotein that binds to human ACE2 as a receptor<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
</sup>, the membrane (M) protein responsible for viral assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum, the ion channel envelope (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid protein (N) that assembles with the viral RNA to form the nucleocapsid<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">The N protein is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that is involved in several aspects of the viral life cycle, including viral genomic RNA replication and virion assembly<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
</sup>. Furthermore, the N protein is produced at high levels in infected cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
</sup>, where it appears to enhance the efficiency of sub-genomic viral RNA transcription and modulate host cell metabolism <sup>reviewed by 5</sup>. The SARS-CoV-2 N protein has two distinct RNA-binding domains, an N-terminal domain [NTD] and a C-terminal domain [CTD], connected by a linker region (LKR) containing a serine/arginine-rich (SR-rich) domain (SRD)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
</sup>. Several critical residues of the N protein have been shown to bind viral genomic RNA and modulate infectivity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
</sup>. Recent studies also show that SARS-Cov-2 N protein undergoes RNA-induced liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) <sup>10,11</sup>. The LLPS of N promotes the cooperative association of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex with viral RNA, thus maximizing viral replication<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">Recent proteomic studies have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 N associates with the host stress granule (SG)-nucleating proteins Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3-domain-binding protein 1 and 2 (G3BP1 and G3BP2)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
</sup>. SGs are membrane-less protein-mRNA aggregates that form in the cytoplasm in response to a variety of environmental stressors, such as oxidative stress, osmotic stress, UV irradiation, and viral infection<sup>15,16</sup>. Assembly of SGs correlates with the arrest of translation initiation followed by polysome disassembly, resulting in an increase of uncoated mRNAs in the cytoplasm. Therefore, SGs are thought to protect endogenous mRNA from stress-mediated degradation. G3BP1 and G3BP2 are considered ‘essential’ for SG formation<sup>17,18</sup>, and overexpression of these proteins results in SG formation even in the absence of stress<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>
</sup>. Recent studies have identified many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), including G3BP1/2, TIA1, PRRC2C and UBAP2L, that appear to be essential for SG formation via LLPS<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
</sup>. SGs are generally believed to have an antiviral role upon viral infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>, and many viruses manipulate SGs to evade host responses<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
</sup>. For example, it has been found that the Zika virus hijacks key SG proteins, including G3BP1 and CAPRIN-1, via an interaction with the capsid<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. This inhibits the formation of SGs and benefits viral replication<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. Currently, however, the functional significance of SARS-CoV-2 N protein’s interaction with G3BPs remains unknown<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">Considering its critical roles throughout viral infection, the SARS-CoV-2 N protein has been described as a promising target for vaccine and antiviral drug development<sup>4,24</sup>. Recently, it has been observed that, upon expression of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), pluripotency is abolished and the proliferation rate reduced<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. Furthermore, it was found that long term N expression drives iPSC to fibroblasts<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
</sup>. Despite the urgent need to investigate molecular mechanisms through which N protein affects infected cells, there has been a lack of information regarding its impact on the host metabolism and transcriptome.</p>
<p id="P6">Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein physically interacts with G3BP1/2 and attenuates SG formation. We found that, like stress granule proteins G3BP1/2, N protein binds directly to cellular mRNAs, with a preference for 3’UTRs. Furthermore, we report that expression of N alters the expression profile of genes implicated in major biological processes and cellular pathways. We suggest that N protein alters host gene expression levels via both SG attenuation and direct interaction with mRNAs of many genes.</p>

<title>Stress granule proteins G3BP1 and G3BP2 specifically co-purify with the SARS-CoV-2 N protein</title>
<p id="P7">To examine the potential impacts of viral proteins on host cell metabolism, we generated HEK293 cell lines expressing EGFP-tagged variants of 21 full-length SARS-Cov-2 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table S1</xref>). Each of the EGFP-tagged proteins was subjected to affinity purification with anti-GFP antibodies followed by Orbitrap-based precision mass spectrometry analysis (AP-MS). To remove any possible indirect associations mediated by DNA or RNA, cell extracts were treated with a promiscuous nuclease (Benzonase) prior to the affinity pull-downs. We scored specific protein interactions against GFP control purifications using SAINTexpress analysis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
</sup> with a statistical cutoff of ≤ 1% false discovery rate [FDR]. In total, we identified 647 protein-protein interactions (PPIs) involving 277 unique cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Extended Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table S1</xref>). We performed KEGG enrichment analysis using the purified interaction partners and identified major cellular pathways, including RNA transport, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, the proteosome and oxidative phosphorylation (P-value cut-off 0.05 (FDR)) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Extended Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">B</xref>). In addition, Huntington, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease related pathways were significantly enriched among the identified interaction partners (P-value cut-off 0.05 (FDR)) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Extended Figure 2B</xref>). We next compared our protein interaction data with two previously published AP-MS studies that were also performed in HEK293 cells <sup>13,14</sup>. We observed that there is little interaction partner overlap among the different reports, highlighting the variability of the experimental and/or statistical analyses employed in the various studies to catalogue the virus-host PPIs (see discussion) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Remarkably, the only shared interaction partners among all three studies were the stress granule nucleating proteins G3BP1 and G3BP2. Considering their essential role in stress granule formation<sup>17,18</sup>, we next focused our attention on examining the functional significance of G3BP1 and G3BP2 interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 proteins.</p>
<p id="P8">Our AP-MS analysis indicated that, among the 21 examined SARS-CoV-2 proteins, G3BP1/2 co-purified exclusively with the Nucleocapsid N protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Extended Figure 1</xref>). We confirmed the interaction between N and G3BP1 by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments using whole cell extracts (WCEs) prepared from cells expressing GFP-N and FLAG-G3BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, the interaction was resistant to nuclease treatment indicating that it is not mediated by RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The N protein NTD, which contains a pocket for binding viral RNA, is highly conserved across the coronaviruses and has been described as a potentially druggable target<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>. Recently, NMR structural studies identified several arginine (R) residues, including R92, R107, and R149, that directly contact the RNA<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
</sup>. Since crystal structures for both the SARS-CoV-2 N protein NTD and G3BP1 are available<sup>27,28</sup>, we performed protein docking studies to identify the residues on the two proteins that might come directly into contact. Our analyses predict a highly stable N-G3BP1 complex structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), further supporting our AP-MS and co-IP analyses. We found that residues 90-96 (magenta spheres in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) of G3BP1 (blue cartoon) potentially interact with residues 130-134 (green spheres) of the N protein (red cartoon) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). We conclude, therefore, that the SG resident proteins G3BP1/2 interact physically with the viral N protein and that this interaction is highly specific, as no other SARSCoV-2 protein was observed to pull down G3BPs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Expression of N reduces stress granule formation</title>
<p id="P9">To begin elucidating the role of N in the context of SG formation, we performed AP-MS analysis using G3BP1 as the bait. SAINTexpress analysis indicated that, in addition to G3BP2, several SG nucleator proteins, including CAPRIN1, USP10, ATXN2l and NUFIP2, co-purify with G3BP1 as high-confidence (FDR&lt;0.01) interaction partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). These high-confidence co-purifying proteins were previously shown to function in SG formation upon exposure to stress<sup>18,20,29</sup>. Notably, the so-called ‘essential’ SG resident proteins that we identified as G3BP1 interaction partners were specifically depleted from the SARS-CoV-2 N interactome (compare Figures 1B and 2A). While further studies are underway to directly examine any remodelling of the G3BP1/2 PPIs upon N expression, our current analysis suggests that N might function to sequester G3BP1/2 away from interacting SG nucleating proteins, thus attenuating the SG formation.</p>
<p id="P10">To test the hypothesis that N attenuates SG formation, we performed immunofluorescence studies. Cells expressing either GFP-N or GFP alone were subjected to oxidative stress by sodium arsenite (NaAsO<sub>2</sub>) treatment for one hour. As identified by G3BP1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), SG punctae were readily observable in cells expressing both GFP and GFP-N Remarkably, we observed that the expression of N significantly reduced the number of observable SGs in cells subjected to NaAsO<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, we also observed that the N protein itself localized to the remaining SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). These data suggest that the expression of N negatively impacts SG formation upon exposure to stress.</p>
<p id="P11">Next, we examined whether this phenotype could be rescued through the overexpression of G3BP1 in N-expressing cells. N-expressing cells were transiently transfected with G3BP1 constructs followed by the induction of oxidative stress using NaAsO<sub>2</sub>. Consistent with the idea that N sequesters away G3BP1 from its interacting SG nucleators, we observed that the overexpression of G3BP1 rescued the SG attenuation phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). As expected, N localized to the SGs in G3BP1 overexpressing cells. Overall, we conclude that N expression inhibits the formation of SGs in the host cells, possibly by sequestering away G3BPs from their interacting SG nucleating proteins.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>SARS-CoV-2 N protein directly binds host mRNAs with a preference for 3’UTRs</title>
<p id="P12">Since N protein contains RNA-binding domains<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
</sup>, we also examined whether N interacts directly with host mRNAs. We initially performed crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) followed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography to detect crosslinked RNA. We observed that N cross-links robustly to RNA <italic>in vivo</italic> upon exposure to UV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, GFP alone did not yield any observable radioactive signal, indicating that N directly binds host RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Next, to identify host mRNAs bound by N, we carried out individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) followed by high throughput sequencing (iCLIP-seq) experiments in biological replicates along with size-matched inputs (SMI) as controls.</p>
<p id="P13">Through peak calling in comparison with the SMI controls, we identified &gt;30,000 high confidence peaks encompassing ~4500 unique human protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Extended Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table S2</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was carried out using these N-bound human genes. Major biological processes related to post-transcriptional regulation, including mRNA processing, RNA catabolic processes, RNA transport, post-transcription regulation of gene expression, and translation regulation were significantly enriched (FDR 0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Extended Figure 3B</xref>). KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that N-bound genes were enriched for pathways that included protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, ribosome and cell cycle (FDR 0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Extended Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">We next examined the iCLIP peak distribution across the N-bound transcripts. Remarkably, most peaks (77% of the total peaks) were found within the annotated 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). We also searched for enriched sequence motifs and found that U-rich sequence motifs were significantly enriched among the N-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Extended Figure 3C</xref>). Since N interacted with G3BP1 and G3BP2, we included their PAR-CLIP-seq data<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>
</sup> for comparison. Our metagene analyses indicated that, similar to the RNA-binding profiles of G3BP1 and G3BP2, the SARS-CoV-2 N protein predominantly binds within the 3’UTRs of its target genes, consistent with its peak distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Our analysis revealed that ~47% of the G3BP1 and G3BP2 targets were also bound by the N protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Furthermore, N’s iCLIP-seq signal was enriched around the G3BP1 and G3BP2 binding sites on the RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). These results reinforce the idea that SARS-CoV-2 N and G3BPs might function together in the infected cells. It is conceivable that N might reshape the G3BP1/2-bound transcriptome to the advantage of SARSCoV-2. Further experiments are underway to test this possibility (experimental data being analyzed). Additionally, studies are ongoing to investigate whether N binds cooperatively in conjunction with G3BPs on shared target mRNAs.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 N alters the host gene expression profile</title>
<p id="P15">To examine the effect of SARS-CoV-2 N on host gene expression, we performed RNA-seq analysis in HEK293 cells expressing GFP-N. Since N appears to have a role in SG formation, we also included RNA samples prepared from cells treated with NaAsO<sub>2</sub>. Cells expressing GFP alone were used as controls in these experiments. The RNA-seq replicates highly correlated with each other, indicating the reproducibility of our data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Extended Figure 4</xref>). Differential expression analysis identified 4363 and 2942 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in N-expressing cells that were untreated or NaAsO<sub>2</sub>-treated (Q&lt;0.05), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Of the 4363 differential genes in the untreated samples 2207 were upregulated, whereas 2156 were downregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental data S3</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">4</xref>). In the NaAsO<sub>2</sub>-treated cells, 1765 and 1178 genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively. We found that ~82% of the differential genes in the NaAsO<sub>2</sub> samples (2403/2942 genes) were the same as those that were also differentially expressed in the untreated cells. These results indicated that N affects a core set of genes under both conditions. Furthermore, after normalizing the NaAsO<sub>2</sub> RNA-seq data against the untreated samples, we identified a small subset of genes significantly upregulated in the N-expressing cells under stress conditions (Q&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental data S5</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">We next examined whether the N-affected host genes are enriched for any specific biological processes. GO enrichment analysis indicated that the upregulated genes were significantly enriched in biological processes related to cellular localization, intracellular protein transport, and cell cycle regulation (Q-value cut-off 0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Extended Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis showed that cancer-related pathways, TGF-beta signalling, Hippo signalling, protein processing in ER and RNA transport were significantly enriched in the upregulated genes (Q-value cut-off 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The downregulated genes, on the other hand, were enriched in pathways related to neurogenesis and nervous system development (Q-value cut-off 0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Extended Figure 5B</xref>). These data suggest that the expression of N results in deregulation of many functionally important genes.</p>
<p id="P17">Considering that N interacts with G3BP1, which has been shown to enhance the stability and translation of its target mRNAs<sup>15,30,31</sup>, we correlated the effect of N binding to its target mRNA abundance. Our results indicate that mRNAs associated with N were generally stabilized in comparison to the non-targets, which were significantly decreased in their abundance upon NaAsO<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). G3BP1 and G3BP2 also showed similar trends in our analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Extended Figure 6</xref>), consistent with their shared targets with N. These data suggest that the RNA-binding of N might stabilize certain target mRNAs against the stress-induced degradation (see discussion). Further studies are underway to directly identify the N targets in NaAsO<sub>2</sub> treated cells and examine how N might reshape the G3BP1-bound transcriptome.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P18">Given that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has globally caused more than one million deaths (World health organization data; October 5, 2020), there is an urgent need to better understand the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle for effective antiviral drug development. In this study, we report the biological impact of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein on host cells. Starting from a proteomic workflow, we found that there is little overlap across studies that recently reported virus-host PPIs for SARS-CoV-2 proteins<sup>13,14</sup>. This observation is perhaps not surprising due to varied experimental and statistical analyses employed across different studies. We suggest that, in the absence of additional evidence to support these conclusions, caution should be exercised in interpreting proteomics data for drug development</p>
<p id="P19">Among the high-confidence interactors detected across three AP-MS studies were the stress granule resident proteins G3BP1 and G3BP2. SGs are typically formed upon viral infection, possibly as a cellular response to block viral replication<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
</sup>. However, viruses have evolved many counter-measures to combat host responses to viral infection and, indeed, many viruses have been reported to destabilize SGs upon infection<sup>15,16</sup>. Certain viruses have been reported to hijack G3BP1 and G3BP2, inhibiting SG formation to the benefit of the virus. In such cases, depletion of G3BPs (or other SG components) reduced viral replication<sup>15,16</sup>. For example, Zika virus hijacks G3BPs, to reduce SG formation and benefit viral replication<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>, and it was shown that depletion of G3BP1 indeed reduced Zika virus replication<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
</sup>. In contrast to Zika, however, G3BPs have been found to inhibit the replication of Sendai virus and vesicular stomatitis virus<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
</sup>. Here we showed that SARSCoV-2 N protein interacts physically with G3BPs and that expression of N attenuates SG formation. It remains to be seen, however, whether or not G3BPs also play a role in SARS-CoV-2 replication. In this context, it is interesting to note that a recent study showed that G3BPs interact with SARS-CoV-2 RNA<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P20">Although N expression resulted in both up- and down-regulation of various host genes, N-bound mRNAs were more stable in comparison to non-targets. Previous reports have shown that certain adenovirus and hepatitis C virus (HCV) proteins stabilize host mRNAs via binding to AU-rich elements present within 3’UTRs of target transcripts<sup>34,35</sup>. AU-rich elements (ARE), which are present in many proto-oncogenes, growth factor and cytokine mRNAs, target mRNAs for degradation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>
</sup>. The adenovirus protein, E4orf6, has been reported to stabilize the host ARE– containing mRNAs, and this stabilization was found to be necessary for its oncogenic activity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P21">Similarly, NS5A of HCV was shown to directly bind to U- (or G-) rich elements within 3’UTRs of host mRNAs, resulting in their stabilization<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>. The NS5A target mRNAs were found to be highly enriched in regulators of cell growth, cell death and cancer<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>. Based on these findings, it has been suggested that virus-induced stabilization of host transcripts prevents cell death and promotes growth of virus-infected cells<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>
</sup>. While SARS-CoV-2 is an acute respiratory virus, our finding that N protein recognises U-rich elements and may stabilize its targets via directly binding to 3’UTRs of host mRNAs is of particular interest given that the up-regulated genes were significantly enriched in cancer-related pathways. Although mechanistic details of N-mediated stabilization remain unknown, we found that N and G3BPs not only physically interact with each other but also have similar RNA-binding profiles with many shared targets. G3BPs have been shown to stabilize their target mRNAs in unstressed as well as stressed cells <sup>reviewed by 15</sup>. We suggest that SARS-CoV-2 N and G3BPs bind to various target mRNAs, resulting in their stabilization.</p>
<p id="P22">It is worth noting that N-bound stabilized targets were also enriched in major cellular pathways, including “protein processing in ER” and “TGF-beta signalling”. This finding is of interest, as viruses, including SARS-CoV, have been shown to cause ER stress and the induction of signalling pathways collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR)<sup>39,40</sup>. However, coronaviruses are thought to have evolved the ability to subvert, or even exploit, certain aspects of the UPR and overcome protein translation shutdown<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
</sup>. Further studies will be required to investigate whether or not the stabilization and/or direct binding of N to ER-related mRNAs plays a role in the ER restructuring that is observed upon infection.</p>
<p id="P23">Further studies are underway to investigate the role of N upon oxidative stress, including how N protein might rewire the G3BP RNA-binding profile and what mechanisms N protein might use to reshape the host transcriptome. Based on the evidence presented here, we suggest that SARSCoV-2 N protein affects host cell metabolism and gene expression via multiple pathways, including SG attenuation, sequestration of G3BPs, and direct binding to mRNAs of some functionally important genes. Considering that N is a promising target for drug and vaccine development, our findings might be of therapeutic interest.</p>

Cells were lysed in 2mL of iCLIP lysis buffer. 1mL of lysate was incubated with 2 μl Turbo DNase (Life Technologies catalogue number AM2238) and RNase I (1:250; Ambion catalogue number AM2294) for 5 min at 37°C to digest the genomic DNA and obtain RNA fragments of an optimal size range. GFP-N was immunoprecipitated from two independent HEK293 cell pellets using 5μg of anti-GFP antibody (Life Technologies G10362). A total of 2% input material was obtained for size-matched control libraries (SMI) prior to the IPs. Following stringent washes with iCLIP high salt buffer and dephosphorylation with T4 PNK, on-bead-ligation of pre-adenylated adaptors to the 3’-ends of RNAs was performed using the enhanced CLIP ligation method. The immunoprecipitated RNA was 5’-end-labeled with <sup>32</sup>P using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs catalogue number M0201L), separated using 4–12% BisTris–PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran).
