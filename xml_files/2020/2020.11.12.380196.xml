<abstract>
<p id="P1">Despite a year-and-a-half of Sars-CoV-2 pandemic experience, personal protective equipment (PPE) remains in short supply<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">1</xref>
</sup>. Current decontamination methods are complex, slow, expensive and particularly ill-suited for low to middle income nations where the need is greatest. We propose a low temperature, ambient humidity decontamination method (WASP-D) based on the thirty minute or less half-life of Sars-CoV-2 (and other common pathogens) at temperatures above 45°C, combined with the observation that most PPE are designed to be safely transported and stored at temperatures below 50°C. Decontamination at 12 hours, 46°C (115°F) and ambient humidity should consistently reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load by a factor of 10<sup>6</sup>, without negatively affecting PPE materials or performance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">In the midst of a pandemic, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) are a critical line of first defense. Prior to the development of vaccines and symptom treatments, PPE limits the spread of disease and protects the lives of vital healthcare workers. Unfortunately, PPE manufacturing capacity and stockpiles persistently lag demand<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">2</xref>
</sup>, resulting in needless deaths and severe economic disruption. Despite best efforts to expand capacity, this PPE access gap continues in developed economies with strong healthcare systems and is exacerbated in low to middle income nations (LMIN)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3">3</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">One potential stop-gap measure is to safely and effectively decontaminate disposable PPE for re-use. A small cohort of methods have been evaluated and approved for use by the CDC and WHO for N95 masks (knowledge here is rapidly evolving- see N95Decon.org or the CDC<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4">4</xref>
</sup> for current information). These include UV-C irradiation, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, dry and moist heat<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN5">5</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">While viable, these methods fail to work uniformly on all brands of PPE<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN6">6</xref>
</sup>, require costly electronics/pumps /renewables and maintenance, or do not scale to high capacity. For example, UV-C is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, but cannot penetrate into the shadows of folded PPE which may harbor viable pathogens. Some UV systems produce ozone which breaks down<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN7">7</xref>
</sup> plastic surfaces. Chemical treatment such as peroxide vapor is both toxic and requires specialized equipment and staff to operate at large scale. To avoid inadvertent high-temperature thermal degradation from exposed 1500°F electric-heating elements, moist heat (60% RH and 165°F/74°C) ovens must be specially designed to block infra-red radiation<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN8">8</xref>
</sup>. High heat also softens elastomeric straps, which may not return to their original taut lengths, or may reduce the material’s ultimate tear strength.</p>
<p id="P5">N95 masks, in particular, contain an inner layer that is electrostatically charged to enhance particle collection efficiency without impacting breathability. This layer is easily neutralized by many wet sanitizers, such as soap and water or autoclaving, making re-use impossible. Other PPE, such as gowns or face shields, can be decontaminated in liquid disinfectants, though may be damaged by physical impact and the process itself is highly labor intensive and residual moisture may encourage microbial growth.</p>
<p id="P6">
<underline>Our goal is to devise and test an accessible decontamination protocol suited for LMIN<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN9">9</xref>
</sup>
</underline>. We are seeking a decontamination, not a sterilization, methodology. The key metric is reducing viral burden and associated clinic or hospital pathogens to manageable levels. We recognize that some pathogens, e.g. mesophiles such as Listeria<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN10">10</xref>
</sup> and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN11">11</xref>
</sup>, have an active growth rate upper temperature bound that just extends into the WASP-D range. And that no lab test, including this study and associated literature studies, can eliminate the possibility of post-WASP-D re-contamination. But we also note the world is filled with pathogens- every breath<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN12">12</xref>
</sup> we take inhales e-coli, clostridium botulinum and various actinobacteria, along with air pollution and other toxic fumes. <underline>Reduction from harm, not elimination of all possible risks, is the goal in a pandemic</underline>.</p>
<p id="P7">Such a protocol would ideally meet the following criteria: <list list-type="order" id="L1">
<list-item>
<p id="P8">Achieve at least 10<sup>6</sup> reduction in common disease pathogens.</p>
</list-item>

<p id="P14">Fail-soft.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p id="P15">Simply “waiting” at room temperature has been demonstrated to reduce SARS-CoV-2 by three orders of magnitude over seven days<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN13">13</xref>
</sup>. However, according to the CDC, six orders of magnitude reduction is typically required for safe re-use<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN14">14</xref>
</sup>. Characteristically, pathogens exhibit a thermally activated degradation rate, but the literature contains few reliable measurements of warm temperature viral inhibition. Pathogen half-life depends on a number of external factors, including temperature, humidity, exposure to light (particularly UV), encasing media (e.g. saliva, mucous, water,…) and substrate<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN15">15</xref>
</sup> (metal, plastic, mesh, air ..). While Sars-CoV-2 research continues to advance, literature results to-date indicate a factor of four or more variation<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN16">16</xref>
</sup> in half-life depending on these external factors. Thus, any practical system must err on the side of caution regarding temperature and humidity.</p>
<p id="P16">
<italic>The purpose of our study is to determine if low-temperature warming of viruses can achieve a six-order of magnitude viral load reduction. Here we test the ability of low-temperature warming to inactivate two surrogate viruses – bovine coronavirus, a beta coronavirus, like SARS-CoV-2 (enveloped) that infects cattle, and MS-2, a small, non-enveloped virus that infects E.coli</italic>.</p>
<p id="P17">By far the simplest solution would be a combination of time and warm heat at ambient humidity- <bold>W</bold>arm <bold>A</bold>nd <bold>S</bold>low <bold>P</bold>athogen-<bold>D</bold>econtamination, or WASP-D(T) where “T” is the decontamination temperature. In WASP-D, PPE are placed in a large closed room or container. Warm heat (43°C-50°C=110°F-122°F, nominally 46°C as a safety factor) and ambient air ventilation are introduced for 12 hours, following a protocol suggested in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix II</xref>. After 12 hours, the amount of infectious virus is reduced by a factor of 10<sup>6</sup>. The same protocol suppresses many molds and fungi which lead to unpleasant mask odors.</p>
<p id="P18">Effective, universal, low-tech, scalable and no consumables.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2">
<title>WASP-D Parameter Choices</title>
<p id="P19">There are three key parameters in this study. First, the choice of warm heat at 43°C-50°C. Second, as moisture affects pathogen viability, a relative-humidity characteristic of affected communities. And third, a pathogen reduction of 10<sup>6</sup> or greater. Decontamination cycle time is a dependent variable necessary to achieve the above objectives.</p>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Warm temperatures</title>
<p id="P20">Most PPE are manufactured from plastic. For example, melt spun polypropylene for the N95 electrostatic filter or high-density polyethylene in a Tyvek body suit. Cellulosic padding, natural or thermoplastic elastomers and small metal snaps may be part of the design. In addition, proprietary hydrophilic coatings to repel blood or bodily fluids, anti-microbials and a host of unknown and transient features may be present. Each material will experience its own specific thermally activated failure mechanism and degradation pathways.</p>
<p id="P21">Testing every brand of PPE is impractical. However, almost all PPE are intended to be shipped from manufacturer to end-user. Like most products, they are designed to withstand standard shipping and storage conditions. Experimental studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN17">17</xref>
</sup> of containerized shipping containers and trucks indicate 50°C is a typical upper bound (with rare excursions to 60°C. Note at higher temperatures, such as 70°C, N95 masks degrade<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN18">18</xref>
</sup>). Consistent with these findings, many product companies (including 3M for N95 masks<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN19">19</xref>
</sup>) recommend 50°C as the maximum safe storage and shipping temperature. While conservative (some PPE are more accepting of higher temperatures, and future decontamination-grade PPE may be more heat tolerant), we chose 50°C or below as likely to preserve PPE efficacy across all commercial products, irrespective of designs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Humidity</title>
<p id="P22">To avoid the cost and complexity of humidity-controlled ovens, the WASP-D protocol draws in ambient air to gently ventilate the heated storage/decontamination chamber. Since the chamber is hotter than ambient, and hot air can “hold” higher levels of moisture and the relative humidity declines. Ventilation also dries out sweat, limiting mold and fungal growth. But until dried out, evaporative cooling lowers<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN20">20</xref>
</sup> PPE surface temperature (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix I</xref>), so the protocol compensates by extending the decontamination cycle.</p>
<p id="P23">Climate varies widely across the globe- thus we considered three limiting cases: Boston, Rio de Janeiro and Lagos. By holding the partial pressure of ambient humidity constant as it warms to ventilate the chamber, we find: <table-wrap id="T1" position="anchor" orientation="portrait">

<p id="P25">There is some evidence<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN21">21</xref>

<title>Pathogen Reduction</title>
<p id="P26">For safety and expediency, bovine coronavirus, a beta coronavirus like SARS-CoV-2, and MS-2 were chosen as surrogate viruses. As the EPA notes, “According to this hierarchy, if an antimicrobial product can kill a small, non-enveloped virus it should be able to kill any large, non-enveloped virus or any enveloped virus. Similarly, a product that can kill a large, non-enveloped virus should be able to kill any enveloped virus.”<sup>

<title>Conclusions and recommendations</title>
<p id="P31">On BoCoV test samples and MS-2 e-coli vectors, WASP-D(46) is expected to result in a 10<sup>6</sup> viral load reduction after 12 hours at 115°F=46°C and 22% relative humidity. We expect a similar effect on the human beta coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. While we have not yet field tested this methodology, WASP-D offers the prospect of saving lives around the globe by allowing for the relatively safe re-use of scarce PPE, and we hope others will confirm and extend our results and protocol in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix II</xref>.</p>
<p id="P32">While the intended audience for WASP-D are LMIN, it does not escape our notice that domestic hospitals and individuals would benefit from a convenient method to decontaminate PPE, or even entire rooms and buildings. New strains, such as alpha, are more contagious. Simple cloth masks are inadequate to stem this variant’s spread, but N95 masks are not yet available in sufficient quantities to be a viable substitute.</p>
<p id="P33">We can imagine colleges might employ this system to decontaminate student masks- or libraries, to sanitize circulating books and DVDs. We also emphasize, in this world of internet misinformation, <bold>and in no uncertain terms</bold>, that WASP-D cannot be used to decontaminate people. A steam spa, or blowing hot air up the nose, is ineffective and possibly dangerous. More subtly, exponential viral decay is exquisitely sensitive to time and temperature. <bold>100°F and 8 hours is not a substitute for 115°F and 12 hours</bold>. A home cooking oven set on WARM will overshoot the 125°F upper safe temperature range (due to radiation from the exposed heating elements) and possibly damage the PPE. Extra time must be allotted to account for the cooling effect of evaporating moisture, or low PPE thermal conductivity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix I</xref>).</p>
<p id="P34">Prudent care must be taken when applying WASP-D to real-world situations. A potential decontamination protocol is offered in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix II</xref> for discussion purposes- please contact the authors for up-to-date guidance.</p>

<p>Heat reduces Bovine Coronavirus infectivity. Bovine Coronavirus (strain Mebus) was heated at 22°C or 43°C for up to twenty-four hours. Following heat treatment, Bovine Coronvirus was incubated with MDBK cells for 48-hours, cyotopathogenecity (CPE) was scored, and median tissue culture infectivity (TCID<sub>50</sub>) was calculated. The TCID<sub>50</sub> assay has a limit of detection of 10 TCID<sub>50</sub> units (here defined as CPE detected in all four replicates. If we define limit of detection (LoD) as any of the replicates showing CPE, then the LoD is 1 TCID<sub>50</sub> units. No infectious virus was detected following exposure to 43°C heat for six or 24 hours.</p>
