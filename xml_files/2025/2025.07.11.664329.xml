In this system, the plant hormone auxin promotes OsTIR1-mediated degradation of proteins carrying an auxin-inducible degron tag. However, “basal” degradation of AID-tagged proteins in the absence of auxin has hampered work with essential proteins due to defective or non-viable strains. A second-generation AID system based on the OsTIR<sup>F47G</sup> mutant was recently introduced to overcome the limitations of basal degradation in budding yeast. However, it remained unclear to what extent the use of OsTIR<sup>F47G</sup> eliminates basal degradation and how it impacts auxin-induced degradation. Here, by performing a quantitative characterization of the basal and auxin-induced degradation dynamics using OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> in budding yeast, we find that basal degradation is still detectable and that it depends on OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression levels. We show that also the auxin-induced degradation rates and auxin-induced steady-state concentrations of AID-tagged proteins depend on OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression levels, in addition to the type of auxin used. Lastly, we showcase how increased basal degradation of AID-tagged functional proteins can impair cell growth and lead to unwanted phenotypes. We anticipate that our findings will guide future applications of the AID system in budding yeast by helping researchers select appropriate OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression levels, particularly in studies focused on precise control of degradation dynamics.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The auxin-inducible degron (AID) system has been widely used to dynamically deplete proteins in yeasts and other organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> – a crucial ability to study dynamic processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Auxin-induced degradation of AID-tagged proteins enables the study of dynamic adaptation of cells upon degradation of specific proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> as well as loss-of-function phenotypes of essential proteins, which otherwise cannot be deleted. For instance, a genome-wide library of protein-AID fusions has recently been developed enabling conditional investigation of essential genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, mimicking the classical, temperature-sensitive yeast strains. Thus, the auxin-induced degradation of AID-tagged proteins is a powerful research tool.</p><p id="P3">The AID-system requires the interaction of three components: (i) the plant hormone auxin, (ii) the heterologously expressed plant F-box protein Transport Inhibitor Response 1 (TIR1), typically derived from <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (OsTIR1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and (iii) a target protein carrying a specific, auxin-inducible degron tag (AID-tag)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Auxin binds to TIR1 and stabilises the interaction between the AID-tag and the TIR1 binding pocket, promoting the SCF ubiquitin-ligase-mediated degradation of AID-tagged proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">A drawback of the original AID system is that auxin-independent activity of OsTIR1 can cause unwanted degradation of AID-tagged proteins, resulting in problems with strain viability and/or the function of AID-tagged proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. This “basal” degradation of AID-tagged proteins can hamper studies where the precise abundance of the protein, targeted for auxin-induced degradation, is critical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The problem of basal degradation was so far tackled by either structural modifications of the OsTIR1 auxin-binding pocket<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, inducible expression of OsTIR1 or usage of competitive inhibitors of OsTIR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Recently, a second-generation AID system was proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> which addressed the problem of basal degradation by engineering a modified OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> version to specifically recognise the auxin analogue 5-Ph-IAA and thereby minimise unspecific interactions with non-auxin molecules in the culture media that might induce basal degradation. While initial findings with OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> in budding yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) suggested absence of basal degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, it remains unclear to which extent the use of OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> fully eliminates basal degradation and impacts auxin-induced degradation in budding yeast.</p><p id="P5">Here, by expressing OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> from six promoters with a wide range of expression strengths, we find that basal degradation still occurs when using OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> and that it depends on the OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression levels used. Furthermore, also auxin-induced degradation rates and auxin-induced steady state concentrations of AID-tagged proteins depend on the expression level of OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> and the type of auxin used. Lastly, we demonstrate that OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup>-mediated basal degradation of the essential protein Acc1 can cause growth defects and basal degradation of Tup1 can lead to flocculation. Our findings will help researchers choose appropriate OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression strengths in yeast to balance the required degradation dynamics with a tolerable degree of basal degradation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Experimental design to quantify basal- and auxin-induced degradation by OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup></title><p id="P6">To assess and quantify basal degradation and auxin-induced degradation of AID-tagged proteins, we constructed a set of six budding yeast strains expressing genomically encoded, yeast-codon optimized OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> from constitutive promoters with different strengths (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. These strains also express a monomeric enhanced GFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> C-terminally tagged with the short AID* sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> (amino acids 71–114 from AtIAA17, Uniprot ID: P93830, in the following referred to as AID) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We considered the single-cell GFP-AID fluorescence intensity as proxy for cellular GFP-AID concentration. By measuring the GFP-AID fluorescence intensity in each strain with a flow cytometer, we assessed the dependence of basal and auxin induced GFP-AID degradation on OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Basal degradation is inversely correlated with OsTIR1 expression srength</title><p id="P7">To test whether basal degradation is dependent on OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression strength, we measured GFP-AID fluorescence in exponential phase cultures of each of the six strains using flow cytometry. First, we divided the GFP-fluorescence value of each single cell by its forward-scatter, a proxy for cell size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, to obtain an estimate of the GFP concentration in the cell and then took the median of the single cell GFP concentration estimates. Second, we corrected these median GFP concentration values for cellular background auto-fluorescence by subtracting the median auto-fluorescence of the wild-type cells from each median GFP concentration value. Then, we normalised the background-corrected GFP concentrations to the background-corrected GFP concentration of a control strain expressing GFP-AID but not OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup>. Plotting the normalized GFP values against the strength of the promoters expressing OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup>, we observed that even with the weakest promoter, the GFP fluorescence was ~4% lower than in the strain without OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> and found an anti-correlation between the GFP-AID fluorescence and the promoter strengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). These findings demonstrate that basal degradation indeed occurs with the AID system in yeast and suggest that the expression level of OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> influences the degree of basal degradation.</p><p id="P8">To verify that OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression level is a determinant of the basal degradation rate, we constructed another strain expressing non-codon optimized OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> from the strong ADH1 promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, which we expected would lead to lower a OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> concentration compared to the codon-optimized OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> used in our previous experiments. In line with our expectation, this strain indeed exhibited lower background degradation than its counterpart with codon-optimised OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This finding provides additional support for the conclusion that the expression level of OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> determines the degree of basal degradation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Auxin-induced degradation dynamics and steady state degradation depend on OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression levels and the choice of auxin</title><p id="P9">Next, we asked how the different levels of OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression would influence the dynamics of auxin-induced GFP-AID degradation. To assess the dynamics of auxin-induced degradation, we performed time-course measurements of the single-cell GFP-AID fluorescence signals after addition of 5-Ph-IAA using flow cytometry. For each strain, we fitted the dynamic data after auxin addition to a one-phase exponential decay function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref> for all individual fits per strain). Thereby, for each strain, we obtained decay functions with the respective parameters describing the auxin-induced degradation dynamics of GFP-AID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Here, we found that the degradation rates increase with the promoter strengths, except for the strain expressing non-codon optimised OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> from pADH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). We found a ~5-fold difference between the highest and lowest degradation rate in the strains tested. Using an alternative measurement approach, in which we continuously recorded GFP-AID fluorescence for 30 minutes after addition of 5-Ph-IAA with a high measurement frequency using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>), and fitting the same model to this alternative measurement data, we obtained similar degradation rates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>), lending further support to the degradation rates reported here. Increasing the concentration of 5-Ph-IAA in the medium did not increase the degradation rate of the strain expressing OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup>, when we tested the promoter with the lowest expression strength (REV1 promoter) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A, B</xref>), which suggested that the OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> degradation system is already saturated at the auxin concentrations applied. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression level not only determines the degree of basal degradation in the absence of auxin, but also the auxin-induced degradation rates.</p><p id="P10">Since the OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> variant used in this study was optimized to bind 5-Ph-IAA, we next asked if the degradation rates would be different if another type of auxin is used. We therefore performed the same time course experiments also with the synthetic auxin, 1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), which was previously found to have beneficial properties for fluorescence live cell imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Here, we found a ~3-fold difference between the highest and lowest degradation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-F</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref> for all individual fits per strain). Degradation rates from NAA-induced and 5-Ph-IAA-induced degradation are linearly correlated (r=0.97, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>), where NAA-induced degradation rates are ~56% lower than 5-Ph-IAA-induced degradation rates. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that auxin induced degradation rates with OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> are faster when inducing degradation with the cognate auxin analogue 5-Ph-IAA than with the alternative auxin analogue NAA.</p><p id="P11">While so far, we focussed on the dynamics of degradation, we next investigated the steady-state GFP concentrations during continued auxin-exposure. Here, we found that the steady-state GFP-AID concentrations in all strains treated with 5-Ph-IAA were &lt;10% of the GFP-AID concentrations in an untreated control strain, irrespective of OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> promoter strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). When GFP-AID depletion was instead induced with NAA, we found equally low steady state GFP-AID concentrations in most strains. The two exceptions, which displayed higher steady state GFP-AID concentrations, were the strain expressing the codon-optimized OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> from the weak REV1 promoter and the strain expressing the non-codon-optimized OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> from the strong ADH1 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). These findings show that low steady state GFP-AID concentrations can only be reached when either 5-Ph-IAA is used or if NAA is used and OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> is highly expressed suggesting that NAA is a less potent inducer of OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> activity than 5-Ph-IAA.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>High basal degradation of AID-tagged protein can lead to growth defects</title><p id="P12">Having characterised basal degradation in yeast expressing OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup>, we next tested the effect of basal degradation on a strain’s phenotype when an essential protein is tagged with AID. As a target, we chose ACC1, an essential gene whose gene product catalyses the rate limiting step in fatty acid biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Due to its essential role in metabolism, we expected that high basal degradation of AID-tagged Acc1 would have an observable impact on the strain’s phenotype – such as the growth rate. To test this, we measured the growth rate of ACC1-AID yeast strains with expression of OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> from either a weak (i.e. pREV1) or a strong promoter (i.e. pADH1). To control for possible growth impairment arising from OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression or AID-tagged ACC1 alone, we also determined the growth rates of strains only expressing OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> from the ADH1 or REV1 promoter and strains with ACC1-AID without OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref> for an overview of all individual growth curves).</p><p id="P13">Here, we found that the control strains expressing either OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> or ACC1-AID individually had growth rates similar to the wildtype, suggesting that these genomic alterations alone were not leading to significant growth defects. In contrast, the strain expressing OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> from the ADH1 promoter and having ACC1 AID-tagged had growth rates that were significantly lower than the wild type and the strain only carrying the ACC1-AID tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>; Kruskal-Wallis test, Dunn’s pos hoc test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction, p-value &lt; 0.05 *). These results demonstrate that basal degradation of certain proteins can have drastic growth phenotypes, highlighting the importance of choosing the right OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression levels, when tagging essential proteins.</p><p id="P14">In addition to the ACC1-AID strains, we constructed and analysed a strain in which TUP1, a non-essential gene encoding a transcriptional regulator, is AID-tagged and OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> is expressed from a promoter of intermediate strength (i.e. the RNR2 promoter). In absence of auxin, we found that this strain strongly flocculated, forming a stable sediment at the bottom of the culture tube in liquid media. A control strain, only expressing TUP1-AID without OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup>, did not exhibit any flocculation phenotype under the same growth conditions, demonstrating that the basal Tup1-AID degradation must be responsible for the flocculation phenotype. This observation is in line with earlier work, which reported flocculation to occur in TUP1 mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. The finding of the TUP1-AID flocculation phenotype due to basal degradation provides another reason for care when AID-tagging proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">In this work, we investigated the effect of OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression levels on basal degradation of AID-tagged proteins as well as on the auxin-induced degradation dynamics. We found that basal degradation of AID-tagged GFP is dependent on OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression. The degree of basal degradation ranges from a ~4% using a low-strength promoter (pREV1) to up to ~35% for high-strength promoters (pALD1, pRPL18B, pADH1). Furthermore, we showed that the rate of GFP-AID degradation upon 5-Ph-IAA addition is also dependent on OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression, with a more than 5-fold difference between the minimal and maximal degradation rates. We further demonstrated that the auxin analogues NAA and 5-Ph-IAA can both be used to degrade GFP-AID in combination with OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup>, although NAA-induced degradation exhibits slower dynamics than 5-Ph-IAA-induced degradation, and with NAA the steady state GFP-AID concentrations are only low when OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> is highly expressed. Finally, we showcased that basal degradation of yeast proteins can lead to phenotypic changes. Basal degradation of AID-tagged Acc1 in a strain with high OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression levels slowed down growth. Moreover, basal degradation of AID tagged Tup1 in a strain with intermediate OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression induced a flocculation phenotype consistent with a partial loss of Tup1 function.</p><p id="P16">As our work shows, even the optimized OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> version does not prevent basal degradation of the AID-tagged protein in budding yeast. We suspect that this degradation might have been left unnoticed in the previous report where less quantitative spotting assays were used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The degradation is consistent with the fact that the interaction of OsTIR1 with its cognate AID-sequence is only stabilised by auxin-binding, but not induced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Along these lines, increasing OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> levels simply increases the probability of an OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup>-AID interaction, leading to protein degradation, even in the absence of auxin. Furthermore, the issue of basal degradation in the AID system might also be a feature of budding yeast, since budding yeast naturally produces IAA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">In the present study, we assessed the degradation dynamics of cytosolic, highly expressed GFP-AID not fulfilling a function in yeast. Both the degradation dynamics and the steady-state level of a AID-tagged protein likely can be different for other proteins. Factors that will influence these values include the protein production rates, stability and general accessibility (e.g. cytosolic or within an organelle). For instance, genes residing in the mitochondria were reported to be less responsive to AID-induced degradation than cytosolic proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the production of many proteins is regulated through processes on the genomic, transcriptional, and translational level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, also involving feedback mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, which could lead to counteraction of the induced protein degradation. Therefore, the choice of suitable OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression levels will likely need to be adjusted to specifics of target proteins.</p><p id="P18">The use of the auxin degron system requires a careful balance between basal degradation and the required rate of protein degradation upon auxin addition. In cases where rapid degradation is required, high OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression is necessary for fast degradation dynamics. However, when targeting essential proteins, or proteins whose concentrations should remain largely unaltered in the absence of auxin, elevated OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression may lead to undesired basal degradation of the AID-tagged protein. If through variation of expression strength of OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> no suitable balance between basal degradation and induced degradation dynamics can be achieved, more advanced dynamic control over OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> levels and activity is needed, e.g. by the use of inducible OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> or of specific OsTIR1 inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Yet, such measures will make the perturbation system more complex, as both the induction of OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> expression and the inhibition of OsTIR1<sup>F74G</sup> are dynamic processes themselves.</p><p id="P19">Overall, the auxin degron system has proven to be a powerful research tool for conditional and temporal perturbation of biological systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Here, by systematically characterising important aspects such as basal degradation and degradation dynamics of the AID system in budding yeast, we improved the practical usability of the system.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Strains and Cultivation</title><p id="P20">The prototrophic YSBN6 strain derived from S288C <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> was used as genetic background for all yeast strains created in this work (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for an overview of the yeast strains).
