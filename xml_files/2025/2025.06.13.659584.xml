Genetic determination, transgenerational effects, and personal experience are major pathways shaping animal personalities. Among these pathways, little attention has been paid to environmental factors in the parental generation affecting offspring personality. Here we tested the effects of the maternal diet on offspring personality in the plant-inhabiting predatory mite <italic>Amblyseius swirskii</italic>. Mated females and males, whose mothers were fed during egg production on either cattail pollen, two-spotted spider mites, or thrips, were subjected to a battery of three to five tests each for exploration, activity, and boldness. Movement activity was assessed in the mites’ familiar environment. Exploration was quantified by the latency to leave and reach novel sites or objects. Boldness was evaluated by residence in risky and benign sites. Mean behaviors were analyzed by generalized estimating equations, repeatability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients. On average, offspring from spider mite-fed mothers were the most active and those from pollen-fed mothers were the shiest. Offspring from thrips-fed mothers were more repeatable in activity than offspring from pollen- and spider mite-fed mothers. Consistently little and highly active personalities produced more eggs than inconsistent, flexible types. Only offspring from pollen-fed mothers were repeatable in boldness. Maternal diet did not influence offspring’ personality in exploration. Taken together, our study suggests that the maternal diet critically influences both mean behavioral trait expression and behavioral repeatability of offspring. The ability of mothers to respond to short-term diet changes during internal egg production allows to adaptively adjust the behavior and personalities of daughters and sons within local and regional groups.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Animal personality refers to behaviors that are consistent within individuals but consistently variable among individuals in a population across time and contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Réale et al., 2007</xref>). Activity, exploration, aggressiveness, boldness and sociability are the five behavioral dimensions widely used to describe animal personalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Réale et al., 2007</xref>). Environmental conditions, along with genetic architecture can mediate the expression of animal personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Réale et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dingemanse &amp; Dochtermann, 2013</xref>).

The effects of personal early life experiences on the formation of animal personality have been documented in various taxa, including vertebrates and invertebrates (snails: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Tariel et al., 2020</xref>; tropical skinks: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">de Jong et al., 2022</xref>; leaf beetles: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Tremmel &amp; Müller, 2013</xref>; predatory mites: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Nguyen &amp; Schausberger, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Schausberger &amp; Nguyen, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Schausberger et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Nguyen &amp; Schausberger, 2025</xref>). In contrast, parental effects on animal personalities have not been well researched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Reddon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Zajitschek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Horváth et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Parental effects, or transgenerational effects, unfold when the environmental experience by the parents affects the phenotype of their offspring, independent of genetic inheritance, and can be mediated by one or both parents, and are accordingly dubbed either maternal, paternal or parental effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Marshall &amp; Uller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Reddon, 2012</xref>). In many animals, the environmental variations experienced by parents are known to have critical effects on their progeny’ morphology, physiology, and mean behavioral traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Tang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ensminger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">McDonald &amp; Schwanz, 2018</xref>). Parents experiencing specific conditions can furnish information about these conditions to their offspring and by that way influence their phenotypic trajectories and behavior in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bernardo, 1996</xref>). Adjusting their offspring personality, or increasing the offspring survival, is perceived as a beneficial strategy to augment parental fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Reddon, 2012</xref>). The influence of parents, particularly maternal impacts, on the personality of their offspring was documented across various animal taxa. However, most research has concentrated on stress-induced maternal effects related to food availability or composition, with a lack of studies addressing maternal effects stemming from various favorable food options that do not lead to critical deficiencies or nutritional imbalances. For example, work in rock lizards, <italic>Iberolacerta cyreni</italic>, shows that the boldness of the juveniles was affected by increasing vitamin D3 level in the maternal diet and corticosterone treatment early in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Horváth et al., 2019</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Harten et al. (2021)</xref> found that in the Egyptian fruit bat <italic>Rousettus aegyptiacus</italic>, a high cortisol level in the milk of urban-origin bat mothers influenced the personality in boldness and exploration of their new-born offspring. They were bolder, faster learning, but less exploratory than the rural-origin sibling. Another maternal effect was recorded by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Petelle et al. (2017)</xref> that the offspring personality in boldness was affected by maternal age together with glucocorticoid metabolite levels (stress levels) in yellow-bellied marmots <italic>Marmota flaviventris</italic>. Offspring from older mothers with high level of glucocorticoid were consistently shier than offspring from younger mothers.</p><p id="P4">Here, we aimed to find out whether and how different favorable maternal diets can affect the offspring’ personality. We tested our hypothesis in plant-inhabiting, omnivorous predatory mites <italic>Amblyseius swirskii</italic> Athias-Henriot (Acari, Phytoseiidae). These mites are well suited models for our study questions because they can utilize diverse diets, including plant-associated herbivorous and predatory mites, small insects, and plant-derived substances such as pollen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Vangansbeke et al., 2016</xref>). Previous studies showed that <italic>A. swirskii</italic> are conducive to parental diet effects and have diet-mediated personalities. Parental, and even grandparental, diets may greatly influence the mean foraging behavior and cognition in <italic>A. swirskii</italic> offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Reichert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Schausberger &amp; Rendon, 2022</xref>).

In this study, the mothers of the experimental predatory mites experienced, during egg production, one of three common diets, two-spotted spider mites <italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic> Koch (Acari, Tetranychidae), narrow-leaf cattail pollen <italic>Typha angustifolia</italic> L. (Poales, Typhaceae), or western flower thrips <italic>Frankliniella occidentalis</italic> Pergande (Thysanoptera, Thripidae).

Each platform consisted of an acrylic tile placed on a water-saturated foam block, delimited by tissue paper wrapped around the edges of the tile, inside a plastic box (20 x 20 x 5 cm) half-filled with tap water. Cotton tufts under coverslips (10 x 10 mm) served as shelters for the mites. To avoid escaping and contamination by other organisms, the plastic box containing the rearing platform was placed inside a plastic tray (40 x 30 x 8 cm), containing a shallow layer of soapy water, and covered by an acrylic case with a mesh-covered opening (10 cm Ø) on top for ventilation. <italic>Typha angustifolia</italic> pollen (Nutrimite, Biobest, BE) and mixed stages of <italic>T. urticae</italic> were added onto the platforms twice a week.</p><p id="P6">The laboratory population of <italic>T. urticae</italic> (green form) used as prey was reared on whole common bean plants, <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris var</italic>.

Fresh bean pods and pollen were added to the jars once a week. To obtain first larval instars of thrips, adult females were randomly withdrawn from the rearing and transferred to a detached bean leaf, embedded upside down in a 1.5 % water agar solution in a closed Petri dish, for oviposition. After 24 h, the females were removed and the Petri dishes with thrips eggs inside the leaves were stored in a growth chamber at 23 ± 1 °C, 60 ± 5% relative humidity RH, and 16:8 h L:D photoperiod. First larval instars, hatching after 4 to 5 d, were used as prey during maternal conditioning.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Maternal treatments and experimental animals</title><p id="P7">To assess maternal diet effects on offspring mean behavior and personality, we examined the behavior of adult <italic>A. swirskii</italic> females and males emerging from mothers that had been fed on either cattail pollen, spider mites, or thrips during egg production. To generate the mothers of the experimental animals, gravid females of <italic>A. swirskii</italic> were randomly collected from the rearing and placed, in batches of 15 females, for oviposition on new acrylic platforms (constructed as described above) harboring pollen. Predatory mite eggs were collected from the platforms and distributed, in batches of 10 eggs, to small acrylic arenas, each equipped with a cotton tuft shelter and cattail pollen. The predatory mites were left on the arenas until the females were adult and mated. Mated females were distributed to three types of new small acrylic arenas (5 to 7 females/arena), each equipped with a cotton tuft shelter and harboring either cattail pollen, mixed stages of two-spotted spider mites, or live and dead 1<sup>st</sup> instar larvae of thrips; some thrips larvae were killed by deep-freezing before transfer to ease feeding by the predatory mite females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Nguyen &amp; Schausberger, 2024</xref>). Eggs produced by the predatory females during the first two days of feeding on their respective diet were discarded to avoid any carryover effect from the previous diet on egg production and provisioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Schausberger &amp; Rendon, 2022</xref>). From the 3rd day onwards, predatory mite eggs were collected daily from each of the three diet-specific arenas and rinsed with de-ionized water for 30 s to remove any diet cues on the chorion. Eggs from the same maternal diet treatment were transferred to a new small acrylic arena harboring <italic>T. angustifolia</italic> pollen and left there until reaching adulthood and mating. Mated males (sons) and females (daughters) were used as experimental animals. Before starting the behavioral assays, each experimental individual was singly transferred to a small leaf disc (10 mm Ø), resting on top of a water agar column inside a closed breeding dish (50 x 15 mm), with a mesh-covered ventilation opening in the lid, half-filled with water, and provided with <italic>T. angustifolia</italic> pollen. These leaf discs were considered the home discs of each experimental individual, where they were kept before and in between the behavioral assays until the end of the experiment. Pollen on the discs was provided ad libitum and replenished as needed. All arenas and leaf discs were stored in a climate chamber at 23 ± 1 °C, 60 ± 5 % RH, and 16:8 h L:D.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Behavioral assays</title><p id="P8">The mean trait expressions and personalities of adult <italic>A. swirskii</italic> females and males were assessed in three of the five canonical personality categories proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Réale et al. (2007)</xref>. Personalities in exploration and boldness were evaluated by subjecting each individual to three successive tests for each trait. Personalities in activity were assessed when residing on their familiar home discs in between the assays for exploration and boldness. Throughout the behavioral assays, we also quantified reproduction of the experimental females by recording the number of eggs produced in the test arenas and on the home discs. The sample sizes were 98 individuals for boldness (34, 31, 33 for pollen, spider mites, thrips), 92 for activity (32, 30, 30 for pollen, spider mites, thrips), and 89 for exploration (31, 29, 29 for pollen, spider mites, thrips).</p><p id="P9">Personality in activity was assessed by observing each predator on their home disc three times within one hour (0, 30 and 60 min), each on five days in between the exploration and boldness assays. At each spot observation the individual was scored as either moving (ambulating) or being stationary.</p><p id="P10">Personality in boldness was evaluated by the response of the experimental animals to intraguild predator cues in three sequential tests. Each boldness test was staged using closed T-shaped acrylic mazes. Each T-maze was composed of two large cavities and one small cavity that were connected with each other by a T-shaped aisle. The bottom of the maze was closed by a fine mesh and on the upper side by a removable glass slide fixed by two foldback clips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Schausberger &amp; Hoffmann 2008</xref>). The two large cavities, located at either end of the horizontal aisle of the T, were sites with (risky) and without (safe) intraguild predator cues; the small cavity was located at the bottom end of the vertical aisle of the T-maze and used as the release site of the experimental animal. We used cues of three different intraguild predators of <italic>A. swirskii</italic>, namely <italic>Orius laevigatus, A. andersoni</italic>, and <italic>Neoseiulus californicus</italic> in the three boldness tests. To generate intraguild predator cues inside one of the two large cavities, one adult intraguild predator female was placed inside one of the large cavities for 12 h before starting the boldness test (the aisle leading to the other cavities was blocked), to leave her traces, such as metabolic waste products and/or footprints, inside the cavity (considered as a risky site). The other large cavity without the predator traces was considered as a safe site. After removing the intraguild predator and the aisle blockage, the boldness test started by releasing an experimental female or male A.swirskii in the small cavity. In each boldness test, the T-shaped mazes were monitored immediately after release of <italic>A. swirskii</italic> and then every 20 min over 2 h to record their residence (distance to risky site) and activity (stationary or moving).</p><p id="P11">Personality in exploration was assessed by exposing the predators to a battery of three tests, offering a novel diet type in the first test, novel objects in the second test, and a novel leaf disc in the third test. In the first test, an arrangement of two plastic discs (15 mm Ø) connected by a non-fragrant wax bridge (28 mm long) on a wet filter paper resting on a water-saturated foam block (6 x 6 x 4 cm) inside a small plastic box (10 x 10 x 6 cm). One disc harbored <italic>T. angustifolia</italic> pollen, which was familiar to the predators, while the other disc harbored tomato pollen, <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>, which was novel to the predators. The experimental animals were singly transferred to the familiar disc of the test arrangement and stayed there for 5 min for acclimatization. During these 5 min, a moist tissue strip was placed on the wax bridge to prevent crossing the bridge during acclimatization. To start the 1<sup>st</sup> test, the moist tissue strip was removed and the activity and position of the experimental animal was videotaped for 5 min, using a digital stereo-microscope (Leica DMS1000). Videos were then watched to determine (i) the dispersal latency, i.e., the time elapsed until the predator first moved onto the wax bridge, and (ii) the object contact latency, i.e., the time elapsed until the predator reached the 2nd disc harboring the novel tomato pollen. In the 2nd test, an open-field arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Antunes &amp; Biala, 2012</xref>) was used to evaluate the propensity of the predators to explore novel objects. Each open-field arena consisted of a light-grey or milky white acrylic tile (60 x 60 x 3 mm) resting on a water-saturated foam block (6 x 6 x 4 cm) inside a plastic box (10 x 10 x 6 cm) half-filled with tap water. Moist tissue paper was wrapped around the edges of the tile to delimit the experimental arena. The four corners of the open-field arena were equipped with piles of paper pieces with different shapes (rectangular, circular, triangular) and colors (pink, light green, white), and a pile of cut plastic hairs (6 to 7 mm long). A small plastic washer (5 and 2.5 mm outer and inner Ø, 1 mm high), with some <italic>T. angustifolia</italic> pollen grains inside, was placed in the center of the arena to serve as shelter and release point for the predatory mites. Before starting the test, a single adult predatory mite was placed inside the plastic washer and the washer was closed by a coverslip. After a 5-min acclimatization period, the coverslip was removed, and the movement of the predator was videotaped for 5 min using a digital stereo microscope (Leica DMS1000). From the videos, the exploration propensity was quantified by determining (i) the dispersal latency, i.e. the time elapsed until the predator left the washer and moved away from it by at least one body length, and (ii) the object contact latency, i.e. the time elapsed until the predator reached, and touched, one of the novel objects in the corners of the arena. The 3rd test was conducted using a closed acrylic cage consisting of two circular cavities (15 mm Ø) connected by an aisle (20 mm long), all drilled into an acrylic plate (3 mm thick) closed at the bottom by a fine mesh and on the upper side by a removable glass slide fixed by foldback clips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Schausberger &amp; Hoffmann, 2008</xref>). A small leaf disc of the familiar common bean (10 mm Ø) was placed inside one cavity to represent a familiar environment for the predator. The other cavity was loaded with a novel leaf disc (10 mm Ø) of blushing philodendron (<italic>Philodendron erubescens</italic>). To allow the predators to acclimatize to the familiar cavity, the aisle was blocked with a paper plug for 5 min. The test was started by removing the paper plug and subsequently the activity and position of the predator was recorded for 5 min. Exploration behavior was quantified by (i) the dispersal latency, i.e., the time elapsed until the predator first moved into the aisle leading to the novel leaf disc, and (ii) the object contact latency, i.e., time elapsed until the predator reached the second cavity with the novel leaf disc. If the experimental animal did not move away from the release site or did not reach the novel object during the experiment, a ceiling time of twice the observation time (10 min) was used in analysis of the dispersal and contact latencies.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P12">All statistical analyses were performed using R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">R Core Team, 2024</xref>) and RStudio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Posit Team, 2024</xref>).

Our experimental design allows to unambiguously assign the observed effects to mothers since the experimental diets were only administered after development and mating (all fathers in all maternal treatments were fed the same pollen diet). Maternal diet influenced offspring’ mean activity and boldness, which effects differed between sons and daughters in activity but not boldness. Offspring activity was the only personality trait that was repeatable across maternal treatments. In two of three personality traits, repeatability varied with maternal diet and offspring sex. The composition of personality types in boldness changed slightly with maternal diet, with maternal thrips diet shifting the offspring’ boldness scores up. Among sons, there were more consistently highly exploratory and consistently little active personality types than among daughters. Consistently highly and little active daughters produced more eggs across maternal diet treatments. Consistently little or highly exploratory daughters from spider mite-fed mothers produced more eggs than flexible daughters.</p><sec id="S12"><title>Population means</title><p id="P23">The offspring from prey-fed mothers were more active than those from pollen-fed mothers. It is perceivable that spider mites and thrips would exert a similar influence as animal diets provide elevated levels of suitable nutrients to primarily carnivorous predators, compared to vegetarian diets such as pollen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lundgren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Delisle et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, spider mite- and thrips-fed mothers likely provided their offspring with higher initial energy reserves than pollen-fed mothers. Availability and composition of nutrients in the yolk during embryonic development can be important proximate factors mediating maternal effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Deeming &amp; Ferguson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Stewart &amp; Ecay, 2010</xref>). However, from hatching onwards, all offspring received completely the same pollen diet, providing ample time and opportunity to equalize any presumable initial differences; still, metabolic memory could have carried initial differences over to adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Somer &amp; Thummel, 2014</xref>). In any case, prey-fed mothers produced offspring with higher mean activity in familiar environments. Also, during the boldness assays, offspring from pollen-fed mothers were the least active, while offspring from thrips- and spider mite-fed mothers maintained similarly high activity. These results are analogous to those by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Seiter &amp; Schausberger (2016)</xref>, who found that A.swirskii emerging from spider-mite fed parents were more active than those from pollen-fed parents. The pollen diet presumably indicates a steady, low-stress environment to mothers, which then program their offspring to maintain reduced activity as a little energy-consuming strategy. Nonetheless, these differences did not translate into differences in mean exploration propensities, which underscores that movement activity in familiar environments is distinct from activity during the boldness and exploration tests.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Personality expression (ICCs)</title><p id="P24">Of the three personality traits evaluated, only activity was consistently repeatable across treatments, yet repeatability varied strongly among maternal diet treatments and between sons and daughters. Boldness was only repeatable in particular maternal diet treatments. Parental effects are anticipated to generate behavioral diversity and individual niche specialization within a population, facilitating flexible and rapid adjustment to changing environments, such as varying occurrence and availability of different diet options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mousseau &amp; Fox, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Proulx &amp; Teotónio, 2017</xref>). No previous studies exist that compared the effects of various nutritionally favorable maternal diets on the development of offspring personalities. Previous research primarily examined the impact of variations in availability of single diet components on mean behavioral trait expression and animal personality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Horváth et al. (2019)</xref> observed that maternal diet supplementation with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> affected the activity-related personality traits of offspring in rock lizards, Iberolacerta cyreni. In our experiments, thrips prey exhibited the most pronounced effects among the three maternal diet treatments. Thrips are difficult to capture (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Schausberger et al., 2018</xref>), and maternal experience of thrips appears to promote the development of two distinct personality types in activity among offspring. This was similar when <italic>A. swirskii</italic> experienced thrips in early life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Nguyen &amp; Schausberger, 2024</xref>). Also, the fact the exploration was only little repeatable across maternal diets aligns with previous studies on the effects of early-life diet experiences in <italic>A. swirskii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Nguyen &amp; Schausberger, 2024</xref>). Nonetheless, personal early life experience of thrips prey generated highly repeatable personalities in exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Nguyen &amp; Schausberger, 2024</xref>), which differed from the effects of maternal thrips diet on offspring observed in this study. This suggests that maternal and early-life experiences do not always and not necessarily act in the same direction, as shown in another predatory mite, <italic>Phytoseiulus persimilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Nguyen &amp; Schausberger, 2025</xref>), and that thrips prey has a stronger and persistent impact on predator behavior if it is personally experienced. Offspring from pollen-fed mothers were the only group among the three maternal diet treatments that were (marginally significantly) repeatable in boldness. Conversely, in rock lizards, vitamin D<sub>3</sub> of the maternal diets did not affect offspring’ boldness repeatability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Horváth et al., 2019</xref>). On average, however, offspring from mothers supplied with vitamin D3 were bolder than those from control mothers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Harten et al. (2021)</xref> observed that urban fruit bats with high cortisol level in their milk, relative to rural fruit bat mothers, heightened the risk-taking tendency and decreased the exploration propensity of rural foster offspring, as compared to those raised by their biological mothers.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Within-group personality composition and fitness</title><p id="P25">Our results indicate maternally-mediated changes in the distribution and composition of personality types in boldness. Specifically, maternal thrips diet shifted the offspring’ personality types in boldness up, which is similar to the effects of early-life intraguild predation risk observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Schausberger et al. (2024)</xref>. This suggests that mothers inform their offspring about foraging-associated risks, and that the offspring then adjust their personalities accordingly. Thrips is only a risky prey for juvenile but not adult predatory mites, which is similar to the risk posed by intraguild predators used in the boldness tests. It thus pays for adult offspring to not shy away from sites that no longer pose a risk to them, no matter whether in foraging or predation. In foraging contexts, maternal information transfer allows offspring to preferentially go for the type of maternally-experienced prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bilkó et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Peralta Quesada &amp; Schausberger, 2012</xref>). While there was no main effect of maternal diet on within-group personality composition in activity and exploration, sons and daughters responded differently to maternal diets. Among offspring from spider mite- and thrips-fed mothers, there were more cautious exploratory personality types in sons than daughters. This may be linked to the much smaller body size of males, which rendes them more vulnerable to risk and weaker in overwhelming prey. The opposite was the case in sons and daughters from pollen-fed mothers. Exploration typically reflects a trade-off between the benefits of acquiring new information and the potential costs of higher risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Wolf et al., 2007</xref>) and this trade-off is inevitably linked to sex-specific acrivities and body size.</p><p id="P26">Personality traits such as activity, aggressiveness, exploration, sociability and boldness are assumed to have implications to fitness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Wolf et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Biro &amp; Stamps, 2008</xref>). For example, more exploratory personalities are more likely to discover new resources, which often enhances developmental speed and increases reproductive output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">McCowan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Roth et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Nguyen &amp; Schausberger, 2025</xref>). Our experiments revealed convex correlations between egg production and personality scores in activity (across maternal treatments) and exploration (in offspring from spider mite-fed mothers). These results indicate that the maternal diet can mediate the adaptive significance of offspring’ personality expression. To our knowledge, no previous study has examined the correlation between within-group personality composition and reproduction as affected by parental effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P27">There exist only very few studies addressing maternal and/or paternal effects on animal personality, especially related to food intake. Apart from showing that maternal diet affects mean behavioral trait expression of offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Horváth et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Stamps &amp; Bell, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Schausberger &amp; Rendon, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Nguyen &amp; Schausberger, 2025</xref>), our study demonstrates that maternal diet during egg production can also have long-lasting impacts on offspring’ behavioral repeatability. This finding highlights the importance to consider transgenerational effects and parental diet history in studies on animal personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Reddon, 2012</xref>). Proximate factors include epigenetic changes, embryonic learning, and differences in maternal and/or offspring’ (through maternal provisioning) initial metabolic or nutritional state having long-lasting (condition transfer or carry-over) effects into offspring’ adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Reddon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Somer &amp; Thummel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Peralta Quesada &amp; Schausberger, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Sih et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bonduriansky &amp; Crean, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Schausberger &amp; Rendon, 2022</xref>). However, regarding nutritional state, there was ample time throughout ontogeny (same food for all offspring from the egg onwards) to balance any initial maternally-mediated differences. Differences could have also been mediated or strengthened by interactions during development in groups with similarly-programmed individuals (individuals of a given maternal treatment grew up together), including mating among those individuals. Recent studies suggest that the mating partners can have decisive effects on adult females’ personalities (Monestier &amp; Bell, 2023; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Schausberger et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Schausberger &amp; Nguyen, 2025</xref>). In our study, the mothers received the experimental diets only during internal production of the eggs giving rise to the experimental animals. Before that, all mothers and fathers had been fed on the same pollen diet. This procedure excludes paternal diet influences and suggests that the mothers’ response to short-term diet changes allows to flexibly diversify their offspring’ personalities and individual niches throughout the oviposition period. Diversification in mean behavior and personality, alongside lacking differences in mean egg production among daughters from the three maternal diet treatments, should mitigate inter-individual conflicts and facilitate the local and regional co-existence of inter- and intra-generationally adjusted personalities and foraging phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Nguyen &amp; Schausberger, 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">2025</xref>; this study).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS206942-supplement-Supplementary_table_1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d8aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S16"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was financially supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF; P 33787-B to PS).
