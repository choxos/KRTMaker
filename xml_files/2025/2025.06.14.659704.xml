In particular, how direct exposure to AECs within the central nervous system (CNS) shapes the local immune environment is currently unknown. Herein we describe a novel CNS-specific immunoregulatory pathway induced by intracisternal delivery of human AECs. Local immune responses induced by AECs in the brain led to recruitment of immunosuppressive Arginase 1<sup>+</sup> (ARG1<sup>+</sup>) macrophages and a novel population of myeloid-derived suppressor cells with eosinophilic characteristics, which we term Eo-MDSCs. We further demonstrate that Eo-MDSCs produce Maresin 2 (MaR2), a specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) involved in the resolution of inflammation. In a mouse model of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), treatment of established disease with AECs induced immunological responses that resulted in reduced numbers of pathogenic macrophages and T helper (T<sub>H</sub>)17 cells, increased anti-inflammatory T cell subsets, and enhanced myelin phagocytosis, all of which led to functional recovery. These findings suggest that AEC therapy has the potential to target CNS-intrinsic inflammatory processes in MS, providing a strong rationale for translation into the clinic.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Stem cell therapy</kwd><kwd>Amniotic Epithelial Cells</kwd><kwd>Multiple Sclerosis</kwd><kwd>Neuroinflammation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Chronic inflammation is a common denominator in many neurodegenerative diseases, which contributes to their pathogenesis. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an incurable autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and demyelination, leading to progressive neurodegeneration. While T cells are central players in MS pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, myeloid cells are crucial in the initiation and exacerbation of MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Myeloid cells in the brain predominantly comprise the central nervous system (CNS)-resident microglia and macrophages, as well as infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages. During MS, myeloid cells infiltrate the CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> through meningeal routes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> where they contribute to neuronal damage by enhancing pathogenic T cell responses, secreting proinflammatory mediators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and through active phagocytosis of axons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Macrophages are prevalent in MS lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and their numbers are traditionally known to correlate with demyelination and axonal damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, over past decades it has become evident that myeloid cells have a remarkable capacity to resolve inflammation and to promote tissue repair in the brain. Consistent with this notion, we demonstrated that selectively inhibiting microglia proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> or enhancing their myelin clearance capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> effectively induced disease remission in an experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) model of MS. It is increasingly evident that current MS treatments targeting the adaptive immune arm exert their therapeutic effect indirectly by modulating myeloid cell activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Indeed, we and others have demonstrated that increased infiltration of immunosuppressive myeloid cells in the CNS reverts the pathogenic inflammatory processes leading to recovery in murine models of MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. This multifaceted behaviour of myeloid cells attributed to their different activation states thus positions myeloid cells as important determinants of MS outcome.</p><p id="P3">AECs are stem cells derived from the innermost layer of the human placenta, offering multiple advantages over other cell types for cell therapy. These include their non-immunogenic and non-tumorigenic properties, their recovery through use of a non-invasive procedure with limited ethical concern, and their higher cell abundance. Since AECs do not express HLA class II antigens nor co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86, acute rejection does not occur after their transplantation. Efficacious AEC-based therapies are reported across a wide range of disease models including hepatic disorders, Crohn’s disease and neurological conditions such as stroke and Parkinson’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">One emerging mechanism of action is their intrinsic immunomodulatory capacities. Although this has been partly investigated <italic>in vitro</italic>, whereby AECs suppress inflammatory responses in both innate and adaptive immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, the immune cell dynamics triggered by AECs after their transplantation <italic>in vivo</italic> remain poorly understood. How direct AEC exposure shapes the immune environment within the CNS is a significant concept, given the ongoing clinical trials with AECs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, including treatment of neurological diseases that often requires direct delivery into the CNS. A detailed characterization of AEC-based immunomodulation in the CNS is therefore essential to understand their mechanisms of action and to ensure safe and effective clinical application. Herein we demonstrate that AEC delivery into the brain mobilizes the influx of immunosuppressive ARG1<sup>+</sup> macrophages and a population of previously unrecognized myeloid-derived suppressor cells with eosinophilic characteristics, which we term Eo-MDSCs. By testing this premise in the mouse model of MS, we demonstrate that AEC-induced immunological response modulates T cell activity, promotes myelin phagocytosis and reduces spinal cord inflammation, ultimately leading to functional recovery.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>AEC suppress proinflammatory immune responses <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P5">We first validated the immunomodulatory function of AECs on primary macrophages and microglia. The phenotype of AECs was confirmed by their expression of HLA-G, K8/18 (keratinocyte marker) and CD55 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). Proinflammatory cytokines were analysed in AEC-preconditioned microglia or control microglia challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/IFNγ for 24 hours. The qPCR analysis revealed that AEC-preconditioning reduced the expression of proinflammatory genes such as <italic>Il6, Tnfα</italic> and inducible nitric oxidase (<italic>Inos</italic>) in microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The reduction of IL-6 and TNFα was verified at the protein level using a cytokine bead array (CBA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, IL-10 levels were increased following AEC treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P6">We next examined the capacity of AECs to reduce inflammatory responses in LPS-stimulated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). As expected, AEC treatment decreased the gene expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β, while the expression of Arginase 1 (<italic>Arg1</italic>), a marker of immunosuppressive macrophages, was markedly increased at gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). The increase in ARG1 was confirmed in human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) following AEC treatment, suggesting a conserved immunosuppressive response by macrophages to AEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Based on these results, we hypothesized that intracisternal (i.c.) delivery of AECs would lead to clinical recovery in a mouse model of neuroinflammation.</p><p id="P7">We first delivered PHK206-labelled AECs i.c. and detected them in the brain borders, including the ventricles, both at 3h and 3 days post injection (p.i.)

Subsequently, we examined the therapeutic impact of AEC on established neurological MS-like disease. When each mouse had developed an EAE disease score of ≥1 they received AEC injections every other day, 4 injections in total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). AEC therapy significantly reduced the macroscopic signs of clinical disease in both female and male mice, as indicated by reduced cumulative EAE scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H and 1I</xref>). Taken together these data demonstrate that AECs are efficient in reducing inflammation <italic>in vitro</italic> and therapeutically ameliorating symptoms of already established MS-like disease <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Intracisternal AEC delivery induces CNS influx of immunosuppressive myeloid cells</title><p id="P8">We next examined the immunosuppressive immune responses elicited by AECs in the brain. We first analysed myeloid phenotypes in the brain at EAE peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). AEC treatment substantially increased the numbers of myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-2D</xref>, gating strategy <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>) that consisted of monocytes, macrophages and a population of highly granular (HG) cells which were unique to AEC-treated brains. This immunological response was local in the brain and absent in the spleen, blood, bone marrow (BM) and skull BM at the time of EAE peak (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D, S2</xref>). HG myeloid cells characterized by the signature side-scatter (SSC)<sup>high</sup>F4/80<sup>lo</sup>MHCII<sup>lo</sup> expressed Ly6C but not Ly6G, which phenotypically excludes them as being neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). Using Giemsa staining we observed that most HG cells had ring-shaped nuclei, with some containing cytoplasmic granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). We performed scRNAseq on sorted HG cells to define their transcriptional signature. We analysed 2858 HG cells sorted from the brain as SSC<sup>high</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup> (PBS-treated: 917 cells; average genes 2226, AEC-treated: 1941 cells; average genes 1344) and identified five distinct HG clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F and 2G</xref>).</p><p id="P9">HG1 and HG5 consisted of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>), and HG5 had reduced expression of genes such as <italic>Lsp1, Lrg1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>), which are linked to neutrophil chemotaxis and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Overall, neutrophil proportions were not affected by AEC treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>). HG3 belonged to the monocyte/macrophage lineage and expressed <italic>Ly6c2, Cd14, Csf1r</italic>, and <italic>Adgre1</italic> (<bold>Table 1</bold>) with high expression of <italic>Arg1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). HG4 was a small cluster reminiscent of microglia, expressing genes such as <italic>Tmem119, P2ry12, Sall1</italic> and <italic>Hexb</italic> (<bold>Table 1</bold>). We focused on HG2, which was exclusive to AEC-treated brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). Using arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15) immunostaining, a top gene expressed in HG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>), we identified that HG2 consisted of cells with ring-shaped nuclei with variable Ly6C expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I and 2J</xref>), in accordance with the FACS data. Since HG2 have similar morphology and low RNA content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>) as immature neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and eosinophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, we compared the transcriptome of HG2 to the genomic signature of the respective immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Our analysis revealed that the HG2 transcriptome had more overlap with eosinophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>) than with neutrophils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). Furthermore, Single Cell Regulatory Network Inference and Clustering (SCENIC) analysis identified Rfx1, a transcription factor involved in eosinophil development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, to have higher regulon activity in HG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2L</xref>). Immature myeloid cells are also MDSCs, so we therefore compared the HG2 transcriptome with previously published polymorphonuclear (PMN) and monocytic (M) MDSC signatures. Our analysis revealed little overlap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3D and S3E</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, suggesting that HG2 are immature myeloid cells or MDSCs with eosinophilic features, which have not been described previously.</p><p id="P10">Given the high expression of ALOX15 in HG, we assessed ALOX15 metabolites in sorted HG cells using lipidomics, using microglia as controls. Interestingly, levels of Maresin 2 (MaR2), a specialized pro-resolving lipid mediator (SPM) with proven anti-inflammatory function, and 8(s)-15(s)-DiHETE, a chemoattractant for eosinophils, were higher in HG cells compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2M</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Altogether, we demonstrate that intracisternal delivery of AECs increases immunosuppressive myeloid cells in the brain characterized by <italic>Arg1</italic><sup>+</sup> monocytes and a novel anti-inflammatory MDSC population, Eo-MDSCs.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>AEC treatment transiently recruits myeloid cells into the CNS</title><p id="P12">We next performed immunostaining to localize ARG1<sup>+</sup> macrophages and Eo-MDSCs in the brain at peak of EAE disease. ARG1<sup>+</sup> macrophages were only noted sporadically, if at all, in PBS-treated brains. However, in AEC-treated brains the numbers of ARG1<sup>+</sup> macrophages were remarkably increased, mainly localizing to brain barriers including the meninges, ventricles, and in subependymal areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3F</xref>) and choroid plexi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), hereafter collectively referred to as ‘brain borders’. Morphologically, ARG1<sup>+</sup> macrophages were distinct from ARG1<sup>-</sup> counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3G</xref>). ALOX15<sup>+</sup> Eo-MDSCs were also identified within the brain borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3H</xref>). The accumulation of these immunosuppressive myeloid cells in the meninges may have a disease-modifying impact as meningeal inflammation correlates with relapses and a severe disease course<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">We next asked whether the influx of these myeloid cells in the CNS is driven by the release of cytokines and chemokines in brain borders following AEC administration. To this end, we isolated the leptomeninges and choroid plexus for bulk RNAseq at 6h (immediate response), 1 or 3 days p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). After 6h, only five genes were significantly upregulated, whereas this number was 320 and 147 genes after 1 and 3 days p.i., respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). The number of downregulated genes was low at all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). As expected, AEC treatment increased the expression of monocyte transcripts <italic>Lyz2, Ccr2</italic>, and <italic>Ly6c2</italic> and their attracting chemokines <italic>Ccl2, Ccl12, Ccl22</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Arg1</italic> expression was already elevated by day 1 p.i. and persisted through to day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). The Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated enrichment related to myeloid migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H, 3I</xref>). Pharmacological inhibition of CCR2 significantly attenuated AEC-induced influx of monocytes, demonstrating CCR2-driven recruitment of monocytes into the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J, 3K</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Having established that AEC treatment drives the influx of immunosuppressive myeloid cells, we then investigated how long these cells remain in the brain. We analysed brain myeloid responses at 2, 7 or 16 days post-AEC injection using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3L</xref>). Control naïve mice received PBS instead of AECs. We observed an influx of monocytes peaking at 2 days p.i., and a subset of these monocytes (Ly6C<sup>+</sup>) expressed ARG1<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3M, 3N, 3O</xref>). By day 7, the numbers of ARG1<sup>+</sup> monocytes declined, but instead the numbers of ARG1<sup>+</sup> macrophages (F4/80<sup>+</sup>) peaked, indicating a monocyte-to-macrophage maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3M, 3N, 3O</xref>). The kinetics of ALOX15<sup>+</sup> Eo-MDSCs were different. At day 2 p.i. highly granular cells were absent, but they peaked at day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3M</xref>), with a concomitant increase in ALOX15<sup>+</sup> Eo-MDSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3M, 3N</xref>). By day 16, the numbers of both ALOX15<sup>+</sup> Eo-MDSCs and ARG1<sup>+</sup> macrophages declined to basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3O</xref>). We confirmed this in EAE brains at the end of the observation period, with the numbers of ARG1<sup>+</sup> macrophages being comparable between AEC and PBS groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3I</xref>) and in naïve mice that received 3 AEC injections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3J, S3K, S3L</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Taken together, our data indicate that AEC therapy induces a transient accumulation of ARG1<sup>+</sup> macrophages and ALOX15<sup>+</sup> Eo-MDSCs in the brain, creating a temporally restricted immunosuppressive milieu, particularly at the brain borders, capable of modulating neuroinflammatory processes.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Intracisternally delivered AECs reprogram monocytes towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype</title><p id="P16">We next investigated how the influx of AEC-induced myeloid cells impacts neuroinflammation during EAE.

After quality control, 30677 cells (PBS: 15906 cells; average genes 2129, AEC: 14777 cells; average genes 2191) were analysed.

While the <italic>prophylactic</italic> effects of AEC treatment have previously been reported in EAE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, we significantly extend these studies and demonstrate that myeloid cells are the primary responders to i.c. treatment with AECs.</p><p id="P30">In neuroinflammatory diseases such as MS, myeloid cells are implicated in causing injury to the CNS but also in promoting tissue repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, a dichotomous response governed by different myeloid activation states. Our study demonstrates that AEC therapy, by modulating myeloid cell function in the CNS, has the potential to target multiple pathological processes in MS. Firstly, broad rim lesions enriched with iNOS<sup>+</sup> macrophages correlate with progression in MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Since ARG1 and iNOS compete for the same substrate, AEC-induced ARG1<sup>+</sup> macrophages have the capacity to directly counteract the proinflammatory effects of iNOS<sup>+</sup> macrophages, thereby targeting pathogenic processes. Secondly, ARG1<sup>+</sup> macrophages are known to increase in numbers during the resolution phase of EAE to promote tissue repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>, and enhanced phagocytosis is one underlying mechanism. Our data suggest that through enhanced myelin debris clearance, a critical step required for efficient remyelination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>, AEC-induced immunosuppressive macrophages have the potential to promote remyelination processes in the CNS. Finally, these immunosuppressive macrophages can have protective function by counteracting the excessive MS inflammation driven by T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>17 cells. We observed a significant reduction of pathogenic T cell responses. T cell-derived TNFα promotes the activation and infiltration of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages and autoreactive T cells in the CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. However, TNFα produced by other cells can have beneficial functions as blocking TNFα leads to detrimental outcomes in both MS patients and in EAE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. That AEC treatment specifically attenuated T cell-derived TNFα and modified their interactions with myeloid cells suggest that AEC therapy effectively targets pathogenic MS mechanisms. Furthermore, locally produced IL-4 in the brain effectively ameliorates EAE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, probably by driving immunosuppressive macrophage polarization.</p><p id="P31">Induction of Eo-MDSCs in the brain is an interesting feature of AEC therapy. We demonstrate that these cells produce MaR2, a SPM which has not been previously studied in EAE, but which promotes the resolution of inflammation in other settings. However, MaR1, which is similar to MaR2, reduces neuroinflammation and increases numbers of Tregs in EAE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>, suggesting overlapping mechanisms. Due to the lack of specific markers and their shared features with other myeloid cells, the specific role of MDSCs in MS may have been overlooked.

The ambiguity of MDSC function in MS might thus reflect their heterogeneity, where the functional state of MDSCs and the stage of the disease in which they appear may dictate the outcome. In a therapeutic context, glatiramer acetate, which has been used for treating relapsing-remitting MS, induces M-MDSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. However, Eo-MDSCs have never been reported before in any MS context.

These cells secrete maresin 2 (MaR2), a specialized pro-resolving mediator involved in resolution of inflammation. In EAE mice with established diseases, this AEC-induced immunological response modulates T cell responses by increasing polarization towards T<sub>H</sub>2 and T<sub>regs</sub> while decreasing the pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>17 subsets.
