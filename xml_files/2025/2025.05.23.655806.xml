Impaired autophagy associated with pathogenic variants in <italic>EPG5</italic> cause a rare devastating multisystem disorder known as Vici syndrome, which includes neurodevelopmental defects, severe progressive neurodegeneration and immunodeficiency. The pathophysiological mechanisms driving disease presentation and progression are not understood. In patient-derived fibroblasts and iPS cells differentiated to cortical neurons, we found that impaired mitophagy leads to mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction. Physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals resulted in paradoxical mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload attributed to downregulation of MICU1/3. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals caused mitochondrial depolarisation, mtDNA release and activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, reversed by pharmacological inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) or of the STING pathway. Thus, we have identified multiple potential therapeutic targets driving disease progression associated with pathogenic EPG5 mutations, including impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload, vulnerability to mPTP opening and activation of innate immune signalling.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>EPG5</italic>-Related Disorder</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial calcium</kwd><kwd>mPTP</kwd><kwd>excitotoxicity</kwd><kwd>mtDNA</kwd><kwd>STING-IFN signalling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved, fundamental intracellular homeostatic process with essential roles in metabolic adaptation, defence against infections and the quality control of defective proteins and organelles including mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Klionsky et al., 2021</xref>). Ectopic P-granules 5 autophagy tethering factor (EPG5), initially reported in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, functions as a tethering protein in concert with specific SNARE complexes to facilitate specific fusion events between autophagosomes and lysosomes and the formation of degradative autolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Tian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Hori et al., 2017</xref>). Recessive mutations in human EPG5 cause a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders termed as <italic>EPG5</italic>-related disorders (<italic>EPG5</italic>-RD) ranging from the severe early-onset multisystem disorder Vici syndrome to relatively milder neurodevelopmental manifestations with progressive neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Cullup et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Byrne et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Dafsari et al., 2022</xref>). Vici syndrome patients are characterized by the key diagnostic features of microcephaly, callosal agenesis, cataracts, hypopigmentation, cardiomyopathy, (combined) immunodeficiency and failure to thrive, followed by severe progressive neurodegeneration with a median life expectancy of approximately 24 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Byrne et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Deneubourg et al., 2022</xref>). While most bi-allelic loss-of-function EPG5 mutations are associated with Vici syndrome, pathogenic missense variants in <italic>EPG5</italic> can lead to less severe clinical presentations. An attenuated EPG5 function is predicted to underlie the phenotypic variability seen in <italic>EPG5</italic>-RD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Vansenne et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dafsari et al., 2024</xref>). However, it is unclear whether the residual function of pathogenic <italic>EPG5</italic> variants correlates directly to a corresponding defect in autophagy alone or if other downstream cellular processes are also disrupted. Interestingly, preliminary observations indicate an increased frequency of adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders in (putative) heterozygous <italic>EPG5</italic> variant carriers, suggesting a potential dosage effect.</p><p id="P4">A previous study has reported that the histopathological appearance of <italic>EPG5</italic>-related Vici syndrome, often including marked ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormalities and decreased respiratory chain enzyme activity, may mimic primary mitochondrial disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">McClelland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Byrne et al., 2016b</xref>) and some patients have been suspected to have a mitochondrial cytopathy before the causative pathogenic <italic>EPG5</italic> variants were genetically confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Balasubramaniam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Waldrop et al., 2018</xref>).

Impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism has been recognized as a key factor in the pathogenesis of many common adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Duchen and Szabadkai, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Schon and Przedborski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Area-Gomez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Chu, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Suomalainen and Nunnari, 2024</xref>). Mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from impaired mitochondrial quality control can lead to impaired ATP homeostasis, oxidative stress, impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering and altered mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling, all of which contribute to neuronal dysfunction and cell death characteristic of many neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Duchen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Devine and Kittler, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Boyman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Plotegher et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Mitochondria actively maintain neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis through Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and efflux pathways during physiological cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub>) signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Rizzuto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Plotegher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Verma et al., 2022</xref>).

A rise in mitochondrial matrix [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>) increases the rate of TCA cycle-driven NADH generation and the rate of oxidative ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Duchen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Jouaville et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Denton, 2009</xref>).

Supraphysiological accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, however, can trigger the opening of a large conductance channel in the IMM, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), resulting in the collapse of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>, ATP hydrolysis by the F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub> ATPase and mitochondrial osmotic swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Brenner and Moulin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bhosale et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Briston et al., 2019</xref>).

However, evidence for a specific mechanism driving aberrant mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory response is scarce and poorly understood.</p><p id="P8">Our recent findings point towards mitochondrial dysfunction and the failure of autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria allowing progressive accumulation of mitochondrial defects as a major factor underlying the neurodegenerative disease and inflammatory dysregulation seen in patients with Vici syndrome and other <italic>EPG5</italic>-RDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dafsari et al., 2024</xref>). We now identify impaired mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis as the causative mechanism for mtDNA-driven STING-type I IFN inflammatory response in patient-derived fibroblasts with truncating and missense <italic>EPG5</italic> variants. iPSC-derived cortical neurons carrying a founder <italic>EPG5</italic> pathogenic variant showed increased sensitivity to excitotoxicity in response to low concentrations of glutamate that were innocuous in control cells, with responses characterised by mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload, delayed calcium deregulation (DCD), loss of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> and neuronal cell death. We demonstrate that impaired mitochondrial bioenergetic function and Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload found in patient-derived cells and <italic>EPG5</italic> mutant neurons were attributable to the downregulation of MICU1 and increased susceptibility to mPTP opening. Remarkably, pharmacological inhibition of mPTP opening attenuated inflammatory signals and rescued mitochondrial bioenergetic function in patient-derived cells and <italic>EPG5</italic> mutant neurons. These findings highlight a key pathophysiological mechanism in Vici syndrome and other <italic>EPG5</italic>-RD and signpost potential therapeutic strategies for the rapidly expanding clinical and genetic spectrum of patients with <italic>EPG5</italic>- and other autophagy-related disorders.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mitochondrial bioenergetic function is impaired in patient-derived fibroblasts bearing pathogenic EPG5 mutations</title><p id="P9">To characterise the impact of pathogenic EPG5 mutations on mitochondrial metabolism and bioenergetic function, we examined human dermal fibroblasts derived from patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) either carrying homozygous missense mutations (p.Gln336Arg, p.Arg1621Gln, hereafter referred to as patient 1 and patient 2 respectively) or compound heterozygous and homozygous truncating mutations (p.Arg299*/Pro1827Ala, p.Phe1604Glyfs*20, hereafter referred to as patient 3 and patient 4 respectively) as well as healthy control cell lines from donors matched for age and sex.

Quantitative analysis of mitochondrial volume occupancy by co-labelling the cells with Calcein AM, to measure cytosolic area, showed no change between the cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>).

Morphometric analysis of TMRM-labelled mitochondria showed that a large proportion of the mitochondrial network was fragmented while a small pool showed swollen morphology in patient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). To investigate the cause of the reduced ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> in patient fibroblasts, we measured the redox state of the NADH pool, the main substrate for the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). The resting level of NADH autofluorescence was quantified through the experimental determination of the “redox index,” a ratio of the signal representing the maximally oxidized pool (response to 1 μM FCCP) and the maximally reduced pool (the response to 1 mM NaCN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E</xref>). Patient fibroblasts exhibited a significant increase in the NADH redox state (i.e. less oxidised NADH/more reduced NAD<sup>+</sup>) in comparison to control cells, suggesting an impaired function of the mitochondrial ETC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>) consistent with the previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Byrne et al., 2016b</xref>).

As mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is potential-dependent, we investigated whether impaired mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake due to the reduced ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> might amplify the bioenergetic defect in the patient cells. We therefore measured the mitochondrial matrix [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> response in control and patient cells expressing mitochondrial-targeted aequorin following a challenge with 10 µM histamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).

This striking finding suggested that the increase in histamine-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> in patient fibroblasts could be due to altered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> content and ER-mitochondria proximity or dysregulation of the MCU/NCLX complex.

Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling directly impacts TCA cycle intermediates by the allosteric activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (αKGDH).

Alternatively, limited mPTP opening in a subset of damaged mitochondria may lead to a chronic low-grade innate inflammatory response.

After glutamate challenge, Q336R neurons showed a marked increase in TOM20 intensity without Cyt c intensity suggesting Cyt c release in comparison to isogenic control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7N</xref>). Notably, Q336R neurons also showed an aberrant remodelling of mitochondrial morphology accompanied by a significant increase in swollen mitochondria pool in the somas and a more fragmented form in the axons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8K</xref>).

Given that the pharmacological inhibition of mPTP in patient fibroblasts suppresses mtDNA-induced IFN response and partially restores mitochondrial bioenergetic function, we first determined mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> retention capacity of neurons which were digitonin permeabilised after co-labelling with Fluo-4 AM (which is lost from the cytosol but retained in mitochondria after permeabilization (McKenzie et al., 2017) and TMRM to monitor dynamic changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> and ΔΨ<sub>m,</sub> respectively, using sequential additions of exogenous CaCl<sub>2</sub> as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9A</xref>. The highest fold-change in Fluo-4 intensity was evident only after the fourth successive Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition (6.91 µM final Ca<sup>2+</sup>) in permeabilised isogenic neurons, indicating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake threshold and cooperative activation of MCU by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>). Subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition (13.3 µM final Ca<sup>2+</sup>) induced permeability transition culminating in the collapse of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> as indicated by the rapid loss of the TMRM signal. In contrast, mitochondria from Q336R neurons showed an almost linear increase in Fluo-4 intensity with successive Ca<sup>2+</sup> additions indicating a lower threshold for activation and a constitutively active MCU complex. As a consequence of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> overload, mPTP opening and rapid dissipation of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> was observed at lower concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (between 1.32 and 3.28 µM) in the Q336R cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>). Notably, the preincubation of Q336R mitochondria with JP1-138 significantly increased the threshold of mPTP opening and the loss of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> without affecting the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake indicating the protective effect of JP1-138 from [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> overload-induced mPTP opening and mitochondrial depolarisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A-B</xref>). To demonstrate this under (patho)physiological state, isogenic and Q336R neurons were loaded with Rhodamine-123 in ‘dequench mode’ to monitor time-dependent changes in ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> following exposure to glutamate. After an initial transient depolarization indicated by an early rise in fluorescence in response to glutamate, ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> recovered to the baseline in almost all the isogenic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8C and 8F</xref>). In contrast, Q336R neurons showed a delayed secondary depolarisation in the majority of the neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8D</xref>), coincident with the glutamate-induced DCD response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abramov and Duchen, 2008</xref>). Moreover, an uncoupler-induced mitochondrial depolarization caused a smaller additional depolarization in comparison to isogenic neurons confirming near total dissipation of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> induced by glutamate in the Q336R neurons. Importantly, preincubation with JP1-138 completely protected the Q336R neurons from glutamate-induced collapse of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8E-G</xref>). To determine the bioenergetic differences under unstimulated resting state, we measured basal and maximal respiration in isogenic and Q336R neurons. Both ATP-linked respiration rate and spare respiratory capacity were reduced in Q336R neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8H</xref>). However, long-term treatment with JP1-138 resulted in a small but significant increase in both basal and maximal respiration rate in Q336R neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8I-J</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that JP1-138 effectively increases mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering capacity and protects Q336R neurons from glutamate-induced loss of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>, and improves mitochondrial respiration, thus highlighting a potential therapeutic strategy to target neurodegeneration in <italic>EPG5</italic>-related disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">Whilst defective autophagy has been identified as a key mechanism in <italic>EPG5</italic>-related disorders, downstream pathogenic effects remain poorly understood.

Although the mechanism of MCU remodelling in patient fibroblasts and EPG5 mutant neurons defined by downregulation of MICUs and EMRE protein levels has not been investigated here, it seems likely that stress-induced activity of quality control proteases in IMM may control the protein turnover of MCU regulatory subunits. Proteostasis stress driven by impaired mitophagy may lead to the processing of DELE1 by OMA1 protease, culminating in activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Uoselis et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">Yamada et al., 2025</xref>) as evident by the ISR signature from RNA-seq data in patient fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).

In contrast, limited or selective opening of mPTP, a feature also evident during histamine-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> overload in patient fibroblasts, may cause insufficient damage to lead to cell death, but enable the release of mtDNA into the cytosol, where it triggers the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, driving an inflammatory IFN response. This protective inflammatory program could be constitutively driven by patient fibroblasts in a chronic low-grade manner that maintains proliferation and evades acute cell death. A recent study described a similar process termed minority mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (miMOMP) where MOMP occurring in a subset of mitochondria enables mtDNA efflux through BAK/BAX macropores and activates the cGAS-STING pathway to drive age-associated inflammation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Ichim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Victorelli et al., 2023</xref>).

The exposure to glutamate at concentrations that are innocuous for isogenic neurons caused a rapid collapse of bioenergetic capacity, disruption of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> homeostasis and excitotoxic death in Q336R neurons. Glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in Q336R neurons is attributed to a lower mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake threshold and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> overload which combined with increased ROS production leads to increased susceptibility to mPTP opening caused by downregulation of MICU1/3 holocomplex and a constitutively active MCU complex. Thus, an increased bioenergetic demand during neuronal metabolic workload may amplify the compromised mitochondrial function due to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> overload and trigger a rapid pathological cascade culminating in cell death. Our data demonstrate that an impaired mitochondrial metabolism and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling sensitises neurons to excitotoxic injury which may play an important role in neurodegeneration in <italic>EPG5</italic>-RD and may also contribute to epileptogenesis observed in around two-thirds of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Deneubourg et al., 2025</xref>).
