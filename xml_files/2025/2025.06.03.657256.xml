PLIN4 contains a giant (≈ 1000 aa) amphipathic helix, which folds on the LD surface and can substitute for phospholipids, thereby regulating LD surface tension. This region of PLIN4 is arranged in tandem repeats of 33 aa. Genetic expansion of this region is associated with skeletal muscle dysfunction in patients suffering from a late-onset vacuolar myopathy (MRUPAV). We demonstrate that purified fragments of the PLIN4 repetitive region form amyloid fibrils as characterized by cryo-EM and atomic force microscopy. The MRUPAV mutation drastically increases the kinetics of fibril formation and induces aggregation in budding yeast. The propensity to aggregate depends on the number of identical repeats and their sequence, and is strongly attenuated by the presence of lipid droplets, suggesting putative intervention strategies and an explanation for the observed tissue bias of the disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Perilipin</kwd><kwd>lipid droplet</kwd><kwd>amyloid</kwd><kwd>genetic expansion</kwd><kwd>coding repeats</kwd><kwd>degenerative disease</kwd><kwd>myopathy</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Many degenerative diseases are associated with protein aggregation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Protein aggregates can be amorphous or forming an ordered phase, with the most highly ordered aggregates presenting as amyloid fibrils, where protein units are stacked within a highly stable cross-β fold. Some well-known examples of amyloid forming proteins include α-synuclein, Aβ protein, tau and huntingtin protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Amyloid fibrils represent an alternative conformation, which can be adopted by the wild-type protein and may be promoted by genetic mutations. For example, wild-type α-synuclein is found accumulated in the dense clusters termed Lewy bodies in the brains of patients for which Parkinson’s disease is associated with ageing. However, early-onset familial form of the disease is linked to genetic mutations in α-synuclein that can promote its aggregation <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Atomic structures of amyloid fibrils have been determined and show how amino-acid residues are stacked in the cross-β fold <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Only specific segments of amyloid forming proteins are engaged in the amyloid core, ranging from 15 to 199 amino acids (aa), representing 5 to 100% of the total protein sequence length <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Many amyloid-forming protein regions are repetitive in nature, and repetitive sequences are more likely to form amyloids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. For example, the amyloid-forming region (AR) of α-synuclein contains imperfect 11-aa repeats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Another well-known example is tau protein, whose AR is comprised of 4 microtubule-binding repeats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Splicing produces 3 or 4 repeat variants that have different aggregation propensities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In the case of huntingtin protein, its AR is comprised of poly-Q repeats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Genetic mutations that result in the expansion of the poly-Q region lead to huntingtin disease, and the severity of the disease is linked to the length of the poly-Q expansion.</p><p id="P4">A rare progressive distal myopathy that leads to loss of skeletal muscle was first described in 2004 in a large multi-generation family <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and was termed MRUPAV, for “myopathy with rimmed ubiquitin-positive autophagic vacuolation” (MIM #601846). Distal myopathies are genetically-diverse diseases, often characterized by the presence of protein aggregates in muscle fibers or defects in protein folding or aggregate clearance pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. A. Ruggieri and colleagues have recently shown that this autosomal dominant disease is linked to a large coding expansion in <italic>PLIN4</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. In muscle biopsies of patients carrying the <italic>PLIN4</italic> expansion, perilipin 4 (PLIN4) is the most abundant protein that accumulates in protein-dense enlarged vacuoles and is also observed in subsarcolemmal aggregates that are positive for ubiquitin and autophagy markers p62 and NBR1, suggesting activation of the aggrephagy pathway for aggregate clearance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. PLIN4 contains an unusually long central repetitive region, composed of about 30 highly conserved 33-aa repeats, which bear similarity to the 11-aa repeat region of α-synuclein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. The coding expansion identified in MRUPAV patients results in additional 33-aa repeats in the repetitive region <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. The high repetitiveness of the corresponding DNA region and lack of any nucleotide change in the genetic expansion explains why this mutation was so difficult to identify. Furthermore, MRUPAV patients exhibit clinical symptoms similar to other vacuolar myopathies. Nevertheless, additional families with muscular degeneration linked to <italic>PLIN4</italic> expansion have recently been reported, with one family carrying an even longer expansion, linked to an earlier disease onset and more proximal muscle involvement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">PLIN4 belongs to the family of perilipins, which are the most abundant proteins on the surface of lipid droplets (LDs) – cellular organelles dedicated to the storage of energy in the form of neutral lipids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. LDs are prominent in myofibrils and provide energy for muscle contraction. Their number and properties can vary in disease states, such as type II diabetes, or with training <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. PLIN4 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and in adipocyte cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Whereas perilipins are generally considered as regulators of LD metabolism, the molecular function of PLIN4 remains enigmatic. Recent evidence suggests that PLIN4 is important for regulation of LD stability, in particular during increased LD production <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. On a population level, analysis of whole-exome sequencing data from a large cohort shows that loss-of-function mutations in <italic>PLIN4</italic> correlate with unfavorable body fat distribution and metabolic profiles in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. These studies point to an important role of PLIN4 in the regulation of cellular lipid metabolism.</p><p id="P6">We have previously shown that the repetitive region of PLIN4 directly interacts with the LD surface and is required for PLIN4 targeting in cells, where PLIN4 can be found both in the cytosol and on LDs. The repetitive region is disordered in solution and it folds into an amphipathic helix in contact with the LD surface, with which it interacts in a length-dependent manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Amphipathic helices are common in proteins that interact with LDs. However, PLIN4 is unique in the size and highly repetitive nature of its amphipathic helix sequence. Interestingly, the much shorter and imperfectly-repetitive region of α-synuclein, which forms amyloid fibrils, has also been shown to target LDs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. LDs have been observed in vicinity of α-synuclein aggregates and are generally implicated in protein quality control <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Here, we explore the molecular mechanism of the <italic>PLIN4</italic>-linked myopathy. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches with purified fragments of PLIN4, we show that the PLIN4 repetitive region is prone to forming amyloid fibrils, and that this propensity is drastically increased by the genetic expansion, which increases the number of identical 33-aa repeats in PLIN4. It is precisely these identical repeats that promote amyloid formation in solution, and the effect is further promoted by a decrease in the interaction with LDs. We therefore propose that the genetic expansion carried by the MRUPAV patients represents a gain-of-function mutation that promotes the aggregation of PLIN4, interfering with muscle contraction. In agreement with this hypothesis, we don’t observe a significant effect of the genetic expansion on the behavior of PLIN4 repetitive region in solution or on its interaction with LDs in cells or <italic>in vitro</italic>. Understanding the aberrant nature of PLIN4 fibrils may open the door towards design of specific treatments for the affected patients, and also promote our understanding of the interplay between lipid metabolism and amyloid-based degenerative disorders.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Fragments of PLIN4 can form fibrils in solution</title><p id="P8">Human PLIN4 (Uniprot Q96Q06) contains a long repetitive region composed of 29 x 33-aa repeats, flanked by a disordered N-terminal region and a folded C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The protein has a narrow expression profile, mostly restricted to highly-differentiated cells such as mature adipocytes, skeletal muscle and breast tissue <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. In cultured cells, it can be observed in the cytosol or on LDs; in cultured adipocytes, it is recruited to LDs after exogenous addition of fatty acids to burst LD production <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. The central repetitive region of PLIN4 is required for the interaction with LDs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">We previously purified fragments of the repetitive region of PLIN4 and demonstrated that they were unfolded in solution and folded into an amphipathic helix in contact with a lipid surface <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. This amphipathic helix can replace phospholipids on the surface of LDs and form stable lipid particles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Unexpectedly, when we incubated purified PLIN4-20mer, comprising 20 x 33-aa repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), at room temperature for a prolonged time (&gt; 1 week) and at a high protein concentration (1.5 mg/ml), followed by negative stain electron microscopy (EM), we could observe filaments with a regular appearance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). The finding of A Ruggieri and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> that an elongated PLIN4 accumulates in the muscle tissue of patients with the MRUPAV vacuolar myopathy, possibly representing PLIN4 aggregates, prompted us to re-evaluate the formation of PLIN4 fibrils under controlled conditions.</p><p id="P10">We started by purifying a fragment of wild-type PLIN4, termed 12mer[260:], comprising the region of PLIN4 starting aa 260 (numbering Uniprot Q96Q06) and containing 12 x 33-aa repeats (396 aa). The first three repeats in this region are expanded 3 times in MRUPAV patients due to the genetically-encoded expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B</xref>). We incubated the purified protein at different concentrations at 37°C under agitation in the presence of ThioflavinT (ThT), a fluorescent compound whose intrinsic fluorescence drastically increases after intercalation into protein fibrils (amyloids) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. We observed a large and concentration-dependent increase in ThT fluorescence over the course of several days. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). For comparison, we used a previously purified PLIN4-12mer fragment comprising a region of the same length downstream of 12mer[260:], now renamed PLIN4-12mer[524:] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Under the same conditions, this fragment showed almost no increase in ThT fluorescence even at the highest concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We next assessed the formation of fibrils using a pelleting assay and observed a good correlation with the ThT assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>): before incubation, both proteins remained in the supernatant, whereas after incubation at 37°C for 100 h, ~10% of 12mer[260:] at 0.25 mg/ml and ~50% of 12mer[260:] at 1 mg/ml were found in the pellet fraction. In contrast, 12mer[524:] at 1 mg/ml remained soluble. Analysis of protein samples after ThT incubation by negative-stain EM consistently revealed abundant and uniform fibrils formed by 12mer[260:] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). For 12mer[524:] we could observe fibrils in only one experiment, following a prolonged incubation at a high protein concentration (2 mg/ml, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the repetitive region of wild-type PLIN4 is prone to fibril formation, in particular the region comprising the repeats that are multiplied in MRUPAV patients.</p><p id="P11">Given the different behaviors of the two 12mer fragments in our aggregation assays, we asked whether they differ in their secondary structure in solution. By circular dichroism (CD), both fragments display spectra typical for unstructured proteins, whereas they show a strong shift to α-helical spectra in the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol (TFE), as previously shown for 12mer[524:] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In agreement, both fragments are highly susceptible to limited proteolysis by subtilisin, which is indicative of high exposure of peptide bonds all along the sequence, i.e., lack of tertiary structure. By contrast, both fragments become more resistant to proteolysis by the addition of liposomes, indicating their folding on the liposome surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Of note, these liposomes contain diphytanyl phospholipids with branched acyl chains that promote PLIN4-12mer binding to bilayers. We have previously shown PLIN4-12mer shows weak affinity towards standard bilayers due to its low hydrophobicity, and instead preferentially localizes to LDs in cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. We conclude that the different aggregation propensities of the PLIN4 repetitive region are not due to differences in their structure in solution or their ability to fold into a α-helix.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Structural analysis reveals that PLIN4 fibrils are amyloids</title><p id="P12">To determine the characteristics of the fibrils formed by PLIN4 repetitive region, we analyzed the 12mer[260:] fibrils by cryo-EM and atomic force microscopy (AFM) in liquid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The cryo-EM analysis of vitrified plin4 fibrils allows extraction of 20.000 filament segments. Segments were boxed into 788x788 ti squares and aligned with Relion4 helical module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Two main classes were identified, thin and thick filaments. The pattern analysis of filaments by Fourier transform unequivocally shows that PLIN4 fibrils are amyloid in nature, as revealed by the 4.77 ti amyloid spacing which is the signature of a cross-β pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. However, despite the high quality of our cryo-EM data, averaging revealed heterogeneity within the fibrils, suggesting that there might be different modes of stacking between the repeats of the 12mer[260:] PLIN4 fragment during amyloid growth. Observation of 12mer[260:] fibrils by AFM revealed typical amyloid fibrils heterogeneous in length, showing a left-handed periodic twist and a maximum height between 7 and 8 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Periodicity analysis by AFM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> revealed an average distribution around 60 nm, but with significant variations confirming the heterogeneity noted by CryoEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E-F</xref>). In addition, the height profiles show atypical variations suggesting gaps in the fibril structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Multiple scanning on single fibrils at relatively low setpoint (300 pN) eventually led to fibril disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>), which started with punctual deformations of the fibril axis, followed by breaks generating destructed ends with short sections around 3-4 nm in diameter. Careful examination of the induced breaks did not showed 2 identifiable fibrils, thus suggesting the formation of a single fibril formed by PLIN4-12mer[260:].</p><p id="P13">In summary, this structural analysis shows that the repetitive region of PLIN4 can form amyloid fibrils with variable periodicity and structural heterogeneity, and raises questions regarding how the 33-aa repeats of PLIN4 interact within the amyloid fibril.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Influence of PLIN4 repeat sequence and number on fibril formation</title><p id="P14">Having determined that PLIN4 repetitive region can form amyloid fibrils <italic>in vitro</italic>, we wanted to understand how the exact nature and organization of the 33-aa repeats influence amyloid fibril formation. In particular, we wondered if any feature of the extended version of PLIN4, present in the muscle fibrils of MRUPAV patients, would increase the propensity of the protein towards amyloid formation.</p><p id="P15">Comparison of the sequences of the 33-aa repeats of WT PLIN4 shows a high level of identity between the repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Overall, the repeats display unique aa composition, with some aa’s being highly over-represented (valine, glycine, threonine), under-represented (arginine, glutamic acid, phenylalanine) or completely absent (tryptophan, tyrosine, histidine) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Among all repeats, three consecutive repeats, r6, r7 &amp; r8 (aa260 – 358) are identical, and this is precisely where the mutant PLIN4 repeat-expansion occurs in the MRUPAV myopathy patients, resulting in 12 identical repeats and expanding the total length of the protein by 297 aa (9 x 33 aa repeats) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We first asked how the exact sequence of PLIN4 repeats influences amyloid formation. We used amyloid prediction algorithms ArchCandy2, Pasta and Tango, included in the TAPASS pipeline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, to determine the size and position of amyloidogenic regions (ARs) within the PLIN4 sequence. The majority of predicted ARs were identified within the repetitive region. Their median length was 27 aa, and their position matched the definition of the reading frame of the repeats, <italic>i.e</italic>., they mapped within the individual repeats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), meaning that these segments could form the amyloid core of PLIN4 fibrils. We then used ArchCandy 2 to predict the propensity of individual repeats to form amyloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The prediction is plotted as a heatmap for individual repeats and shows amyloid propensity varies between individual repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). To experimentally assess these results, we analyzed fibril formation in the ThT assay for three 33-aa synthetic peptides corresponding to three PLIN4 repeats with different amyloidogenic propensities (intermediate, high and low), 1mer[260:] (repeat r6 that is multiplied in patients), 1mer[656:] (r18) and 1mer[755:] (r21), respectively. We observed rapid fibril formation for 1mer[260:] with a very short lag phase, and the rate of fibril formation was even higher for 1mer[656:] at similar peptide concentrations. By contrast, 1mer[755:] did not show any increase in ThT signal even at the highest concentration (1 mg/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, we were not able to observe any fibrils formed by 1mer[260:] or 1mer[656:] by negative stain EM or by AFM, whereas large μm-sized particles could be observed by fluorescence microscopy after aggregation in the presence of ThT (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>). Rapid polymerization of these peptides may lead to anisotropic growth and formation of large clumps, which could even be observed by eye in the test tubes.</p><p id="P17">We also analyzed the formation of fibrils by longer fragments containing 4 repeats from different parts of the PLIN4 repetitive region, which were purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). Surprisingly, the fragment 4mer[260:], comprising PLIN4 region 260-523 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), aggregated with a similar kinetics as the single repeat 1mer[260:] at high protein concentration (0.5 mg/ml, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). This was despite its 4-times higher length, which we would expect to slow down the aggregation kinetics due to higher flexibility of the polypeptide chain, as was the case for 12mer[260:] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). However, in contrast to 1mer[260:], the aggregation kinetics of 4mer[260:] was largely concentration-independent and occured even at 20x lower protein concentration (0.03 mg/ml, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). Of note, unlike all other purified PLIN4 fragments used in these experiments, 4mer[260:] contains a T7 tag of 13 aa at its N-ter, which was introduced during cloning (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). This tag likely slightly inhibits the aggregation of this PLIN4 fragment (see the behavior of MBP-fusion constructs described in the next section. Other 4mer fragments (4mer[326:], 4mer[557:], and 4mer[689:]) aggregated with different kinetics that were more or less concentration dependent, with 4mer[557:] showing the most similar behavior to 4mer[260:], 4mer[326:] aggregating more slowly, and 4mer[689:] requiring a much higher concentration for robust aggregation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B-E</xref>). This data is in agreement with the prediction that individual repeats have different amyloidogenic propensities and shows that combination of different repeats can lead to variable outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Identical repeats in expanded PLIN4 strongly promote fibrillation</title><p id="P18">A unique feature of the region of the PLIN4 sequence that is expanded in MRUPAV patients is that it contains 3 identical repeats (r6-r8). These three identical repeats are represented by 1mer[260:], and all three are included in PLIN4-4mer[260:] and in PLIN4-12mer[260:]. The presence of identical repeats in this region could promote amyloid formation by prioritizing intra-molecular stacking. To test this hypothesis, we expressed and purified a 12mer fragment termed 12merMUT, which contains 9 identical repeats, <italic>i.e</italic>., 3-fold more than 12mer[260:] that represents the WT PLIN4 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A,B</xref>). Purified 12merMUT displayed an extremely fast aggregation kinetics, orders of magnitude faster than 12mer[260:], even at &gt;10-fold lower protein concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref> and S4C). Furthermore, we could detect aggregate formation already during purification of 12merMUT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A,B</xref>). Unlike for the 1mer peptides or 12mer[260:], aggregation kinetics of 12merMUT were similar over a range of concentrations. Furthermore, the ThT fluorescence signal displayed a high scatter, suggesting that the rapid polymerization could be leading to formation of large particles. Indeed, we could observe large (μm-sized) particles by fluorescent microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4D</xref>), whereas we were not able to detect any fibrils by EM or by AFM.</p><p id="P19">To circumvent the problem of rapid aggregation and obtain fibrils comprised of identical repeats, we prepared constructs where 2, 3 or 4 copies of 1mer[260:] were fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP), followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease restriction site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). The MBP tag increased the solubility of the tandem 33-aa identical repeats, and the fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography and tested in the ThT aggregation assay at different protein concentrations in the presence or absence of TEV to cleave off the N-terminal tag. As expected, at about the same mass concentration of each MBP construct, meaning the same concentration of the 33-aa repeat in each reaction, aggregation efficiency in the presence of TEV increased with the number of identical repeats in the same construct, <italic>i.e</italic>., from 2x to 4x (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). For the longest construct, MBP-4x1mer[260:], we observed aggregation by ThT fluorescence even in the absence of TEV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>, right panel). By negative stain EM, we could observe long fibrils in this sample (decorated with spherical buds), whereas in the +TEV sample, some shorter uniform fibrils were observed among more abundant and amorphous aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). No fibrils could be observed with the 2x or the 3x constructs. We obtained more abundant thick fibrils (~20 nm in diameter) when MBP-4x1mer[260:] was purified using a longer induction to augment protein concentration, and treatment of these fibrils with pronase to shave off MBP reduced their thickness (5-8 nm in diameter) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A and S5B</xref>). Analysis of the MBP-4x1mer[260:] fibrils by cryo-EM yielded a similar classification as for the 12mer[260:] fibrils, with thick and thin polymorphs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C and S5D</xref>), suggesting that these fibrils contain a similar functional folding unit. We conclude that multiplication of identical repeats within the same peptide promotes fibril formation, which can be slowed-down by a globular tag.</p><p id="P20">Based on these results, we propose that the multiplication of identical repeats in mutant PLIN4, expressed in skeletal muscle of myopathy patients, leads to more pronounced aggregation <italic>via</italic> intramolecular interactions that promote in-register β stacking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>). This model is in agreement with the large increase in aggregation kinetics when comparing two PLIN4 fragments of the same length (12 x 33 aa = 396 aa), where one contains three times more identical repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Furthermore, the model is supported by the observation that when we multiplied the number of identical repeats within the same peptide (from 2 to 4), the aggregation kinetics was increased even though the total number of identical repeats was kept similar between the reactions with different fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Furthermore, we did not observe any difference in the localization of full-length wild-type or mutant PLIN4, fused to GFP, and stably transfected HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). Both proteins could be observed localizing to the LDs, as well as in the cytosol, both in normal media or upon addition of oleic acid to promote LD formation. We therefore conclude that the presence of an increased number of identical repeats in mutant PLIN4 promotes its aggregation without significantly impacting its interaction with LDs.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Influence of lipid droplets on PLIN4 fibril formation</title><p id="P21">Previous work has shown that the repetitive region of PLIN4 binds to LDs via the formation of an amphipathic helix, and is required for PLIN4 targeting to LDs in cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. We have also shown that LD binding affinity increases with the number of repeats, suggesting a velcro-type mechanism of LD binding. Interestingly, the PLIN4 repetitive regions binds much more readily to LDs than to bilayer membranes because it favors interaction with the neutral lipids of the LD core compared to the phospholipid surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.This same repetitive region of PLIN4 is expanded in myopathy patients and forms amyloid fibrils <italic>in vitro</italic>. We therefore wanted to assess how the presence of LDs affects PLIN4 fibril formation. We prepared artificial LDs composed of triglycerides, which form the neutral lipid core, and phosphatidylcholine (PC), the most abundant phospholipid forming the LD surface monolayer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. In order to prepare a homogenous suspension of artificial LDs, we adjusted their density to be close to the density of water solution by the addition of brominated oil, following a recently-established protocol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Binding of purified perilipins, including PLIN4-12mer to these artificial LDs can be assessed by fluorescent microscopy or by other approaches, as has been described by Araújo et al. (2024). We therefore included in the LD preparation a small amount of fluorescently-labelled phospholipid (rhodamine-conjugated phosphatidylethanolamine; rhodamine-PE) in order to visualize the LDs by fluorescent microscopy. Incubation of these dense LDs with fluorescently-labelled PLIN4-12mer[260:] or 12merMUT showed that both proteins could bind to the LD surface, especially after a prolonged incubation of 24h at room temp. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Next, we performed a ThT aggregation assay with 4mer[260:], 12mer[260:] or 12merMUT in the presence of an increasing concentration of LDs, from 0 to maximum possible. To compare the influence of LDs on the aggregation of different PLIN4 constructs, we calculated the LD to protein ratio in the different reactions by using the molar PC concentration as a measure of available LD surface, normalizing this to the total molar concentration of 33-aa repeats (mer) in each reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). The aggregation of 4mer[260:] or 12mer[260:] was slowed-down or completely blocked, respectively, by an increasing concentration of LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). By contrast, the aggregation of 12merMUT was much less affected by LDs at the same PC (surface lipid) to protein molar ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, right-most panel). Furthermore, PC liposomes (bilayer membranes) had less effect on aggregation of 4mer[260:] or of 12merMUT compared to LDs, event at a &gt;100-fold higher PC concentration. This result correlates with a lower affinity of PLIN4 amphipathic helix for bilayers compared to LDs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7A-C</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. We therefore conclude that aggregation of the PLIN4 repetitive region may be slowed down by LDs via a competitive mechanism: for WT PLIN4 repetitive region, binding to LDs is more pronounced than aggregation, whereas in the case of PLIN4-12merMUT, aggregation is less sensitive to the presence of LDs, likely because aggregation occurs faster than LD binding.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Identical repeats of PLIN4 promote aggregation in a yeast model</title><p id="P23">Finally, we wanted to establish an orthogonal model to evaluate the effect of PLIN4 sequence on the aggregation of the PLIN4 repetitive region.

We expressed in yeast two PLIN4 12-mer fragments, 12mer[260:] and 12merMUT, both from a high expression GPD promotor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Expression of the two fragments, fused to mScarlet, did not affect the growth of wild-type yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>).

By contrast, such puncta were never observed in yeast expressing PLIN4-12mer[260:] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Therefore, these results show a clear and reproducible difference in the behavior of the two PLIN4 fragments and indicate that identical repeats, present in 9 copies in PLIN4-12mer[MUT], compared to 3 copies in 12mer[260:], promote aggregation. The decrease in affinity of PLIN4-12merMUT for LDs, compared to 12mer[260:], could also contribute to its increased aggregation.

Nevertheless, the model of intramolecular stacking is enticing. Only a few such examples have been described to date.

For each condition, the molar ratio between [PC] and individual 33-aa PLIN4 repeats [mer] was calculated. Note that the PC concentration of liposomes is &gt;100x higher than in the case of LDs, due to the smaller size of liposomes. However, since the liposomes are composed of a bilayer, compared to the LD monolayer, the PC concentration in the case of liposomes should be divided by 2 to obtain the total PC area available for protein binding, compare to LDs, assuming that the liposomes remain intact during the course of the experiment.
