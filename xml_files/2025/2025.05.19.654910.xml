Animal opsins also show great potential to be used as optogenetic tools that regulate cellular G protein signalling with light. Opn5 is a UV-sensitive "non-visual" opsin that is expressed in a wide range of tissues throughout body. Although Opn5 could be a good template for the development of optogenetic tools applicable to tissues outside of the eye because of its broad expression, its sensitivity to poorly tissue-penetrating UV light poses challenges for its application. In this study, we focused on human OPN5 (hOPN5) to attempt to identify amino acid(s) responsible for the UV sensitivity and to shift the spectral sensitivity to visible light. Sequence alignment across UV-sensitive Opn5s identified a conserved lysine reside (Lys91) at a position implicated in spectral tuning in invertebrate opsins. We applied site-directed mutagenesis to replace this residue with neutral (alanine) or acidic (glutamate or aspartate) amino acids. Heterologous action spectroscopy of these mutants revealed substantial shifts in spectral sensitivity (55-63nm) toward visible wavelengths. Our findings identify Lys91 as a key spectral tuning site in hOPN5 and provide visible-light sensitive versions of this protein as a candidate for optogenetic applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>opsin</kwd><kwd>GPCR</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>spectral tuning</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Animal opsins are light-sensitive G protein coupled receptors that convert light into intracellular G protein signalling. In vertebrates, opsins extend beyond the well-studied rod and cone photopigments underlying vision to encompass various "non-visual" opsins identified from tissues outside photoreceptor cells. Opn5 (neuropsin) is a type of the non-visual opsin first identified in the genomes of human and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Mouse Opn5 is expressed in a wide range of tissues including brain and skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] and has been reported to mediate various light-dependent physiologies such as direct photoentrainment of local circadian clocks in cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] and skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] and the violet-light dependent suppression of brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. In non-mammalian vertebrates, quail Opn5 is expressed in the hypothalamus paraventricular organ (PVO) where it contributes to regulation of seasonal cycle of reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. In the Japanese rice fish (medaka), Opn5 expressed in pituitary melanotrophs regulates the short-wavelength-light dependent release of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and subsequent pigmentation in the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p id="P3">In addition to such physiological importance, the Opn5 family has also attracted attention for its potential for generating optogenetic tools that regulate intracellular G protein signalling with light. A recent study has shown that human OPN5 (hOPN5) selectively activates the Gq-type G protein without promiscuous activation of other G proteins such as Gi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] which most other Gq-coupled opsins including melanopsins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] and jumping spider Rh1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] activate. hOPN5 as a Gq-selective optogenetic tool has been applied <italic>in vivo</italic> to murine cardiomyocytes to modulate heart beat rate and smooth muscle cells in various organs such as the small intestine and stomach in mice to induce muscle contraction with light via Gq signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Although hOPN5 is becoming increasingly valuable in the field of optogenetics, several challenges remain to be addressed for its widespread application. One of the most important problems is that it is primarily sensitivity to UV light, which has much lower penetration of biological tissues than visible light due to higher absorbance and scattering. Homologues of hOPN5 from across the vertebrates (the so called 'Opn5m' sub-family; supplementary material, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figure S1</xref>) form UV-absorbing pigments with λ<sub>max</sub> at 360 ~ 380 nm upon binding 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal in the dark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The highly conserved UV sensitivity among these Opn5m opsins suggests the existence of shared amino acid residue(s) responsible for the UV sensitivity. In this study, we set out to identify such responsible amino acid residue(s) for the UV sensitivity of hOPN5. We applied sequence alignment and homology modelling to identify conserved residues close to the chromophore binding pocket with potential to provide UV sensitivity. We then applied site directed mutagenesis and heterologous action spectroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] in HEK293 cells to determine their involvement in this property. We find that a lysine residue, Lys91 (bovine rhodopsin amino acid numbering), in helix II is necessary to make hOPN5 UV-sensitive. Based on this result, we discuss the potential use of hOPN5 K91 mutants as visible light-sensitive Gq-manipulating optogenetic tool.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P5">We first measured light-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases in wild type hOPN5-transfected HEK293T cells via an aequorin-based bioluminescent assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1a</xref>) and confirmed that it induced light intensity-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1b</xref>). The irradiance-response curves for six spectrally distinct stimuli showed that the wild type hOPN5 had a higher sensitivity to stimuli rich in UV than visible light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1c</xref>). This finding confirms that hOPN5 forms UV-sensitive pigments in the HEK293T cell environment to drive Gq-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses upon light absorption, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p id="P6">To determine the amino acid residue(s) responsible for the UV sensitivity of hOPN5, we searched animo acids which are conserved across the Opn5m sub-family and located near the Schiff base based upon AlphaFold3 structural modelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. The most promising candidate was a conserved Lys (position 91) in helix II of Opn5s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figures 2a, b</xref>). Replacement of Lys residues at an equivalent location in UV-sensitive <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Rh3 and Rh7 opsins and <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> c-Opsin1 have successfully produced shifts to visible wavelength sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P7">To determine the contribution of Lys91 to UV sensitivity of hOPN5, we substituted the residue with amino acids having neutral (alanine) or negatively charged (glutamic/aspartic acids) side chains and examined their spectral sensitivity of the resultant K91 mutants. We confirmed that the K91 mutants increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> light-dependently as observed in the wild type opsin. Construction of irradiance-response curves for spectrally distinct stimuli showed that the K91 mutants had higher sensitivity to visible light compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2c</xref>). The λ<sub>max</sub> values of wild type and K91A mutants of hOPN5 were estimated by applying a nonlinear optimisation algorithm with bootstrapping to the experimentally obtained light intensity-Ca<sup>2+</sup> response dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] (see supplementary material, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figure S2</xref> and Material and Methods section for details). The estimated λ<sub>max</sub> values were 389 nm for wild type (similar to that reported elsewhere), while K91A, K91D, and K91E mutants of hOPN5 had λ<sub>max</sub> around 447 nm, 452 nm, and 444 nm respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>). These results indicate that a single amino acid mutation at Lys91 is sufficient to make hOPN5 visible-light sensitive.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P8">The visible light shift we observed in the K91A, K91D &amp; K91E mutants implicates Lys91 as a critical residue in defining UV sensitivity for human OPN5. Opsins can absorb visible light only when the chromophore retinal is covalently bound to the opsin via a protonated Schiff base. Consequently, the most parsimonious explanation for the role of Lys91 in UV sensitivity is that the positive charged side chain of this residue destabilises the Schiff base protonation. Such a mechanism has been suggested to explain the contribution of Lys residues at sites 90 and 94 in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Rh3 and Rh7 and <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> c-Opsin1, respectively, to UV sensitivity of these opsins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Moreover, in teleost parapinopsins (non-visual opsins phylogenetically close to vertebrate rod and cone opsins), introduction of helix II from UV-sensitive PP1 is sufficient to provide a λ<sub>max</sub> at UV light region to the visible light (blue)-sensitive PP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] and also, a report has demonstrated that G90K mutation in bovine rhodopsin shifts the λ<sub>max</sub> to UV region (384 nm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Thus, across diverse opsins, residues in helix II appear to define UV sensitivity. However, according to the Alpha-fold3 3D model of hOPN5 aligned with the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2b</xref>), the side chain of Lys91 in hOPN5 is about 8A away from the Schiff base. It remains to be determined how such a distant residue could destabilise Schiff base protonation. Furthermore, sequence alignments across more distantly related Opn5s (supplementary material, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figure S1</xref>) reveals UV sensitive opsins (Opn5m2 and Opn5L2)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] that lack Lys91 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1a</xref>), indicating that these Opn5 homologs have different spectral tuning mechanisms from Opn5m for their UV sensitivity.</p><p id="P9">The possible immune response against optogenetic protein itself has been reported as well as against AAV-mediated gene transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Mammalian non-visual opsins including Opn3, Opn4, and Opn5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] that exhibit broad tissue expression represent an attractive strategy to reduce the likelihood of such immune responses; therefore, they have a significant advantage for both experimental and therapeutic optogenetic applications. hOPN5 has generated particular interest due to its specific activation of Gq-type G proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] and successful <italic>in vivo</italic> applications of hOPN5 have been demonstrated, such as light-dependent control of muscle contraction across a wide range of muscle tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. The visual light-sensitive version of hOPN5 in this study have the potential to be applied to deep tissues where UV light penetration is limited and thus could be a good template upon which to develop general Gq-manipulating optogenetic tools. As there has been accumulating knowledge about spectral sensitivity tuning within the visible-light range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], engineering of further red-shifted mutants of hOPN5 could prove fruitful in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S5"><title>Construction of opsin expression vectors</title><p id="P10">mRNA sequence of hOPN5 was obtained from NCBI GenBank (NM181744).
