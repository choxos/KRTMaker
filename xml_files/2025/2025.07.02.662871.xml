In humans, theta rhythmic sensory stimulation (RSS) enhances episodic memory when the stimuli are synchronised across the visual and auditory domain compared to when they are out-of-synchrony. However, recent studies show mixed evidence if the improvement in episodic memory is the result of modulating hippocampal theta activity. In the current study, we investigated whether pre-stimulus brain state could explain part of this variance in the neural and behavioural effects induced by the RSS, via recording participants’ brain activity with MEG during a multisensory theta RSS memory paradigm. Our findings suggest that pre-stimulus alpha power modulates entrainment strength in sensory regions, which in turn predicts subsequent memory formation. These findings suggest that for non-invasive brain stimulation tools to be effective it is crucial to consider brain-state dependent effects.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Episodic memory provides humans with the ability to mentally travel back to the past<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> where experiences typically involve associations between multimodal information, such as a concert you have seen. Binding the arbitrary sensory stimuli into a coherent memory episode depends on the hippocampus, which receives multimodal inputs from corresponding neocortical areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Moreover, hippocampal synapses are more likely to undergo activity-induced synaptic modifications such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Evidence from rodent literature suggests that whether LTP or LTD occurs depends on whether stimulation is delivered at the peak or the trough of ongoing hippocampal theta rhythm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Inspired by these findings, we have developed a rhythmic sensory stimulation (RSS) approach to modulate episodic memory performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. This approach enables the modulation of visual and auditory cortices following the application of RSS at theta frequency (4 Hz) with the two modalities being either in-phase or out-of-phase. This way the sensory inputs that reach the hippocampus synchronously should be more likely to be associated, as compared to inputs arriving asynchronously. Indeed, previous studies by our and other labs found that associative memory performance was significantly better in the in-phase condition than in the out-of-phase condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">This approach is promising to enhance episodic memory as it is non-invasive and inexpensive. Importantly, understanding the exact cognitive and neural mechanisms responsible for the RSS induced memory effects may help to develop therapeutic interventions for clinical and healthy aging populations with impaired episodic memory. As an example, the RSS induced memory effects might be challenged by trial-by-trial and (or) individual variability in entraining multisensory regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, further reaching the hippocampus. For example, peak frequency of brain rhythms could differ between individuals or between cognitive states within an individual<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, individual brain states fluctuate moment-by-moment, which determines how external stimuli are processed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. A recent study failed to show the RSS induced memory effects, which raises the very important question on what the most effective RSS protocols are for enhancing episodic memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. The mixed evidence on whether RSS can reach higher-level regions beyond sensory regions has also been discussed in recent investigations on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Several studies have shown that 40 Hz RSS can entrain both the sensory regions and the hippocampus. Moreover, AD pathology in those areas was significantly reduced. Hippocampal-related cognitive task performance, such as spatial memory, was also improved after the RSS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In contrast, other studies have not found evidence for entrainment of hippocampal neurons at 40 Hz via visual 40 Hz RSS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">One variable that could explain the variance in finding RSS in downstream regions (such as the hippocampus) is the brain state during the stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Supporting this notion, Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> found that the gamma phase locking response to a 37.5 Hz audio-visual flickering stimulus was significantly higher for subsequently remembered compared to subsequently forgotten trials. It is also well-known that the amplitude of steady-state visual and auditory evoked potentials (SSVEPs and SSAEPs) is modulated by attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, variations in brain state could explain variations in finding evidence for RSS in down-stream regions and, as a result, downstream effects on behaviour.</p><p id="P5">The current study investigates if the trial-by-trial variability in entrainment strength is modulated by brain state, and whether it can explain variations in the multisensory theta-induced memory effect (TIME) induced by the 4 Hz multisensory RSS. To do this, we recorded participants’ brain activity using MEG while they underwent a standard version of the audio-visual RSS memory task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>). During the encoding phase, the luminance and the volume of neutral videos and sounds were modulated by a theta (4 Hz) sine wave with two phase offsets, 0° (in-phase) and 180° (out-of-phase). During encoding, participants were presented with audio-video pairs, and in a later recall task were cued with a sound and asked to recall the corresponding video. The results demonstrate that the behavioural effect of TIME emerges only when accounting for single-trial variance in theta phase entrainment, but not when this variance is not accounted for. Furthermore, pre-stimulus alpha power differed between trials that matched the expected phase offsets compared to the trials that did not match the expected phase offsets.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Memory performance does not differ in the degree of cross-regional phase synchronisation averaged across trials</title><p id="P6">Our first step was to replicate the findings from the previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. We used a linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> to source localise the evoked power at 4 Hz in the unimodal conditions. Coordinates for the left and right auditory sources and one single visual source were determined by where the maximum power of 4 Hz was localised in the unimodal auditory condition and visual condition, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). After reconstructing the time series of multimodal data at source level using LCMV beamforming, the grand average event-related fields (ERF) across 24 participants in each phase offset condition were extracted from the visual and auditory regions of interest (ROIs) that were predetermined in the unimodal source localisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The grand average ERFs were bandpass filtered between 1.5 and 9 Hz. After applying the Hilbert transformation to the bandpass filtered data, the instantaneous phase differences between the visual and auditory activity were computed for 1-s length (500 samples) starting from 1 s after stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Rayleigh tests and V tests for the 0° and 180° conditions both lead to a rejection of the null hypothesis that the distribution of the phase differences was uniformly distributed, all <italic>p</italic> values ≈ 0. The V tests further demonstrated that the distribution of the phase differences in each condition had a mean direction of its expected phase, 0° or 180°, respectively, both <italic>p</italic> values ≈ 0.</p><p id="P7">The results suggest that the RSS effectively synchronised or desynchronised the corresponding sensory regions at 4 Hz. However, memory performance did not differ between 0° and 180° conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), <italic>t</italic>(24) = -0.891, <italic>p</italic> = 0.809 (one-sided). In one of our previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, trial-by-trial variability of 4 Hz phase differences between visual and auditory activity did influence subsequent memory success, even though the phase difference on average level was constant. Therefore, using the same analysis pipeline, we investigated if the level of single trial phase synchronisation at 4 Hz could account for the subsequent memory success.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Strength of single trial phase entrainment predicts subsequent memory performance</title><p id="P8">We used a single-trial phase entrainment measure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), where the resultant vector length was computed for every time point between the observed phase difference (between visual and auditory sources, for example, 202° at the data point at 1.288 s in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) and the expected phase difference (for example, 180° in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Therefore, a value close to 1 suggests high entrainment in that a given trial closely followed the RSS, whereas a value close to 0 suggests low entrainment, i.e., that the given trial deviated from the RSS. In the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, the entrainment strength of the single data point is 0.981, indicating strong entrainment to the 180° RSS. The entrainment measures of data points between 1 and 2 s after stimulus onset were averaged for each trial and then averaged over trials in each subsequent memory condition and phase offset condition. A 2x2 Repeated Measures ANOVA with the factors phase offset condition (0° vs 180°) and subsequent memory (hits vs misses) revealed a significant interaction between the two factors, <italic>F</italic>(1, 23) = 10.613, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003. Subsidiary paired-samples <italic>t</italic> tests suggest that the interaction was a result of significantly stronger entrainment to 0° RSS in subsequently remembered trials than in forgotten trials in the 0° condition, <italic>t</italic>(23) = 2.887, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004 (one-sided). In contrast, in the 180° condition, subsequently remembered trials showed significantly weaker entrainment than forgotten trials, <italic>t</italic>(23) = -2.036, <italic>p</italic> = 0.027 (one-sided; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The results suggest that trial-by-trial variability in following the RSS may have obscured the memory effect when averaging across phase-offset conditions and across trials. Therefore, we back-sorted the trials based on their actual phase difference between auditory and visual cortices and re-labelled the trials based on their actual phase difference. To this end, we computed the instantaneous phase differences between band-pass filtered (1.5 and 9 Hz) visual and auditory activity, and averaged the phase differences between 1 and 2 s for each trial. Each trial was sorted into one of the two phase bins (bin 1: -π/2 to π/2; bin 2: π/2 to 3π/2) based on the averaged phase differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The number of trials in each bin was equated by randomly sampling the one trial fewer than the minimum trial number between the two bins, from each bin. The proportion of remembered trials was calculated for each bin. This procedure was repeated for 100 times for each participant. The proportion of remembered trials calculated at each iteration was averaged across the 100 iterations. Paired samples t-test revealed a significantly higher proportion of remembered trials in phase bin 1 than in phase bin 2, <italic>t</italic>(23) = 3.504, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 (one-sided, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). To be consistent with the previous approach, we also sorted the single trials into four bins centred at 0°, 90°, 180° and 270° based on the actual instantaneous phase differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). We replicated the previous findings by showing that the mean recall accuracy in the 0° bin was significantly higher than in the 90°, 180°, and 270° bins, <italic>t</italic>(23) = 2.196, <italic>p</italic> = 0.019; <italic>t</italic>(23) = 2.052, <italic>p</italic> = 0.026; <italic>t</italic>(23) = 2.600, <italic>p</italic> = 0.008, respectively (all one-sided, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). Whereas recall accuracy in the 90°, 180°, and 270° bins did not differ from each other statistically (all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; 0.820).</p><p id="P10">Participants’ subjective rating on how well a sound suited the contents of a movie influenced memory performance. A generalized linear mixed effects model (GLME) of a fixed factor ‘rating’ and a random factor ‘subjects’ suggests that ‘rating’ significantly predicted memory performance, <italic>z</italic> = 4.811, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Therefore, to account for the confounds of subjective rating, a linear mixed effects model (LME) was built on the entrainment measures with a fixed interaction term phase offset x memory performance and a fixed interaction term phase offset x rating, and a random effect subjects. The interaction between phase offset and memory was still significant, <italic>z</italic> = 2.739, <italic>p</italic> = 0.012; whereas the interaction between phase offset and rating was not significant, <italic>z</italic> = 0.109, <italic>p</italic> = 0.914, suggesting that although perceived semantic congruency between multisensory stimuli influenced memory performance, it did not influence entrainment strength. Specifically, the strong entrainment to 0° RSS but weaker entrainment to 180° RSS led to subsequent memory success, while subsequently missed trials showed the opposite pattern, replicating our previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">The results suggest that although the RSS did not always entrain a trial, when the trial followed the optimal (i.e. 0 phase lag) 4 Hz phase differences, memory was better than when the trial did not follow the optimal phase. However, it is important to consider that when sorting the single trials into the 0° or the 180° bins, the distribution of stimuli (i.e. movies and sounds) is not counterbalanced across phase offset conditions anymore. This could lead to a potential confound between memory advantage in 0° and a greater proportion of memorable items. To address this concern, we conducted a number of control analyses which are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>. The control analyses suggest that the proportion of which movies assigned to the 0° bin was normally distributed. Further, the memory advantage found in 0° was still significant even after randomly sampling equal amounts of trials from better remembered items and less remembered items for the 0° and 180° bins. A GLME was built with fixed factors ‘phase bin’ and ‘subjective rating’, and random factors ‘subjects’, ‘movie ID’ and ‘sound ID’. The effect of ‘phase bin’ was still significant after taking the effect of stimuli into account, <italic>z</italic> = 3.175, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Highly-entrained trials were preceded by decreased alpha power</title><p id="P12">After replicating our previous finding showing that trial-by-trial variations in entrainment strength explains subsequent memory performance, we interrogated if this trial-by-trial variability in entrainment strength can be explained by variations in brain state. Specifically, we computed alpha power, which has been linked to attentional brain states for processing external information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, between 0.7 and 0.2 s prior to stimulus onset and between 8 and 12 Hz. We then compared pre-stimulus alpha power for trials whose actual phase differences between visual and auditory 4 Hz activity matched with their expected phase difference (i.e. the experimental condition), with those trials whose phase differences did not match their expected phase difference. A cluster-based permutation one-sample t-test on all gradiometers and magnetometers showed that alpha power significantly decreased before the trials whose actual phase differences matched with their intended phase difference, as compared to the trials whose actual phase differences did not match with the intended phase difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, the effect size for the averaged alpha power over the cluster was: gradiometer sensor cluster Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.53; magnetometer sensor cluster Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.52). This analysis suggests that pre-stimulus brain state determines in part if a given trial accurately follows RSS. However, this relation between matching and unmatching trials and alpha power could also be driven by a hidden third variable, for instance an increase in tonic alpha power over time together with decreased reactivity to the RSS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. To test for this possibility, we averaged the pre-stimulus alpha power across the gradiometer and magnetometer sensors in the clusters that showed a significant difference between matched and mismatched trials and split the trials into the first and second half of the memory task for each participant. A 2x2 Repeated Measures ANOVA with the factors trial order (1<sup>st</sup> vs 2<sup>nd</sup>) and match between the actual phase bin and the experimental phase condition (match vs mismatch) suggested main effects of trial order and label match. The pre-stimulus alpha power in the second half of the trials increased significantly as compared to the alpha power in the first half of the trials, <italic>F</italic>(1, 23) = 10.989, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003. The main effect of label match suggests that decreasing pre-stimulus alpha power effect before the matched trials was not simply due to the tonic alpha power changes over time, which remained significant after taking trial order into account, <italic>F</italic>(1, 23) = 5.938, <italic>p</italic> = 0.024.</p><p id="P13">The results suggest that decreases in pre-stimulus alpha power predict how accurately a given trial follows the RSS. Next, we investigated if pre-stimulus alpha power also links with subsequent memory behaviour. As above, we split the trials into first half and second half depending on the trial order to address the potential confound of alpha power systematically changing across the time on task. To avoid conflating the variance, within each half of trials, we median split the trials into low pre-stimulus alpha power trials and high pre-stimulus alpha power trials according to their pre-stimulus alpha power that was averaged between -0.7 and -0.2 s, 8 and 12 Hz, and across all the gradiometers and magnetometers in the significant clusters. Then for each pre-stimulus alpha power bin, we subsampled the same number of trials from 0° and 180° phase offset conditions, respectively. Mean recall accuracy was calculated for each phase offset condition. A 2x2x2 Repeated Measures ANOVA with the factors trial order (first vs second), phase offset condition (0° vs 180°) and pre-stimulus alpha power (low vs high) revealed a significant interaction between phase offset condition and pre-stimulus alpha power, <italic>F</italic>(1, 23) = 5.448, <italic>p</italic> = 0.029 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). The interaction was driven by significantly higher recall accuracy in the low alpha power bin than in the high alpha power bin in the 0° phase condition, <italic>t</italic>(23) = 2.747, <italic>p</italic> = 0.011; no significant difference in recall accuracy between low and high alpha power bins in the 180° phase condition was observed, <italic>t</italic>(23) = -0.511, <italic>p</italic> = 0.614.</p><p id="P14">Next, we used an LCMV beamforming method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> to source localise the significant difference in pre-stimulus alpha power between mismatch and match conditions that was exhibited at sensor space. After reconstructing the time series of the data at source level using LCMV beamforming, alpha power (8 - 12 Hz) was computed for mismatch and match conditions using a Morlet wavelet transformation. The mean power between -0.7 and -0.2 s was normalised by the mean power between 3.2 and 3.7 s within each condition. The difference in normalised pre-stimulus power between mismatch and match conditions was interpolated to a standard MRI image using volumetric morphing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The strongest pre-stimulus power difference was localised to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC).</p><p id="P15">Finally, we investigated whether inter-regional coupling in 4 Hz was modulated by the match/mismatch condition. To this end we calculated inter-regional phase coupling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> between the PPC and all other regions. The results show that functional connectivity at theta frequency was significantly greater between the PPC and the hippocampus in the same pre-stimulus time window in the match compared to the mismatch condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">TIME reveals that episodic memory can be improved by synchronising theta activity in the auditory and visual cortices that are entrained by 4 Hz in-phase multisensory RSS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. TIME has been suggested to be influenced by trial-by-trial fluctuations in entrainment strength of the RSS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Here, we show that pre-stimulus alpha power modulates the trial-by-trial variability in entrainment strength, thus influencing subsequent memory performance. We successfully replicated the previous findings on TIME at a single-trial level showing that single trial phase synchronisation at 4 Hz improves the likelihood of memory success and that this is not due to an item effect. However, RSS did not always entrain the sensory regions at desired phase offsets, resulting in approximately half of trials not matching with their experimental conditions. Arguably, this led to a failure in replicating the TIME when averaged across trials. Pre-stimulus alpha power was increased for trials whose actual phase difference between auditory and visual 4 Hz activity did not match with the expected phase offset. Moreover, pre-stimulus alpha power modulated subsequent memory performance. The source localisation of the pre-stimulus alpha power between mismatch and match conditions points to a brain region that is related to attention, the PPC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. The findings enhanced our understanding on the RSS induced TIME and might provide insights on why recent studies could not replicate the TIME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">Despite the differences in experimental procedures and stimuli used in those experiments, our results suggest that the robustness of TIME very much depends on the trial-by-trial variability in entrainment strength. Serin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and the current study both performed the experiment in the MEG suite. The auditory stimuli’s quality might be influenced by the MEG-compatible auditory deliver system because auditory stimuli were delivered through long thin silicone tubes into the magnetically shielded room (MSR) to prevent interference with the MEG signals, which diminished the quality (i.e. reduced frequency bandwidths) of the sounds. Such changes likely cause variability in entraining the sensory regions especially the auditory region, resulting in variable phase shifts compared to the visual stimuli. Our previous studies suggest that even though phase in sensory regions is entrained to the multisensory RSS on average, subsequent memory performance is better predicted by the actual phase difference on a single-trial level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. In the current study, we successfully replicated this finding in showing that the single-trial entrainment strength in the 0° condition was positively related to subsequent recall, whereas in the 180° condition, stronger entrainment strength was related to subsequent forgetting. Additionally, sorting trials according to their actual phase difference results in significant TIME and replicates the ‘hockey-stick’ pattern, which refers to increased memory for the 0° condition compared to the 90°, 180°, and 270° conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Notably, this hockey-stick pattern points to an interaction between theta-phase-dependant and spike-timing-dependent plasticity as pointed out in a recent computational modelling study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. We further demonstrated that the memory effect after sorting trials based on their actual phase offsets was not driven by a bias towards more memorable sounds or videos being more likely to be sorted into 0° phase bin. Evidence from an intracranial EEG study has shown that human Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL) responds to theta (5.5 Hz) audio-visual RSS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Therefore, the single-trial TIME is more likely to be supported by the interaction between the two synaptic plasticity mechanisms in the hippocampus. This interpretation would also be in line with a recent MEG study that showed that hippocampal theta power is enhanced for synchronous vs. asynchronous multi-sensory speech stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">Importantly, and going significantly beyond previous studies, our results show that pre-stimulus alpha power was decreased for trials whose actual audio-visual phase offset matched with the expected phase, as compared to the trials which did not match with the expected phase offset. A plethora of studies showed anticipatory alpha power decreases in tasks where attention was oriented spatially or temporally, thus predicting performance and reaction times of visual targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. In a memory inhibition study, pre-stimulus alpha power has been found to increase before the to-be-inhibited items, as compared to the to-be-remembered items and the difference in the prestimulus alpha power was localised in the parietal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Moreover, the pre-stimulus alpha power decrease in the PPC has been linked with subsequent memory success regardless of whether the upcoming item was to-be-remembered or not-to-be-remembered. Another line of research demonstrated that phase-locked responses (or entrainment) to rhythmic flickering stimuli is strongly modulated by attention, such that the brain follows a flickering stimulus more faithfully during high compared to low attentional states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Modulation of oscillatory activity using auditory stimulation has been suggested to be highly state-dependent, such as closed-loop auditory stimulation during sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Moreover, neuronal activity in the auditory cortex follows the auditory stimulation more faithfully in the desynchronised state. Whereas in the synchronised state when low-frequency power is prevalent, the neuronal activity misaligns from the stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Our finding of decreases in alpha power preceding phase-offset-matched trials is consistent with these studies. Previous studies show that the state of phase entrainment, especially in the auditory domain, alternates with the state of alpha at a rate of approximately 0.06 Hz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. When alpha power is strong, auditory entrainment is weak and decoupled from the external stimulation. Whereas when alpha power is weak, auditory rhythmic activity shows stronger phase entrainment to the external stimuli. In light of these findings, our results suggest that fluctuation on trial-by-trial variability in entrainment strength is modulated by pre-stimulus alpha power. Pre-stimulus alpha power decreases for phase-offset-matched trials might reflect more engagement of attentional resources, which in turn increase the phase alignment to the external flickering stimuli.</p><p id="P19">Relatedly, we also show that pre-stimulus alpha power is linked with subsequent memory performance but only in the 0° condition. Low pre-stimulus alpha power resulted in higher proportion of recalled trials compared to high pre-stimulus alpha power. However, for the 180° condition recall accuracy did not differ significantly between low and high alpha power. This pattern of results could be due to two forces, attention and phase-offset pulling in the same direction for the 0° condition, but in opposite directions for the 180° condition. For the former, enhanced attention would both benefit memory encoding, because enhanced attention boosts memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, and it would also increase the phase-alignment with a condition that is known to be beneficial for memory. However, for the 180° condition enhanced attention would increase memory encoding, whereas it would lead to enhanced phase-alignment in a condition that is known to decrease memory encoding. Therefore, one could argue that the beneficial effects of attention, and the detrimental effects of phase-alignment cancelled each other out for the 180° condition, whereas the beneficial effects for memory were amplified in the 0° condition.</p><p id="P20">Alpha oscillations could reflect internal processing modes that can be activated by attentional drift due to time on task, hence resulting in fatigue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. We replicated these findings in showing that pre-stimulus alpha power indeed increased across time during the task. However, after controlling for this alpha power drift over time we still observed that trial-by-trial variability in entrainment strength is modulated by prestimulus alpha power. Additionally, the interaction between pre-stimulus alpha power and phase offset condition on subsequent recall accuracy was still significant after taking time on task into account. Perhaps future studies could investigate if the entrainment mode induced by the current RSS protocol is alternated with the alpha mode at 0.06 Hz as suggested by the previous study by Lakatos et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. This could help to optimise the RSS stimulation to be more effective on inducing the TIME.</p><p id="P21">In conclusion, our study provides novel insights into the variability and effectivity on using rhythmic sensory stimulation (RSS) to modulate memory performance. Our results demonstrate that variations in pre-stimulus brain state are the reason for why the brain does not always follow the RSS. Our findings might be also insightful for understanding the discrepancy in evidence on whether RSS can reach higher-level brain regions in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Having animals pay attention to the RSS is important for the rhythmic sensory inputs to reach the higher-level brain regions such as the hippocampus. We show that functional activity at theta frequency was significantly greater between the PPC, where the strongest pre-stimulus alpha power difference was localised, and the hippocampus in the same pre-stimulus time window before the matched trials than before the mismatched trials. This supports that attentional state amplifies the effect of RSS reaching the downstream regions. Previous studies suggest TIME on the average level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, which the current study and Serin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> did not replicate. Instead, the current study indicates that the TIME might be state-dependent. Previous studies have also suggested that the effect of brain stimulation on perception or visual short-term memory is state-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Here, we show that the effect of RSS on episodic memory is also state-dependent. This highlights the need for brain-state dependant stimulation protocols which individualise stimulation parameters, before we can confidently use RSS as a non-invasive therapeutic intervention in clinical populations with impaired hippocampal function.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S8" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P22">29 young healthy participants participated in this experiment (12 male; mean age: 24.3 years; range: 18 – 35 years).

The movie clips consisted of documentaries on natural scenes, animals, architecture or human activities. 400 movie clips were modulated at 4 Hz with luminance changing between 0% and 100% (initially starting at 50% luminance). 400 sound clips were preprocessed using Audacity software (ver. 2.4.2 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">https://www.audacityteam.org/</ext-link>) as in Clouter et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.

Sound amplitude was modulated at 4 Hz between 0 and 100% with a sine wave at 0° and 180° phase offsets relative to the modulation of the movie clips. The sound clips were not directly related to the contents of the videos. Each sound clip was taken from one of the eight sound categories as described in Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, with 36 sound clips for each category. The stimuli were allocated to three experimental tasks. 192 sounds and movies were used for the memory task. 56 sounds and movies were used for the unimodal task. The 56 sounds were modulated at only 0° phase offset from the modulation of the movies. 96 sounds and movies were used for the perceptual synchrony task. The 192 sounds and movies used for the memory task were randomly divided into two sets of equal size (96 sounds and 96 movies per set), with the constraint that the number of sounds for each sound category was equal. The same was done to the 96 sounds and movies used for the perceptual synchrony task.

Auditory stimuli were presented with ER-30 tube-phone drivers (Etymotic Research) via Docs Promold ear pieces to avoid electronic audio noise interference with the MEG recording. The physical presentation of phase offsets between movies and sounds, as well as the frequencies of the movies and sounds, were verified using the PROPixx projector Pixel Mode Triggers and a microphone placed at the end of the sound delivery tubes.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title><p id="P25">Participants provided informed consent before entering the MEG scanner. After they were given the task instructions, they practiced the procedure with four example trials. The formal experiment consisted of 12 blocks of an associative memory task, followed by two unimodal source localiser tasks and another 6 blocks of synchrony judgment task. Each associative memory task block included an encoding phase, a distractor phase and a retrieval phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). During the encoding phase, participants were presented with one of 16 movie clips paired with one of 16 sound clips. Each trial started with a fixation cross with an inter-trial interval (ITI) between 1 and 3 s. A sound-movie pair was presented for 3 s after the fixation cross. Participants were then instructed to make a judgment as to how well the sound suited the contents of the movie by pressing the keys on a Lumitouch response pad. The instruction screen was presented until a response was made. The ratings ranged from 1 (thumb key, the sound does not suit the movie at all), 2 (index key), 3 (middle key), 4 (ring key), to 5 (pinkie key, the sound suits the content of the movie very well). Participants were instructed to remember each sound-movie pair, as their memory of the association would be tested later. Within each block, four sounds from four sound categories were associated randomly with the 16 movies with the constraint that the number of sounds for each phase offset condition was equal in each sound category.</p><p id="P26">After the last trial of the encoding phase, participants were instructed to do the distractor task. A series of numbers were presented one by one, and participants were instructed to respond as fast and accurately as possible, indicating whether the number presented was an odd or an even number. They were asked to press the index finger key if the number was odd and press the middle finger key if the number was even. The distractor task included 20 trials and participants were shown their accuracy, i.e. the proportion of correct trials of all 20 trials, at the end of the task.</p><p id="P27">Upon completion of the distractor task, participants were instructed to start the associative memory retrieval task. The retrieval phase consisted of 16 trials, during which all 16 sound-movie pairs presented during the encoding phase were tested. Each trial started with a fixation cross with an ITI between 1 and 3 s. Participants were presented with one of the 16 sounds heard during the encoding phase for 3 s, along with four still images from four of the movies from the encoding phase. Participants were instructed to select the movie that was presented with the sound in the encoding phase using the keys such that the index key corresponded to movie 1, the middle key corresponded to movie 2, the ring key corresponded to movie 3, and the pinkie key corresponded to movie 4. The screen of the four still images along with the instructions was presented until a response was made. All four movie options were associated with sounds from the same sound category presented during the encoding phase. Participants were allowed to take a break between blocks.</p><p id="P28">After the completion of the 12 associative memory task blocks, participants were given the instruction to finish the two unimodal localiser tasks. The unimodal task consisted of 50 trials of fluttered sound clips only, followed by 50 trials of flickered movie clips only. The sound and movie clips were different from the ones used in the associative memory task, to avoid memory components. On each trial, participants were asked to rate how pleasant the sound or movie was by using the keys that thumb key corresponded to 1 (the sound or the movie was very unpleasant), index key corresponded to 2, middle key corresponded to 3, ring key corresponded to 4, pinkie key corresponded to 5 (the sound or the movie was very pleasant).</p><p id="P29">Lastly, participants were instructed to perform a 6-block synchrony judgment task. The task was in the same format as the encoding phase. However, instead of memorising the sound-movie associations, participants were instructed to judge whether each sound-movie pair was presented in synchrony (in-phase, 0° phase offset) or asynchrony (out-of-phase, 180° phase offset). Participants were instructed to indicate asynchrony by pressing the index finger key and indicate synchrony by pressing the middle finger key. Each task block consisted of 16 trials. The 96 sound-movie pairs were different from the sounds and movies used in the encoding phase, to avoid the involvement of memory.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>MEG acquisition and preprocessing</title><p id="P30">Participants’ brain activity was recorded with a 306-channel TRIUX neo MEG system from MEGIN (204 Gradiometers and 102 Magnetometers). An empty room recording was conducted for 3 min before each participant arrived at the lab. Participants’ eye movements and ECG were recorded with two EEG electrodes placed above and below the right eye (vertical eye movements), two electrodes placed 1 cm to the left of the left eye and to the right of the right eye (horizontal eye movements), and two electrodes placed close to the right and left clavicles (ECG). Participants’ eye movements were also recorded using the EyeLink 1000 (SR Research) eye tracker that was positioned ~100 cm from participants’ eyes. Calibration and validation were done by asking participants to follow a dot presented on the screen before starting recording. The online signals (MEG, EOG, ECG and Eye tracking positions) were sampled at 1000 Hz, with a highpass filter at 0.03 Hz, a lowpass filter at 330 Hz and continuous head position tracking (cHPI).

Continuous brain and empty room data were highpass filtered at 1 Hz and lowpass filtered at 148 Hz. Bad channels were marked and head positions were computed. Next, MaxFilter with temporal signal-space separation (tSSS) was applied to interpolate the bad channels, transform different recording runs to the reference head position (the head position that was measured during the unimodal task, except one participant whose unimodal task was done in a separate day. The participant’s multimodal data recording runs were referenced to the head position in the middle of the multimodal runs), and compensate for the signal interference due to head movement. Line noise at 50 Hz, 100 Hz and 150 Hz was removed using a notch filter. Excessive muscle artefacts were identified before applying an independent component analysis (ICA). ICA components suggesting eye movement, heartbeat and muscle artefacts were removed from the data. After cutting data into epochs with 2 s pre-stimulus and 5 s post-stimulus and baseline correction (using data 1 s before stimulus onset), epochs with artefacts were manually rejected by visual inspection. Mean of percentage of rejected trials was 18.8% (range 0 – 56%) in the unimodal trials; mean of percentage of rejected trials was 18.0% (range 1.6% - 45.8%) in the multimodal trials.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>MRI acquisition and MEG source reconstruction</title><p id="P32">Structural magnetic resonance images (MRIs, T1-weighted) were acquired for each participant using a 3T Trio Siemens scanner (3D MPRAGE, 1x1x1 mm resolution).

The individual MRI was aligned to the participant’s digitised scalp landmarks (nasion, left and right preauricular points) and scalp shape digitised before the MEG data recording. Volume source space was set up by a 5 mm grid covering the volume of the brain. The forward solution was constructed based on the volume source space in relation to the head position with respect to the MEG sensors.</p><p id="P33">The linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer was applied to the unimodal data to localise the unimodal visual and auditory 4 Hz steady state evoked activity. The data covariance matrix was estimated using the time window of 0.75 to 2.75 s after stimulus onset. The noise covariance was estimated using the time window of -1 to 0 s before stimulus onset for whitening to combine different channel types (magnetometers and gradiometers). The spatial filter was computed with reduced rank of the data (~70 due to the MaxFilter and ICA applications), hence no further regularisation needed, and optimising the orientation of the sources. The resulting spatial filter was applied to the epochs to project the sensor data to the source space. Then the inter-trial coherence (ITC) was computed between 3.5 and 4.5 Hz at each source using Morlet wavelets with 7 cycles. The ITC averaged between 0.75 and 2.75 s was normalised by subtracting the ITC averaged between - 1 and -0.5 s and dividing by the ITC averaged between -1 and -0.5 s. The normalised ITC at individual source space was morphed to the Freesurfer’s ‘fsaverage’ T1 weighted MRI using the Symmetric Diffeomorphic Registration method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Thus, the source ITC can be grand averaged across participants. The coordinates for auditory and visual regions-of-interest (ROIs) were determined by where the maximum grand average ITC was shown on the fsaverage template MRI.</p><p id="P34">The multimodal source reconstruction followed the same steps as the unimodal source reconstruction except that the data and noise covariance were estimated using the data over left and right hemispheres separately, as suggested by Murzin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> to solve the issue that beamforming analysis has a poor performance in reconstructing highly correlated source activity such as auditory stimulation. The spatial filter that was computed based on the left and right hemispheres was applied to the epochs separated by left and right hemispheres, respectively. After morphing the reconstructed time series to the fsaverage template MRI, data were extracted from the left auditory ROI, the right auditory ROI and the visual ROI, each defined based on the unimodal source reconstruction.</p><p id="P35">To solve the problem of ambiguous dipole orientation caused by the source reconstruction procedures, we manually forced the signs of source reconstructed time series to be consistent across hemispheres, regions and participants. We first computed the grand average unimodal source event-related fields (ERFs) and unimodal sensor ERFs. Since the left auditory source ERFs and the right auditory source ERFs were roughly in-phase, they were averaged to result in one unimodal auditory source ERFs. We extracted the unimodal sensor ERFs from one gradiometer sensor and one magnetometer sensor which showed the strongest evoked power averaged between 3.5 and 4.5 Hz and between 0.75 and 2.75 s. The grand average magnetometer auditory sensor ERFs were in-phase with the visual sensor ERFs. In contrast, the grand average gradiometer auditory sensor ERFs and the auditory source reconstructed ERFs were 180° phase shifted relative to the gradiometer visual sensor ERFs and the visual source reconstructed ERFs. Therefore, we used the magnetometer data as a reference to realign the source unimodal ERFs. The grand average unimodal visual source reconstructed ERFs were flipped 180° to be aligned with the magnetometer sensor ERFs, and the auditory source reconstructed ERFs remained the same. Then each participant’s left and right multimodal auditory source and visual source time series were band pass filtered between 1.5 and 9 Hz before computing the ERFs, to be consistent with the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. The ERFs were normalised by subtracting the mean of the whole time series and then divided by the standard deviation of the time series. The z-score transformed ERFs in each phase offset condition were plotted along with the z-score transformed grand average unimodal source ERFs. The signs of the multimodal time series were flipped by multiplying by -1 if the multimodal data in the 0° phase condition was not in-phase with the unimodal time series in the corresponding modality. The signs were applied to all trials in the corresponding modality, regardless of phase offset condition. To confirm that the flipping procedure did not bias the results in favour of our hypothesis, we did a control analysis to compare the grand average ERFs within visual and auditory modalities between the 0° and 180° phase conditions. The phase difference between the 0° and 180° condition in the auditory ROIs was 180° and the phase difference between the two phase offset conditions in the visual ROI was 0°, which remained constant before and after flipping.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Statistical analysis of MEG source reconstructed data</title><p id="P36">To compute the instantaneous phase differences on average level, the sign-flipped source reconstructed time series in the auditory ROIs were averaged.

The instantaneous phase differences were computed between the auditory and visual ROIs for each phase offset condition. The Rayleigh test and the V test were used to test circular uniformity of the instantaneous phase differences between 1 and 2 s after stimulus onset (to avoid influences of evoked responses at onset and offset) in each phase offset condition.</p><p id="P37">To measure the phase entrainment strength, we applied the Hilbert transformation to the bandpass filtered (1.5 and 9 Hz) single-trial time series at each ROI.

The resultant vector length was averaged across time between 1 and 2 s, resulting in one value per trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). A 2 (phase offset condition) x 2 (subsequent memory performance) repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted on the averaged single-trial phase entrainment values for subsequently remembered and forgotten trials in each phase offset condition.

The phase locking value<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> (PLV) was computed between the seed region and each other voxel by computing the complex time-frequency representations of the whole epoch using Morlet wavelets with 4 cycles. The resultant vector length of phase difference between the seed region and one of the rest voxels was computed across -0.7 and -0.2 s. The PLV was average between 3 and 8 Hz and normalised by the PLV across 3.2 and 3.7 s in each condition. A cluster-based one-sample permutation t-test was conducted with 1000 permutations and a right-tail at alpha level 0.05, masking the ROIs including the left hippocampus, to compare if the difference in the normalised PLV between match and mismatch conditions was significantly higher than 0 in the hippocampus.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Figure S</label><media xlink:href="EMS207081-supplement-Figure_S.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d101aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by grants from the Economic Social Sciences Research Council (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://esrc.ukri.org/">https://esrc.ukri.org/</ext-link>, ES/R010072/1 to S.H. and K.L.S.), and the Medical Research Council Doctoral Training Program in Precision Medicine (MR/W006804/1 to E.M.).

C, recall accuracy was plotted as a function of pre-stimulus alpha power in each phase offset condition, in each half of trials. In each half of trials, trials in each phase offset condition were median split into low alpha power bin (green) and high alpha power bin (red) according to the pre-stimulus alpha power averaged across -0.7 and -0.2 s and averaged across gradiometer and magnetometer sensors in the significant clusters, relative to the mean alpha power between 3.2 and 3.7 s over trials in match and mismatch conditions. The proportion of remembered trials was calculated in the low and high alpha power bins in each phase offset condition. Individual data for each condition is shown in dots connected by grey lines (24 participants).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207081-f004"/></fig></floats-group></article>
