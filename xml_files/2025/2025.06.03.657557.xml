Here we report the development of a candidate GA treatment that is a potent complement modifier (mini-CR1) that addresses consequences of complement over-activation including membrane attack complex (MAC) formation. Mini-CR1 acts a potent cofactor for factor I driven proteolysis of C3b leading to iC3b and then C3dg formation; iC3b itself remains a potent opsonin. As well as inhibiting the alternative complement pathway, mini-CR1 acts as a cofactor for C4b degradation thereby inhibiting the classical pathway. Mini-CR1 prevents MAC formation in activated human serum with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 125 nM. Mini-CR1 was shown to cross human Bruch’s membrane <italic>ex vivo</italic>, implying the ability to cross into the choroidal space. Transduction of RPE cell lines with rAAV2-mini-CR1 (CTx001) resulted in dose-dependent transcription, and both basolateral and apical secretion of mini-CR1 by monolayers of human iPSC derived RPE cells. Mini-CR1 transduction of ARPE19 cells resulted in increased consumption of C3b and iC3b1 in activated culture media and decreased MAC formation on the cell surfaces. Subretinal injection of CTx001 in rats resulted in dose-dependent mini-CR1 production as demonstrated by solid-phase immunoassay. MAC formation following laser induced CNV in a rat model was reduced by 75% in CTx001-treated animals relative to null vector (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). This first generation of CTx001 represents a potent single administration complement modifier capable of effectively addressing pathologic complement amplification in the retina/choroid.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative blinding disease that manifests itself through the progressive destruction of the macula, the central region of the retina responsible for high-resolution vision. The condition, which constitutes the leading cause of blindness in developed countries <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, has two late-stage forms: wet AMD, characterised by the formation of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) and geographic atrophy (GA; also called late dry AMD), in which patches of retinal cell death form. Since the introduction of anti-VEGF therapies as treatments for CNV, the wet form of AMD has been clinically well-managed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In 2023 two treatments for GA that target the complement system called pegcetacoplan and avacincaptad pegol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> were approved by the US FDA. These therapies that are delivered by regular intravitreal injection inhibit complement and have been shown to slow the progression of GA lesions.</p><p id="P5">Evidence for the involvement of the complement system in AMD has emerged over nearly two decades of genetic, biochemical and human tissue studies. The retina (neurosensory retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)) along with the underlying Bruch’s membrane and choriocapillaris (the outer retinal blood supply) are where tissue damage occurs in AMD and there is evidence for complement mediated damage in all these layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, recent evidence suggests that complement overactivation occurs both in the neurosensory retina and the choriocapillaris layer, particularly the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding this layer of capillaries and its associated Bruch’s membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">The complement system consists of the classical, lectin and alternative pathways that all feed into a central C3 amplification loop. The C3 amplification loop feeds into the C5 amplification loop which in turn activates the terminal pathway and membrane attack complex (MAC) formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the C3 amplification loop, C3 is broken down into C3a and C3b. C3b binds to factor B to form a convertase which in turn stimulates more C3b production and downstream activation of the complement pathway <italic>via</italic> C5 cleavage, resulting in C5a production and MAC (C5b9n) formation. The anaphylotoxins C3a and C5a are potent mediators of inflammation and activators of immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Pegcetacoplan and avacincaptad pegol act by inhibiting the breakdown of C3 into C3a and C3b, and C5 into C5a and C5b respectively.</p><p id="P7">The C3 amplification loop is downregulated by the breakdown of C3b by the enzyme complement factor I (FI) into iC3b, a process that requires the presence of a FI cofactor. Cofactors include the soluble proteins factor H (FH) and its truncated variant factor H-like protein (FHL-1), and the cell membrane-bound complement receptor 1 (CR1). FH/FHL-1 allow the breakdown of C3b as far as iC3b, but this breakdown product remains a potent opsonin. In contrast, CR1 permits the further FI-mediated degradation of iC3b into C3c/C3dg towards lesser opsonin potency, a reduction in pro-inflammatory stimuli, and greater inactivation. Variations in the <italic>CFH</italic> gene that result in decreased function of the FH and FHL-1 proteins represent a major genetic risk factor for AMD. In addition, there are 5 FHR proteins (FHR1-5) that inhibit the actions of FH and FHL-1 thereby impeding C3b breakdown and driving complement activation; variations in and around genes encoding the FHR proteins, including <italic>CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR4</italic> and <italic>CFHR5</italic> have been shown to be associated with, and indeed causal in AMD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">To develop a treatment for GA we elected to use the approach of enhancing cofactor activity, thereby generally suppressing complement activation and specifically restoring deficient cofactor activity in patients. We based our approach on CR1, as it has potent cofactor activity and is the only natural complement regulator capable of degrading iC3b. However, the native CR1 protein is a large (~220kDa) glycoprotein comprising thirty complement control protein (CCP) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), whereas we aimed to use a small, secreted protein that can traverse Bruch’s membrane and thereby treat complement overactivation on both the retinal and choriocapillaris sides of Bruch’s membrane. Therefore, we elected to use one of the two elements within CR1 that provide its cofactor activity i.e. CCPs 8-10. Delivery of this protein using subretinal gene therapy has the advantage of being a potential one-off treatment rather than the frequent intravitreal injections required for current therapies. In addition, production and secretion of the protein from RPE cells could help avoid the blood-retina-barrier and support effective distribution to both the retinal and choroidal compartments. To allow the protein to be secreted, the FH signal peptide was added, and the resultant therapeutic protein was called mini-CR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). An rAAV2 self-complimentary vector was developed that encoded mini-CR1 (CTx001), and below the biological activity and therapeutic potential of this vector and mini-CR1 are investigated.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Purified recombinant mini-CR1 protein production in HEK293T cells</title><p id="P9">To produce purified, recombinant mini-CR1 protein, cDNA encoding CCPs8-10 of CR1, which includes a TEV-cleavable N-terminal 6xHis tag, was incorporated into a pcDNA3.1 vector and transfected into HEK293T cells using previously described expression protocols <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.

Animals were anesthetized and placed under a stereoscope (Leica Microsystems) and a drop of iodine was applied on the cornea and allowed to spread evenly (Minims Povidone Iodine 5%, Laboratoire Chauvin S.A.). A sclerotomy in the temporal side was performed with a 30G needle in order to expose the choroid. The cornea was punctured to reduce the intraocular pressure. A microsyringe (Hamilton Bonaduz AG) was filled with rAAV2 particles and introduced into the subretinal space through the exposed choroid. The solution was injected into the subretinal space for 10 sec, and the needle was kept in place for an additional 30 sec before being removed. The success of the injection was confirmed using in vivo SD-OCT imaging (Bioptigen Envisu R2210. Bioptigen Inc./Leica Microsystems). Chloramphenicol ointment was applied after the injection (Oftan Dexa-Chlora, Santen Oy). CNV induction was performed 28 days after administration of rAAV2 particles.

This dual band appearance is due to the presence of two N-glycosylation sites in mini-CR1, with the higher molecular weight band having both occupied, whereas the lower band only has one occupied: the two bands resolve to a single band after treatment with PNGase F to remove glycosylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P18">C3b breakdown assays demonstrated that mini-CR1 at concentrations as low as 62 ng/ml (2.1nM) caused substantial consumption of C3b with the production of iC3b, C3dg and C3c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). As the concentration of mini-CR1 increased the consumption of C3b became more complete, as did the breakdown of iC3b to C3dg and C3c. C4b degradation also occurred in a dose-dependent pattern with increasing doses of mini-CR1 resulting in decreased C4b and an increase in C4d fragments, although the digestion efficiency was lower than for C3b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A and D</xref>). In contrast to mini-CR1 and CR1, other FI cofactors only facilitate the cleavage of C3b into iC3b. This is demonstrated for FHL-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>) and known to be the case with FH and CD46/MCP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Mini-CR1 shares the same capacity as soluble CR1 (a shortened form of CR1 that lacks a cell membrane binding domain found in very low concentration in blood) to drive the breakdown of C3b into C3dg (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Cleavage of C3b into iC3b and beyond by mini-CR1 would effectively inhibit the continuation of the amplification loop of the complement cascade. To confirm this, we used the alternative pathway Wieslab assay to assess the inhibitory effects on complement turnover in human serum; this was demonstrated with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 125 nM with mini-CR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Similarly, we tested serum from other species and saw for Cynomolgus monkey serum an IC<sub>50</sub> of 26 nM, and rat serum 165 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).

This replicates other studies that have found the C3b-binding regions of CR1 to have high C3b-binding affinities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, and it is believed that this is the mechanism by which CR1 can drive the degradation of C3b by FI beyond iC3b <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Mini-CR1 is unaffected by increased levels of FHR proteins</title><p id="P20">FHR proteins have been demonstrated to be elevated in the circulation and/or retinal tissue in AMD and so provide a unique environment and an additional challenge for driving C3b breakdown by modifying co-factor activity.

Bruch’s membrane alone, even without the retina, can present a barrier to therapeutics delivered to the retina (or vitreous) reaching the choriocapillaris.

The self-complementary rAAV2 vectorised mini-CR1 (referred herein as CTx001) showed a dose-dependent increase in mini-CR1 transcription in RPE cells by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Subsequent transduction analysis using CTx001 at 100,000 MOI (multiplicity of Infection) on both RPE cell lines (hTERT-RPE1 and ARPE19) and human primary RPE showed mini-CR1 gene transcription by qRT-PCR (data not shown), and secretion of the mini-CR1 protein into the culture supernatant by Western blot analysis using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against mini-CR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P23">To investigate further the expression, and secretion, of mini-CR1 by RPE cells we employed induced pluripotent stem cell derived RPE cells (iPSC-RPE) that were fully differentiated in a transwell setting; these formed a confluent monolayer and expressed a series of RPE cell tight-junction markers, including occludin and ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). These iPSC-RPE cells were transduced with three separate doses of CTx001 (low, 9x10<sup>8</sup> vg/transwell; medium, 4.5x10<sup>9</sup> vg/transwell; and high, 2.2x10<sup>10</sup> vg/transwell); after seven days mini-CR1 staining was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>) and samples taken from both the apical and basolateral chambers of the transwell system in which the cells were grown. Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) immunoassay showed secretion of mini-CR1 from transduced iPSC-RPE cells both apically and basolaterally (60% and 40% total secreted protein respectively), through the cell-deposited ECM and the transwell membrane itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>), thereby predicting effective delivery of mini-CR1 to both the neurosensory retina and through Bruch’s membrane to the choriocapillaris.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>CTx001 delivered mini-CR1 shows activity in RPE cell line</title><p id="P24">ARPE19 cells were transduced with CTx001 AAV2 (1.78 vg/cell) and maintained for seven days to allow stable expression, secretion and accumulation of mini-CR1 transgene protein. Cells were then incubated with 10% normal human serum to provide all necessary complement components for activation. Complement activation was triggered by addition of 100µg/mL zymosan and 10µg/mL LPS for 16h (to represent the long-term delivery of mini-CR1). LPS and zymosan promote complement activation by providing surfaces that facilitate C3b deposition and subsequent C5b9 formation: Zymosan activates the alternative pathway by serving as a binding surface for C3b, leading to amplification of the cascade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and LPS engages both the classical and alternative pathways, further enhancing complement activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. In both pathways, C3b and C4b contribute to the formation of C5 convertases (C3bBbC3b and C4b2aC3b), which cleave C5 into C5a and C5b. C5b then sequentially binds C6, C7, C8, and multiple C9 molecules, forming C5b9n (MAC), which mediates cell lysis. Mini-CR1, as a cofactor for FI, should augment C3b and C4b proteolysis, reducing C5 convertase formation and thereby limiting C5 cleavage and subsequent C5b9 assembly.</p><p id="P25">CTx001-AAV2 induced mini-CR1 expression in ARPE19 cells resulted in <sup>~</sup>700 ng/mL (<sup>~</sup>24 nM) mini-CR1 in the supernatant as quantified by MSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Mini-CR1 secretion remained consistent regardless of the presence of human serum (grey bars) or serum supplemented with zymosan/LPS (red bars). The increase in mini-CR1 was accompanied by a significant reduction in C3b-iC3b1 levels in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B-C</xref>), measured using an MSD assay that first captures total C3b and then detects the 1H8 epitope, specific for C3b converted to iC3b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. These findings indicate that mini-CR1 in the ARPE19 supernatant actively facilitates the consumption of C3b and iC3b1 derived from human serum.</p><p id="P26">Mini-CR1 bioactivity was further evaluated by staining for C5b9n on the surface of these serum- and zymosan-activated ARPE19 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F-G</xref>). C5b9n deposition was detected using an aE11 neoepitope-specific antibody, which recognizes C9 incorporated into C5b9n complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Incubation of ARPE19 cells with fresh human serum led to spontaneous accumulation of C9 neoepitope staining, reflecting MAC deposition on the cellular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D and F</xref>). The addition of zymosan/LPS further increased C9 neoepitope staining, indicating enhanced C5b9n formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E and G</xref>). In CTx001-infected ARPE19 supernatants, where mini-CR1 reached <sup>~</sup>700ng/mL, a significant reduction was observed in C9 neoepitope staining, measured as cell surface deposits. Since C3b and all necessary complement components for C5b9n formation were provided by the addition of human serum, these results indicate that mini-CR1 not only reduces C3b/iC3b1 levels but also limits C5b9n (MAC) deposition on the cell surface.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Subretinal delivery of CTx001 in a rat laser-induced CNV model</title><p id="P27">Having demonstrated that mini-CR1 inhibits complement by driving the complete degradation of C3b and the degradation of C4b, and that it can be delivered successfully to RPE cells with gene therapy, we aimed to test its efficacy <italic>in vivo</italic>. Rodent laser-induced CNV models were originally optimised for the study of ocular vascular diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and played a major role in the identification of VEGF as a target for ocular neovascularisation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Although not a model for GA in AMD (of which none exist), the laser CNV model results in increased complement turnover and the deposition of MAC within the retina <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. As such, complement inhibitors can be tested in this model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, using MAC deposition as a biomarker of complement turnover in the posterior part of the eye.</p><p id="P28">It has been suggested that the mouse complement system does not behave in the same manner as that of human complement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, and that in fact rat complement makes a far better model of the human system. Therefore, we performed <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy experiments using a rat laser-induced CNV model. Subretinally delivered CTx001 at two different doses, low (1x10<sup>8</sup> vg/eye) and high (5x10<sup>9</sup> vg/eye), were compared to null vector (5x10<sup>9</sup> vg/eye), with nine rats in each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Eye-cup lysates were collected 28 days after subretinal injections, and using the MSD immunoassay a dose-dependent secretion of the mini-CR1 protein was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). A reduction of 75.4% in the level of C5b9n staining was observed in rat eyes treated with high dose CTx001 compared to null vector alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Given that the raw data did not follow a normal distribution direct ANOVA analysis cannot be applied. However, log<sub>10</sub> transformed data fulfil all of the tests for normality (Shapiro-Wilk, D’Agostino-Pearson, Kolmogrov-Smirnoff) and thus ANOVA analysis was applied and showed the 75.4% reduction to be statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">The first treatments approved for GA, pegcetacoplan and avacincaptad pegol, have validated the complement system as a therapeutic target. However, these require monthly or bimonthly intravitreal injections to maintain efficacy. This places considerable burden on both patients and healthcare providers and, while they slow GA lesion growth, they have not, yet, been shown to improve functional outcomes in visual acuity. Therefore, we elected to develop a complement modifier for treating AMD, CTx001, that is delivered as a single surgical treatment and produces a sustained effect, and which targets multiple pathways involved in complement activation and turnover. CTx001 is a gene therapy designed to be delivered by subretinal injection (i.e. creation of a transient bleb between the neurosensory retina and RPE). As it uses an rAAV2 vector, it is expected to predominantly target the RPE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, which then secretes the small, soluble complement inhibitor protein, mini-CR1, in a so-called bio-factory approach.</p><p id="P30">We demonstrated that RPE cells transduced with CTx001 secrete mini-CR1 apically and basolaterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Furthermore, we demonstrate that it inhibits MAC formation on the surface of CTx001 transduced ARPE19 cells and promotes C3b consumption in the cell culture media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Using human Bruch’s membrane <italic>ex-vivo</italic>, we demonstrated that mini-CR1 crosses Bruch’s membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>); it is important to test this using human tissue as there is wide variation in Bruch’s membrane thickness and permeability between species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. The ability of an AMD therapeutic to cross Bruch’s membrane is now recognised as an important consideration for therapeutic design and delivery modality selection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Bruch’s membrane acts as a selective barrier to many proteins, including complement proteins, based on size, hydrodynamic radius, and charge <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>; if complement therapies are delivered to the vitreous or retina, failure to cross Bruch’s membrane may pose a significant barrier to realising their full efficacy potential, as their function will be limited to retinal tissues and they will not treat complement over-activation in the choriocapillaris layer. Therefore, we predict that the transduced RPE cells will continually secrete mini-CR1 that will reach both the retina and choroid, thereby inhibiting complement over-activation in all anatomical compartments where complement over-activation has been demonstrated in AMD.</p><p id="P31">We have shown that mini-CR1 is a potent cofactor for the FI-mediated degradation of C3b, iC3b and C4b, so it targets the alternative and classical complement pathways. The breakdown of C3b to iC3b removes it from the complement C3 amplification loop, thereby decreasing anaphylatoxin production and downstream MAC deposition. Mini-CR1 is an effective co-factor for FI and is more potent than other co-factors including FH and FHL-1, so it can breakdown C3b beyond iC3b to C3dg. This can be explained by its higher affinity to C3b compared to FH and FHL-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Whilst iC3b cannot contribute to the C3 amplification loop, it does act as a strong ligand for CR2, CR3 and CR4 receptors on immune cells, and the resultant interaction with immune cells results in continued opsonisation and remains pro-inflammatory. The further degradation to C3dg by mini-CR1 removes, or greatly reduces, interactions with immune cells, thereby further reducing their potency and the pro-inflammatory microenvironment.</p><p id="P32">Recently, genetically driven elevated levels of circulating FHR proteins have been associated with AMD pathogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Indeed, there is evidence from Mendelian randomisation studies that high FHR protein levels cause AMD. These highly homologous proteins are closely related to the FH protein and share some of its binding partners <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. FHR proteins bind to C3b but cannot bind to FI, so they are not cofactors for FI-mediated C3b breakdown; instead, they can act as complement activators by outcompeting FH and/or FHL-1 binding to C3b, thereby decreasing C3b breakdown and causing excessive complement activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Given that these FHR proteins accumulate in the ECM surrounding the choriocapillaris in human eyes, as well as in drusen within Bruch’s membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, we assessed whether FHR proteins hinder the co-factor activity of mini-CR1. We demonstrated that mini-CR1 is not displaced by supra-physiological levels of FHR proteins in human serum, so mini-CR1 maintains cofactor activity for FI in the presence of FHR proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-E</xref>).</p><p id="P33">There are no satisfactory <italic>in-vivo</italic> models of GA. However, in rodent laser choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) models complement overactivation is observed. This occurs in the region of the retina and choroid, so it is in an anatomically relevant location. We used the rat laser CNV model, and the readout used for the effect of CTx001 was deposition of the terminal complement activation product MAC. We demonstrated significantly reduced levels of MAC deposition following laser CNV induction (75% compared to null vector controls; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). MAC deposition has also been used to evaluate soluble CD59, the native complement regulator that naturally targets MAC cellular deposition directly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, as a potentially therapeutic complement modifier in the eye. In this case, MAC deposition in the laser-induced CNV mouse model is reduced by <sup>~</sup>50% <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Other groups have used CNV lesion size and leakage as a readout, but we believe MAC is a more direct and specific readout of complement overactivation.</p><p id="P34">In summary, we present here a first generation, self-complementary rAAV2 mediated gene therapy (CTx001) that successfully transduces RPE cells resulting in secretion of the soluble complement modifier mini-CR1. This modifier can address both complement-meditated amplification and opsonisation, in retinal tissues, Bruch’s membrane and the choriocapillaris. This ‘one shot and done’ delivery approach, was shown to be very efficacious in reducing complement turnover and can target the complement cascade at the levels of both C3b, iC3b and C4b. CTx001 aims to address the continued unmet need in the therapeutic landscape for intervention in GA.</p><p id="P35">Supplementary information accompanies the manuscript on the Experimental &amp; Molecular Medicine` website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nature.com/emm/">http://www.nature.com/emm/</ext-link>)</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS206199-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d23aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Medical writing and editorial assistance in the development of this manuscript was provided by Jennifer Green, PhD (Green Ink Communications Ltd, UK), funded by Complement Therapeutics.

eye, with a focus on retinal changes in geographic atrophy (GA) and complement activation.</title><p>a) The human retina in the posterior part of the eye consists of the light-sensitive neurosensory retina and RPE, underlying the RPE is Bruch’s membrane and the inner layer of the choroid, called the choriocapillaris. GA occurs in the central part of the retina called the macula. During the formation of GA lesions, which often form in areas with extracellular deposits in Bruch’s membrane called drusen, there is atrophy of the RPE, photoreceptors and the choriocapillaris. This micro-environment is characterized by the presence of activated complement products in and around the extracellular matrix (ECM) of Bruch’s membrane and the choriocapillaris that promotes both inflammation and the ingression of cells including macrophages and microglia. b) Complement can be activated through three separate pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, but the central protagonist remains the deposition of C3b onto cells and ECM. The binding of factor B (FB) and processing by factor D (FD) creates a C3 convertase (C3bBb), which enzymatically cleaves circulating C3 into C3b, feeding into the amplification loop. Subsequently, a C5 convertase is also formed (C3bBbC3b) which cleaves circulating C5 into C5b and triggers the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC, or C5b-9<sub>n</sub>) that causes cell lysis and contributes to a pro-inflammatory environment. Processing of C3 and C5 also produces C3a and C5a: two potent anaphylatoxins, which act as chemoattractants that recruit circulating immune cells to the site of complement activation. Complement activation is regulated by the protease Factor I (FI) and this requires several one of several cofactors including Factor H (FH), Factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1), Membrane co-factor protein (MCP), and Complement receptor 1 (CR1). Increasing concentrations of FHR proteins can interfere with the co-factor activity of FH and FHL-1 (red box). Together with a cofactor, FI cleaves C3b into inactive C3b (iC3b) which can no longer contribute to the amplification loop of complement activation. Both C3b and iC3b are potent opsonins: molecules that label a surface for phagocytosis by the immune cells recruited by the C3a/C5a anaphylatoxins. Opsonisation is finally switched off through further degradation of iC3b by FI into C3dg and eventually C3d: CR1 is the only FI cofactor able to support this step. c) Engagement of the C3a or C5a receptors on recruited immune cells stimulates degranulation and release of proteases and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Opsonin engagement with specific receptors initiates phagocytosis and tissue/ECM remodelling. d) Native CR1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein comprised of 30 complement control protein (CPP) domains organized across four long homologous repeats (LHRs). Mini-CR1 comprises CCPs 8-10 (depicted in red), which contain the C3b/C4b binding domain, the pre-protein form has an N terminal signal peptide to enable secretion from cells.
