Whilst mechanical forces mediated by cadherin-cadherin junctions are known to control the assembly, maturation and stability of epithelia, little is known of the mechanical context associated with neuroepithelial organoid development. In this report, we demonstrate a rapid translocation of YAP to budding neuroepithelial apical junctions, suggesting the build-up of strong compressive forces early on in their development. To study the mechanics of budding rosettes, we designed oil microdroplets stabilised by protein nanosheets displaying cadherin receptors, able to engage with receptors presented by neighbouring neuroepithelial cells, to integrate into embryoid bodies and developing organoids. The resulting artificial cells are able to sustain the formation of mature junctions with neighbouring cells and lead to the recruitment of tight junction maturation proteins such as ZO1. During early budding of neuroepithelial rosettes, artificial cells are found to be rapidly expelled from the developing organoids, further evidencing apical compressive forces. These forces are not opposed by sufficiently strong shear forces from neighbouring cells, or adhesive forces maintaining anchorage to the apical junction, to induce deformation of artificial cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Protein engineering</kwd><kwd>protein nanosheet</kwd><kwd>artificial cells</kwd><kwd>mechanosensing</kwd><kwd>organoid</kwd><kwd>neuroepithelial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Mechanical forces continuously shape tissue development and the correct regulation of tissue architecture and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].

Since the first report of intestinal organoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], a broad range of systems have been proposed, including kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] , eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] and cerebral organoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], amongst many others. Some of these models can be readily embedded in engineered matrices other than Matrigel, which allowed to demonstrate the importance of the mechanics of the organoid microenvironment in the regulation of cell differentiation and patterning of the developing tissue. For example, hydrogels with controlled degradation enable the occurrence and positioning of intestinal crypt development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], whilst lung organoid maturation is regulated by hydrogel mechanics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Probing mechanical forces in organoids is particularly challenging as it is difficult to access contractile or compressive events taking place deep in these cellular assemblies. Beyond direct contact probing techniques, such as force probe microscopy, which are restricted to probing surface mechanics, with limited extrapolation to core mechanics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], optical and magnetic tweezer-based methods allow the probing of deeper mechanics in cellular assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. More recently, microdroplet force sensors have attracted attention as they enable reaching the deeper mechanics of cell assemblies and even embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. For example, this enabled the identification of fluid flow and jamming during tissue morphogenesis and embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] and provided evidence for anisotropic compressive forces shaping the development of the murine incisor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p><p id="P5">YAP and TAZ are transcriptional co-activators playing an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], the correct orchestration of organoid development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] and have a significant impact on brain development at multiple stages, from neural tube formation to maturation of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Deletion of YAP leads to abnormal neural tube closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], its silencing reduces neural crest cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] and the balance of YAP activation regulates progenitor proliferation in the developing neural tube and ultimate neuron density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. In turn, during later cortical and cerebellar development, YAP and TAZ were shown to regulate the shape, architecture and neuronal density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Similarly, conditional knock out of YAP led to impaired retinal progenitor cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, leading to retina developmental defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] and, in optic neuroepithelial development, the drosophila YAP homologue Yki controls the cell cycle arrest preceding conversion to neuroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>].</p><p id="P6">The translocation of YAP from the cytosol to the nucleus has been shown to constitute an important process mediating mechanosensing and the response of cells to substrate mechanics, cyclic strain and extra-cellular matrix geometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], mediated by the Ras family GTPase RAP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. YAP translocation and associated mechanosensing itself is regulated by and regulates the formation of focal adhesion and the assembly and contractility of the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], including in 3D microenvironments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. In turn, these processes were found to impact a broad range of cell phenotypes, including the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into multiple lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>], their remodelling of the pericellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], myogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>] and cardiomyocyte proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], hepatocyte function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] and the balance of expansion and differentiation in the interfollicular epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. In addition, YAP-regulated mechanosensing is not restricted to matrix-mediated processes and equally plays a critical role in the regulation of force sensing by cadherins at adherens junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>].</p><p id="P7">Although the importance of mechanosensing and YAP-mediated signalling and the Hippo pathway are well established in the development of organoids, including intestinal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>], liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>] and lung organoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>], the temporal regulation of YAP translocation during neuroepithelial organoid development has not been studied. However, mechanical stimulation of neuroepithelial organoids using low intensity ultrasounds led to enhanced growth in a YAP-dependent manner (although investigated via direct knock down of YAP) and enhanced the maturation of neural lineages in vitro and upon implantation in mice hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. Stimulated microgravity caused impaired development (reduced proliferation and abnormal architecture) of neuroepithelial organoids, associated with reduced Hippo pathway activation, and rescued by YAP activation via MST1/2 inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. In contrast, confinement in microgrooves led to inhibition of YAP and reduction in lumen formation and FOX2A patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. Similarly, bioreactor culture and differentiation of hPSC-derived primitive neural stem cells led to enhanced neuronal lineage maturation compared to 2D cultures, with associated YAP1 cytoplasmic translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>].</p><p id="P8">Hence, we proposed that mapping the evolution of YAP localisation during early stages of the formation of neuroepithelial organoids could shed light on the evolution of their mechanical context. To probe associated mechanical forces developing during neuroepithelial maturation, we then applied microdroplet force sensors. However, to avoid having to inject microdroplets into organoids, resulting in their dissociation and damage, and to enable direct engagement of cell-cell receptors, such as cadherins, we proposed to develop microdroplet-based artificial cells presenting defined cadherin receptors and enabling embedding into embryoid bodies prior to neuroectoderm induction and differentiation. In this report, we demonstrate the assembly of such artificial cells, their embedding in embryoid bodies and their rapid expulsion from budding neuroepithelia, evidencing the build-up of compressive forces occurring during early rosette formation, associated with YAP translocation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><label>2</label><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>The mechanotransducer YAP translocates upon initiation of neuroepithelial development</title><p id="P9">Neuroepithelial organoids were generated via neuroectoderm induction of embryoid bodies, followed by neuroepithelial differentiation and maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. During this process, the initially smooth spherical embryoid bodies displayed a gradual roughened surface associated with symmetry breaking occurring during the onset of multiple neuroepithelia forming in each organoid, followed by expansion of their size and overall volume of the organoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Videos S1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Immunostaining revealed that neuroepithelial rosette budding occurred from day 1 of differentiation, followed by lumen formation, enlargement and maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), in agreement with literature observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. During this time frame, YAP was found to be initially nuclear and gradually translocated to the cytosol, with relatively little nuclear fraction remaining by day 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-D</xref>). In addition, we found that YAP localisation at this end time point was primarily at the apical junction of developing neuroepithelia.</p><p id="P10">Although apical localisation of YAP, at tight junctions formed by the developing neuroepithelial organoids was not previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>], it is in good agreement with its localisation at apical junctions formed by radial glial cells in the developing ventricular zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] . This is also in good agreement with its reported localisation at the apico-basal junctions of retinal section at E15.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. YAP apical junction distribution was also reported in colonic crypt cells, where its accumulation at adherens and tight junctions was regulated by RAB11A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. Therefore, our observations indicate that YAP remains mainly nuclear following neuroectodermal induction of embryoid bodies, and then gradually translocates to the cytosol during early onset of neuroepithelial rosette budding, following by its accumulation at apical junctions during neuroepithelial rosette maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Considering the importance of YAP cytoplasmic translocation typically observed during cell spreading, response to substrate mechanics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>], including in 3D matrices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], and as a result of mechanical strain and tugging forces generated at cell-cell junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>], our observations suggest that mechanical forces build up in neuroepithelial rosettes, even at early stages of development. Indeed, mechanical regulation of YAP translocation was observed in other contexts. In drosophila, during oogenesis and development of the egg chamber, Yki accumulated at apical junctions of columnar cells and in the nuclei of stretch cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. Similarly, in MDCK cells and keratinocytes, high cell densities resulted in YAP translocation to the cytosol, in a process regulated by Merlin and the contractile circumferential apical actin belt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. Therefore, we proposed that YAP translocation in early stages of neuroepithelial development underpinned the build-up of mechanical forces.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2.2</label><title>Protein engineering to design artificial cells</title><p id="P12">Microdroplets stabilised by protein nanosheets have been demonstrated to enable cell adhesion, spreading and the maintenance of cell phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. In these systems, the control of interfacial shear mechanics, viscoelasticity and toughness, in addition to the presentation of suitable adhesive ligands, enabled corresponding interfaces to resist cell mediated contractile forces, allowing cell spreading and the downstream integrin-mediated regulation of cell proliferation and stemness retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>]. In turn, this enabled the long-term maintenance of mesenchymal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>], the control of their differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>], the proliferation of induced pluripotent stem cells and direct induction of differentiation to cardiomyocytes, without further processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>], and the in vitro expansion of haematopoietic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>].</p><p id="P13">Here, we proposed the design of microdroplet-based artificial cells, stabilised by protein nanosheets, controlling interfacial mechanics (mimicking cortical mechanics), and presenting cadherins to mimic cell-cell adhesive cues and allow the direct capture and integration of microdroplets by cellular assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). To build artificial cells with controlled architecture and mechanics, we selected albumin as a scaffolding amphiphilic protein for the stabilisation of microdroplets, allowing a broad range of interfacial mechanics to be achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>] , and introduced single biotin residues recombinantly via an Avi tag (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S1-2</xref>). Subsequent binding of streptavidin and biotinylated Protein G was proposed to enable the capture of Fc fusion cadherins, such as E- and N-cadherins. Defined biotinylation was selected to avoid crosslinking within the protein layer. To ensure that the tag selected was accessible for subsequent binding, without compromising the self-assembly of albumin to the surface of droplets, we selected the N-terminus of bovine serum albumin (BSA), which was shown by molecular dynamics simulations to remain dangling in the bulk aqueous phase following adsorption of this protein to hydrophobic surfaces such as graphite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>]. This is in agreement with the position of the Sudlow site II of BSA, a hydrophobic binding pocket present at the C-terminus, proposed to unfold upon adsorption at hydrophobic interfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>]. To validate that the small modification made to BSA (Avi tag with glycine bridge) would not impact on the globular assembly of BSA, we carried out structure prediction using AlphaFold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>], confirming an excellent retention of the bundled α-helices of native BSA and the accessibility of the biotin residue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To produce relatively high concentrations of the selected recombinant BSA (rBSA), we opted for yeast expression in <italic>P. pastoris,</italic> as this host has been demonstrated to support the expression of albumins in high yields and scales, with excellent folding and structure retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>]. We selected the PIC9K vector for expression as this features an AOX1 promoter and α-factor secretion signal, allowing the release of the produced protein in the culture medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>]. Successful transformants were identified at high concentrations of G418 to ensure sufficient copies of the rBSA plasmid, normally resulting in higher protein yields. Successful transformation and supernatant expression/secretion was achieved in good yields, in agreement with the literature for albumins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>], followed by purification of the resulting rBSA-Avi via Ni-NTA column (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S3-5</xref>). The resulting rBSA-Avi was then converted into rBSA-Bt using recombinant BirA, with biotin conversion levels measured &gt; 90%.</p><p id="P15">The resulting proteins were characterised by mass spectrometry, confirming the increase in molecular weight of rBSA-Avi and rBSA-Bt, compared to native BSA, and implying comparable glycosylation levels compared to this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, circular dichroism confirmed the high α-helix content typical of BSA, which adopts a highly globular conformation with tightly bundled helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>]. Finally, the dual activity of the rBSA-Bt generated was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). To model the fluorinated oil surface targeted to form microdroplets, fluorinated thiol monolayers were generated at the surface of SPR chips and rBSA-Bt was directly adsorbed to these interfaces, in PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). In agreement with the amphiphilic properties of globular albumins, rBSA-Bt rapidly adsorbed to fluorinated monolayers, to surface densities of 97 ± 8 ng/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). This is in good agreement with BSA adsorption levels reported for fluorinated monolayers, near 120 ng/cm<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>], indicating the formation of monolayers with moderate packing. Upon subsequent adsorption of streptavidin, biotinylated Protein G and Fc-tagged E-Cadherin, successive rapid adsorption profiles were observed, with surface densities of 28 ± 2, 61 ± 6 and 26 ± 3 ng/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Hence, our data confirms the formation of monolayers of cadherins captured at the surface of protein nanosheets, with moderately dense packing.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.3</label><title>Protein nanosheet assembly to control artificial cell formation</title><p id="P16">The adsorption of protein nanosheets at fluorinated oil interfaces was investigated next. To quantify protein adsorption in situ and the mechanical properties of the resulting assemblies, interfacial shear rheology was carried out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Upon injection of BSA or rBSA-Bt in the aqueous phase, the interfacial shear storage and loss moduli were found to increase from 0.1-1 mN/m to 4-5 mN/m and 1-2 mN/m, respectively, with the increasing gap between these two moduli and associated reduction in interfacial tan δ, confirming the formation of viscoelastic assemblies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). This was further confirmed by analysis of the frequency sweeps obtained after assemblies of albumin nanosheets, displaying modest changes in interfacial shear mechanics, for both proteins, over a broad frequency range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), in agreement with interfacial shear rheology previously reported for globular albumins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>]. Interestingly, upon introduction of streptavidin (after washing of excess rBSA-Bt), no further increase in modulus was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>), implying that the network mechanics is primarily dominated by the underlying recombinant albumin nanosheet formed, and that streptavidin binding did not induce further crosslinking in this assembly. Although this is somewhat surprising as streptavidin tetramers can bind 4 biotin residues with high affinities, this likely reflects the high excess of streptavidin molecules, rapidly saturating available biotin residues. The distance between biotin residues may also be too large for significant crosslinking of the albumin network, reflecting the modest packing density of albumin molecules (packed monolayers are estimated between 190 and 630 ng/cm<sup>2</sup>, depending on the protein orientation).</p><p id="P17">The formation of microdroplets by rBSA-Bt was next examined by microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Emulsions were formed by homogenisation of aqueous solutions containing albumins at a total concentration of 1 mg/mL with Novec 7500 oil. The mixing of rBSA-Bt with native BSA was investigated first, to identify whether biotin surface densities were a limiting factor for the subsequent binding of streptavidin. We observed a clear linear relationship between the concentration of rBSA-Bt and the ultimate antibody fluorescence intensity (pesenting Fc domains, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>), implying that the density of biotin residues, for emulsions formed in the presence of rBSA-Bt alone, was not saturated. This is in agreement with the SPR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D-E</xref>), which indicated higher molar surface densities of rBSA-Bt compared to streptavidin. Therefore, 1 mg/mL rBSA-Bt solutions were selected for further evaluation, to maximise streptavidin surface densities and the impact of the concentration of streptavidin was next examined.</p><p id="P18">Although the ultimate fluorescence intensity was found to increase significantly when the streptavidin bulk concentration was increased from 10 μg/mL to 25 μg/mL, it only increased modestly when the concentration was further increased to 50 μg/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Therefore, an intermediate concentration was selected for further evaluation. Such low concentration, compared to the mg/mL concentration of albumins typically required for the stabilisation of emulsions is in agreement with the surface densities measured by SPR. Indeed, for 10 μm droplets, the weight of proteins required to stabilise the equivalent of 1 mL of oil phase is 0.44 mg. Therefore, at a 2/1 volume ratio of aqueous phase to oil, a modest excess of protein is used to stabilise emulsions. However, at a streptavidin density of 28 ng/cm<sup>2</sup>, compared to the 97 ng/cm<sup>2</sup> measured for rBSA-Bt, the amount of streptavidin required to saturate the surface of 1 mL of 10 μm droplets is expected to be 126 μg. Therefore, in the conditions used for the functionalisation of artificial cells with the ligands of interest (10 μL of droplets for 100 μL of protein solution), a concentration of 25 μg/mL corresponds to a two-fold excess. Such efficiency is in good agreement with the very high binding affinity of streptavidin for biotin.</p><p id="P19">Finally, the impact of the concentration of biotinylated protein-G on the capture of Fc-tagged protein was characterised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). The intensity of antibody captured increased gradually as the concentration of ProteinG-Bt increased to 100 μg/mL and then reached a quasi-plateau at higher concentrations. This is again in good agreement with the surface density of ProteinG immobilised at the surface of nanosheets, as determined by SPR (61 ng/cm<sup>2</sup>). At such density, the mass of ProteinG required to saturate the surface of 1 mL of 10 μm droplets would be 280 μg and, at 100 μg/mL, with 10/1 volume ratio of aqueous to oil phases, a near four-fold excess was used in our experimental protocol. This larger excess required, compared to that observed for streptavidin adsorption, is to be expected considering the weaker binding affinity of subsequent biotin residues binding to streptavidin.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>2.4</label><title>Embedding of artificial cells within embryoid bodies</title><p id="P20">The assembly of embryoid bodies with artificial cells was next examined. To do so, iPSCs were detached and resuspended with artificial cells functionalised with E-cadherin, N-cadherin or a mixture of both receptors, and allowed to adhere and form approximately 400-500 μm cellular assemblies. During this process, cells suspended at the bottom of a low adhesive plate were found to gradually make contact with other cells and cluster into a homogenous cell mass, with some artificial cells remaining entrapped (when presenting E-cadherins), whereas others were left at the bottom of the dish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Incomplete uptake is to be expected from the higher density of the microdroplets formed, resulting in faster sedimentation and accumulation at the bottom of the culture dish. Following induction and differentiation, some of the droplets could be clearly seen at the periphery of developing organoids, whether at the surface or in the cell assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The density of the core of the organoids did not allow resolving the deeper integration of artificial cells.</p><p id="P21">Confocal microscopy images, using tagged streptavidin to identify artificial cells, were used to evaluate their degree of integration within embryoid bodies (prior to induction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). The number of artificial cells per organoid was quantified for artificial cells presenting different types of cadherin receptors. In the absence of cadherins, no artificial cells could be observed. However, in the case of E-cadherin presenting artificial cells, high densities were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). In the case of N-cadherin-functionalised microdroplets, the densities were almost halved but recovered when mixed E- and N-cadherin presenting nanosheets were used to stabilise artificial cells. In addition, investigation of the separate sections revealed that, although relatively high densities of N-cadherin artificial cells were observed in the max projection of confocal stacks (to maximised 3D visualisation), most of these objects were found at the surface of the embryoid bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>), with few found in the core. In contrast, E-cadherin presenting artificial cells were found both in the core and at the surface of cell assemblies. This observation is in good agreement with the expression of E-cadherin by iPSCs, whereas N-cadherin is not significantly expressed until ectodermal induction and neuroepithelial differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>].</p><p id="P22">Finally, we examined confocal microscopy images of embryoid bodies prior to induction and the recruitment of the protein associated with the formation of tight junctions presenting ZO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). Although this protein was clearly recruited at junctions between cells forming the embryoid body, no clear recruitment was observed at the surface of E-cadherin presenting artificial cells, as was particularly apparent when inspecting intensity profiles of streptavidin and ZO1. Hence artificial cells were recruited within embryoid bodies and retained prior to ectodermal induction but did not induce the formation of mature cell-cell junctions. In addition, all artificial cells observed were spherical, with no evidence for significant deformation, implying that relatively little local stress was accumulating within embryoid bodies, which could have resulted in the distortion of microdroplets, as observed in the context of other cellular assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S7"><label>2.5</label><title>Impact of artificial cells on neuroepithelial organoid development</title><p id="P23">The fate of artificial cells during neuroepithelial differentiation was examined by induction of ectoderm commitment, followed by differentiation, as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>. At day 3 post induction, organoids displayed comparable numbers of neuroepithelial rosettes, in all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-B</xref>). In addition, budding neuroepithelial rosettes displayed normal morphologies, with dimensions insensitive to the presence of artificial cells or the type of receptors they presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Further culture of organoids until day 9 led to the maturation of neuroepithelial organoids, with expression of SOX2 at neuroepithelia and initiation of the differentiation marker TUJ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Therefore, neuroepithelial organoids initiated from artificial cell-loaded embryoid bodies were successfully induced and continued to mature normally, irrespective of the type of cadherin displayed, validating the proposed approach to introduce these objects within complex organoids, without disrupting their development.</p><p id="P24">However, examination of the stacks did not reveal retention of artificial cells within neuroepithelia, and instead they accumulated in between rosettes, regardless of the type of receptor presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Further examination of the optical slices taken from confocal stacks confirmed that artificial cells were expelled from the budding neuroepithelial rosettes at day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Interestingly, at this time point, ZO1 was found to accumulate at the surface of artificial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Although ZO1 localised at much higher densities at apical junctions in developing neuroepithelia, it was not recruited at lateral cell-cell junctions to the same extent to recruitment to artificial cells. Therefore, these data indicate that, upon induction of neuroepithelia formation, artificial cells are able to form junctions with surrounding cells, resulting in the accumulation of ZO1. However, despite the formation of junctions mimicking cell-cell interactions, artificial cells were rapidly expelled from developing neuroepithelia and localised in between budding rosettes. In addition, we could not see any evidence of droplet deformation, with all droplets observed appearing spherical and symmetrical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Our data suggest that apical compressive forces arising within neuroepithelia rapidly expel artificial cells, resulting in their accumulation at their periphery.</p><p id="P25">To investigate the impact of artificial cell mechanics on their retention in neuroepithelia, we coated rigid silica microparticles (20 μm) with mixtures of E- and N-cadherins, using the same protocol used to stabilise artificial cells (silica particles were coated with hydrophobic octyl silane monolayers). Similarly to what was observed with artificial cells, the silica particles were rapidly expelled from the organoids, with few particles remaining adhered in between neuroepithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). This implies that rigid particles, as well as compliant droplets, are expelled from developing neuroepithelia, likely as a result of rapid proliferation in basal layers, and a build-up of apical compressive forces correlating with YAP cytoplasmic translocation. However, examination of ZO1 localisation in confocal slices revealed no association at the surface of microparticles, unlike what was observed with artificial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). This suggested that, although &gt;20 μm cadherin-presenting objects were extruded from neuroepithelia regardless of their mechanical properties, the soft cell-cell adhesive interfaces of artificial cells may promote further maturation and biomimicry of cell-cell junctions.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><label>2.6</label><title>Apical compressive forces expel artificial cell during neuroepithelial organoid early development</title><p id="P26">To further investigate the expulsion process evidenced with large artificial cells and microparticles (30 μm and 20 μm, respectively), we investigated the fate of 8 μm artificial cells and 5 μm silica particles. Indeed, mechanical forces exerted on smaller particles are expected to lead to slower expulsion. At day 3 post induction, a relatively large number of E/N-cadherin presenting artificial cells and silica particles remained within organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). Compared to the densities measured initially within embryoid bodies, a significant reduction was still observed, indicating that, even for smaller objects, compressive forces resulted in the effective expulsion of a large proportion of artificial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, many particles and artificial cells were found remaining in rosettes, indicating a slower expulsion process. No significant differences were observed between the densities of artificial cells and those of silica nanoparticles remaining in organoids.</p><p id="P27">To investigate the role of cytoskeleton assembly and contractility on the droplet/particle expulsion process, organoids were cultured in the presence of the ROCK inhibitor Y27632, and the myosin contractility inhibitor blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). These inhibitors were applied at the maximum concentration for which we observed early nucleation of ZO1 clusters underpinning early neuroepithelial rosette development (20 μM for Y27632 and 10 μM for blebbistatin). However, we note that for both inhibitors, beyond 3 days of culture, no further development of neuroepithelial rosettes could be observed. Therefore, these conditions only correspond to the perturbation of the very early onset of budding but are too disruptive to neuroepithelial development to continue further maturation.</p><p id="P28">In these conditions, we observed significantly higher artificial cells and silica particles being retained in day 3 organoids compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C and E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). In addition, we observed a significant number of artificial cells/particles being retained within neuroepithelial rosettes. This was quantified through the distance measured between the centre of the droplet/particle and the edge of the closest ZO1 positive cluster, corresponding to apical junctions of budding neuroepithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). In the presence of Y27632 or blebbistatin, the distance between artificial cells or microparticles and ZO1 clusters reduced significantly compared to untreated controls. A reduction in distance was also observed when comparing blebbistatin-treated organoids seeded with silica particles to those seeded with artificial cells. In these latter conditions, many artificial cells and silica microparticles were observed in direct contact with ZO1 clusters, or separated by 1 cell only, together indicating that the expulsion process had been considerably slowed down by disruption of actin assembly and myosin contractility. However, whether in control conditions or in the presence of inhibitors, the shape of artificial cells was spherical, with no evidence for anisotropic stress exerted at the surface of artificial cells. This contrasts with the significant deformation of droplets injected in cell aggregates and embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Hence, our data suggest that internal actomyosin cytoskeleton-dependent stress building up within budding neuroepithelial organoids results in the expulsion of droplets and particles, with low resistance from peripheral basal cells/cell bodies, which would otherwise result in significant deformation of artificial cells, or as these are themselves expelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). This also implies modest shear forces exerted by surrounding cells, so that droplet/particle expulsion occurs faster than the accumulation of local stress that could result in artificial cell deformation. Associated shear forces would be expected to increase significantly upon maturation of cell-cell junctions. Therefore, we further examined the developing organoids at day 3, focusing on the recruitment of ZO1.</p><p id="P29">We examined single optical sections taken from embryoid bodies (day 0) and organoids (day 3) and profiled the recruitment of ZO1 against the position of artificial cells or silica particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F-H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). Prior to induction, significant ZO1 recruitment was observed at the surface of artificial cells, often at higher densities to ZO1 distribution at neighbouring cell-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). In comparison, relatively little ZO1 was recruited at the surface of silica microparticles. Upon induction of neuroepithelial development (at day 3), ZO1 localisation at the surface of artificial cells was significantly reduced, although still apparent, and remained basal for silica microparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F-G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). A reduction of ZO1 recruitment and increase in apical compressive forces could account for the expulsion of droplets without significant distortion of their spherical shape.</p><p id="P30">Interestingly, in the presence of ROCK and myosin inhibitors, we observed significant recruitment of ZO1 at the surface of artificial cells at day 3 post-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>), compared to empty carrier. This implies that, although myosin-mediated contractility and F-actin cytoskeleton assembly are not critical to recruit ZO1 at cell-cell junctions (at the concentration selected), they can significantly strengthen ZO1 recruitment, resulting in its translocation to more contractile cellular junctions (although the direct measurement of cell-mediated contractile forces was not possible). In addition, the absence of significant ZO1 recruitment at the surface of silica microparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>) suggested that interfacial viscoelasticity (absent in the latter particles), and associated clustering or rearrangement of ligands, could play an important role in the strengthening of cell-cell adhesions and associated junction maturation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="conclusions"><label>3</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P31">The recreation of cellular and sub-cellular components enabling the capture of key cellular functions with synthetic building blocks offers striking opportunities for the understanding of living systems, but also the engineering of novel biotechnologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>]. In this respect, extra-cellular matrix engineering has enabled exquisite control over a broad range of parameters, including integrin adhesions, growth factor stimulation, enzymatic degradation and mechanics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>]. Recently, a range of approaches have been proposed to allow recreating cell-cell interactions. However, introducing such cues as part of a matrix fails to capture the interfacial confinement, geometry and viscoelastic properties associated with ligands and receptors embedded in cell membranes. Artificial cells enabling to recreate such properties could allow to recreate some of the processes critical to the regulation of stem cell phenotype and the harnessing of their properties for regenerative medicine.</p><p id="P32">The present work demonstrates the formation of artificial cells able to trigger ZO1 recruitment in embryoid bodies and neuroepithelial organoids. The lack of recruitment to rigid silica particles highlights the importance of interfacial viscoelasticity in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion maturation. How viscoelasticity impacts on cadherin recruitment is unclear, but it is possible that such interfacial properties enable the clustering of ligands, whilst balancing tugging forces generated at developing junctions. Indeed, stress generated at cell-cell junctions are known to play a critical role on planar polarity in epithelia and tissue morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. In turn, using artificial cells as force sensors, the present study provides evidence for apical compressive forces rapidly building up in the developing neuroepithelium, resulting in their expulsion to basal and peripheral compartments of organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). As the size of artificial cells increases, we propose that the speed at which they are expulsed increases. Similarly, perturbation of cytoskeleton assembly and contractility results in a reduction in compressive forces and a reduced rate of expulsion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). The lack of deformation of artificial cells suggests weak basal shear forces, resulting in expulsion without significant deformation. However, the role of surface tension and interfacial shear mechanics, which could mimic abnormally strong cortical mechanics (in comparison to interfacial mechanics in normal cell membranes), could also account, at least partly for the phenomena observed.</p><p id="P33">Overall, the joint observations that the translocation of the mechano-transducer YAP occurs rapidly upon induction of neuroepithelial organoid formation and that artificial cells and microparticles are rapidly expelled from developing neuroepithelia provides strong evidence for the occurrence of apical mechanical forces shaping the cerebral organoid early development. Although the origin of the tissue pressure and stresses that result in such morphological changes remains unclear, it is likely to be associated with the rapid cell expansion taking place, and cell divisions occurring at apical junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. As cell compression increases in the apical compartment, nuclei and cell bodies are gradually expelled outwards. In normal developing neuroepithelial organoids these forces are opposed by the retention of cell adhesion at apical junctions, leading to columnarisation and priming cell positioning for further differentiation and maturation. The combination of molecular biology and bioengineering tools, such as artificial cells, will allow shedding further light on these processes, in a human context.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><label>4</label><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials"><label>4.1</label><title>Materials</title><p id="P34">JM109 from Promega, Rosetta D3 (Novagen) from Sigma and DH5α <italic>E. coli</italic> cells from NEB.

As a qualitative method, 5 μL of 10 μM rBSA-Bt was added to 10 μL of 2x SDS buffer, the sample was heated at 95°C for 5 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. 5 μL of 1 mg/mL streptavidin was added and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The sample was run on an SDS-page gel at 220V for 30 min and the bands were observed for an increase in molecular weight. As a secondary qualitative method, emulsions were generated with the rBSA-Bt, washed with buffer and then incubated with 50 μg/mL FITC-Streptavidin and imaged (at 488 nm) to verify streptavidin binding.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><label>4.8</label><title>Circular dichroism (CD) and mass spectrometry</title><p id="P41">rBSA-Bt protein was concentrated to 150 μM using a 30 kDa MWCO PES concentrator (Vivaspin) run at 4000xg and subsequently 1 mL of protein was loaded onto a S200 10/300 SEC column (Cytvia), preequilibrated with 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4, the flow rate was set to 0.25 mL/min and run overnight. This step was completed to exchange the buffer from PBS into IPO<sub>4</sub> - a buffer that will not strongly absorb in the UV wavelength range of 180-300 nm. The CD instrument was purged with nitrogen gas. The temperature was set to 20°C. The photomultiplier voltage was measured at 300 nm with a sample chamber containing IPO<sub>4</sub> buffer. 300 μL of 5 μM protein was transferred into a cuvette and loaded into the CD instrument (with a pathlength of 0.1 cm) and a wavelength scan protocol was conducted in the 180-300 nm range.

Gold coated SPR chips measuring 10 x 12 mm in size were plasma oxidised for five minutes using the Henniker Plasma HPT-200 machine. Then treated in a 5% methanolic solution of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanethiol overnight at room temperature. This generated a fluorinated monolayer which served as a model to mimic the fluorinated Novec-7500 oil. The chips were then washed once with water and dried in air prior to mounting. The sample sensor chip was then mounted onto a plastic support frame, docked and primed once with PBS. Once primed the signal was allowed to stabilise to a stable baseline. rBSA-Bt (1 mg/mL) was then loaded into the sample loop with a micropipette and injected at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. Once injection had finished, the surface of the sample chip was washed with PBS for 10 min at a flow rate of 10 μL/min followed by the subsequent injection of streptavidin (50 μg/mL).
