Here, we analysed the dairy cow gut virome across four life stages—calf, heifer, dry adult, and lactating adult. Using hybrid sequencing, we assembled 30,321 viral operational taxonomic units, including 1,338 complete genomes representing mostly novel lineages. Virome composition shifted dramatically with life stage, transitioning from low-diversity, temperate-dominated communities in calves to high-diversity, lytic-dominated communities in adults. Virome transitions paralleled but showed distinct dynamics from bacterial community development, with viral and bacterial diversity negatively correlated during drying-off. Dry cows exhibited elevated viral loads relative to their bacterial hosts. We identified 26 viral sequences targeting the methanogen <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic>, absent in calves but present in adults. These findings reveal the dynamic nature of ruminant gut viral communities and highlight phages’ potential regulatory role during critical life transitions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The farming of cattle constitutes 50% of global livestock units, with an estimated 265 million dairy cows worldwide, underscoring the sector’s pivotal role in food production, agricultural economics, and environmental health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Throughout a dairy cow’s life, dramatic physiological and nutritional transitions occur that profoundly reshape gut microbial communities, with likely impacts on health, productivity, and environmental footprint.</p><p id="P3">Dairy cows experience several distinct developmental stages, each characterised by unique dietary and physiological conditions—from milk-fed calves with developing rumens, to heifers transitioning to high-fiber diets, to lactating and dry adults with cyclical shifts in nutritional requirements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. These transitions create ecological opportunities for microbial community reorganisation and potentially periods of enhanced vulnerability to dysbiosis.</p><p id="P4">While bacterial community dynamics across these life stages have received increasing attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, our understanding of the viral community—the virome—remains limited, particularly for the intestinal tract.

Illumina sequencing yielded ~277 Gb of data (median library sizes: calves 1.7 Gb, heifers 14.9 Gb, dry adults 16.5 Gb, lactating adults 19.4 Gb, overall 14.3 Gb), and a pooled Nanopore library produced ~104 Gb. Implementation of a short-read exclusion kit for Nanopore sequencing improved median read lengths (6.0-6.9 kb per flow cell) relative to sequencing without exclusion (1.7-3.0 kb per flow cell), without reducing data yields (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Complementary bacterial metagenomes were generated from the same samples, producing ~162 Gb of sequence data (median library sizes: calves 8.6 Gb, heifers 7.8 Gb, dry adults 8.1 Gb, lactating adults 7.7 Gb, overall 8.0 Gb).</p><p id="P8">Viral contigs were assembled, filtered and de-replicated to produce 30,321 unique vOTUs that are approximate to viral species, ranging from 1.5 kb to 1.2 Mb in length with mean and median lengths of 25.3 and 16.9 kb, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Quality assessment using CheckV classified 1,338 vOTUs as complete, 3,898 as high-quality, 6,497 as medium-quality, 18,587 as low-quality, and one as undetermined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Manual annotation checks confirmed the absence of non-viral elements within the 1,338 complete genomes.</p><p id="P9">Taxonomic analysis of the 1,338 complete genomes revealed striking novelty in the bovine gut virome. At the level of Realm, 1,249 complete genomes were classified as <italic>Duplodnaviria</italic> (dsDNA viruses; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) and 89 as <italic>Monodnaviria</italic> (ssDNA viruses; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Of these, only 105 complete genomes fell within previously described families—<italic>Intestiviridae</italic> (n=1), <italic>Steigviridae</italic> (n=4), <italic>Salasmaviridae</italic> (n=10), <italic>Microviridae</italic> (n=84), <italic>Autotranscriptviridae</italic> (n=5), and <italic>Peduoviridae</italic> (n=1). The remaining 1,233 complete genomes (92%) did not fall within known families, often forming deeply branching monophyletic clades lacking ICTV-classified members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2AB</xref>), highlighting the exceptional novelty of the bovine gut virome. The distinct clustering patterns and deep branches in the phylogenetic analysis suggest these genomes likely represent numerous novel viral families and potentially new orders awaiting formal taxonomic classification.</p><p id="P10">Lifestyle prediction indicated that 598 complete genomes (44.7%) were likely temperate phages capable of integration into host genomes, while the remaining 740 (55.3%) were predicted to be obligately lytic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Host prediction was possible for only 105 of the complete genomes, with the vast majority (1,233) lacking a confident host assignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Among those with predicted hosts, bacteria classified within the <italic>Firmicutes</italic> were the most commonly targeted phylum (n=46), followed by <italic>Bacteroidota</italic> (n=37), <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> (n=16), and <italic>Patescibacteria</italic> (n=3). At the family level, viruses targeting bacteria within the Bacteroidaceae (n=18), Ruminococcaceae (n=8), and Enterobacteriaceae (n=6) were most frequent, consistent with the prevalence of these bacterial families in the ruminant gut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Notably, many of the predicted hosts represent important members of the cow gut microbiota, including <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> (n=4), <italic>Bacteroides</italic> (n=11), <italic>Prevotella</italic> (n=7), and <italic>Escherichia</italic> (n=4).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Life-Stage Transitions Drive Distinct Viral Community Profiles</title><p id="P11">Of the 20 faecal viromes sequenced, two calf samples did not meet our vOTU detection threshold (≥1× coverage over 75% of vOTU length) and were excluded, leaving 18 viromes for downstream analyses. Parallel bacterial metagenomic data were available for these samples, allowing us to examine both bacterial and viral community dynamics across the four major life stages.</p><p id="P12">Alpha diversity analyses revealed stark differences between calves and adults for both viral and bacterial communities. Calf viromes exhibited markedly lower Shannon diversity (mean 2.49 ± 0.45) compared to heifers (7.33 ± 0.52), dry adults (7.68 ± 0.16), and lactating adults (6.58 ± 1.97) (Kruskal-Wallis test, X<sup>2</sup> = 12.68, p = 0.005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). This pattern was even more pronounced when examining community evenness through Inverse Simpson index, with calves showing extremely low evenness values (mean 5.73 ± 1.40) compared to the substantially more balanced viral communities in heifers (270.63 ± 105.51), dry adults (317.80 ± 85.03), and lactating adults (130.77 ± 98.85) (Kruskal-Wallis test, X<sup>2</sup> = 12.15, p = 0.007; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons using Dunn’s test with Bonferroni correction confirmed significant differences in evenness between calves and each adult group (p &lt; 0.01 for all comparisons), while differences among adult groups were not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05), despite the notably higher evenness in dry adults. The dramatic &gt;50-fold increase in evenness from calves to adults indicates not just greater viral richness but a fundamental restructuring towards communities where abundance is more equitably distributed across viral taxa. This pattern was mirrored in nucleotide-level variation, with adults displaying substantially greater micro-diversity than calves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The bacterial communities showed similar life-stage stratification, though with an intriguing inverse relationship to viral diversity—while viral diversity increased during the transition from lactating to dry adult status, bacterial diversity decreased. This negative correlation between bacterial and viral diversity (Spearman’s rho = –0.69, P=0.0084) was particularly pronounced during the drying-off period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>), suggesting potential ecological interactions between the two communities.</p><p id="P13">Beta-diversity analyses reinforced the distinctiveness of life-stage communities in both viral and bacterial domains. Using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, both viral and bacterial communities showed significant clustering by life stage in nested PERMANOVA tests (999 permutations). For viral communities, the primary division between calves and adults explained 10.3% of the total variation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.10, P = 0.001), while differences among the three adult stages (heifers, dry, and lactating) explained an additional 17.4% of variation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.17, P = 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3EF</xref>). Bacterial communities demonstrated an even stronger age-related structuring, with the calf-adult division explaining 47.8% of total variation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.48, P = 0.001)—more than four times the proportion explained in the viral dataset. Differences among adult stages contributed an additional 15.1% of bacterial community variation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.15, P = 0.023; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3GH</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Testing for homogeneity of multivariate dispersions confirmed that these differences were driven by distinct community centroids rather than within-group dispersion effects for both viral (permutest, P = 0.352) and bacterial communities (permutest, P = 0.554). The strong association between viral and bacterial community structures was confirmed by both Mantel test (r = 0.671, P = 0.001) and Procrustes analysis (correlation = 0.740, P = 0.003), indicating coordinated ecological shifts in both domains across life stages. The compositional changes in viral communities closely parallel those in bacterial communities, suggesting interconnected ecological dynamics between these two components of the bovine gut ecosystem.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Ecological Shift from Temperate to Lytic Viral Communities During Development</title><p id="P15">The composition of viral communities differed dramatically between calves and adults. Calf viromes contained a higher proportion of temperate phages (49.15 ± 26.41%) compared to heifers (23.32 ± 6.40%), dry adults (23.67 ± 3.13%), and lactating adults (19.48 ± 9.33%), though this difference did not reach statistical significance (Kruskal-Wallis test, X<sup>2</sup> = 1.69, df = 3, p = 0.639; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). This suggests a potential shift toward predominantly lytic viral communities in adults (&gt;76% of viral abundance), which may represent an ecological transition during ruminant development, though larger sample sizes would be needed to confirm this pattern statistically.</p><p id="P16">Taxonomic assignment alongside known viruses further supported this developmental transition. The relative abundance of vOTUs not assigned to known genera was lowest in calves (90.59 ± 9.33%) compared to adult animals, with heifers (98.99 ± 0.53%), dry adults (98.53 ± 0.50%), and lactating adults (98.90 ± 0.71%) showing similar levels of novel viral abundance (Kruskal-Wallis test, X<sup>2</sup> = 7.31, df = 3, p = 0.063; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Public database mapping patterns supported these findings, with calves averaging a substantially higher fraction of reads mapping to known phages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4AF</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Comparison with existing viral databases further confirmed the life-stage stratification of viral communities. Mapping rates varied significantly across life stages for human gut viral databases (Kruskal-Wallis test, X<sup>2</sup> = 8.63, p = 0.035; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), with calf viromes exhibiting remarkably higher mapping frequency (UHGV: 0.63-46.81%) compared to adult cattle (0.3-0.63%). Similarly, calves showed significantly higher mapping to general viral reference collections (INPHARED: 0.27-10.36%, X<sup>2</sup> = 7.89, p = 0.048; Viral RefSeq: 0.29-7.56%, X<sup>2</sup> = 8.05, p = 0.045; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) compared to adult cattle (&lt;0.03% for both databases), suggesting that calf viromes contain more similarity to previously characterised viruses.</p><p id="P18">Conversely, the slurry tank virome from the same farm showed significantly higher mapping from adult samples (Kruskal-Wallis test, X<sup>2</sup> = 10.17, p = 0.017; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), with highest similarity to lactating (3.01-5.19%) and dry cows (2.59-4.07%), followed by heifers (1.37-2.39%), with minimal mapping from calves (0.16-0.55%). This gradient reflects the population structure of the farm, where lactating cows comprise the largest proportion of animals and therefore contribute most significantly to the slurry tank microbiome. All adult stages also showed moderate mapping to ruminant-specific viral databases, with both RVD (14.38-36.74%, X<sup>2</sup> = 10.73, p = 0.013; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) and URPC (9.68-22.76%, X<sup>2</sup> = 7.62, p = 0.049; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) showing significant differences across life stages. Lactating cows exhibited particularly high mapping rates to the RVD database (21.98-36.74%). These mapping patterns align with the observed ecological shifts in viral communities during development and further support the transition from a calf virome with human gut-like characteristics to a specialised ruminant virome in adults.</p><p id="P19">The core virome analysis further highlighted the developmental transition in viral communities. After rarefaction, only 225 vOTUs were present in at least one calf sample, of which 47 were detected in any adult group. In contrast, each adult group displayed a substantial core virome—3,385 (heifers), 3,049 (dry adults), and 3,254 (milking adults) vOTUs detected in ≥4/5 individuals. Despite this richness, only 711 vOTUs were shared across all three adult groups, indicating that while adult cows share a considerable viral component, each life stage maintains a partly distinct community.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Virus-Host Dynamics Reveal Complex Ecological Interactions Across Life Stages</title><p id="P20">To explore the relationship between viruses and their bacterial hosts across development, we predicted host genera for each vOTU and calculated a virus-host ratio (VHR) by dividing the total relative abundance of viruses by the relative abundance of their predicted microbial hosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. A consistent negative correlation between VHR and host abundance was observed across all adult life stages (Spearman’s rho from -0.61 to -0.74, p &lt; 2.2e-16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). This inverse relationship suggests that more abundant bacterial taxa tended to have fewer associated phages per host genome, consistent with the ecological model of "Kill-the-Winner"<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> wherein viral predation selectively targets the most abundant bacterial populations, thereby maintaining diversity in the microbial community.</p><p id="P21">The VHR analysis highlighted the dry cow period as particularly dynamic for virus-host interactions. Dry cows exhibited a significantly higher median VHR compared with lactating adults (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P=0.006; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating a shift toward increased viral loads relative to their bacterial hosts during this critical transition period. To further examine this pattern, we determined viral load by mapping bulk metagenomic reads to our vOTUs, calculating the percentage of total metagenomic DNA attributable to viral sequences. This revealed consistent group differences, with dry cows exhibiting the highest median viral load (3.61% of metagenome), followed by calves (2.17%), heifers (1.91%), and lactating cows showing the lowest (1.52%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). The significant difference between dry and lactating cows (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.016; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>) corroborates the VHR analysis and further illustrates heightened viral activity during the drying-off period.</p><p id="P22">Evidence of ongoing evolutionary dynamics between phages and their bacterial hosts was found across all life stages. A substantial fraction of detected vOTUs in all groups contained at least one gene under positive selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>), with significant differences observed among life stages (Kruskal-Wallis test, X<sup>2</sup> = 9.73, df = 3, p = 0.021). Dry adults exhibited the highest proportion of vOTUs under selection (mean 38.0% ± 0.65%), significantly higher than calves (26.2% ± 9.55%; Dunn’s test with Bonferroni correction, p = 0.0197) and marginally higher than heifers (33.0% ± 1.01%, p = 0.0455). Lactating adults showed intermediate levels (31.2% ± 13.2%) that did not significantly differ from other groups. The consistently elevated proportion of vOTUs under selection in dry adults suggests that selective pressures on viral genes are particularly intense during the drying-off period, likely reflecting rapid adaptation to changing host populations or environmental conditions.</p><p id="P23">Among genes under positive selection, functions related to DNA, RNA and nucleotide metabolism were particularly prominent (2,545 instances; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>), including DNA polymerase (270), HNH endonuclease (212), and DNA helicase (178). Structural components were also frequently under selection, with head and packaging genes (2,127 instances; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>) such as major head protein (449) and portal protein (447), as well as tail-related genes (1,270 instances; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>) including tail length tape measure protein (346) and tail protein (305). The prevalence of selection on phage structural genes, particularly those involved in host recognition and infection, suggests ongoing evolutionary arms races between phages and their bacterial hosts across all life stages, with particularly intense selective pressure during the physiologically critical drying-off period.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Identification of Archaeal-Targeting vOTUs and Methanogen-Associated AMGs</title><p id="P24">Beyond bacterial viruses, our analysis also identified viruses targeting archaeal hosts, in particular methanogens important to ruminant digestion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. In total, 60 vOTUs were predicted to infect archaeal hosts, including 10 with CRISPR matches to archaeal MAGs from a rumen MAG compendium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S4</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Of these, 26 vOTUS were inferred to target <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic>, the primary genus of methanogens in the bovine gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). These putative <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic>-infecting vOTUs ranged from 10 to 470 Kb in length, with seven estimated to be &gt;90% complete by CheckV. Seven were predicted to be temperate, and the remaining 19 could not be assigned a lifestyle, potentially being obligately lytic. Taxonomic classification assigned all to <italic>Caudoviricetes</italic>, with six belonging to the Order <italic>Methanobavirales</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). The remaining 20 likely represent seven novel orders of tailed archaeal viruses that contain no cultivated members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p id="P25">The archaeal viruses showed distinct life-stage patterns similar to bacterial viruses. None of the <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic>-targeting vOTUs were detected in calf samples but appeared in over half of the adult samples, albeit at low absolute abundance (0.01–0.06% relative abundance when present; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). This pattern paralleled the dramatic expansion of <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> itself, with its relative abundance being 75,600% higher in adults (0.00123-0.00757%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) compared to calves (0.00001-0.00019%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). This co-development of methanogen populations and their associated viruses suggests a coordinated ecological succession as the rumen matures. The complete absence of methanogen viruses in calves, followed by their consistent presence in adult ruminants, indicates that viral regulation of methane-producing archaea emerges as a functional component of the mature ruminant gut ecosystem.</p><p id="P26">The potential impact of these viruses on methanogen metabolism is further supported by the presence of several putative auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) associated with methane pathways (KEGG map00680). The most frequently identified—predicted in 49 vOTUs—was glycine hydroxymethyltransferase (glyA/SHMT; K00600) that is involved in one-carbon metabolism, and can play a role in the production of methionine. Methionine can act as a source of methyl groups that may form methane. More directly relevant to methanogen metabolism, we detected two vOTUs containing coenzyme F420 hydrogenase subunit beta (frhB; K00441), one vOTU with heterodisulfide reductase subunit A2 (hdrA2; K03388), and one vOTU encoding gamma-F420-2 ligase (cofF; K14940). Additional metabolic genes in the map00680 pathway included phosphate acetyltransferase (pta; K00625, two vOTUs), 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase (hxlB; K08094, two vOTUs), glycerate 2-kinase (gck; K11529, one vOTU), and phosphofructokinase (pfk/pfp; K21071, one vOTU). Taken together, these findings suggest viruses may interact with methanogen populations through both direct predation and metabolic modulation in the developing bovine gut ecosystem.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">The viral community of dairy cows has been largely underexplored. Previous work has focused on specific stages of a lifecycle (e.g., lactation) where very few complete bacteriophages were identified <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, or has been limited to characterising viruses within the rumen <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Here we utilised a combination of short and long read sequencing to gain a comprehensive understanding of gut viral diversity in dairy cattle across key developmental stages, identifying &gt;30,000 vOTUs, including 1,338 complete and 3,898 high-quality viral genomes.</p><p id="P28">We observed a stark contrast between calf and adult viromes. Calves harboured significantly lower viral diversity, with communities dominated by recognisable, often temperate phages—largely sharing similarity with human gut viral sequences. The dominance of temperate phages in calves may result from induction of prophages from early colonising bacteria, as has been proposed in human infant gut development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">As the gastrointestinal tract matures and the diet diversifies post-weaning, the virome undergoes a dramatic expansion in both diversity and complexity. The adult virome was characterised by high novelty, with the vast majority of complete viral genomes representing previously undescribed viral lineages. This pattern mirrors developmental progressions observed in human infant gut viromes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. However, unlike human gut viromes that typically stabilise in adulthood, the dairy cow virome continues to undergo significant compositional shifts across adult life stages, reflecting the distinct physiological transitions these animals experience throughout their productive life.</p><p id="P30">The shift from temperate to lytic viral communities with age likely reflects changing ecological strategies as the gut ecosystem matures. The predominance of temperate phages in calves may provide evolutionary advantages in a developing, less stable environment, while the transition to lytic dominance in adults could indicate a shift toward competition-based dynamics in a more stable ecosystem, consistent with the "Kill-the-Winner" model of viral-bacterial coevolution.</p><p id="P31">Our integration of bacterial and viral metagenomic data revealed complex ecological relationships between these communities. The strong correlation between bacterial and viral beta diversity confirmed that these communities largely shift in concert across life stages. However, the negative correlation between bacterial and viral alpha diversity—particularly pronounced during the drying-off period—suggests a more nuanced relationship than simple co-development.</p><p id="P32">The drying-off period emerged as a particularly dynamic phase for virus-host interactions. The transition involves substantial dietary changes, with reduced energy intake and a shift toward more fibrous rations. These changes coincided with increased viral diversity, decreased bacterial diversity, and a significantly higher virus-host ratio. Furthermore, dry cows exhibited the highest proportion of viral genes under positive selection, suggesting intensified evolutionary dynamics between phages and their bacterial hosts during this transition. Our identification of 26 vOTUs targeting <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic>, absent in calves but widely present in adult samples, provides temporal context to emerging research on archaeal viruses in the rumen ecosystem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The life-stage specificity suggests archaeal viruses emerge alongside the establishment of functional methanogen populations during rumen development, which may inform future strategies for methane mitigation through virome manipulation.</p><p id="P33">From an applied perspective, our findings have potential implications for dairy cattle management. The identification of critical transition periods characterised by viral community restructuring—particularly weaning and drying-off—suggests these phases may represent intervention opportunities for modulating the microbiome. Future research should explore the functional implications of these virome transitions, particularly the role of phage-mediated gene transfer in conferring adaptive traits to bacterial hosts across developmental stages.</p><p id="P34">In conclusion, our work establishes a comprehensive foundation for understanding viral community development in dairy cattle, revealing that life-stage transitions drive profound shifts in virome composition, diversity, and virus-host dynamics. These findings highlight the dynamic nature of phage-bacteria relationships in the ruminant gut and underscore the potential importance of viral communities in shaping microbial ecosystem function across the life cycle of dairy cattle.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Online Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Sample Collection and VLP Enrichment</title><p id="P35">Cow faeces was collected from a UK dairy farm using a drop catch method (i.e., catching the sample in a sterile tube before it can contact the ground).
