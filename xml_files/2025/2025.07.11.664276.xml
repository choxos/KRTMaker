These viruses possess an NA polymorphism associated with plasminogen binding, as well as an unusual sequence around the HA cleavage site; accordingly, HA cleavage mediated by NA-driven plasminogen recruitment has been proposed to underly their systemic spread and pathogenicity. To test this, we established a reverse genetics system for A/chicken/Belgium/460/2019 and created single mutations in HA (K345R), and NA (S122N) that restored the viruses to normal consensus, as well as an HA/NA double mutant. Confirming previous work, trypsin-independent spread and HA cleavage of wild type Ck/Belgium was observed in the presence of fetal bovine serum containing plasminogen <italic>in vitro.</italic> Dose-dependent HA cleavage and trypsin-independent spread was also observed in the presence of purified chicken plasminogen. Compared to wild type virus, both HA cleavage and virus spread <italic>in vitro</italic> were reduced by the HA K345R mutation and further blocked by NA mutation S122N. Plasminogen-mediated HA cleavage was seen in a variety of avian cell lines and chicken organoids, excluding cell type-dependent effects. Furthermore, <italic>in ovo</italic> tests showed that mutant viruses unable to recruit plasminogen were less able to replicate systemically in chicken embryos. Bioinformatics analyses revealed other viruses which could potentially recruit plasminogen, including two independent outbreaks of H6N1 viruses, one of which we confirmed PLG-driven spread <italic>in vitro.</italic> We conclude that PLG-recruitment by NA is a general virulence mechanism of N1 LPAIVs</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Avian influenza viruses (AIV) are classified into high pathogenic (HPAI) or low pathogenic (LPAI) viruses based on their hemagglutinin (HA) subtype and sequence near the HA cleavage site. Almost without exception, HPAI viruses (HPAIVs) are H5 or H7 subtypes that possess a polybasic cleavage site (PBCS), whereas LPAI viruses are all other subtypes and H5 or H7 subtypes without a PBCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). In gallinaceous poultry such as chickens and turkeys, HPAIVs show systemic spread and rapidly fatal disease, whereas infection by LPAI viruses is largely restricted to the respiratory tract and intestinal organs and often causes few or no clinical signs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). However, not all LPAI viruses are phenotypically low pathogenic; certain strains can be highly virulent, spread systemically in the animals and lead to an overt outbreak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P3">In 2019, an LPAI H3N1 outbreak involving various poultry species started in Belgium and spread regionally for four months, including to three farms in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). The outbreak was notable for its association with dramatic drops in egg production, tropism for the reproductive tract and high mortality in chickens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Our laboratory study using an H3N1 isolate from the outbreak, A/chicken/Belgium/460/2019 (Ck/Belgium), showed 58% mortality and 100% drop in egg production in 34-week-old specific pathogen free (SPF) laying hens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Virus was also detected in the oviducts of the hens at 9 to 10-days post-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). This indicated that the H3N1 strain was indeed a virulent LPAIV capable of systemic spread in poultry. Therefore, it was of interest to identify the molecular reasons that contribute to the increased virulence of Ck/Belgium, both to understand the reasons for it and to enhance risk prediction of future novel AIV strains as they arise.</p><p id="P4">The surface of an influenza virus particle contains two glycoproteins: HA and neuraminidase (NA). In order to activate virus infectivity and permit cell entry, the HA precursor polypeptide (HA0) must be cleaved by host proteases into two functional subunits, HA1 and HA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Without this specific proteolysis event freeing the N-terminus of the HA fusion peptide, viral and host membranes cannot be fused and virus entry fails. Therefore, HA sequence around the HA cleavage site can be an important determinant of virus pathogenicity in different hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The PBCS in HPAIV HAs are cleaved intracellularly by ubiquitously expressed furin family proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), whereas the HAs from LPAI viruses with a monobasic cleavage site are usually activated extracellularly by secreted trypsin-like proteases found in the airway or gut lumens, but not within the internal organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). An additional mechanism for HA cleavage which depends on the sequence of the viral NA has been found in certain strains of influenza A virus. In a human-isolated but mouse-adapted H1N1 strain, A/Wilson Smith Neurotropic/1933 (WSN), the presence of a C-terminal lysine and loss of glycosylation site at position 130 (WSN numbering) on NA leads to NA binding to plasminogen (PLG), which is subsequently converted to plasmin that cleaves adjacent HA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). PLG recruitment by NA in WSN has been associated with increased pathogenicity in mice, including neurotropism, presumably because of the systemic availability of PLG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Consistent with this, PLG-knockout mice infected with another laboratory-adapted H1N1 strain, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8), which is also able to use PLG for HA cleavage, showed higher survival and lower weight loss compared to wild type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Notably, the NA from the H3N1 Ck/Belgium outbreak also lacks the equivalent glycosylation site (at position 122) to the WSN NA and a previous study has shown that another isolate from the outbreak, A/chicken/Belgium/1940/2019, exhibited trypsin-independent spread in cell culture in the presence of PLG-containing serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Furthermore, virus replication was blocked by a plasmin inhibitor, 6-aminohexanoic acid (6-AHA), suggesting a mechanism for the increased virulence of the Ck/Belgium family viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). In addition, the Ck/Belgium HA also contains an unusual monobasic cleavage sequence, with a lysine (K) at the HA1 boundary (P1 position), instead of the more common arginine (R) residue seen in H3 HAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). A previous study using WSN has reported that a non-consensus amino acid at the P2 position of the HA cleavage site affected virus virulence under plasminogen-dependent conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), indicating the possibility of collaboration between the atypical HA cleavage site and PLG binding by NA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Accordingly, we set out to test the molecular hypotheses that the unexpectedly high virulence of Ck/Belgium lineage viruses resulted from plasminogen recruitment by NA working in concert with a modified HA monobasic cleavage site. We confirmed PLG-mediated cleavage of the Ck/Belgium HA in the context of virus infection and found that the atypical NA and HA sequences combine for efficient PLG-mediated spread in a variety of avian cell systems. We also identified PLG-mediated spread in a separate H6N1 outbreak, suggesting that this may be a general pathogenicity mechanism for LPAIV virulence.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cells</title><p id="P6">Chicken ANP32A-expressing Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK/ANP32A; a kind gift from Prof Massimo Palmarini, University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, UK), quail fibroblast cells (QT-35; a kind gift from Dr Laurence Tiley, University of Cambridge, UK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T; ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Gibco). 1 μg/ml puromycin was added for the selection marker in MDCK/ANP32A cells.

To further understand the effect of the unusual HA cleavage site, we created a Ck/Belgium HA K345R mutant which had the H3 consensus sequence restored and then directly assayed HA cleavage by infecting cells with wild type (WT) and mutant virus followed by western blotting for HA. This showed that both WT and HA K345R needed trypsin for cleavage in CLEC213 cells, as only uncleaved HA0 precursor was visible in the absence of trypsin, while a mix of HA0 and cleaved HA1 and HA2 were present with trypsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). To provide a more quantitative measurement of trypsin susceptibility, cells were infected with both viruses, then treated with a range of trypsin concentrations and assessed for HA cleavage. From the western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), HA K345R showed higher susceptibility to trypsin cleavage than the WT. To examine this in the absence of other viral proteins, cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding WT or mutant HAs and subjected to the same trypsin titration and western blot analysis. Again, the HA K345R mutant showed greater trypsin cleavability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Densitometric measurement of the HA1/HA0 and HA2/HA0 ratios from infection and transfection data confirmed the higher sensitivity of the HA mutant to trypsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E, F</xref>), although this was only statistically significant for HA1/HA0 ratios. Thus, the unusual HA sequence of Ck/Belgium does affect trypsin susceptibility, but by reducing cleavability rather than enhancing it.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>The unusual NA and HA sequence polymorphisms in Ck/Belgium affect PLG cleavage of HA</title><p id="P23">A previous study using another virus isolate from the same Belgium outbreak (A/chicken/Belgium/1940/2019) identified the loss of a glycosylation site at amino acid position 122 on NA (position 130 in WSN numbering) which, by analogy with WSN would allow NA binding of PLG and subsequent trypsin-independent spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Our Ck/Belgium isolate shares the same potential PLG-binding motif in its NA, so we tested whether it too exhibited trypsin-independent spread in the presence of FBS containing PLG. CLEC213 cells were infected with Ck/Belgium, WSN (as a positive control) and Udorn (as a negative control) at low MOI and incubated in the absence or presence of FBS for 24 or 72 hours before staining the cultures with anti-HA to identify infected cells. Individual infected cells were observed for all viruses at 24 hours, with or without FBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This pattern of single infected cells remained at 72 hours for all viruses without serum and Udorn with serum. However, clear microplaques were visible at 72 hours for both WSN and Ck/Belgium in the presence of FBS indicating virus spread, thus corroborating the findings of Schon and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p><p id="P24">In order to test the hypothesis that the identity of the amino acid at position 122 on Ck/Belgium NA confers the ability of the virus to spread in the absence of trypsin, as well as to test for any phenotypic association with the unusual HA cleavage site, we created two additional mutants: an NA S122N mutant (restoring the potential glycosylation site) and an HA/NA double mutant, HA K345R/NA S122N. We then infected CLEC213 cells with WT or mutant viruses at high MOI in the absence or presence of FBS and a plasmin-specific inhibitor, 6-AHA, before examining HA cleavage by western blot of cell lysates. Low levels of HA cleavage were observed with the WT virus in the presence of serum, but not in the absence of FBS, nor with FBS further treated with plasmin inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The HA K345R mutant showed reduced HA cleavage in the presence of FBS than the WT virus, but was still inhibited by 6-AHA, while the NA S122N and HA K345R/NA S122N viruses did not show detectable HA cleavage under any conditions. These results support the hypothesis that the Ck/Belgium NA recruits PLG for HA cleavage and that the unusual HA cleavage site contributes to the efficiency of this process.</p><p id="P25">To confirm that HA cleavage resulted from the presence of PLG and not another 6-AHA-sensitive factor present in FBS, we next tested the effects of adding host species-matched purified chicken PLG during virus infections. CLEC213 cells were infected with WT or mutant viruses at high MOI and treated with a range of chicken PLG concentrations, then HA cleavage was determined at 16 hours by western blotting as before. Chicken PLG caused dose-dependent HA cleavage for WT and HA K345R, whereas the HA1/HA2 cleavage products of the NA S122N mutant virus were only faintly observed with 1 μg/ml of PLG (the highest concentration used; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). No HA cleavage was detected for the double mutant HA K345R/NA S122N. Quantification of HA1/HA0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) and HA2/HA0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) ratios from replicate experiments showed that the HA K345R mutation significantly reduced cleavage compared to the WT HA, as well as confirming only residual cleavage with the NA mutant and no detectable cleavage for the double mutant. To further understand the effect of PLG on virus replication, CLEC213 cells were infected at low MOI and incubated with a range of PLG concentrations. After 24 hours, the number of infected cells were measured by flow cytometry after fixing and staining for surface H3, while the amount of infectious virus released was measured by plaque titration. Spread of the WT virus showed a dose-dependent response to PLG concentration and was significantly higher than all the mutants, particularly viruses with the NA mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Titres of infectious virus also increased with PLG concentration and again, all mutations reduced virus replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results indicate that the unusual Ck/Belgium HA cleavage site and NA recruitment of PLG collaborate to induce HA cleavage and virus spread <italic>in vitro.</italic></p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Synergy between the HA cleavage site and NA-mediated PLG recruitment is not cell type-dependent and occurs <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in ovo</italic></title><p id="P26">PLG activation is a tightly regulated process with multiple cell-surface stimulatory and inhibitory factors, whose abundance can vary by tissue or cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). All our experiments so far were performed in CLEC213 cells, so it was therefore important to test the significance of the Ck/Belgium HA and NA sequence motifs in other avian cells. Using a single concentration of 250 ng/ml PLG, cleavage of WT Ck/Belgium HA was again significantly higher than HA K345R and no cleavage was found for NA S122N and HA K345R/NA S122N in infected CLEC213 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Very similar results were obtained using another chicken cell line (DF-1 fibroblasts; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), as well as in duck (CCL-141; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) and quail (QT-35; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>) fibroblast cell lines. Thus, the HA processing induced by the collaborative effects of the unusual HA cleavage site and NA-recruited PLG were not specific to a single type of chicken cell but also applied to immortalised cells from other avian species.</p><p id="P27">In order to further examine the biological relevance of PLG-mediated HA cleavage, we used chicken organoids as a complex cell model of infection in primary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Groups of approximately 200 organoids pooled from 3-4 chick embryos were infected with WT or mutant viruses in the absence or presence of PLG. Virus replication was examined 24 hours later by quantifying the intracellular expression of segment 7 RNA as well as virus released into the supernatant. The addition of PLG increased segment 7 accumulation significantly in WT and HA K345R infections whilst the NA S122N mutation suppressed this PLG-induced increase, both alone and with the HA mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Although variable between batches of organoids, the addition of PLG also significantly increased the titre of released WT, but not mutant viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Overall, these data further corroborate the importance of the HA cleavage site and NA PLG-binding motifs for Ck/Belgium replication.</p><p id="P28">As a further <italic>in ovo</italic> model of infection, we inoculated the allantoic cavity of 10-day old embryonated chicken eggs with WT and mutant Ck/Belgium viruses. There were no differences in the titres of the various viruses harvested from the allantoic fluid 48 hours later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). WT Ck/Belgium and the HA K345R mutant also replicated well in the chicken embryos, but in contrast, NA S122N and HA K345R/NA S122N showed notably lower virus titres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). These results were also supported by immunostaining of the chicken embryos for virus antigen. In lung, heart and brain sections, NP expression was only observed for WT and HA K345R viruses, whereas the staining for NA S122N and HA K345R/NA S122N was similar to that of mock-infected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). These findings indicated the importance of NA-mediated PLG recruitment in the pathogenesis of Ck/Belgium.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>PLG recruitment by N1 NA has also evolved in moderately virulent H6 subtype LPAIVs</title><p id="P29">Schon and colleagues previously searched the Influenza Research Database for other N1 NA sequences that contained a PLG-binding motif, identifying 15 independent virus isolates not linked to the Belgian 2019 H3N1 outbreak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Of these, the largest category (discounting multiple sequences of the lab-adapted WSN, PR8 and a reassorted derivative of the latter) were human infections, while only two were independent isolates of LPAIVs, both from the 1980s. To further investigate the emergence of the PLG-binding motif across N1 NAs, we carried out a similar search using the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). From over 38,000 sequences that met inclusion criteria (we excluded human seasonal viruses for computational tractability), we found 165 sequences lacking the NA glycosylation site and with a C-terminal lysine which may permit PLG binding. Of these, 153 were inferred to be from individual naturally occurring virus isolates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>). These potential PLG-utilising viruses span a date range from 1983 to 2025, possess H1, H3, H5 or H6 subtype HAs and come from a range of host species, both mammalian and avian, but predominantly domestic poultry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). To gain an understanding of the distribution of these PLG-binding viruses among the wider diversity of N1 NAs, they were placed in a phylogeny representative of protein diversity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref> highlights NAs with PLG-binding motifs as well as indicating subtype and the associated host types across the tree. Most (100 or 83.3%) were H3N1 sequences with the vast majority belonging to the 2019 Belgium outbreak (<italic>n</italic> = 99, of which 20 are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>) and one other sequence (A/duck/Buryatia/664/1998; identified in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>)) being highly diverged from this outbreak. Outside of H3N1 strains, the next largest group of NAs possessing the PLG-binding motif were H6N1 viruses (31 sequences). We noted two clusters of H6N1 viruses in which the motif indicative of PLG-binding appears to have emerged independently. Based on the dates and countries which the isolates were collected, they derive from two epizootic clusters: 3 sequences representing a 2010 outbreak in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) while the other 28 sequences are from linked but genetically distinct outbreaks in Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). All four outbreaks were associated with notable drops in egg production and increased mortality. For the Ireland/UK outbreak, there was also evidence of systemic virus spread within the birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). We also found H5N1 and H1N1 subtype viruses (15 and 7 sequences, respectively) that possessed the PLG-binding motif. These tend to occur as singletons in the tree, suggesting independent evolution, except for two clusters of viruses sampled as part of the ongoing epizootic of HPAI H5N1 in the USA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). However, closer examination of genotypes and NA sequences involved suggested that these also represented several independent emergence events. The majority of other H5N1 strains with potential PLG-recruiting NAs are also HPAIVs. Thus, the N1 PLG-binding motif has evolved independently on multiple occasions, but most notably in LPAIV outbreaks in poultry, in the context of virus strains exhibiting increased pathogenicity.</p><p id="P30">We had an isolate of the 2010 Netherlands H6N1 outbreak available (A/chicken/Netherlands/917/2010). Accordingly, to determine if this virus could utilise PLG, CLEC213 cells were infected at low MOI with Udorn, Ck/Belgium or the H6N1 LPAI viruses and incubated without trypsin but in the absence or presence of PLG for 48 hours. Plaque titration of released virus showed that addition of PLG significantly increased the virus titres of Ck/Belgium and H6N1, but not Udorn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, PLG addition also significantly increased replication of the H6N1 virus in chicken organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). We conclude that similarly to Ck/Belgium, the atypical N1 sequence of the Netherlands H6N1 outbreak also leads to PLG-mediated spread of the virus, potentially explaining the higher than normal pathogenicity of the outbreak viruses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">Despite being categorised as an LPAI, H3N1 viruses from the Ck/Belgium family have been characterised as moderately virulent in poultry, showing systemic replication as well as causing appreciable mortality and a severe drop in egg production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The unexpected pathogenicity of the outbreak strain has been linked to PLG-cleavage of the HA, potentially mediated by loss of a glycosylation site in NA that, by analogy with the laboratory-adapted WSN and PR8 strains, leads to recruitment of PLG to the cell surface by NA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Here, we report molecular tests of this hypothesis. We confirmed PLG-driven HA cleavage and virus spread of Ck/Belgium using purified chicken PLG in avian cell systems from three species, including fibroblast, epithelial and organoids. Using reverse genetics, we show that the key determinants of this are indeed the loss of a potential glycosylation site in NA, along with a variant monobasic cleavage site in the H3 HA that potentiates PLG cleavage and increases virus replication <italic>in vitro,</italic> as well as <italic>ex vivo</italic> and in <italic>in ovo</italic> systems. Furthermore, we identify further outbreaks of unexpectedly pathogenic H6N1 LPAIVs with similar traits, suggesting this is a general virulence mechanism for N1 LPAIVs.</p><p id="P32">This study brings the number of virus lineages experimentally verified to use PLG-recruitment by an N1 NA for HA processing to four: the H1N1 WSN and PR8 families, the 2019 Belgium H3N1 outbreak and the 2010 Netherlands H6N1 LPAIV outbreak. WSN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) and now the Belgian H3N1 viruses have been shown to depend primarily on the N1 mutation that destroys a potential N-linked glycosylation site, but to also possess a further adaptive mutation in the HA cleavage site that enhances plasmin-mediated proteolysis. Although both sequence motifs are important, the NA change is clearly more consequential, as its reversal to normal consensus has a greater effect on replication <italic>in vitro</italic> and pathogenicity <italic>in ovo</italic> than restoring the HA cleavage site to the more usual sequence ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) and this study). Indeed, the NA PLG-binding polymorphism was sufficient to correctly identify the Netherlands H6N1 outbreak virus as using PLG, although its HA has the usual H6 PQIETR/GLF cleavage site sequence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The viruses from the linked 2020 outbreaks of moderately virulent H6N1 LPAIVs in Irish and UK poultry flocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) also have a normal HA consensus cleavage site, but nevertheless we think it is plausible that they too will prove to be able to use PLG to mature HA.</p><p id="P33">Whether the acquisition of an unusual HA cleavage site sequence represents the “fine-tuning” of the PLG-recruitment virulence mechanism or is selected for other reasons (perhaps HA subtype-specific) remains to be determined. The unusual cleavage site in WSN did not obviously alter its ability to be cleaved by trypsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) but the Ck/Belgium HA showed a moderate reduction in trypsin-cleavability. In mammals, PLG is both broadly expressed and secreted from the blood into other tissues, including the lung and central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), but it is unclear whether a virus that <underline>can</underline> use PLG <underline>only</underline> uses PLG, or (more plausibly perhaps), HA is simply cleaved by whatever protease with the right specificity comes along first. If the latter is true, then it would be interesting to test whether the Ck/Belgium HA cut site also affects cleavage by airway proteases and thus represents a balancing act between transmissibility and systemic replication.</p><p id="P34">Further relating to the diversity of proteases involved in HA cleavage is the intriguing number of H5 HPAIV HAs, primarily from the A/Goose/Guandong/1/1996 lineage, which have an N1 NA without the key glycosylation site (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). At first sight, it seems unlikely that a virus that has evolved a highly efficient furin-cleavable HA would gain an advantage from being able to also use PLG. Furin-like proteases that cleave HA are usually viewed as ubiquitous in cell types and tissues, explaining the systemic replication of H5 and H7 HPAIVs in poultry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). However, furin-like proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin (PC/PCSK) genes are a large family that vary with respect to secretion versus transmembrane residence and intracellular localisation, as well as ability to cleave HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). It is therefore possible that there are circumstances in which PLG recruitment might be advantageous even in an HPAIV background. Given that PLG recruitment is well correlated with neurovirulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) and that several of the recent HPAIV isolates with the potential to recruit PLG are Clade 2.3.4.4b viruses isolated from mammals, including cows (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), determining whether this loss of glycosylation in some HPAIV N1 NAs is genuinely functional or mere sequence noise could be important for understanding the evolution of pathogenicity of this newly emergent variant.</p><p id="P35">Overall, our study reveals that the unusual HA sequence of Ck/Belgium works in concert with NA-recruited PLG to increase HA cleavage, virus spread, and systemic replication in avian cells. We also provide evidence from another outbreak-associated LPAI H6N1 virus that this is potentially a generalisable virulence mechanism for LPAIVs. We suggest that future outbreaks of unexpectedly pathogenic LPAIVs with an N1 NA in poultry should have their NA and HA genes monitored for loss of the glycosylation site and secondarily, an atypical HA cleavage sequence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Table S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS207128-supplement-Table_S1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d11aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Table S2 - GISAID acknowledgments</label><media xlink:href="EMS207128-supplement-Table_S2___GISAID_acknowledgments.csv" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="csv; charset=utf-8" id="d11aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS207128-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d11aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Prof Massimo Palmarini (MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, UK) for MDCK/chicken ANP32A cells, Dr Laurence Tiley (University of Cambridge, UK) for QT-35 cells, Dr Sascha Trapp (French National Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment, France) for CLEC213 cells, Dr Leah Goulding (University of Nottingham, UK) for CCL-141 cells, Prof Janet Daly (University of Nottingham, UK) for anti-H3 antibody and Prof Richard Compans (Emory University, Atlanta) for Udorn virus.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Author summary</title></caption><p>Avian influenza viruses (AIV) are divided into two broad categories - high or low pathogenicity - based on the sequence of their haemagglutinin (HA) and their lethality in chickens. The majority of AIV strains circulating in the wild are low pathogenicity both in waterfowl and when they spill over into domestic poultry. However, some low pathogenicity strains can cause severe disease in poultry despite not being classified as H5 or H7 high pathogenic AIVs with an HA polybasic protease cleavage site. A severe 2019 outbreak of an H3N1 strain has been suggested to result from the neuraminidase (NA) of the virus recruiting cellular plasminogen to proteolytically activate HA. Here, we tested this hypothesis by using reverse genetics to mutate the virus in a way predicted to block this. We found that indeed, the sequence of the NA at position 122 is the primary determinant of plasminogen-driven HA cleavage but that the unusual sequence at the HA cleavage site of the outbreak virus also contributes to pathogenicity. Furthermore, we show that N1 NA sequence can be used to identify other unexpectedly virulent strains of AIV. This work therefore adds to our ability to risk assess AIV strains from sequence-based surveillance.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Trypsin-dependency of CK/Belgium in cell culture.</title><p>(A) Alignment of HA sequences near the cleavage site for Ck/Belgium and an H3 consensus.
