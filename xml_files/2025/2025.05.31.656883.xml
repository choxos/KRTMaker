These systems maintain proteostasis by facilitating membrane protein insertion, folding, and degradation. To gain structural insights into a putative complex formed by FtsH and YidC, we performed single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy on detergent-solubilized membrane samples, from which FtsH and YidC were purified using Ni-NTA affinity and size exclusion chromatography. Although SDS-PAGE analysis indicated a high purity of these proteins, cryo-EM datasets unexpectedly yielded high-resolution structures of ArnA and AcrB at 4.0 Å and 2.9 Å resolutions, respectively—ArnA is a bifunctional enzyme involved in lipid A modification and polymyxin resistance, while AcrB is a multidrug efflux transporter of the AcrAB–TolC system. ArnA and AcrB are known membrane protein contaminants after Ni-NTA purifications. However, they were also detected in Strep-Tactin affinity purified FtsH-YidC samples. ArnA, typically cytoplasmic, was consistently found in membrane-isolated samples, indicating an association with membrane components. Two-dimensional class averages revealed additional particles resembling GroEL, cytochrome bo<sub>3</sub> oxidase, and the AAA+ cytoplasmic domain of FtsH. Although our preparation was initially considered homogeneous, neither full-size FtsH nor the intact FtsH–YidC complex could be resolved. This case highlights that cryo-EM can reveal structural information beyond the intended target, and that overexpression of membrane proteins involved in quality control may lead to the co-purification of proteins such as ArnA and AcrB.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Bacterial membrane proteostasis relies on the coordinated action of membrane protein biogenesis and degradation pathways, which ensure the proper insertion, folding, and removal of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Akiyama, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Watkins et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Njenga et al., 2023</xref>).

ArnA is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (L-Ara4N), a nucleotide-activated sugar that is incorporated into lipid A to reduce its net negative charge and thereby enhance resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides such as polymyxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Gatzeva-Topalova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Williams et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Yang et al., 2019</xref>).

In our study, this capability allowed us to resolve the structures of ArnA and AcrB while also identifying 2D class averages resembling GroEL and cytochrome bo<sub>3</sub>, further emphasizing the dynamic nature of the protein mixtures.</p><p id="P67">In summary, our findings underscore the complexity of cryo-EM datasets derived from membrane protein complexes and highlight the importance of integrating structural and biochemical data with mass spectrometry to accurately interpret the data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P68">This study highlights the complexity of transient membrane protein interactions, such as YidC and FtsH involved in membrane protein homeostasis, and the associated challenges to obtain structural and functional insights into these protein complexes by cryo-EM. While the FtsH–YidC complex could not be reconstructed, high-resolution structures of off-target proteins, such as ArnA and AcrB, were successfully obtained, providing valuable structural insights into these components. The enrichment of co-purified proteins in cryo-EM 2D class averages, such as GroEL and cytochrome bo<sub>3</sub> (identified also in mass spectrometry) further illustrates the complexity of the task. Our findings emphasize the importance of combining structural and biochemical approaches and mass spectrometry to gain a comprehensive understanding of membrane protein function and regulation, particularly in the context of stress-induced cellular responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS206123-supplement-Supplementary_Information.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d86aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>M.Ç., and B.V.K. were funded by the Scientific and Technological Council of Türkiye (TÜBİTAK) BÌDEB 2232 International Outstanding Researchers Program (Project No: 118C225).

combined Cryo-EM dataset.</title><p>Two cryo-EM datasets were collected from DSP-crosslinked membrane protein samples. The first dataset (3,908 movies) was prepared with 0.02% DDM and 0.4%w/v CHAPS as an additive, and the second dataset (7,506 movies) with 0.05% DDM and 0.005% w/v cholesterol hemisuccinate (CHS). Motion correction and CTF estimation were performed separately for each dataset. 10,141 micrographs were used for particle picking resulting in 7.13 million particles (estimated diameter: 100–200 Å). Two rounds of 2D classification (200 classes, 256 Å mask, 40 online-EM iterations, batch size 400) retained 74,668 particles [scale bar: 37.8 nm]. These classes were used as templates for template-based picking, which yielded 6.3 million particles. After re-extraction and duplicate removal, a final set of 10.13 million unique particles was obtained. 2D classification yielded 1.26 million particles distributed across the best 20 classes. For ArnA, 123,593 particles corresponding to ArnA 2D classes [scale bar: 37.8 nm for 2D class averages] were selected and processed through <italic>ab-initio</italic> reconstruction with C1 symmetry, followed by heterogeneous and non-uniform refinement using D3 symmetry. For AcrB, 104,054 particles corresponding to AcrB 2D classes [scale bar: 37.8 nm for 2D class averages] were selected and refined using C3 symmetry. Global CTF refinement and DeepEMhancer post-processing were applied to both maps. Handedness correction for AcrB was performed using the Volume Tools utility in cryoSPARC. Particles corresponding to GroEL, cytochrome bo<sub>3</sub> oxidase, and other minor components were also detected during classification [scale bar: 37.8 nm for 2D class averages].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206123-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM density map and model fitting of the hexameric ArnA complex.</title><p>(A) Cryo-EM density map of the ArnA hexamer reconstructed at 4.0 Å resolution, shown from three orientations: top, side, and bottom views.
