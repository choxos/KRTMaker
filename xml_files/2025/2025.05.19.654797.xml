Variations in the primary amino acid sequence of IAPP can influence its aggregation rate and animals expressing IAPP variants that do not form amyloids, do not develop T2D. Conversely, specific single amino -acid changes in IAPP are enough to accelerate its aggregation rate. Understanding how mutations impact IAPP aggregation can help gain mechanistic understanding into the process of pathogenic amyloid formation of this peptide and preventively identify mutations that may contribute to the risk of developing T2D. Here, we employ deep mutational scanning to measure the ability to nucleate amyloids for 1663 IAPP variants, including substitutions, insertions, truncations and deletions and identify variants that increase amyloid formation in all mutation classes. Our results point at a continuous stretch of residues (15-32) which likely is structured in IAPP amyloids and that matches the core of the early aggregated species formed by IAPP <italic>in vitro</italic>. Inside this region, mutations have a more drastic effect in the 21-27 NNFGAIL segment, suggesting tighter structural constraints for this stretch in IAPP amyloids. Finally, by comparing this mutational atlas to that of another amyloid, Amyloid beta (Aβ42), the peptide that aggregates in Alzheimer’s Disease, we find that the effects of mutations that slow down nucleation correlate between the two amyloids, but that when it comes to mutations that accelerate nucleation one single amyloid dataset cannot be used to predict mutational effects in the other.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Amyloids formed by the islet amyloid polypeptide hormone (IAPP) are among the first ever amyloids observed and extracted from human tissue, more than 120 years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, decades before evidence of amyloids was observed in dementia brains.</p><p id="P3">It is now established that IAPP amyloids cause pancreatic beta-cell damage, leading to a decline in insulin secretion and Type-II diabetes (T2D)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, a debilitating condition which affects over 100 million patients worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.

It is currently unknown which mutations could increase IAPP aggregation rate and therefore it is difficult to preventively know if novel variants found in the population can contribute to increasing the risk of developing T2D.</p><p id="P5">Several studies have proposed an analogy between IAPP and another extracellular peptide, Amyloid Beta (Aβ42), the main component of the plaques that deposit in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Sequence alignment of the two proteins shows 56% sequence similarity, with 9 positions (24%) having identical amino acids. Four of these identical amino acids are located in the previously described core of the fibrils formed <italic>in vitro</italic> by both proteins (NxGAI, positions 22, 24-26 in IAPP and 27, 29-31 in Aβ42). Different structural polymorphs have been described for fibrils formed by the two peptides <italic>in vitro</italic> or extracted from human tissue (8 for IAPP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and 10 for Aβ42<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>).

We have previously mapped the complete mutational landscape of the Aβ42 peptide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> and have gathered insights into pathogenic gain of function (GOF) from systematically characterizing insertions and deletions (indels)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Here, we employ a similar strategy to quantify the impact of substitutions, insertions and deletions in IAPP, for a total of 1663 variants. Besides comprehensively mapping for the first time the IAPP mutational landscape and identifying the likely structured core of the nucleating IAPP fibrils, the resulting dataset reveals that GOF, i.e. the acceleration of amyloid nucleation, can result from all different classes of mutations, highlighting the need to improve our ability to measure, understand and predict the impact of indels in human sequences.</p><p id="P7">We also systematically compare the outcome of mutations in IAPP and Aβ42 and find significant similarities between mutational effects in IAPP and Aβ42 when it comes to mutations that reduce amyloid nucleation, suggesting a common mechanism of disruption of amyloid nucleation. However, the effects of GOF mutations, that instead speed up nucleation and are more frequent outside the core amyloid region of both peptides, are distinct in the two datasets. Overall, one mutational dataset cannot be used to predict the effect of mutations in the other. This highlights the challenge of predicting pathogenic GOF from primary sequence and the need to produce similar quantitative datasets for all amyloids observed in human disease.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Massively parallel quantification of IAPP amyloid nucleation</title><p id="P8">We synthesized a library encompassing six classes of mutations: single amino acid substitutions, insertions, and deletions in IAPP, as well as truncations, larger internal deletions, and sequence alterations resulting from polymerase slippage. We then quantified the ability of each sequence to form amyloids using a cellular assay where IAPP variants are fused to the nucleation domain of the yeast prion Sup35. Nucleation of endogenous Sup35p is required for yeast survival in the lack of adenine, so that fitness-based selection becomes possible and that variants that nucleate amyloid fibrils inside yeast cells get enriched upon selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The relative enrichment of each variant is calculated from sequencing the variant library before and after selection, providing an estimate of the ability of each variant to nucleate amyloids (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P9">As a result, we obtained a dataset reporting nucleation scores and associated error terms for 1663 IAPP variants that belong to all classes of mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Nucleation scores are reproducible across biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Suppl.

By comparing nucleation scores to the results of over ten previous studies where the kinetics of amyloid formation of IAPP variants (n = 26) were followed <italic>in vitro</italic> by Thioflavin-T fluorescence, we show that nucleation scores accurately capture the direction of the mutational effects in speeding up or slowing down the rate of amyloid formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

An advantage of this deep mutational scanning approach is obtaining quantitative estimates for all IAPP variants in one unique experimental set-up, overcoming some of the challenges involved in quantifying <italic>in vitro</italic> rates for more than a handful of variants in identical conditions.

In those classes of mutations, where changes involve the removal of more than one amino acid such as multiple amino acid deletions and truncations from the N-terminus and the C-terminus, an even larger percentage of variants reduce nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>, 88.3% of NS- multiple aa deletions, 96% of NS- N-terminal truncations, and 91% of NS- C-terminal truncations).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Single amino acid substitutions highlight a structured core between residues 15 and 32</title><p id="P11">Substitutions to proline and glycine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) reduce (or maintain) nucleation in a continuous stretch from residue 15 to 32, suggesting this region is the one getting structured in the amyloid fibrils nucleated by IAPP and where side-chain constraints are tighter. This region matches the structured region in all fibrils formed by IAPP <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as in those seeded by samples extracted from T2D patients. Within this region, we find the lowest nucleation scores in the NNFGAIL stretch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), which has been shown to be essential for IAPP aggregation <italic>in vitro</italic> and one of the shortest peptides known to form amyloids <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.

The impact of mutations in the NNFGAIL stretch appears to be dominant: double mutants containing the A25T mutation (NS+) feature increased aggregation compared to the other single mutant, while the opposite happens in double mutants containing F23L (NS-) where amyloid formation is reduced relative to the other single substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We also find that mutating Cys residues at positions 2 and 7 drastically reduces nucleation and that instead mutations to Cys at the first 6 positions speed up the rate of amyloid nucleation, with T4C and A5C scoring as the strongest nucleators among all IAPP substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P13">While this fusion peptide may not recapitulate all of the modifications that <italic>in vivo</italic> characterize biologically active IAPP, such as C-terminal amidation and formation of the disulfide bond between Cys 2 and Cys 7, the mutational landscape of IAPP substitutions presented here identifies a likely structured region (15-32) in IAPP amyloids as well as an inner stretch of core residues (21-27) that are essential for amyloid nucleation, both of which are in line with results obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> with unfused oxidized peptide, overall suggesting the SupN-IAPP fusion employed in the selection assay can accurately capture the essence of IAPP nucleation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Mutational impact is consistent with a P-fold subunit arrangement</title><p id="P14">There is currently no high-resolution structure of IAPP fibrils from human tissue, but four structures of fibrils formed <italic>in vitro</italic> by recombinant or synthetic IAPP have been resolved by Cryo-EM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.

Based on a previous mutational scan of Aβ42<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, the expectation is that - if our assay is tracking the aggregation of IAPP into structures that are similar to those reported so far - then mutating those side chains buried in the core of amyloid fibrils should slow down nucleation the most. We find a stretch of residues (aa 21-27, with the exception of Ala 25) where more than 50% of single amino acid substitutions per position decrease the nucleation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Suppl.

These correspond to residues forming the minimal IAPP fragment required for amyloid formation, NNFGAIL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, and these positions also feature low relative ASA across all available IAPP fibril structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Suppl. Fig. 3</xref>), as their side chains are buried in the fibril core. We note that mutations that affect the first of the two zippers of the P-fold structures have more drastic effects than those affecting the other, prioritizing residues 21-27 as those more likely to get structured in the initial events of IAPP aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We also find that average nucleation scores per position are significantly different between buried and exposed residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), and that the overall correlation between nucleation score and accessible surface area (ASA) is higher for those structures where each fibril subunit adopts a P-fold (PDB: 6Y1A, 6ZRF, 8R4I, 7M64) and lower for those that consists of different folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). We note that the P-fold is also the fold of the first species identified in the early time points of the time-resolved Cryo-EM characterization of the amyloid reaction for IAPP and the IAPP S20G variant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Suppl Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Suppl.

The insertions of prolines and glycines decrease nucleation in the same continuous stretch we identified measuring substitutions (15-32) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, bottom panel). Within this window, all insertions after position 22, 23, 24 and 25 virtually reduce nucleation, confirming the coordinates of the essential inner core of IAPP amyloids. The N-terminus (aa 1-9) of the peptide is also sensitive to insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Here, the vast majority of these mutations reduce nucleation - with the exception of insertions of cysteines which, similar to substitutions to cysteines in this region, increase the rate of nucleation.

What is more, between residues 10 and 14 even the insertion of prolines and glycines speeds up nucleation, suggesting the presence of an element of secondary structure able to stabilize the IAPP monomeric ensemble against amyloid nucleation. When insertions disrupt it, nucleation becomes more likely, suggesting this region could represent a potential target for small molecule binders able to modulate IAPP nucleation. Binding of chaperones stabilizing this region has been shown to inhibit fibril formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">We have also evaluated the effect of double amino acid insertions that can result from polymerase slippage, i.e. the duplication of two amino acids of the WT sequence, or of one same amino acid, repeated twice. Overall, these insertions of two amino acids have mixed effects, with variants that increase or decrease nucleation across the whole sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Suppl. Fig. 7</xref>). The effect of single amino acid insertions can be used to predict the impact of double amino acid insertions at the same position, especially for those where the same amino acid is repeated (R = 0.73, p-value = 4.2e-06) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Suppl. Fig. 8a</xref>). However, effects of single insertions would be difficult to predict on the basis of the single amino acid substitutions alone (R = 0.32, p-value = &lt;2.2e-16) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Suppl. Fig. 9a</xref>), similar to what was found for the effect of insertions on protein folding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">Finally, the insertion of just one single cysteine (due to single or double amino acid insertions) is enough to increase nucleation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Suppl.

Together with the observation that nucleation is also increased for sequences where mutations result in two adjacent cysteines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Suppl.

Their effects are more drastic when deletions cause loss of Cys 2, Cys 7, Thr 9, and of residues in the NNFGAIL stretch, with the exception of Ala 25 which, in line with the results of substitutions, seems dispensable for the formation of the inner core of IAPP amyloids. Deletions of single residues from position 11 to 16 increase or maintain nucleation, suggesting that alterations of the main chain in this region, other than insertions, can unlock faster nucleation. Finally, also the individual loss of Ser28 or Ser29, which results in two identical sequences, increases nucleation.</p><p id="P22">Most of the large multi-AA disrupt nucleation, but 22 deletions of just 2-4 amino acids, at different positions along the sequence, can increase it (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Suppl.

Among these, we highlight those deletions that don’t reduce the number of cysteines, but rather bring the WT cysteines closer to each other, significantly speeding up nucleation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Suppl. Fig. 10b</xref>). We also observe a contrast between the effect of the loss of two serines, just before or just after the inner core NNFGAIL (S19, S20). The first double deletion (Δ19-20) speeds up the aggregation process, while the latter (Δ28-29) slows it down, in contrast with the individual loss of Ser28 and Ser29. Finally, deletion of the entire 10-14 stretch (QRLAN) and other shorter deletions in this region result in sequences that nucleate faster than WT, further suggesting the presence of a gate-keeping element of secondary structure in this region of IAPP, which in the WT sequence limits aggregation rates.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>The same types of mutations decrease nucleation in IAPP and Amyloid Beta</title><p id="P23">To assess the similarity of mutational impact in different amyloidogenic peptides we compared the IAPP nucleation landscape with that of Aβ42<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.

This atlas reveals 334 GOF mutations that are able to speed up the aggregation of IAPP. These fast nucleators result from mutations of all types, including insertions, deletions and substitutions out of the structured core of IAPP amyloids which would have been hard to predict using currently available aggregation predictors or variant effect predictors.</p><p id="P29">It would have been difficult to predict these GOF variants even on the basis of the complete mutational landscape of Aβ42, another peptide that aggregates extracellularly and that can, under specific circumstances, form fibrils that structurally align to those formed by IAPP. This suggests that simply one dataset is not enough to recapitulate GOF mutational effects in another amyloid dataset and highlights the need to generate variant effect maps for all human amyloids. Similarities between the two datasets are limited to those mutations that disrupt amyloid nucleation, where changes in nucleation caused by the same types of mutations correlate strongly between datasets. Second, in both Aβ42 and IAPP, two interfaces build the structured core of mature fibrils, where strands face each other in a steric zipper. Our results reveal that, for both peptides, mutations are more disruptive in one of the two interfaces.</p><p id="P30">GOF mutations are found more frequently outside of these core regions for both peptides, including those parts of the sequence which are not even resolved in the final structures of mature amyloid fibrils (1-12 for Aβ42 and 1-11 for IAPP). More specifically, in IAPP, we find that 35,6% of single amino acid substitutions and insertions up to residue 15 are GOF, and identify a region (aa 10-21) where 110 out of 214 (51,4%) insertions speed up nucleation, hinting at the presence of a secondary structure element that in the WT could protect against aggregation by stabilizing the IAPP monomeric ensemble.</p><p id="P31">While preventively quantifying amyloid nucleation for 1663 IAPP variants in one unique set-up, our study comes with a series of limitations. Given that nucleation takes place in the yeast cytoplasm, it is likely we are only tracking mutational impact on the reduced version of the peptide. The N-terminal cysteine residues are not part of the published structure of IAPP fibrils and several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that IAPP forms amyloids <italic>in vitro</italic> both in its reduced and oxidized state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. However, our results revealed that mutating cysteines and mutation to cysteines have drastic effects, decreasing and increasing nucleation respectively; we cannot exclude that in this specific experimental set-up cysteines favor nucleation by other mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> which include multimerization via metal chelation. However, there are different lines of evidence suggesting our method accurately captures IAPP amyloid nucleation: 1) nucleation scores discriminate significant differences amongst IAPP sequences from different animals, 2) nucleation scores match with most previous <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments performed in different conditions on unfused peptides and 3) the pattern of mutational impact identifies a core region which corresponds to the minimal IAPP fragment essential for amyloid formation <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p id="P32">The lack of IAPP variants clearly classified and reported on Clinvar and the limited number of IAPP variants currently available in the UK Biobank make it challenging to validate this dataset with human genetics in a conclusive manner. While we find that individuals carrying variants that increase nucleation have slightly higher odds of being diagnosed with T2D, the genetic validation of the dataset, unlocking its use to contribute to clinical variant classification, will have to wait for additional data from sequencing of new T2D patients. However, the preventive quantification of amyloid nucleation presented here can contribute to the classification of these variants whenever they are encountered in the clinic or in healthy individuals. There is also a critical need for the design of soluble IAPP analogs. The dataset presented here can help guide the design of IAPP variants that do not aggregate into amyloids but that are still active and more bioavailable than the currently employed pramlintide.</p><p id="P33">Finally, this work highlights the importance of developing selection assays that, combined to deep mutagenesis, allow the characterization of novel pathogenic gain of function variants, which are particularly hard to predict and to characterize, yet are important drivers of human disease.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Library design</title><p id="P34">The designed library consists of 2000 unique IAPP variants and includes all possible single amino acid substitutions and stop codons at each position (n = 738), all single amino acid insertions at all positions (n = 685), all single amino acid deletions (n = 32), variants with bigger internal deletions with length ranging from 2 to 16 amino acids (n = 374), truncations of the N-terminal (n = 27) or the C-terminal (n = 27), 73 variants resulting from polymerase slippage, synonymous variants (n = 43) and the IAPP WT sequence.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Plasmid library construction</title><p id="P35">The synthetic library was synthesized as an oligo pool by Twist Bioscience and with oligos consisting of IAPP variants region of 30 nt to 117 nt, flanked by 25 nt upstream and 21 nt downstream constant regions. 10 ng of the library were amplified by PCR (Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase, NEB) for 10 cycles with primers annealing to the constant regions (primers MB_01-02, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table S3</xref>), following the manufacturer’s protocol.
