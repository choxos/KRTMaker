Here, we compared the identified motor unit (MU) discharge patterns from decomposed electromyography signals acquired during triangular dorsiflexion contractions up to 70% of maximal voluntary force (MVF) between resistance-trained, endurance-trained, and untrained individuals (n=23 in each group). We then estimated intrinsic motoneuron properties and garnered insight about the proportion of excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory inputs contributing to motor commands across contraction intensities in each group. Participants also performed a task where a triangular contraction was superimposed onto a sustained one designed to challenge inhibitory control of dendritic persistent inward currents (PICs). Both trained groups demonstrated greater MU discharge rates with greater ascending discharge rate modulation during higher contraction forces (≥50% MVF), which were accompanied by more linear MU discharge patterns and greater post-acceleration attenuation slopes of the ascending discharge rates. No differences in discharge rate hysteresis or the discharge rate characteristics during the sombrero tasks between groups, suggesting no differences in neuromodulatory input. Conversely, resistance-compared to endurance-trained individuals exhibited greater acceleration slopes during lower contractions forces (≤50% MVF), indicating the possibility of enhanced initial activation of PICs. Collectively, the greater and more linear MU discharge patterns in the trained groups either suggests a more reciprocal (i.e., push-pull) excitation-inhibition coupling during higher contraction forces or enhanced excitatory synaptic input to the motor pool, which might underpin greater force production of trained individuals.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Electromyography</kwd><kwd>monoamines</kwd><kwd>motor unit</kwd><kwd>persistent inward currents</kwd><kwd>strength training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Motoneurons are highly adaptable to a variety of stressors, including exercise (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gardiner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Macdonell &amp; Gardiner, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Pearcey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Škarabot et al., 2020</xref>). From an electrophysiological perspective, endurance exercise in rodents has been shown to hyperpolarise motoneuron resting membrane potential and voltage threshold, and decrease the spike rise time, the threshold for rhythmic discharge, the minimal steady-state discharge frequency, and the slope of the frequency-current relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Beaumont &amp; Gardiner, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">2003</xref>). Similarly, motoneuron adaptations have been shown in rodent models following resistance training, including an increase in the time course of afterhyperpolarisation and input resistance, and a decrease in minimal steady-state discharge frequency and rheobase current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Krutki et al., 2017</xref>). These changes in intrinsic motoneuron discharge properties with exercise have been attributed to altered ion conductance, particularly those of sodium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gardiner et al., 2006</xref>). However, recent evidence suggests prominent exercise-induced dendritic plasticity leading to alterations within the voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels facilitating dendritic persistent inward currents (PICs) to interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Chen &amp; Dai, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Ge &amp; Dai, 2020</xref>). PICs are also critical for modulating intrinsic excitability of motoneurons and are facilitated by diffuse metabotropic/neuromodulatory inputs via long descending axons of the raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Bennett et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Goaillard &amp; Marder, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Hounsgaard et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Schwindt &amp; Crill, 1980</xref>). Due to the diffuse nature of metabotropic inputs, the gain control of motoneuron output is mediated by the potency and pattern of inhibitory inputs to supress PICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Hyngstrom et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Pearcey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Revill &amp; Fuglevand, 2017</xref>). During a linearly increasing excitatory synaptic input, PICs introduce non-linearities in motoneuron discharge rate by amplifying and prolonging the excitatory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Lee &amp; Heckman, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">2000</xref>), allowing the estimation of intrinsic motoneuron properties and the proportion of excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory motor commands from human motor unit (MU) discharge patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Beauchamp et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Chardon et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">M.

Studies employing subcortical stimulation of corticospinal axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Angius et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Ansdell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Nuzzo et al., 2017</xref>) and sensory activation of motoneurons (for meta-analysis, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Siddique et al., 2020</xref>) often show no changes after training, but in a cross-sectional model of chronic resistance training, alterations in the responsiveness to cervicomedullary stimulation <italic>across contraction intensities</italic> have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Pearcey et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, studies examining MU discharge properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Del Vecchio et al., 2019</xref>) and estimates of PIC magnitude (via onset-offset hysteresis of pairs of MUs; ΔF, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Orssatto et al., 2023</xref>) both show increases in discharge rate and estimates of PICs following short-term training. In a cross-sectional comparison, a previous study estimated human PIC magnitude (ΔF) in several lower limb muscles of resistance-trained, endurance-trained and untrained individuals and observed no differences between the groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Goreau et al., 2024</xref>). However, this investigation was limited to a low level of contraction force (20% of maximal voluntary force, MVF) and therefore low-threshold MUs.</p><p id="P4">Several lines of evidence suggest that adaptations in biophysical properties of motoneurons might be limited to, or be more readily apparent in, higher threshold motoneurons. For example, rat motoneuron cell capacitance has been shown to increase following endurance training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Beaumont &amp; Gardiner, 2003</xref>), whereas the current for inducing rhythmic firing and rheobase current have been shown to decrease following weightlifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Krutki et al., 2017</xref>) and compensatory overload (tenotomy of synergists; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Krutki et al., 2015</xref>) to a greater extent or exclusively in higher threshold motoneurons. We have also shown that the excitatory-inhibitory synaptic coupling is modulated with contraction force. Specifically, inhibition patterns appear to be tonic at low forces, but more reciprocal (push-pull) in relation to excitation at higher intensities, leading to greater linearity of the ascending discharge rate and greater estimates of PIC magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Škarabot et al., 2025</xref>). Given the reported changes in motoneuron receptors linked to the modulation of tonic inhibition after exercise in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Woodrow et al., 2013</xref>) and the potent effect of exercise on synaptic inhibition in humans (e.g. reciprocal inhibition; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Geertsen et al., 2008</xref>), the differences in intrinsic motoneuron excitability and/or motor commands are more likely to differ between trained compared to untrained individuals at higher contraction forces.</p><p id="P5">Here, we estimated potential adaptations in the intrinsic properties of human motoneurons and aimed to garner insights into the proportion of excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory motor commands by examining the MU discharge patterns during contractions up to 70% of MVF in resistance-trained, endurance-trained, and untrained individuals. We hypothesised that MU discharge patterns would become more linear and exhibit greater onset-offset discharge rate hysteresis in trained individuals at greater contraction intensities due to enhanced push-pull pattern of excitation-inhibition coupling. Additionally, we quantified MU discharge properties during a triangular contraction superimposed on a steady low-force task, which has been shown to degrade force control likely due to impaired inhibitory control of PICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Beauchamp et al., 2025</xref>).

Participants returned to the laboratory two to ten days later to complete the experimental session. A warmup was performed initially with participants isometrically contracting their dorsiflexors for 3-5 seconds at 50 (×2), 70 (×2) and 90% (×1) of perceived maximal effort. After that, two isometric dorsiflexion contractions were performed with maximal effort (30-60 s rest between contractions). An additional trial was performed if the instantaneous peak force during the performance of maximal effort contractions differed by more than 5%. The greatest instantaneous force across the trials with maximal effort was taken as maximal voluntary force (MVF).</p><p id="P8">Participants were then tasked to perform triangular contractions with linear increases/decreases of force over 10 seconds up to/from the target of 30, 50, and 70% MVF. Two trials at each contraction level were performed, separated by 30-60 seconds of rest. Following triangular contractions, participants performed a task of a sustained contraction at 10% MVF with a superimposed triangle up to 30 and 50% MVF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Beauchamp et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Goodlich et al., 2024</xref>; &gt;60 seconds of rest between trials). We colloquially refer to this task as ‘sombrero’. Specifically, the force was increased over 3.3 seconds from rest to 10% MVF which was maintained for 10 seconds as accurately as possible (plateau 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>); the force was then linearly increased/decreased over 6.7 seconds to/from the target (30 or 50% MVF), followed by another sustained phase of 10 seconds (plateau 2), and then a slow relaxation over 3.3 seconds (total contraction duration of 40 seconds). Two trials were performed at each force level; the one with the force profile that most closely matched the target based on visual inspection was selected for analysis. Finally, participants performed a sustained task of the equivalent duration to the sombrero task at 10% MVF (3.3-second increase/decrease to/from target, 33.4-second plateau).</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="S6"><title>Force recordings</title><p id="P9">Ankle dorsiflexion forces were measured via a strain gauge (CCT Transducer s.a.s., Torino, Italy) attached to the ankle ergometer (NEG1, OT Bioelettronica, Torino, Italy) that was fitted to a rigid, custom-made chair upon which participants were seated during the experiment. The ankle, knee and hip were positioned at 10° of plantar flexion (0° = anatomical position), and 180° and 120° (180° = full extension), respectively. The foot of the dominant leg was strapped to the ergometer footplate with Velcro at the tarsometatarsal and metatarsal-phalangeal joints, and the knee was strapped to minimise any knee flexion.

The peak discharge rate was taken as the maximal value of the smoothed discharge rate profiles, whereas the recruitment threshold was estimated as the force (in % MVF) corresponding to the first spike in the binary spike train. We also calculated the difference between peak and initial discharge rate to estimate the magnitude of the ascending discharge rate modulation. The magnitude of PICs was estimated by quantifying the onset-offset hysteresis (ΔF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Gorassini et al., 1998</xref>) of suitable pairs of high-threshold (test) units with respect to the lower-threshold (reporter) units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hassan et al., 2020</xref>). For test units with multiple suitable reporter units, ΔF values were averaged per test unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">A. S. Hassan et al., 2021</xref>). A suitable pair of MUs was defined according to the following criteria: 1) rate-rate correlation of r<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.7 to increase the likelihood that the pairs of MUs received common synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Gorassini et al., 2004</xref>); 2) test unit had to be recruited at least 1 s after the recruitment of the reporter unit to increase the likelihood that PICs were fully activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hassan et al., 2020</xref>); and 3) the reported unit discharge rate modulation had to be greater than 0.5 pps whilst the test unit was active, to minimise the effect of saturation on ΔF estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Stephenson &amp; Maluf, 2011</xref>). Additionally, to account for potential confounds when comparing differences in discharge rate hysteresis across contraction levels, we normalised ΔF estimates to the maximal discharge rate modulation of the reporter units from test-recruitment to reporter-unit derecruitment for each test-reporter unit pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Škarabot et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P15">The ascending MU discharge rate modulation was examined with a quasi-geometric approach. The extent of non-linearity (“brace height”), which is influenced by neuromodulation but is minimally influenced by the pattern of inhibition in computer simulations of biologically-realistic motoneuron pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Beauchamp et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Chardon et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Škarabot et al., 2025</xref>), was computed as the maximal orthogonal vector between a theoretical linear line between onset and peak discharge and the ascending smoothed MU discharge rate with respect to the change in force. This vector was then normalised to the height of the right triangle with a hypothenuse between the onset and peak ascending discharge rate that represents the maximal theoretical activation of PICs (i.e. maximal non-linearity with vertical acceleration and complete post-acceleration saturation). Such normalisation accounts for the differences in relative discharge rate modulation (e.g. associated with different contraction forces). The estimation of the ascending non-linearity was considered valid in cases where the acceleration slope was positive, the normalised values did not exceed 200%, and the peak MU discharge rate occurred before peak force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Beauchamp et al., 2023</xref>). The instance of brace height on the ascending MU discharge rate modulation acted as the separator of the acceleration (secondary discharge range) and post-acceleration attenuation (tertiary discharge range) phases, for which we calculated slopes. The attenuation slope has been shown to be particularly influenced by the pattern of inhibitory synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Beauchamp et al., 2023</xref>); notably, however, this sensitivity to inhibitory gain is likely only relevant when assessed at the same contraction level due to the greater relative increase in force with respect to discharge rate when comparisons are made across contraction levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Škarabot et al., 2025</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Motor unit discharge rate prolongation</title><p id="P16">To facilitate the assessment of differences between groups in MU prolongation, MUs identified during the sombrero tasks were separated into two cohorts: “brim” units, which included units recruited in the beginning, i.e. before the superimposed triangular force task; and “cap” units, which included units recruited during the superimposed triangular ramp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). For brim units, we quantified the mean discharge rate during the two plateaus. These calculations were additionally constrained to MUs that exhibited at least 40 discharges during the first plateau. Similar analyses were performed on MUs identified during the sustained contractions; these served as a control condition to ensure that any differences between groups in the discharge behaviour during the first vs. the second plateau were not solely a function of time-dependent adaptations in motoneuron discharge rate (e.g. spike frequency adaptation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Powers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Sawczuk et al., 1995</xref>). For cap units, we quantified the duration of the sustained discharge as the difference in time between derecruitment and the theoretically expected point of derecruitment (i.e. if a unit was recruited 1 second after the beginning of the superimposed triangular ramp, then the theoretically expected point of derecruitment was 1 s before the end of the ramp). Additionally, we quantified the proportion of self-sustained cap MUs with respect to the whole pool of identified cap MUs; the self-sustained cap MUs were classified as those that sustained their discharge for &gt;2 s after the theoretically expected point of derecruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Beauchamp et al., 2025</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P17">To investigate differences between groups in participant characteristics (age, height, mass, physical activity levels), maximal unilateral isometric dorsiflexion strength, and the number of the identified MUs, a linear model was constructed with group as a factor.

Nevertheless, our data suggests that chronic training, and less the type of training, exerts profound effects on motoneuron behaviour during isometric contractions, and future studies should explore these physiological mechanisms in the context of training specificity and different tasks, including those that are currently less conducive for human MU recordings (e.g., dynamic tasks).</p><p id="P41">We assessed MU discharge patterns and discharge characteristics during triangular and sombrero contractions to various target forces, but the signals obtained during these contractions were decomposed individually, likely leading to MU replicates across contraction forces without our ability to ascertain the extent of them. However, we have previously demonstrated similar modulation of MU discharge patterns across contraction levels with and without motor unit tracking in the tibialis anterior muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Škarabot et al., 2025</xref>), suggesting that the absence of tracking herein was unlikely to have influenced our results. The inherent bias to blind source separation algorithms towards higher threshold units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Francic &amp; Holobar, 2021</xref>) might be viewed favourably in this regard as it suggests a greater likelihood of a proportion of unique identified MUs at each contraction level. Conversely, this bias is perhaps a disadvantage for superimposition tasks such as sombrero contractions where cap units are more likely to be identified than those classified as brim units. Nevertheless, the number of identified MUs during sombrero contractions was consistent with prior studies that employed such tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Beauchamp et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Goodlich et al., 2024</xref>). The potential decomposition biases are accounted for in some variables inherently (i.e. a proportion, rather than an absolute number of, units with self-sustained discharge) or by using recruitment threshold of the identified MUs as a covariate in the statistical model.</p></sec><sec id="S26" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P42">The comparison of tibialis anterior motor unit discharge patterns during isometric contractions up to 70% of maximum between resistance-trained, endurance-trained and untrained individuals revealed that the trained groups modulated MU discharge rate to a greater extent, reaching greater peak discharge rates during higher contraction forces. These differences in MU discharge rate in trained individuals were also accompanied by more linear discharge patterns with greater post-acceleration rate attenuation slopes, suggesting smaller <italic>relative</italic> contribution of PICs to ascending discharge rate modulation. These findings can be explained by either more reciprocal/push-pull excitation-inhibition coupling or enhanced excitatory synaptic input which could both result in greater <italic>net excitation</italic> to the motor pool and greater force production of trained individuals.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Vedika Mohite and Yanbin Zhang for their assistance with participant recruitment and data collection.

patterns and prolongation of motor unit discharge rate.</title><p>A: Motor unit (MU) discharge rates during triangular contractions to 30, 50 and 70% of maximal voluntary force (MVF) were smoothed with support vector regression. We then calculated onset-offset discharge rate hysteresis (ΔF) of suitable MU pairs (only 3 units shown for clarity); the test (higher-threshold) unit ΔF values with multiple reporter (lower-threshold) units were averaged. The ascending discharge rate was expressed as a function of force and the length of the maximal orthogonal vector (brace height, BH) between the linear line between onset and peak discharge rate and the smoothed discharge rate was calculated to quantify non-linearity (normalised to the height of the right triangle, BH<sub>max</sub>). The point of brace height acted as a separator between the acceleration (ACC) and post-acceleration attenuation (ATT) phases for which slopes were calculated. B: the identified MUs during “sombrero” (10/30% and 10/50% MVF) and sustained (10% MVF) contractions. The units recruited during the first plateau were classified as “brim” MUs, whereas those recruited during the triangle were classified as “cap” MUs. The behaviour of brim units was compared in the first relative to the second plateau; similar analyses were performed in the sustained contraction at 10% MVF (the units had to display at least 40 discharges during the first plateau to be included; examples of excluded units are presented in opaque colour during sustained contraction). For cap MUs, we quantified the duration of MU discharge with respect to its theoretically predicted derecruitment. Further, the MUs that were discharging for longer than 2 seconds past their theoretical derecruitment were classified as self-sustained discharging MUs and were expressed as a proportion of all cap MUs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206306-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Ensemble average of motor unit discharge patterns during triangular contractions.</title><p>Ensemble force traces (grey) along with cumulative smoothed discharges are depicted for each group (resistance-trained, RT; untrained, UT; endurance trained, ET) as well as ensemble averages of motor unit (MU) discharge patterns based on recruitment threshold in 7% maximal voluntary force (MVF) bins (colour-coded) during triangular contractions up to 30, 50 and 70% of MVF.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206306-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Differences in motor unit discharge rate and hysteresis between resistance-trained (RT), untrained (UT), and endurance-trained (ET) individuals during triangular contractions up to 30, 50, and 70% of maximal voluntary force (MVF).</title><p>A: Peak discharge rate; B: Ascending discharge rate modulation (the difference between peak and initial discharge rate); C: motor unit (MU) discharge rate hysteresis (ΔF; in pulses per second, pps); D: MU discharge rate hysteresis normalised to the maximal discharge rate modulation for each test-reported unit pair.
