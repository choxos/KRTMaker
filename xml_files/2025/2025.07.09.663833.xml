Plant microbiota are known to promote plant resilience. To be able to harness the power of the plant microbiome we need to identify microbiota with health-promoting properties. Recent studies have demonstrated that the bacterium <italic>Chitinophaga pinensis</italic> enhances plant health and increases resistance to fungal infections. Here, we show that <italic>C. pinensis</italic> exhibits an unusually high morphological plasticity, switching between a filamentous and a spherical cell state, each of which is characterized by a distinct transcriptional profile. Despite these transcriptional differences, spherical cells remained metabolically active and replicating, while lacking structural characteristics typically associated with dormant states. Furthermore, the spherical cell morphology of <italic>C. pinensis</italic> facilitates hitchhiking behaviour and motility via surfactin cheating, potentially influencing its dispersal and interactions within the plant microbiome. To investigate the structural dynamics and transcriptional adaptation of this plant endophyte, we applied a combination of microscopy and culture-based techniques. Taken together, our study provides new insights into the morphological flexibility and transcriptional regulation of the plant-beneficial <italic>C. pinensis</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Chitinophaga pinensis</italic></kwd><kwd>endophytes</kwd><kwd>morphological plasticity</kwd><kwd>hitchhiking</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Modern agriculture increasingly faces challenges due to climate change and a growing world population. Therefore, new measures and innovative strategies must be developed to conserve resources and minimize losses to ensure a sustainable future.</p><p id="P3">One of these strategies is to understand and utilize the natural defence and resistance mechanisms of plants. Numerous studies have already shown that the plant microbiota plays a decisive role in this context (reviewed in ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]). Plants and their associated microbiota are often referred to as a holobiont, as they engage in complex symbiotic interactions and have an evolutionary history as a community (reviewed in ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]). Among the most abundant phyla within the plant microbiota, the phylum Bacteroidetes stands out as it contains numerous symbiotic strains associated with various hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].These microorganisms can enhance host fitness either directly by promoting plant health or indirectly by supporting other members of the microbiota. Those that colonize plant tissue without causing harm or negatively affecting the host are known as endophytes. Recent studies have shown that the endophytic strains <italic>Flavobacterium anhuiense</italic> and <italic>Chitinophaga pinensis</italic> contribute to plant health and improve stress tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. The diversity of the plant-associated microbiota reflects a range of strategies that can enhance plant resilience. One such strategy is the “cry-for-help” response, in which plants actively recruit beneficial microbes by releasing root exudates in response to environmental stress. The composition of these exudates varies depending on the stress conditions, which leads to a specific metabolic adaptation of the bacteria already residing in the microbiota and stimulates the production of secondary metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. However, effectiveness of induced stress tolerance depends on the microbiota composition, and missing key members can decrease the response effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. This effect is even more pronounced during activated defence mechanisms in the presence of plant pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. In order to optimize the composition of the microbiota to protect plants naturally, it is important to identify key microbiome members and understand the factors involved in their recruitment.</p><p id="P4">As mentioned above, plants excrete root exudates to actively recruit and shape their microbiota according to their needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. These exudates contain diverse compounds, including sugars, amino acids, enzymes, fatty acids and polyphenols such as flavonoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. To successfully colonize the rhizo- and endosphere, microbes must be able to detect and respond to those signals. Many motile bacteria achieve this through chemotaxis, allowing them to sense and move along chemical gradients via chemosensory pathways that regulate flagellar motors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Depending on their structural adaptations, bacteria utilize different motility strategies, including flagella-driven swimming and swarming or gliding motility, which relies on surface adhesins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. However, some bacteria do not possess chemotaxis arrays or motility mechanisms. This raises the question of how these strains reach the plant and establish themselves within the microbiome. Previous research demonstrated that non-motile spores of endophytic <italic>Streptomyces</italic> can be transported by motile bacteria, a process known as hitchhiking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Hitchhiking allows non-motile bacteria to benefit from chemotactic movements without expending their own energy, potentially providing ecological advantages in host colonization. As proposed by Muok <italic>et al</italic>. (2021) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] and Seymour (2024) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], hitchhiking can also yield in long-term benefits for bacterial communities, facilitating movements through barriers and promoting metabolic exchange.</p><p id="P5">Here, we focus on <italic>Chitinophaga pinensis</italic>, which was recently identified as an important member of the plant microbiota particularly regarding pathogen resistance and stress tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Originally isolated from pine litter, <italic>C. pinensis</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterium found in the endosphere of various plants, including crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. It is known for its ability to degrade complex polysaccharides such as chitin and produce a variety of biologically active molecules, highlighting its potential value for agriculture and industrial applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, previous studies have reported that <italic>C. pinensis</italic> forms so-called myxospores or microcysts, which have been hypothesized to represent a resting stage similar to bacterial spores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. However, these structures have primarily been characterized based on their spherical morphology under the light microscope, and their metabolic state remained unclear. While most research on <italic>C. pinensis</italic> focused on its metabolic capabilities alone, in this study we investigated the ultrastructural morphology of cells as well as their interactions within the holobiont using a combination of microbiological assays, cryo-electron microscopy and transcriptomics. In particular, we aimed to gain insight into whether the morphology of <italic>C. pinensis</italic> depends on the growth conditions, and see how this correlates to the strain´s ability to interact with plant tissue. Additionally, we aimed to determine whether these interactions are solely based on chemical signals or if physical structures, such as outer membrane vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], play a role in the communication with the plant. Notably, the <italic>C. pinensis</italic> strain studied by Carrión (2019) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] is neither motile nor equipped with chemotaxis arrays, which raises questions about its recruitment and ecological role within the holobiont. Finally, we investigated how these characteristics of <italic>C. pinensis</italic> contribute to its ecological function and potential impact on the dynamics of the plant microbiome.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>Chitinophaga pinensis</italic> shows two distinct cell morphologies</title><p id="P6">To gain a better understanding of the general morphology of <italic>C. pinensis</italic> over time, we investigated the cell culture at different incubation times by light microscopy. In fresh cultures up to 20 h of growth, the cells are filamentous and can reach lengths of up to 40 µm, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Intriguingly, between 20 and 40 h of growth, the morphology of <italic>C. pinensis</italic> dramatically transformed from several µm long filamentous cells to small spherical cells with a diameter of 600–700 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). When transferred to fresh media with a lower cell density, the spherical cells reverted to the filamentous cell state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). To gain a more detailed insight into these two cell morphologies, we used cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). Both cell types were enclosed by a typical Gram-negative cell envelope, enclosing a typical cytoplasm filled with evenly distributed ribosomes and other cellular content. Neither cell type resembled previously described spores or cysts, such as for example the presence of a thicker protective cell envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To better visualize the morphological switching of <italic>C. pinensis</italic> from filamentous to spherical growth, we aimed to introduce GFP into the bacterium. The GFP labelling was designed to enable live-cell imaging and precise tracking of morphological changes, particularly since the spherical cells are very small (600–700 nm), making them difficult to keep in focus and distinguish from other particles or debris under the microscope. Therefore, the gene encoding GFPmut3, under the control of its native <italic>gap</italic> promoter, was cloned into pCP23 (details in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Materials and Methods</xref>), a shuttle vector between <italic>Flavobacteria</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>. The resulting construct, pGWS1802, was successfully introduced via electroporation. However, the plasmid was not stably maintained: green fluorescence diminished with each subsequent bacterial generation. This suggests that the plasmid failed to replicate in <italic>C. pinensis</italic>, most likely due to incompatibility of the repB replication origin on pCP23, which is optimized for Flavobacteria and does not function effectively in this species.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Resistance profiles of cell morphologies to environmental and chemical stressors</title><p id="P8">The small spherical cells observed after prolonged growth were consistent with previous reports, which described them as microcysts or spores. However, our cryo-ET results revealed that the small spherical cells forms do not have a typical spore morphology, such as a thickened cell envelope and tightly packed cytoplasm content. Therefore, we wondered whether the two cell morphologies exhibit distinct responses to various physical and chemical stress factors. Both cell morphologies exhibited similar resilience to the following stress factors: UV light irradiation for 10 minutes, heat stress at 60 °C and sonication for up to 5 min. Both cell morphologies of <italic>C. pinensis</italic> survived after desiccation and could be revived by plating on fresh medium. Light microscopic examination of the desiccated <italic>C. pinensis</italic> cells revealed small spherical cells, independent of their initial morphology. Further chemical stress tests showed slight differences in resistance behaviour of the two cell morphologies in response to changes in the pH and in the presence of up to 0.2% ethanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). However, in the presence of 2% ethanol both cell morphologies grew slower, with the OD<sub>600</sub> ≤ 0.25. Neither cell morphology of <italic>C. pinensis</italic> grew in SDS-containing (0.02–2%) media.</p><p id="P9">Overall, the spherical morphology exhibited higher carrying capacity and a slightly shorter doubling time compared to the filamentous cell morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Nevertheless, the differences in the resistance profiles between the two morphologies were marginal.</p><p id="P10">Next, we investigated whether the decrease in cell size and the formation of small spherical cells represented a stress reaction. For this purpose, growth in the presence of salt (0.5–2%) or chloramphenicol (12.5–100 µg/ml) was analysed. When cells with a filamentous phenotype were exposed to higher salinity and chloramphenicol concentrations, the cell size decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). With increasing salt and chloramphenicol concentrations, the spherical cells tended to dominate the culture faster compared to the control conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Regardless of the salt and chloramphenicol concentration in the medium, spherical cells appeared in all cultures after 2 days of incubation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Transcriptomic analysis of 20 h and 40 h cultures</title><p id="P11">Spherical cells were previously assumed to be dormant spores. However, the cryo-EM and resistance assays presented here revealed no structural or physiological features typically associated with dormancy. To assess the changes in transcriptional patterns between the two time points and corresponding culture types, we performed transcriptomic analysis on RNA obtained from cultures harvested after 20 h and 40 h of growth, dominated by filamentous and spherical cells, respectively. All cultures were grown under identical conditions (1.0x TSB, 25 °C, 250 rpm) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). It is important to note that the growth rate of the cultures was comparable.</p><p id="P12">Principal component analysis (PCA) showed a clear transcriptional distinction between the two time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as showing a fold change of ≥ 2 (FC ≥ 2) and an adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value (padj) of 0.05. Based on these criteria, 691 genes were upregulated and 615 downregulated in the 40-h samples compared to the 20-h samples of a total of 6094 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). The lists of up-, down-regulated DEGs and all DEGs were subjected to KEGG pathway enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Genes downregulated at 40-h were significantly enriched for ribosomal components (cpi03010), and upregulated genes were depleted for those involved in amino acid biosynthesis (cpi01230). Additionally, genes involved in fructose and mannose metabolism (cpi00051) and fatty acid biosynthesis (cpi00061) were predominantly downregulated. Within the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, most of the identified genes (19 out of 25) showed reduced expression, including 9 DEGs, indicating a broad transcriptional shift in this pathway.</p><p id="P13">Despite the observed downregulation of genes involved in translation and biosynthesis processes at 40-h, growth measurements under control conditions showed similar growth rates for both time points. The doubling time was 1.53 h at 20-h (µ = 0.45 h<sup>-1</sup>, 95% CI: 1.32 – 1.83), and 1.62 h at 40-h (µ = 0.43 h<sup>-1</sup>, 95% CI: 1.39 – 1.94). The confidence intervals overlapped.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Morphological variation under different culture conditions</title><p id="P14">Next, we sought to determine the factors that trigger morphological changes. For this, we systematically varied (i) cell density (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.2 and 0.5), (ii) nutrient content, and (iii) the presence of quorum sensing (QS) signals using five different media (FM, LM, SM, SMT, B). As these factors are interrelated, they were tested by adjusting their concentrations in the media.</p><p id="P15">The general pattern was a decrease in cell length of approximately 29% for filamentous cells and an increase of about 74% for spherical cells over the measured time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P16">For both morphologies, measurable changes in cell length were observed after 3 h compared to the initial values, and density-related differences became apparent. After a total of 6 h, these differences decreased, and the cell lengths showed a trend towards convergence within each cell morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P17">The influence of cell density was more pronounced in filamentous cells than in spherical cells. In spherical cells, both densities led to a similar increase in length, differing primarily in the speed of increase. In contrast, filamentous cells showed different patterns depending on the initial density; at high density (0.5), cell length decreased continuously by approx. 32% after 6 h, while at low density of (0.2), the cell length initially decreased by 45% after 3 h, followed by an of approx. 27% after 6 h. Deviations from this general pattern were observed in B and SM media, whereby in medium B at higher cell density (0.5), filamentous cells increased in length by approximately 6% over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), while in SM media at lower cell density (0.2), filamentous cells continued to decrease in length after 6 h (approx. 48%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P18">During the experiment, we assumed that the nutrient content of the media decreased in the following order, from the highest to the lowest content: SMT &gt; FM &gt; LM &gt; SM &gt; B. Whereby medium B was assumed to contain neither nutrients nor QS signals. We also presumed that LM contained QS signals from filamentous cells, while SM and SMT contained QS signals from spherical cells.</p><p id="P19">Overall, changes in cell length were observed in both cell morphologies under all conditions tested.

(2021) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] in order to determine the hitchhiking ability of the two cell morphologies of <italic>C. pinensis</italic>. For this purpose, filamentous or spherical cells of <italic>C. pinensis</italic> were isolated and placed on semi-solid media plate over <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. The hitchhiking behaviour of <italic>C. pinensis</italic> cells was assessed by observing their spreading indicated by the yellow-orange colonies.</p><p id="P22">As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, when spherical cells were added, the yellow colonies spread across the plate. When filamentous cells of <italic>C. pinensis</italic> were plated, the colonies remained in the centre of the plate.</p><p id="P23">To understand the nature of the hitchhiking behaviour, we tested the ability of <italic>C. pinensis</italic> to hitchhike in the presence of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> mutants that were impeded in their movements either by inhibition of surfactin production (Δ<italic>espH srfAA</italic>::mls), suppression of flagellar motility (Δ<italic>motAB</italic>}) or absence of flagella (Δ<italic>hag</italic>}). In addition, a laboratory strain of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (DK605) that had lost its swarming ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] was included in this study. The test revealed that the hitchhiking behaviour of <italic>C. pinensis</italic> is independent of flagellar movement and the presence of flagella. While the spherical cells can be dispersed by swarming and sliding motility of <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, they cannot be dispersed by a <italic>B. subtilis</italic> mutant (Δ<italic>espH srfAA</italic>::mls) that is limited to swimming motility and unable to produce surfactin. A surfactin cheating assay demonstrated that the spherical cells of <italic>C. pinensis</italic> follow surfactin dispersal in and on media surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Next, we tested whether the spherical cells of <italic>C. pinensis</italic> follow the surfactin spreading in the presence of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells, assuming that the surfactin produced by <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells is distributed over the entire plate due to their movement.

Although these terms are frequently used, there is neither a clear definition nor a distinction between them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Dormancy is defined as an adaptive state of reduced metabolic activity and arrested growth that enhances survival under unfavourable conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. It is typically associated with structural and physiological adaptations such as thickened cell walls, condensed DNA, and enhanced resistance to environmental stressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. However, stress resistance assays and structural analysis suggest that morphological changes in <italic>C. pinensis</italic> do not follow the classical characteristics of dormancy-associated differentiation. Our transcriptomic analysis indicates a shift in gene expression patterns in spherical cells, suggesting a metabolic slow down, although cells continue to proliferate and maintain distinct transcriptional activity. Furthermore, there was no major difference in growth rate between 20 h and 40 h cultures, dominated by filamentous and spherical cells, respectively. These results suggest that <italic>C. pinensis</italic> does not really enter a dormant phase but instead modulates its transcriptional profile at the molecular level as part of an adaptive response to changing nutrient availability and environmental conditions.</p><p id="P26">Morphological plasticity is a well-documented survival strategy among bacteria, enabling them to respond dynamically to environmental change. Some bacteria undergo sporulation under unfavourable condition, whereas others alter their morphological characteristics to optimize resource acquisition, evade predation, or adapt to fluctuating nutrient availability. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, for example, can undergo filamentation under stress to avoid predation or shrink size to minimize metabolic demands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. In this context, the ability of <italic>C. pinensis</italic> to transition between morphologies may provide similar ecological advantages, contributing to its persistence in diverse environments. Beyond individual survival, morphological transitions can also play a role in microbial community dynamics and interactions with host organisms. Previous studies have shown that microbial morphology can influence biofilm formation, resource competition, and interspecies interactions within complex microbiomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. However, as noted by Shah (2019) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], the ecological consequences of morphological differentiation in bacteria remain underexplored.

Consequently, the link between morphology and transcriptional changes beyond stress adaptation remains insufficiently explored. The observed morphological and transcriptional plasticity in <italic>C. pinensis</italic> challenges conventional assumptions, as filamentation is typically associated with stationary phase adaptation, where secondary metabolite production is prioritized over cell growth and occurs as a stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. In this way, bacteria ensure that secondary metabolites are produced at low cost and with high benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. However, in <italic>C. pinensis</italic>, filamentation and increased transcription of secondary metabolites occurs during early growth when nutrients are abundant, and cell density is low. Filamentation is energetically costly and can reduce fitness and carrying capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], suggesting it must provide compensatory benefits in <italic>C. pinensis</italic>. Filamentation has been associated with several ecological advantages, including improved surface interactions, biofilm formation, competitive polymer degradation, nutrient acquisition in heterogeneous environments, and a possible intracellular spreading mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. The interplay between morphological and transcriptional plasticity in <italic>C. pinensis</italic> reflects a complex regulatory network within the holobiont, likely contributing to microbial stability and adaptation. However, further research is needed to determine whether these morphological transitions provide ecological advantages in competitive environments and how they influence plant-microbe interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Hidden trigger of recurrent morphological change</title><p id="P28">To identify triggers for morphological change beyond stress factors, three commonly described factors – nutrient availability, QS signalling, and cell density – were tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Since these factors co-occur, they could not be tested in isolation. Instead, their concentrations were varied, and the speed of morphological change was analysed. Despite these efforts, no clear trigger could be identified, suggesting a complex interplay of growth conditions and regulatory mechanisms. Previous studies have shown that triggers are only effective under certain conditions. If these conditions are not met, the cell’s regulatory mechanisms intervene and prevent the response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. This could explain why the filamentous cells in SMT increased in size after six hours, whereas in SM, they continued to decrease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). Both media contain QS signals from spherical cells but differed in nutrient composition. Additionally, this effect was absent in filamentous cells at higher initial cell densities, which is a further indicator for a complex interplay of regulatory mechanisms.</p><p id="P29">Triggers may also be masked by secondary effects. It was suggested that high phosphate concentrations may trigger filamentation of <italic>Paraburkholderia elongata</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. However, further analysis revealed that the actual trigger was magnesium deficiency, resulting from intracellular polyphosphate chelation. Similarly, our findings suggest that morphological changes in <italic>C. pinensis</italic> are linked to cell density. This is supported by observations that filamentous cells exhibited density-dependent differences in cell length dynamics, while spherical cells increased in size under all tested conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). This may be due to dilution effects, as spherical cells were harvested from a high-density culture, potentially initiating morphological transitions.</p><p id="P30">Growth rate, rather than cell density alone, likely plays a key role in morphological changes as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>].

This limitation led us to explore whether morphological plasticity provides alternative advantages beyond metabolic efficiency. Given their small size (600–700 nm), the spherical cells of <italic>C. pinensis</italic> could be transported by vascular pressure within plant tissue. However, their movement in soil remains unclear. Without chemotaxis genes, they may rely on other motile bacteria for translocation. Previous studies have shown that some non-motile bacteria exploit the motility of others for their dispersal. For example, the spores of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> can attach to the flagella of motile bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], while the coccoid cells of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> attach directly to the cell body of swimming bacteria and can be passively translocated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>].</p><p id="P32">In our experiments, spherical cells of <italic>C. pinensis</italic> exhibited hitchhiking behaviour but unlike <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spores, this interaction was independent of carrier mobility and presence of flagella. Notably, hitchhiking was observed on swarming plates but not on swimming plates indicating that surface conditions influence this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. In addition, gliding, sliding, and swarming are classified as crowd movements, whereas swimming is an individual behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Crowd movements are an energy-saving, protective and efficient translocation mechanism that optimizes the search for resources in a nutrient-heterogeneous environment such as soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>].</p><p id="P33">Microscopy imaging further supports that hitchhiking in <italic>C. pinensis</italic> is transient rather than a stable attachment, distinguishing if from <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spores. As observed in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), spherical cells loosely associated with <italic>B. subtilis</italic> minicells, possibly via hydrophobic interactions. Notably, some spherical cells had already started elongating and losing their spherical morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), but whether this promotes hitchhiking remains unclear.</p><p id="P34">In dense bacterial communities, population often align in liquid-crystal-like arrangements, promoting collective movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Consistent with this, <italic>C. pinensis</italic> spherical cells moved with <italic>B. subtilis</italic> rather than dispersing independently, despite being capable of surfactin cheating. Cheating on public goods, such as surfactin, is a well-known strategy in cooperative communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. However, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> employ regulatory mechanisms to mitigate cheater exploitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Thus, while hitchhiking behaviour was observed, it remains unclear whether <italic>C. pinensis</italic> actively engages in this process or undergoes passive translocation driven by <italic>B. subtilis</italic> crowd movements. Resolving this distinction is essential for understanding bacterial dispersal mechanisms and plant root colonization.</p><p id="P35">Each piece of knowledge contributes to unravelling and understanding the dynamic interaction within the host-microbiota. In addition, the question of the critical ratio of mobile and immobile bacteria that still allows community mobility should be answered. Considering that some bacteria are motile at low and others at high cell density, the question arises whether this contributes to the community remaining motile under different conditions. It would be also interesting to investigate the extent to which hitchhiking behaviour influences this movement, especially in the presence of plant roots. Some of these questions could potentially be explored in future studies using transparent soil and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P36">Climate change and pollution from conventional agriculture degrade resource quality and put additional stress on plants, weakening their resilience.

In addition, the transition into small spherical cells enables flagella-independent translocation by motile bacteria.</p><p id="P38">Further work is needed to uncover the triggering and control mechanisms of morphological and metabolic plasticity and their role in dynamic and complex interactions. In addition, it is crucial to investigate the extent to which translocation, whether by hitchhiking or crowd movement, contributes to colonization and distribution within plant tissue.
