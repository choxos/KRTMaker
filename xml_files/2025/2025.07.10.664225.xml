These sleep cycles are a striking feature exhibited from infancy through adulthood, yet their underlying mechanisms and functional relevance remain elusive, calling for large-scale longitudinal studies. Here we leverage Locomotor Inactivity During Sleep (LIDS), previously established in adults as an accessible means to track sleep cycles, to chart ultradian sleep cycle dynamics within the first year of life at scale. Specifically, we analyzed &gt; 35, 000 hours of sleep from a longitudinal dataset of 152 infants with 10 days of actigraphy at 3, 6, and 12 months of age. Using advanced signal processing techniques, we demonstrate the existence of rhythmic patterns in LIDS in infants with a cycle length of ~60 minutes. Cycles were not only shorter in infants than parents (−11.8 min, 95% C.I. [−13.8, −9.8]) but also increased by ~10 min from 3 to 12 months of age, mirroring previous results in smaller samples for NREM-REM sleep cycles. This increase was found to be partially mediated by an increase in sleep bout duration with age (+1.0 min/h, [+0.9, +1.2]). Longer cycles were also found in infants still breastfed at 12 months (+2.5 min [+0.4, +4.5]) and their breastfeeding mothers (+6.7 min [+0.5, +12.9]). We also explored variations in non-rhythmic LIDS patterns in relation to endogenous and exogenous factors. Overall, our results provide evidence of a link between rhythmic patterns in limb inactivity and sleep cycles in infancy, underscoring the potential of studying these in large-scale population cohorts for developmental and health outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>infant</kwd><kwd>ultradian</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>NREM-REM cycles</kwd><kwd>actigraphy</kwd><kwd>wearables</kwd><kwd>early childhood</kwd><kwd>baby</kwd><kwd>sleep regulation</kwd><kwd>longitudinal</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Ultradian rhythms, biological rhythms with cycle lengths in the hour range and no obvious environmental synchronizers, are manifest across the animal kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] and across biochemical, physiological and behavioral processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] such as gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], hormone release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], body temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], feeding habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] and motor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Despite the ubiquity of ultradian rhythms, their underlying generative mechanisms are largely unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], and their biological function(s) remains equally elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Around 70 years ago, in 1955, Aserinsky and Kleitman observed ultradian rhythms in “bodily movements” in infants during sleep, synchronized with the peculiar ultradian rhythms of ocular motility they had previously noticed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], confirming an even earlier report of this phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Two years later, Dement and Kleitman described in detail similar observations in adults: brain activity, eye and body movements vary in an ultradian cyclic manner throughout the night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. These discoveries led to the first definition of ultradian sleep cycles based on cyclic changes in sleep physiology. Following the shift to an EEG-oriented definition of sleep and sleep stages, Feinberg and Floyd updated this early definition in 1979 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], which is still in use today: Cycles are defined as the alternation between non-REM (NREM) sleep periods (including all stages of NREM sleep and intermittent wake) and REM sleep periods (REM sleep and intermittent wake over 5 min total) and are accordingly called NREM-REM cycles. A recent retrospective study of ~ 6000 polysomnographic recordings reported a median sleep cycle length of 96 min in adults with wide variation in cycle length between and within individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Despite these early observations of the cyclic nature of sleep, much about the ultradian dynamics of sleep remains elusive today. For example, mechanisms of sleep cycle generation and the functional relevance of rhythm characteristics are still enigmatic (although see recent advances in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]). This lack of understanding may be largely driven by the difficulty of monitoring sleep cycles at scale, which is necessary to overcome the variability in cycle dynamics characteristic of all ultradian rhythms. Hence, using simpler recording methods than polysomnography, which can be more easily deployed in large numbers of individuals, longitudinally and in everyday environments, appears to be an intuitive path to gaining more data and thus a better understanding of ultradian sleep cycles.</p><p id="P7">In 2018, we demonstrated that Locomotor Inactivity During Sleep (LIDS), derived from simple wrist-worn actigraphy in everyday life, is an easy method to detect ultradian rhythms in movement during sleep in school-age children, adolescents and adults, and their dynamics are highly similar to NREM-REM sleep cycles assessed with polysomnography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. The detected inactivity rhythms oscillate with a cycle length of ~ 90 <italic>–</italic> 110 min and show characteristic variability, while the mean inactivity levels were found to decline progressively overnight. This decline as well as the oscillation amplitudes were reduced with increasing age, suggesting not only usefulness for ultradian monitoring but also potentially for depth of sleep and homeostatic sleep pressure. Here, we show that the LIDS methodology can also be applied during a particularly critical period in life that is marked by rapid and substantial changes in sleep: infancy.</p><p id="P8">During the first year of life, sleep undergoes remarkable development: starting from a polyphasic sleep-wake pattern after birth with multiple short sleep bouts scattered almost evenly across the 24-hour day, sleep bouts gradually consolidate, and become increasingly concentrated during the night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. This change in sleep-wake organization is attributed to the maturation of two important sleep regulatory systems: the circadian system, which promotes wakefulness during the biological day and sleep during the biological night, and the homeostatic system, which tracks the wake-dependent accumulation of sleep pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].</p><p id="P9">Interestingly, in early infancy, sleep states are commonly referred to as quiet (NREM) and active (REM) sleep - suggesting differences in motor behavior which help demarcate sleep cycles, which also initially led to their discovery by Denisova and by Aserinsky [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Only after the first two to three months of life do the differences in EEG appear that clearly distinguish REM and NREM sleep and the NREM substages. This is intriguing as it might indicate that rhythmic motor activity predates the appearance of specific brain activity patterns that allow the classification of sleep epochs into discrete stages. It might also suggest that while sleep physiology is still maturing, the ultradian cycling mechanism is already functional at an early life stage and that its manifestation might be greater in motor activity than in brain activity. Indeed, monitoring of infants’ breathing and body movements with a pressure sensitive mattress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] revealed cycles in quiet sleep with a period of 63 min at 2 to 5 postnatal weeks. Evidence for the presence of such cycles as early as the first postnatal days was also put forward by Freudigman and Thoman in 1994 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p><p id="P10">Therefore, already from the first weeks of life, infant sleep alternates between two states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], a clear manifestation of ultradian sleep cycles. These sleep cycles are on average 50-60 min long [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,] and thus markedly shorter than the 90-110-min cycles observed in adults. Studies based on small or cross-sectional samples suggest that cycles may gradually lengthen over the course of infancy and early childhood to reach adult-length cycles by school-age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]However, strong longitudinal evidence is lacking given the cumbersome nature of polysomnographic recordings especially in this age group.</p><p id="P11">Here, we used a longitudinal infant and parent dataset with ankle-actigraphy recordings at 3, 6, and 12 months after birth to explore the potential of using motor patterns during sleep via our LIDS methodology to study infant sleep dynamics, particularly those of ultradian sleep cycles. We address multiple questions: Are there ultradian rhythms detectable in infant in-activity during sleep as early as 3 months of age? Do these rhythms show characteristics typical of NREM-REM cycles at this age, i.e., a cycle length around 50-60 min with high variability and shorter lengths than those in adults and their parents? And finally, how do these ultradian rhythms change over the first year of an infant’s life, both in infants and parents? For the latter question, we explored not only cycle lengthening with age but also associations with multiple other key endogenous and exogenous factors including sex, sleep-wake cycle maturation, breastfeeding and sleep location, which are held to influence sleep quality but have never been systematically assessed in large datasets for links with ultradian sleep cycles.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P12">The work presented here analyzed data from a longitudinal study of infant sleep and gut microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], in which a total of 162 infants living in the area of Zurich were enrolled. In addition, 100 of the infants’ parents (74 mothers and 26 fathers) opted to contribute their own data to complement the data of their infant.

See Tables 1 and S1 for participant details. Parents were instructed to attach their own device to the non-dominant hand and the infant’s device to the ankle using a modified sock or a Tyvek paper strap. In addition, parents completed 24-hour diaries to document infant sleep episodes as well as times when the device was removed (primarily during bathing and swimming).</p><p id="P14">Feeding, sleeping habits as well as infants’ sleep location were also reported by the parents using questionnaires. At each time point, breastfeeding frequency was assessed on a 5-item scale, ranging from “1:never” to “3:occasionally (1-2 times a week)”, up to “4:regularly (3-5 times a week)” and “5:daily”. For the purposes of our analysis, breastfeeding was coded as “No” for levels 1 to 3 and as “Yes” for levels 4 and 5. Parents were also asked to describe their infant’s sleep location using a questionnaire providing 15 different sleep configurations (e.g.”Infant bed in separate room” or “In parents’ bed”). Here, these were classified with respect to their parents as “Separate room” or “Same room”. The latter category was further divided into “Separate bed”,”Same bed” or “Attached cot” (a semi-enclosed cot attached to the parental bed).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Actigraphy processing</title><p id="P15">Actigraphy data pre-processing as well as sleep bout detection were performed with Matlab (R2016b), while all subsequent processing steps were performed in Python with the <italic>pyActigraphy</italic> software (v0.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>].</p><sec id="S6"><title>Pre-processing</title><p id="P16">As described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], raw accelerometry data acquired at a sampling frequency of 30 Hz were converted to activity counts in order to use validated sleep detection algorithms. In brief, following the method by Te Lindert et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], a 3-11 Hz bandpass Butterworth (order 5) filter was applied to the magnitude of the acceleration vector along the 3 axes, which was then converted into counts by discretizing this value between 0 and 5g into 128 bins and summing the peak value measured every second over a period length of 1 minute.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Sleep bout detection and selection</title><p id="P17">Bouts of likely sleep (relative immobility), henceforth referred to as “sleep” for simplicity, were automatically identified from actigraphy recordings using the same procedure as in prior publications of this dataset, a modified version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>] of the algorithm developed by Sadeh and colleagues (1994) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Modifications improved agreement between diary and actigraphy data and included an adapted threshold and a consolidation step where short active bouts (<italic>≤</italic> 5 min) surrounded by sleep were relabeled as sleep. Biases in recorded activity levels were reduced by excluding bouts where the infant was reportedly sick. Finally, from the sleep-wake scoring, the nighttime sleep percentage was calculated per infant per time point as the fraction of sleep duration occurring in the 12 hours between 19:00 and 07:00 with respect to the total sleep duration.</p><p id="P18">From all such estimated sleep bouts, we then selected only those occurring during the putative main sleep episode (defined as starting between 18:00 and 08:00) to minimize recording artifacts from external movement common during daytime at that age (from strollers, prams, carriers, etc.). We further selected bouts of a minimum duration of 90 min to enable adequate characterization of rhythms in the range of 40-90 min as informed by Singular Spectrum Analysis (see below). To prevent undue loss of data from this 90-min criterion and bias towards consolidated sleepers and later time points, we fused sleep bouts that were less than 15 min apart by padding the gaps with “Not a Number” (NaN) to represent missing data and retain the original temporal distance between the recorded activity patterns. Fused bouts were only included if they contained not more than 20% NaNs across their final duration. As a result, we were able to retain a median of 83 − 88% of sleep data per infant across all 3 time points (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Locomotor Inactivity During Sleep (LIDS)</title><p id="P19">To study ultradian rhythms during sleep based on movement, activity counts during nighttime sleep bouts were converted to Locomotor Inactivity During Sleep (LIDS) following the procedure first laid out in Winnebeck et al.

To avoid misinterpreting noise components as significant regular oscillations, a Monte Carlo SSA (MC-SSA) hypothesis test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] from the python software <italic>MCSSA</italic> (v0.0.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>] was also used.</p><p id="P25">SSA aims to construct an additive decomposition of the original signal into a trend, regular oscillations, and a noise component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Each component is associated with a singular value accounting for its partial variance. The MC-SSA then compares this signal decomposition to the decomposition obtained from an ensemble of random time series generated from a 1st-order autoregressive process (red noise). For each component, it is then possible to test the null hypothesis that this component originates from stochastic fluctuations.</p><p id="P26">To resolve infant periodicities in the same range as in our previous LIDS study in adults (up to 180 min), we chose an SSA embedding window length of 2.5 h. This meant that the required minimum sleep bout duration for SSA was 5 h, i.e. double the window length, as recommended for maximal separation of oscillations and noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. The first detected sleep bout &gt; 5 h from each infant at each time point was thus selected for SSA. Components with the 15 highest partial variances were kept, and components with a relative difference below 0.15 between their singular values were merged. These components were then statistically tested with MCSSA. Only statistically significant components were retained. Finally, to coarsely characterize each component, the cycle length associated with its maximal power, derived with a Fast Fourier Transform, was considered as the main cycle length.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Lomb-Scargle periodogram</title><p id="P27">In order to cross-check the presence of oscillations in infant inactivity, another periodic signal detection method was used: the Lomb-Scargle periodogram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>] as implemented in the R package <italic>MetaCycle</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>].

Specifically, sleep moved more into the night, increasing the proportion of daily sleep occurring at night from a median of 72.3% at 3 months to 82.5% at 12 months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), and was paralleled by an increase in the main nighttime sleep episode duration from a median of 9.9h per night per infant to 10.6h over the same time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, we included an infant’s proportion of nighttime sleep in all key statistical analyses as a putative marker of maturation of the infant’s circadian and homeostatic system. Furthermore, nighttime sleep markedly consolidated over the assessment period. The median number of detected sleep bouts per night per infant evolved from 5 bouts at 3 months to 2 bouts at 12 months, with the median bout duration lengthening by 3.3 h, from 1.1 h to 4.4 h over this period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Although we fused bouts separated by less than 15 min of wake for an optimal and minimally biased inactivity rhythm analysis (see Methods), sleep bout durations retained their characteristic variability within and between individuals and time points. We therefore also included bout duration as covariate in our statistical analyses. Importantly, the sleep-wake pattern development in our infant sample was aligned with nighttime sleep duration and consolidation reported in other infant cohorts (e.g. Rise&amp;Shine cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>] and CHILD-SLEEP cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]).</p><p id="P48">In addition to the longitudinal sleep-wake pattern changes, many of the parameters known or hypothesized to influence sleep quality, and thus considered as covariates in our analyses, also evolved markedly between the 3 recording time points (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

The unweighted histogram (inset) demonstrates that components with cycle lengths of 20-30 min were most abundant, followed by cycle lengths of 60 min. When weighted for the partial variance explained by each component, however, only the peak located around 60 min remained visible, indicating oscillations with a ~ 60-min cycle length dominated the inactivity signals in infants at 3 months. This was confirmed by a second rhythm analysis, Lomb-Scargle periodograms across the full sample at 3 months, which also detected oscillations with a cycle length distribution peaking at ~ 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Not only do most individual bouts show clear rhythms in inactivity (see example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), but also the averaged signal across all sleep bouts displays a rhythm in inactivity during infant sleep at all time points. While the oscillation of the averaged signal quickly dampens due to destructive interference from differing periods and phases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A, B</xref>), period-normalization of the timeline and prior phase alignment of each bout’s inactivity signal reveals a strong, sustained oscillation in ankle inactivity during infant sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). Just like previously observed in adults, there is also a gradual decline in the levels of the inactivity oscillation over the course of sleep in infants.</p><p id="P52">To systematically characterize these ultradian inactivity rhythms in infants and compare them to those of their parents, parameter values were estimated via cosine model fits for LIDS cycle length, amplitude, offset, slope, and phase across the infant and parental samples.

Statistical testing using Bayesian generalized mixed model regressions indicated 12 min shorter median LIDS cycle lengths in infants than in their parents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>).</p><p id="P54">Further visual and statistical comparisons between infants and parents at the 3-month time point revealed differences not only in LIDS cycle length but also in all other LIDS parameters except for LIDS phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). Parents had a smaller LIDS amplitude (−7.2 LIDS units), indicating that the oscillatory range in infants was larger than in parents, a higher LIDS offset (+7.4 LIDS units), indicating that infant inactivity was lower at the beginning of sleep than in parents, and a flatter LIDS slope (+1.6 LIDS units/h), indicating that the decline of inactivity over the course of sleep was steeper in infants than in parents. These results are in general agreement with results from the original LIDS analysis in children and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], where LIDS cycle length was found to lengthen with age, from 5 to 92 years, while amplitude and decline were reduced. The results for phase do not provide evidence that infant and parent LIDS rhythms start at different points of the oscillation in relation to the actigraphy-defined sleep bout onset. With the modified Sadeh algorithm employed here, the inactivity rhythm was on average just before the trough at detected sleep onset, which is slightly earlier than with the MASDA algorithm in Winnebeck et al.

As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, all three methods used for LIDS cycle length determination, SSA, Lomb-Scargle periodogram and cosine fits, indicate a gradual lengthening of inactivity cycles over the first year of life. The statistical analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S5 and S6</xref>), based on the cosine fit estimates, puts the covariate-adjusted increase in LIDS cycle length at +4.7 min between 3 months and 12 months of age, while not detecting a statistically significant difference between 3 months and 6 months.</p><p id="P57">Importantly, inactivity cycle length was also found to increase with sleep bout duration (+1.0 min/h, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>), an effect previously also detected in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Since infant sleep bout duration increased markedly with age, doubling from 4.8h at 3 months to 9.9h at 12 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), the overall increase in LIDS cycle length between 3 and 12 months amounted to 9.8 min (4.7 min + 1.0 min/h <italic>×</italic> 5.1h).

This indirect quantification is confirmed by a dedicated mediation analysis, which showed 35% of the effect of age on LIDS cycle length was mediated by the increase in bout duration, whereas 65% occurred independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). Likewise, when selecting only bouts &gt; 5 hours and restricting the cosine fit to the first 3 h of each bout, LIDS cycle length was still found to be longer at 12 months (+3.1 min) compared to 3 months (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S8</xref>), demonstrating that cycle lengthening with age was detectable also in a sample of homogeneous bout durations and identical cosine fit lengths.

Compared to 3-month-old infants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>), infants at 6 and 12 months had a lower LIDS amplitude (−2.3 LIDS units at 6 months, −1.6 LIDS units at 12 months). At the same time, LIDS offset increased (+3.3, +1.5 LIDS units) as did LIDS slope (+0.7, +0.8 LIDS unit-s/h). The increase over time of LIDS offset shows that LIDS oscillations were initiated with a higher level of inactivity as the infants grew older, while the increase in the generally negative LIDS slope indicates a shallower decline in inactivity over the course of sleep at later time points. Together, this means that the overall level of inactivity remained higher throughout the sleep bout for older infants. As noted in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], the probability of awakening most likely increases as the level of inactivity decreases. These results are thus compatible with infants having more consolidated sleep bouts and, therefore, longer sleep bouts during the night at 6 and 12 months compared to 3 months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P60">No systematic differences in LIDS phase between time points were observed. However, it can be seen in the inactivity profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>) that, while rescaling the bout timelines with their individual LIDS cycle length seemed sufficient to reveal clear oscillations at 3 months, this was not the case at 6 and 12 months. This might point towards an increased variability of the LIDS phase at these time points, at least between individuals. Accordingly, aligning the LIDS phase between sleep bouts did restore visible oscillations at 6 and 12 months.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Endogenous factors: sex and sleep-wake cycle maturation</title><p id="P61">In none of the statistical models did the proportion of nighttime sleep show any association with any inactivity parameters. This is likely due to the low variability in this marker between infants and possibly its colinearity with bout duration and age.</p><p id="P62">Sex also explained little of the variation in infant inactivity parameters, with none of the effects reaching statistical significance. However, two patterns were notable: firstly, male infants tended towards longer sleep cycles (+1.3 min, 95% C.I.: [−0.08, +2.83]) across the full sample when accounting for sleep bout duration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>). Secondly, LIDS offset tended towards lower levels in male infants (−0.8 LIDS units, [−1.77, +0.21]; Tab S6) suggesting greater movement during sleep in males.</p><p id="P63">This matches several previous reports on sex differences in infant sleep motility, despite a lack of consistency across studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>], as well as LIDS results in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] and our result here in fathers (see below).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Exogenous factors: breastfeeding and sleep location</title><p id="P64">At 3 months, all infants in this study were regularly breastfed, while this was the case for just more than a third of the cohort at 12 months. We therefore explored differences in LIDS characteristics linked to differences in breastfeeding status at this last recording time point via a dedicated statistical model including breastfeeding status (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S9</xref>). At 12 months, infants that were still breastfed at least 3-5 times per week had a longer LIDS cycle length (+2.5 min), as well as a higher LIDS offset (+1.4 LIDS unit), meaning that breastfed infants had longer inactivity cycles and initiated their sleep at a higher inactivity level compared to non-breastfed infants of the same age. Other LIDS parameters were not statistically linked to breastfeeding status.</p><p id="P65">In addition, we found associations between infants’ night-time sleep location and LIDS characteristics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S5</xref> and S6). Compared to infants sleeping in a separate room, infants sleeping in their parents’ bed had longer LIDS periods (+2.9 min), lower LIDS amplitudes (−0.9 LIDS units) and a flatter LIDS decline (+0.3 LIDS units/h). These results were qualitatively identical to those obtained with the model including breastfeeding using sleep bouts collected at 12 months only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S9</xref>). Interestingly, the direction of the effects (increase or decrease) of sleeping predominantly in the parental bed and LIDS characteristics was similar to the effect of age.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Factors associated with parental rhythm characteristics</title><sec id="S25"><title>Parental role</title><p id="P66">In parents, LIDS cycle length was stable across all time points. However, compared to mothers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S10</xref> and S11), fathers exhibited a shorter LIDS cycle length (−4.7 min) as well as a</p><p id="P67">lower LIDS amplitude (−0.5 LIDS units).</p><p id="P68">Furthermore, fathers seemed to initiate their sleep at lower inactivity levels as reflected by a lower LIDS offset (−1.2 LIDS units), with the difference even further increased at 6 months by an additional −1.5 LIDS units.

The fact that LIDS offset was also lower at 12 months, compared to 3 months, corroborates this interpretation.</p><p id="P69">Other LIDS parameters were not statistically different between mothers and fathers.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Breastfeeding (mothers only)</title><p id="P70">As breastfeeding might induce physiological changes that can, in turn, alter sleep in women, potential links between LIDS characteristics and maintained breastfeeding at the 12-months time point were also statistically assessed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S12</xref>). Indeed, at 12 months, compared to non-breastfeeding mothers, breast-feeding mothers had a longer LIDS cycle length (+6.7 min) as well as a steeper LIDS slope (−0.5 LIDS unit), indicating a faster decline of the inactivity levels. Other LIDS parameters were not statistically linked to breastfeeding habits.</p><p id="P71">It is interesting to note that both breastfed infants and breastfeeding mothers had a longer LIDS cycle length compared to their non-breastfeeding/fed counterparts.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Sleep location</title><p id="P72">The same statistical model for mothers at 12-months indicates associations between the sleep location of the infant and the mother’s LIDS characteristics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S12</xref>).

When families reported that their infant was sleeping predominantly in the parental bed, parents’ LIDS amplitude was again greater (+1.4 LIDS units) and LIDS offset was lower (−1.6 LIDS units) than when infants slept in a separate room. In contrast, in this model, the longest ultradian cycle lengths for parents were found when the infant slept in an attached cot (+6.3min), not in a separate bed as at 12 months.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S28" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P74">Our study analyzed limb movement patterns during sleep as a window into infant and parental sleep physiology during infants’ first year of life. We extracted both rhythmic and non-rhythmic patterns of Locomotor Inactivity During Sleep (LIDS) from actigraphy and investigated associations with key endogenous and exogenous factors such as sex, sleep bout duration, breast-feeding, and sleep location to explore the potential of this approach for studying the functional relevance of sleep cycle dynamics in health and disease. Most notably, employing a range of careful analytic techniques, we demonstrated the existence of ultradian rhythms in infant inactivity that are compatible with inactivity patterns reflecting ultradian sleep cycles. These cycles lengthened between 3 and 12 months of age in concert with age and also with consolidation of sleep bouts, providing strong longitudinal evidence that sleep cycles lengthen gradually during development. Below we discuss the interpretation of the different inactivity pattern characteristics extracted from the LIDS signal, separating them by rhythmic and non-rhythmic components and by patterns associated with endogenous and exogenous factors.</p><p id="P75">A rich signal, such as limb movement during sleep, even with enhanced contrast between movement and non-movement via transformation to inactivity, inherently possesses many quantifiable features. Characterizing the LIDS signal using a cosine fit with a linear slope, we extracted five parameters of the inactivity signal during sleep. LIDS cycle length, amplitude, and phase are quantifications of the rhythmic aspects of the signal and might be interpreted as reflecting the periodicity, amplitude and phase of an underlying ultradian process. Phase, which quantifies the state of the inactivity rhythm at the beginning of the sleep bout, needs to be carefully interpreted as it is greatly dependent on the sleep-wake detection algorithm in cases where this is also based on movement like in our sample. In contrast, LIDS offset and LIDS slope quantify non-rhythmic aspects of inactivity during sleep, indicating the density and intensity of movement at the beginning of the bout (offset) and the gradual decline in inactivity with time asleep (slope). The latter reflects the previously observed gradual increase in movement during infant sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. Notably, amplitude also carries information about the amount of movement, and its extent is directly influenced by the intensity of movement through the non-linearity in the LIDS transform, therefore making amplitude a rhythmic and non-rhythmic parameter at the same time.</p><p id="P76">Based on prior research into body movements and sleep, including our own work on LIDS, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], the most parsimonious interpretation of the non-rhythmic components extracted from LIDS is that they may reflect sleep depth and sleep pressure. Notably, deep sleep is more prominent in the first half of the night and is linked with lower motor activity. Thus, higher inactivity levels towards the beginning of a sleep bout likely correspond with deeper sleep early on in the bout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Another key feature of sleep is sleep homeostasis: the accumulation of sleep pressure during wakefulness and its gradual dissipation during subsequent sleep, in parallel with the decrease of deep sleep/slow wave activity over the course of the sleep bout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. In infants, similarly to adults, mean inactivity levels decreased overnight in line with the gradual change from deeper sleep to lighter sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Thus, the non-rhythmic components extracted from the LIDS signal may reflect both sleep depth and the dissipation of sleep pressure, an interpretation we use below for the findings in this study. However, it is without question that formal testing of this interpretation, using studies of experimental sleep restriction, will be essential to validate it.</p><p id="P77">Turning now first to the rhythmic patterns in inactivity during sleep, the central observation of our study was that motor inactivity during sleep is rhythmic in infants at 3 months, with a cycle length of approximately 60 min. This was established using three different analysis methods, Singular Spectrum Analysis, Lomb-Scargle periodogram and cosine model fitting. The results were not only in agreement with each other but also with the expected length of the NREM-REM sleep cycle for infants of this age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Moreover, these findings go full circle with the original discovery of sleep cycles, where motility cycles were one of the main features characterized by Denisova, Aserinsky and Kleitman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Additionally, infants showed shorter cycle lengths in inactivity than their parents, aligning with previous findings of different NREM-REM cycle lengths in infants and adults. This leads us to believe that both NREM-REM cycles and LIDS cycles are the manifestation of the same underlying ultradian process.</p><p id="P78">Furthermore, we demonstrated that inactivity cycles lengthen between 3 and 12 months of age by +4.7 min explained by the the main effect of age and by an additional +5.1 min explained by the increase in sleep duration. The developmental lengthening of LIDS cycles seems to parallel quite precisely the previously reported lengthening of NREM-REM sleep cycles in infancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Indeed, in their longitudinal study of 15 infants, Louis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] demonstrated an increase in sleep cycle length of +11 min between 3 and 12 months, matching the increase we observed here (+9.8 min) over the same developmental period. Besides, in our study, this lengthening was evident across three different analysis techniques (SSA, Lomb-Scargle and cosine fit), which each have their own advantages and disadvantages in accommodating non-stationary signals, focus on cycle length determination or stability. Interestingly, the first two techniques, contrary to the cosine fits, indicated that lengthening occurred already between 3 and 6 months of age and therefore was gradual over the first year. This gradual nature of sleep cycle development in infants is corroborated by the cross-sectional report of Ficca et al. studying infants of diverse ages across the first year of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Our study adds substantial longitudinal evidence for gradual sleep cycle lengthening in a large sample of 150 infants over multiple consecutive nights per time point.</p><p id="P79">This central finding of developmental lengthening of ultradian sleep cycles could be linked to various phenomena, such as the maturation of an ultradian process underlying both NREM-REM and LIDS rhythmicity. As also observed in our sample (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), the circadian and homeostatic systems mature with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>], resulting in more consolidated sleep bouts at night. Our mediation analysis revealed that longer sleep bout duration due to older age coincides with longer ultradian cycle lengths. Inter-individual differences in this system’s maturation may result in variability in the infant’s ability to generate consolidated and thus longer sleep bouts at night. But, as the cycles lengthen with age, longer cycles might also be considered as a sign of a more mature ultradian rhythm. Considered altogether, our observations of the endogenous factors affecting rhythmic components of sleep physiology suggest an interplay between the maturation of the ultradian and circadian systems.</p><p id="P80">When it comes to interpreting the exogenous effects on sleep cycles as gleaned from inactivity, the literature is more sparse, and our interpretations accordingly more speculative in nature. Nevertheless, we observed that breastfed infants at 12 months had longer LIDS cycle lengths, and therefore potentially a more mature ultradian rhythm than non-breastfed infants similar to older age. In addition, human breast milk composition exhibits diurnal variation; it presents higher levels of cortisol during the day and conversely higher levels of melatonin during the night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. Breastfeeding constitutes a hormonal <italic>zeitgeber</italic> that may facilitate circadian entrainment in infants and contribute to the maturation of the circadian system, as evidenced by an earlier appearance of a circadian rhythm in core body temperature in breastfed compared to non-breastfed infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. This observation aligns with our previously stated hypothesis that circadian and ultradian rhythms are, in part, interrelated. Another explanation is that breastfeeding might also promote microbial diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>] and thus interact with the sleep-gut axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Indeed, within the same infant sample, a more diverse gut microbiome was linked to reduced daytime sleep. Considering that the circadian system actively promotes wakefulness during the day, less daytime sleep in infants might be interpreted as a more mature circadian system, which would in turn affect ultradian outputs. Conversely, a homeostatic explanation could be that the slower accumulation of homeostatic sleep pressure during wakefulness would also lead to less daytime sleep. Nonetheless, this observation should guide future studies, as interventions could be designed around modifiable factors that alter sleep and/or the gut microbiome during early infancy. Interestingly, breastfeeding mothers also showed a longer LIDS cycle, and further investigation is needed to determine whether this may also be linked to hormonal or microbial changes.</p><p id="P81">Turning to the non-rhythmic features of the inactivity signal, we observed multiple noteworthy associations with endogenous factors also in these. Firstly, LIDS offset (inactivity level at sleep onset) was lower in infants than in parents. This can be explained by the generally higher activity level of infants during sleep compared to adults, which is well documented and would result in lower LIDS offsets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. We also observed an increase in LIDS offset with age. If interpreting in the context of sleep homeostasis, this could potentially be indicative of higher sleep pressure in older infants, in line with our previous observation about decreased daytime sleep and consolidated, longer sleep bouts during nighttime. Additionally, LIDS slope (inactivity decline over the course of the sleep bout) showed a steeper decline in infants than in parents, possibly indicating a faster dissipation of homeostatic sleep pressure in infants, which is in line with mathematical models of infant sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>] and also with higher occurrence of slow-wave sleep in infants, a hallmark of sleep pressure dissipation, during the night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. However, infants maintained higher inactivity levels through the night as they grew older. It remains unclear if this is a cause or a consequence of sustained sleep episodes in older infants. Finally, LIDS amplitude was higher in infants than in parents, but decreased as infants aged. This phenomenon likely also reflects generally higher activity levels in infants. It remains to be investigated whether the pronounced LIDS amplitude in early infancy reflects the distinct neurophysiological features of infant sleep, as may be revealed by EEG markers of active and quiet sleep.</p><p id="P82">Finally, we also observed exogenous effects on the non-rhythmic aspect of inactivity in what is a highly exploratory analysis of this topic, given the small prior number of studies on the subject. Breastfeeding mothers showed a steeper decline in inactivity over the course of sleep compared to non-breastfeeding mothers. This is interesting in light of the increased sleep pressure seen in breastfeeding mothers, as suggested by a higher delta power in their night sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum and more time spent in deep sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. This increase has been shown to remain in breastfeeding mothers even when controlling for partial sleep deprivation, suggesting that these differences in night-time sleep EEG characteristics might be, at least partially, due to physiological adaptations related to increased circulating prolactin levels induced by breastfeeding. When it comes to sleep environmental influences, various sleep characteristics, such as sleep duration or quality, have been shown to be modulated by socioeconomic and environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>]. Parent-infant sleep settings (solitary sleeping infants or infants sharing a room and/or bed with their parents) seem to affect both infants and mothers, as well as mothers’ postpartum sleep trajectory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>]. Interestingly, our exploratory analysis revealed that LIDS characteristics were linked to bed/room sharing habits, both in infants and parents, suggesting that dedicated studies on the impact of the environment on sleep might benefit from the LIDS methodology.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P83">While this study demonstrates the great potential of using large longitudinal activity records as a window into infant and parent sleep, we note several limitations for the interpretation of this study. It cannot be excluded that differences in inactivity patterns between infants and parents partially originated from the different placement of devices between the two groups. Actigraphy data were collected using ankle-worn devices in infants while parents wore the actigraph at their wrists. However, it was demonstrated that, at least in adults, ankle-derived and wrist-derived LIDS patterns are highly correlated within individuals and sleep bouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].Additionally, both infants and parents were recorded using the exact same device model, and the same sleep-wake algorithm was used on all recordings, limiting methodological differences from these aspects. Another limiting factor arose from the natural settings in which actigraphy data were collected; while measuring sleep in the habitual sleep environment underscores the study’s relevance, it also hampers exclusion of confounding factors, such as environmental noise. This is particularly relevant for our exploratory analyses of breast-feeding and sleep location, which need to be interpreted carefully and used only for hypothesis generation to be followed up in more controlled studies. Finally, the social, economic, and cultural characteristics of the participants should also be taken into account when generalizing the study findings, as they have been shown to exert an influence on sleep characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. Reproducing our results with culturally and racially diverse cohorts is therefore mandatory.</p></sec><sec id="S30" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P84">Epidemiological, longitudinal and experimental research has demonstrated the importance of sleep for infant brain development and cognitive functioning. Methods that allow large-scale characterization of sleep beyond simple sleep duration commonly obtained from self-reports or actigraphy will be essential in enabling better understanding of the interplay between sleep physiology and development. Even though movement records will unlikely ever convey as much detail as polysomnography, the simplicity and unobtrusiveness of data recording enables large, longitudinal samples that are instrumental for hypothesis generation, in discovering potential genetic mechanisms through genome-wide association studies or identifying potential biomarkers for developmental progress that are suitable as screening tools. Using limb movement from actigraphy or other wearables as a window into sleep physiology, and particularly the thus far still enigmatic ultradian sleep cycles, promises great potential in advancing our understanding of the intricate relationship between sleep and developmental trajectories.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS207291-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d2aAcGbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S32"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank the families for their participation in this study.</p><sec id="S31"><title>Funding</title><p>This analysis project was funded by the Deutsche Forschungs-gemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation: 450622422 to ECW).
