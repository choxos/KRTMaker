SINEs retain sequence features recognized by the POL III machinery and constitute a substantial portion of vertebrate genomes. Despite their impact on genome stability and evolution, the mechanisms governing SINE transcription remain poorly understood. Although DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation have been implicated in their repression, we find these pathways play only a minor role in mouse embryonic stem cells. Instead, we identify the ChAHP complex as a key repressor of SINE B2 elements. ChAHP directly inhibits POL III transcription by blocking TFIIIB recruitment without affecting TFIIIC binding. This selective interference prevents transcription initiation and highlights a distinct regulatory mechanism. Our findings establish ChAHP as a non-canonical repressor of POL III-dependent SINE transcription, offering new insights into the control of this pervasive class of non-coding genomic elements.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements present in nearly all eukaryotic genomes. These “selfish” DNA sequences propagate by hijacking the cellular machinery of their hosts, enabling their mobilization and replication within genomes. Retrotransposons, a major subclass of TEs, employ an RNA intermediate and reverse transcriptase (RT) to increase their copy number via a copy-and-paste mechanism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. These copies constitute substantial portions of vertebrate genomes; for instance, retrotransposons account for approximately 37% of the mouse genome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">TE activity can have profound implications for host genomes. Transcription of TEs can alter expression of nearby genes, disrupt gene-regulatory networks and potentially lead to developmental defects and diseases. Further, TEs can serve as hotspots for recombination and chromosomal rearrangements, and when mobilized, can disrupt gene function by insertional mutagenesis, both contributing to genomic instability. In contrast to negatively impacting their host’s fitness, TEs have also been associated with phenotypic variation, environmental adaptation, and the acquisition of new regulatory sequences. TEs are therefore considered important drivers of genome evolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">To mitigate the deleterious effects of TEs, hosts have evolved diverse mechanisms to repress their activity. These include heterochromatin formation, DNA methylation, or small RNA-mediated silencing. The repressive activities are typically directed to TEs via sequence-specific recognition mechanisms and are mediated by multi-protein complexes such as KRAB-ZNFs, HUSH, or piRISC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. These repressive mechanisms have been studied largely in the context of several kb long, RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcribed autonomous TEs such as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) or long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs). In contrast, the regulation of the highly abundant class of RNA Polymerase III (POL III)-transcribed, non-autonomous short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) is much less understood.</p><p id="P5">SINEs are chimeric elements with homology to endogenous short non-coding RNAs and LINE elements, present with over one million insertions in the mouse genome. They originate from cellular RNAs such as tRNAs (e.g., the mouse SINE B2 family), 7SL RNAs (e.g., mouse SINE B1/Alu) or 5S rRNAs (e.g., SINE3 in zebrafish)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. As a result, SINEs are relatively short, typically ranging from 80-300 bp. In addition to the 5ʹ region, which contains POL III promoter elements, active SINEs contain a genomically encoded poly(A)-stretch and often a short 3ʹ region that is partially homologous to the 3ʹ untranslated region (UTR) of LINEs. SINEs do not encode proteins; therefore, their propagation within the host genome depends on the RT and integration machinery encoded in LINEs, which recognize the 3ʹ end of SINE transcripts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">SINEs in the mouse genome can be classified in five families, namely B1/Alu, B2, B4/RSINE, ID and MIR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1A</xref>). They all contain so-called type 2 POL III promoters, like the highly abundant Alu and MIR families in humans. These internal promoters consist of A- and B-box elements that are directly recognized by the transcription factor complex TFIIIC, composed of six subunits (GTF3C1-GTF3C6) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. TFIIIC binding leads to subsequent recruitment of TFIIIB, comprising TBP, BRF1, and BDP1, which in turn enables the binding of POL III and the initiation of transcription <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Unlike Pol II-mediated transcription, which involves multiple regulatory steps from recruitment to pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation and productive elongation, POL III transcription is believed to start immediately following the successful recruitment of POL III PIC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. However, in contrast to the well-characterized canonical POL III-transcribed genes, transcriptional regulation at SINEs remains poorly understood. Early studies on SINEs have detected SINE transcripts in multiple different mouse tissues as well as during embryonic development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. More recent studies in mouse and human cells revealed that multiple SINE insertions are bound by the POL III machinery, indicating that they are actively transcribed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Moreover, evolutionary young B1 and B2 SINEs show high numbers of polymorphic insertions when comparing different mouse strains, indicating that these SINEs have retained the ability to retrotranspose <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Hence, host organisms must have evolved means to restrict further spreading. Both DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation have been implicated in SINE transcriptional silencing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, yet the precise role of these repressive pathways in SINE regulation has remained obscure. In addition, recent work revealed that SINE elements are upregulated upon perturbation of the chromatin regulatory ChAHP complex consisting of the DNA binding factor ADNP, chromatin remodeler CHD4 and heterochromatin binding HP1 proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Like for the other repressive pathways, it remained unknow whether this is an indirect effect or a direct consequence of ChAHP impeding POL III transcription at SINE insertions.</p><p id="P7">We therefore set out to elucidate if and how SINE elements are regulated at the transcriptional level. We demonstrate that DNA and H3K9 methylation play only a minor role in repressing SINEs in mouse embryonic stem cells. Instead, we find that ChAHP selectively interferes with the recruitment of TFIIIB to the promoter of SINE B2 elements, thereby preventing initiation of transcription by POL III.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Evolutionary young SINEs are actively transcribed by POL III in mESCs</title><p id="P8">Given the ~1.4 million SINE insertions in the mouse genome, quantifying expression of individual SINEs by RNA-seq is challenging because of the high sequence similarity of individual copies. Furthermore, the vast majority of reads mapping to SINE sequences originate from intronic insertions within expressed protein-coding genes that are transcribed by Pol II, making it difficult to correlate changes of RNA levels with changes in POL III transcription <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1B</xref>). Therefore, we first defined genomic loci transcribed by POL III using ChIP-seq for the core subunit POLR3A in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). Besides the expected POL III targets such as tRNA, U6 RNA, or 5S rRNA genes, most POL III peaks (n=2400, &gt;80% of total peaks) locate over SINE insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-C</xref>). Consistent with previous observations, the POL III-bound SINE copies are strongly enriched for evolutionary young elements containing intact A- and B-boxes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1C</xref>). Notably, these putatively active SINEs belong to the B1_Mm, B1_Mus1, B1_Mus2, and B2_Mm1a, B2_Mm1t, B2_Mm2 subfamilies which can actively retrotranspose in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S1D</xref>). Due to their high copy number in the genome and the likely non-random insertion mechanism, SINEs are often directly adjacent or even nested with other repeat insertions, complicating the unambiguous assignment of POL III peaks to individual elements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1E</xref>). To avoid mis-assignments of ChIP peaks, we excluded all SINE insertions within 200 bp of other SINEs or POL III transcription units. Despite reducing the number of analyzable loci, this refined strategy identified a similar proportion of SINE-associated peaks, reinforcing the specificity of the high enrichment of SINEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S1D, S1F</xref>). For stringency and consistency, we have used this unambiguous SINE set for further analysis.</p><p id="P9">To determine whether POL III bound to SINE elements is transcriptionally active, we established a mESC line that enables conditional depletion of GTF3C1, the central subunit of the POL III recruitment factor TFIIIC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Treatment with dTAG13 strongly reduced GTF3C1 levels within 1 hour, with further reductions after prolonged treatment for 4 and 24 hours (h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Although some protein remained after 24 h, POL III ChIP-seq analysis revealed a near-complete loss of POL III binding at TFIIIC-dependent loci after 24 h of GTF3C1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E</xref>). In contrast, POL III levels at TFIIIC-independent U6 and 7SK promoters remained unchanged, confirming the specificity of the depletion system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Quantification of RNA-seq reads mapping to intergenic SINE insertions indicated that transcripts from the SINE B2 family are by far the most abundant in mESCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1G</xref>). Notably, the evolutionary old families of B4, ID, and MIR elements are not bound by POL III. We nevertheless detected RNA reads mapping to these insertions. Likely, these originate from non-specific, spurious Pol II transcription events.</p><p id="P10">This notion is supported by the observation that only transcripts of young SINE B2 elements, which are bound by POL III, were reduced upon TFIIIC depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S1G</xref>). RNA levels of the other families, including evolutionary older SINE B2s that are not bound by POL III, did not react. Interestingly, RNA levels of young B1 elements were rather low and did not decrease upon TFIIIC depletion, despite some insertions being POL III bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S1G</xref>). As only 0.36 % of young SINE B1 insertions are POL III bound, we might be unable to specifically detect their transcriptional output in bulk assays considering the uniform background.</p><p id="P11">To strengthen the RNA-seq quantification of highly repetitive SINE sequences with an orthogonal approach, we performed Northern blotting with probes specific to B1 and B2 families of SINEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S1H</xref>). This confirmed that B2 RNAs are strongly reduced upon GTF3C1 depletion, suggesting that they are bona fide POL III transcripts. Consistent with RNA-seq, SINE B1 transcripts were not strongly decreasing after 24 h of GTF3C1 depletion. Of note, expression of Pol II-transcribed genes changed minimally, if at all, 4 h post GTF3C1 depletion. After 24 h, however, we observed extensive expression changes for hundreds of genes. We speculate this reflects a pleiotropic stress response caused by prolonged impairment of POL III transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p id="P12">In summary, using genetic and genomics approaches we show that evolutionary old SINE families, such as B4, ID, or MIR elements, are not bound by the POL III machinery. Few (0.36 %) copies of the younger SINE B1/Alu subfamilies Mm, Mus_1, and Mus_2 are bound by POL III but do not produce detectable amounts of GTF3C1-dependent RNA when quantified by RNA-seq or Northern blotting. However, copies belonging to elements of the young SINE B2 subfamilies Mm1a, Mm1t and Mm2 are bound by RNA POL III 3.5-fold more often (1.28 %) and produce detectable RNA. This establishes Mm1a, Mm1t, and Mm2 SINE B2 elements in mESCs as a suitable paradigm to study the regulation of POL III transcription of non-autonomous retrotransposons.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>SINE B2 elements are directly repressed by ChAHP</title><p id="P13">Initial studies had employed DNA or H3K9 methylation inhibitors to assess whether SINEs might be repressed by DNA methylation or heterochromatin formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Although such treatment led to increased SINE transcript levels, a causal relationship between DNA or H3K9 methylation and SINE repression has not been established. To revisit this question, we analyzed published RNA-seq data sets from genetic depletion of either DNA methylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> or H3K9me3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> in mESCs. Consistent with previous reports, ERV and L1 transposons showed dependencies on H3K9me3 and DNA methylation. However, neither the knockout of all three DNA methyltransferases, nor <italic>Su(var)39h1/2</italic> double-knock out or SETDB1 depletion (H3K9 methylation) did affect SINE expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This raises the question of whether SINE expression is regulated by DNA or H3K9 methylation at all.</p><p id="P14">In contrast, ablation of the ChAHP complex by knocking out <italic>Adnp</italic> resulted in increased SINE B2 RNA levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). To further test if ChAHP is directly repressing SINE B2 expression, we depleted ADNP conditionally. ADNP protein levels were strongly reduced within one hour of dTAG13 treatment and remained undetectable by Western blot after 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Northern blotting and RNA-seq of ADNP depleted cells showed that SINE B2 RNAs are upregulated as early as one hour after ADNP depletion, with the strongest effect observed for Mm1a and Mm1t subfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-E</xref>). SINE B1 transcript levels remained unchanged, indicating that ChAHP-mediated repression is specific to active SINE B2 elements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S2A-B</xref>). Importantly, the up-regulation of SINE B2 elements preceded any observable mis-regulation of RNA Pol II-transcribed genes, which start to be detected only after 4h of ADNP depletion and progressively increased at 24h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). This immediate effect on SINE B2 expression strongly supports a direct role of ChAHP in repressing these TEs.</p><p id="P15">We and others have previously reported that ChAHP counteracts CTCF binding at SINE B2 elements, which have acquired and spread CTCF binding motifs throughout the mouse genome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Given that CTCF is a multivalent chromatin regulator and its binding generates locally accessible chromatin with regularly spaced nucleosomes, both features of transcription-permissive chromatin, we depleted CTCF to test if its presence has an impact on SINE B2 expression. CTCF depletion alone had no effect on B2 RNA levels, whereas simultaneous depletion of ADNP and CTCF resulted in upregulation of Mm1a RNA, comparable to the effect observed upon ADNP depletion alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S2C-D</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that chromatin occupancy of CTCF at SINE B2s does not affect their expression. Collectively, these results support a direct role of ChAHP in repressing POL III transcription of evolutionary young SINE B2 retrotransposons, which is independent of ChAHP’s role in counteracting CTCF binding to these elements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>ChAHP and TFIIIC bind SINE elements independently of each other</title><p id="P16">The most parsimonious mechanism by which ChAHP could repress transcription of SINEs is through steric hindrance of TFIIIC binding, the most upstream POL III general transcription factor (GTF) involved in initiating POL III transcription from type 2 promoters. Notably, studies in human cells have shown that ADNP physically interacts with TFIIIC and it was proposed that ADNP recruits TFIIIC to specific sites in the human genome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">To investigate whether these interactions occur between TFIIIC and ChAHP as intact complexes, we endogenously tagged the GTF3C1 subunit of TFIIIC and performed immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS). Consistent with the observation in human cells, all subunits of the ChAHP complex co-purified with the 6 subunit TFIIIC complex (GTF3C1–GTF3C6). Reciprocally, ADNP purifications recovered all TFIIIC complex members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). To corroborate a direct physical interaction between ChAHP and TFIIIC, we purified both complexes and performed in-vitro pull-down experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). This revealed a direct interaction of intact ChAHP with TFIIIC, showing that ADNP can interact with TFIIIC as part of the ChAHP complex.</p><p id="P18">We next assessed whether ChAHP and TFIIIC affect each other’s occupancy on SINE elements by performing ChIP-seq with endogenously tagged GTF3C1 (TFIIIC) and ADNP (ChAHP). As expected, ADNP predominantly localized to SINE elements, with most peaks overlapping the B2 family <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition to B2s, ADNP also showed low enrichment at B1 elements. GTF3C1 was enriched at POL III genes such as tRNAs as reported before <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Among SINE families, we observed the strongest enrichment at B1 elements, followed by B2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S3B</xref>). Consistent with the observed physical interaction between ChAHP and TFIIIC, we saw a correlation of ADNP and GTF3C1 predominantly at evolutionary young B2 Mm1a and Mm1t subfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P19">To test a direct dependency of these two factors for chromatin binding, we depleted either GTF3C1 or ADNP and assayed ADNP or GTF3C1, respectively, for DNA binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3A</xref>). Unlike reported in human cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> and despite their strong colocalization, depletion of ADNP or GTF3C1 revealed that the ChAHP and TFIIIC complexes can associate with their targets independent of each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Notably, when comparing chromatin occupancy at lowly divergent SINE B2 insertions, we observed a small increase of GTF3C1 binding, while ADNP binding remained unaffected upon GTF3C1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). This marginal increase might result from elevated POL III transcription in the absence of ChAHP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P20">These results demonstrate that ADNP and TFIIIC maintain independent chromatin associations in mESCs and strongly argue against a model that ChAHP could repress POL III transcription by sterically hindering TFIIIC binding.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>ChAHP interferes with TFIIIB recruitment to repress POL III transcription</title><p id="P21">To comprehensively test at what step of POL III transcription initiation ChAHP interferes, we endogenously tagged subunits of all POL III GTFs in cells that allow conditional depletion of ADNP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S4A</xref>). ChIP-seq of the POL III GTFs revealed robust enrichments at their respective targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S4B</xref>). As expected, SINE B1 and B2 insertions bound by ChAHP and/or GTF3C1 were only bound by GTFs of type 2 promoters (GTF3C1, BRF1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A-B</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Upon ADNP depletion, B1 elements, although weakly bound by ChAHP, acquired only marginally more BRF1 and POL III. In contrast, B2 elements, which are strongly enriched for ADNP in untreated cells, acquire high levels of BRF1 and POL III upon ADNP depletion, in agreement with their transcriptional upregulation. Importantly, other POL III-associated factors such as GTF3A, SNAPC, or BRF2 that are not implicated in type 2 promoter regulation remained absent at transcriptionally upregulated SINE B2s. Moreover, the levels of POL III GTFs at tRNA genes, which are also weakly bound by ADNP, remined unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). To test if the same SINE B2 insertions that gain TFIIIB binding also show increased POL III binding and therefore are transcriptionally upregulated, we correlated the changes in ChIP enrichment upon ADNP depletion. Reassuringly, the elevated BRF1 ChIP signal strongly correlated with the increase in POL III, supporting the conclusion that the increase in TFIIIB occupancy upon ChAHP depletion is causative for the enhanced POL III transcription at SINE B2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Finally, we investigated whether ChAHP occupancy could predict the degree of repression, or conversely, the extent of increased BRF1 and POL III enrichment in the absence of ChAHP. When binning SINE B2 transposon insertions according to their increase in BRF1 enrichment upon ADNP depletion, we observed that insertions with higher ADNP levels exhibited stronger increases in BRF1 ChIP signal upon ADNP depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). In agreement with the SINE B2 expression data, this trend was particularly evident at Mm1a and Mm1t elements. Since these are the evolutionary youngest elements and ChAHP preferentially binds to lowly divergent copies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, we assessed whether the transcriptional upregulation also correlates with sequence divergence, i.e. evolutionary age. This is indeed the case; additionally, the upregulated copies exhibit the highest scores for A-box and B-box motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S4G-H</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Collectively, our results demonstrate that ChAHP specifically interferes with TFIIIB recruitment at evolutionarily young SINE B2 elements, revealing a targeted mechanism for silencing POL III-transcribed transposable elements capable of retro-transposition in the mouse genome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">Our findings establish the ChAHP complex as a direct repressor of POL III transcription specifically at SINE transposable elements. This conclusion is based on the following key findings from our comprehensive analysis of POL III GTFs and ChAHP: (1) ChAHP is specifically targeting young SINE B1 and B2 insertions, (2) B2 transcripts are upregulated within one hour of ADNP depletion, whereas changes in protein coding genes are only detectable after prolonged depletion, (3) TFIIIC, the most upstream GTF for POL III transcription, is already pre-bound to many inactive and upregulated loci and does only marginally increase while (4) TFIIIB and POL III levels are strongly elevated upon ADNP depletion, and (5) other POL III genes, such as tRNAs with similar promoter types as SINE B2s, are not affected by loss of ADNP.</p><p id="P26">The fact that ChAHP acts on TFIIIB is particularly intriguing, as TFIIIB is not only a recruitment factor but also plays essential roles in pre-initiation complex formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Moreover, POL III's ability to achieve high transcriptional output is thought to depend on facilitated reinitiation, a specialized transcription mode that bypasses the need for TFIIIC but likely requires TFIIIB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. By targeting TFIIIB recruitment, ChAHP effectively blocks both the initiation of transcription and this putative reinitiation pathway, providing a potent mechanism for silencing SINE elements.</p><p id="P27">On a mechanistic level, we propose two possible models for how ChAHP might counteract TFIIIB recruitment: Either, the binding of the multi-subunit ChAHP complex sterically hinders TFIIIB recruitment. Alternatively, the ATPase activity of CHD4 is employed to reposition nucleosomes and rendering the TFIIIB binding motif inaccessible, or to continuously expel TFIIIB from SINE B2 promoters. In a related preprint, we show that the catalytic activity of CHD4 within the ChAHP complex is essential for SINE B2 repression, strongly supporting the latter model (Ahel <italic>et al</italic>. 2025. Remodeling Activity of ChAHP Restricts Transcription Factor Access to Chromatin. <italic>bioRxiv</italic>). Interestingly, earlier studies have revealed that transcription initiation by POL III is sensitivity to nucleosome positioning over promoter elements, adding further support for such a mode of action <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">Importantly, the mode of silencing revealed in our study operates distinctly from canonical transposon silencing mechanisms, which typically rely on heterochromatin formation or DNA methylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Such chromatin-based mechanisms often involve spreading of repressive marks, leading to the establishment of heterochromatic domains spanning several kilobases. Whereas this is well-suited to repress long TEs, such as LINEs and ERVs that span 4-10kb, it may be less effective for SINE elements, which are only 80-300bp in length and encompass just 1-2 nucleosomes. Moreover, due to their exceptionally high copy number, chromatin-based SINE silencing could lead to unwanted off-target repression of nearby transcription units and other regions across the genome. In contrast, ChAHP's sequence specific nucleosome remodeling activity provides a locally restricted mechanism for silencing POL III transcription. Intriguingly, Fpt1 was recently identified as a <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>-specific POL III repressor that can mediate tRNA silencing under certain metabolic conditions via chromatin-based repression of POL III transcription <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Although the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown, increased Fpt1 binding at tRNA genes under repressive conditions coincides with enrichment of chromatin remodelers such as INO80. This raises the possibility that Fpt1 and ChAHP utilize similar molecular strategies for inhibiting POL III transcription.</p><p id="P29">Of note, the sequence-specific repression of POL III by ChAHP fundamentally differs from the mechanism employed by Maf1, the sole other known POL III repressor in mammals. MAF1 is phosphorylated and thereby restricted to the cytoplasm under normal growth conditions. Upon nutrient deprivation, mTOR signaling decreases MAF1 phosphorylation. This allows MAF1 to enter the nucleus and bind POL III at a position that prevents interaction with TFIIIB, thereby preventing proper transcriptional initiation at all POL III genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Yet, despite employing distinct mechanisms, both ChAHP and MAF1 converge on interfering with TFIIIB, which is essential for assembling a transcription-competent POL III complex.</p><sec id="S8"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="P30">It is important to note that assigning transposon-derived transcripts to specific loci is inherently difficult due to their repetitive nature. This challenge is particularly pronounced for SINEs, given their extremely high copy number and frequent localization within introns of protein-coding genes. Although we employed multiple orthogonal approaches to identify genuine POL III-driven transcription, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that some RNA-seq signals reflect Pol II-derived transcripts.</p><p id="P31">This study was conducted in mESCs, which are amenable to genome engineering and well-suited for dissecting chromatin regulatory processes. We demonstrate that SINE elements exhibit basal levels of transcription that is attenuated by the ChAHP complex, making mESCs an ideal system for studying SINE regulation. Whether the regulatory principles worked out in this study extend to other cell types or developmental stages remains to be determined. Further, our study does not address the functional significance of SINE transcripts or the physiological consequences of their upregulation following ADNP depletion. Given proposed roles for SINE RNAs in modulating RNA polymerase II activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, it is possible that ChAHP indirectly influences Pol II-driven transcription of protein-coding genes, beyond its established role in regulating 3D chromatin organization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Resource Availability</title><sec id="S10"><title>Lead contact</title><p id="P32">Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Marc Bühler (<email>marc.buehler@fmi.ch</email>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Materials availability</title><p id="P33">mESC lines and plasmids are available upon request.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Mouse embryonic stem cell culture</title><p id="P34">Mouse embryonic stem cells (129 × C57BL/6 background) with BirA and Cre insertions in the Rosa26 locus were used as wildtype background <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>.

The protein mixture was then incubated with 10 μL Magnetic Strep beads (IBA) for 15 min on ice. The ChAHP complex served as bait due to the StrepII-tag on the HP1γ subunit. Beads were washed three times with pulldown buffer and proteins were eluted by boiling at 75°C for 5 min in 1× SDS loading buffer. Eluted proteins were separated on 4-6% Tris-Acetate gels (Invitrogen) and visualized using InstantBlue protein stain (Abcam). Gels were imaged using a GelDoc system (Bio-Rad). Negative controls included beads alone and individual complexes incubated separately with beads to assess non-specific binding.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Genomics data analysis</title><sec id="S30"><title>SINE curation</title><p id="P67">Given the short length and proximity of SINEs to each other and other POL III transcription units, we excluded all SINEs which are within 200 bp of another SINE or POL III transcription unit.
