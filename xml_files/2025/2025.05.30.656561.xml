This is especially true for PacBio lrRNA-seq data, which were previously only available at low to moderate depth. Using a high-depth PacBio Kinnex lrRNA-seq dataset, sample-matched with Illumina short-read RNA-seq, we performed rigorous benchmarking to characterize quantification accuracy between platforms on a dataset representing differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells into primordial endothelial cells. We identified biases impacting transcript quantification, including inferential variability within Illumina data, which can bias transcript abundance estimates for genes with complex splicing, as well as length biases in Kinnex data. Overall, PacBio and Illumina quantifications were strongly concordant, supporting that PacBio Kinnex is a reliable method for transcriptome profiling and enabling downstream biological analyses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PacBio</kwd><kwd>Long-read RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>isoforms</kwd><kwd>quantification</kwd><kwd>endothelial cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In recent years, high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies have enabled an improved characterization of the human transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. In addition, long-read RNA-seq (lrRNA-seq) technologies have begun offering the ability to capture full-length transcripts, which may enable more accurate discovery of isoforms, although direct comparisons with current short-read RNA-seq (srRNA-seq) methods have been understudied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Benchmarking efforts, such as the Long-Read RNA-seq Genome annotation Assessment Consortium (LRGASP) and others have systematically evaluated the performance of lrRNA-seq data, high-lighting particular methods and technologies for their high accuracy in the discovery of isoforms, among other tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Beyond isoform discovery, comparative studies have explored the utility of both lrRNA-seq and srRNA-seq for transcript and gene quantification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Previous methodological reports of this type either focused on Oxford Nanopore (ONT) lrRNA-seq data or only had access to Pacific Biosciences (PB) data at moderate to low depths, typically at a maximum of around 10M reads per sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Recently, the MAS-seq method, commercialized by PB as Kinnex, has enabled an increased throughput of up to 16-fold for PB lrRNA-seq data, based on cDNA concatenation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Leveraging these developments, we collected a dataset representing one of the largest PB lrRNA-seq datasets, enabling technical comparisons of Illumina srRNA-seq and PB lrRNA-seq, as well as exploration of endothelial cell (EC) related transcriptome dynamics during their early development.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Kinnex lrRNA-seq is technically robust and enables effective biological downstream analyses</title><p id="P3">We collected RNA from human induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) (WTC11, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>) that were subjected to a five-day differentiation, coaxing cells from a pluripotent state (day zero), to a primitive streak (day one), mesoderm (day three), and then a primordial EC type (early EC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. For each day of differentiation, we isolated RNA with three replicates for day zero and five, two replicates for day three, and one replicate for the remaining days (one, two, and four) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). To assess intra-platform performance and technical validation, we included Spike-In RNA variants (SIRV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>). The same samples were then subjected to parallel Kinnex lrRNA-seq and Illumina srRNA-seq (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>). We excluded the single day-two sample from further analysis due to quality issues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A-J</xref>).</p><p id="P4">We first evaluated the read depth and characteristics, as well as the overall quality of the Illumina and Kinnex datasets. Both technologies reached comparable depths per sample, with Illumina averaging 65M reads per sample and Kinnex averaging 50M reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Both platforms exhibited high alignment rates to the human genome (mean ~95% for Illumina, mean ~97% for Kinnex) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The Kinnex data had a higher proportion of reads aligning to the SIRV spike-ins than Illumina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, the median Kinnex read length (~1.55 KB) was ~5.2 times longer than Illumina’s (299 bps, paired-end) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), leading to a substantially larger total number of sequenced bases per sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) and higher junction coverage per read (mean of 5.6 junctions covered for PB samples compared to 0.8 for Illumina; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Both platforms generated high-quality reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Since base qualities are not necessarily calibrated, we calculated empirical edit distances (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>), showing that Kinnex and Illumina achieved mean edit distances of 0.003 and 0.006 (corresponding to empirical phred values of 25.2 and 22.2), respectively, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). Kinnex data exhibited a moderate 3’ bias, while Illumina did not manifest a bias at either end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). These quality metrics confirm that both Kinnex and Illumina datasets were technically robust.</p><p id="P5">In addition to technical quality, we confirmed that each dataset captured the expected biological progression associated with endothelial differentiation. For both Illumina and PB, MDS plots revealed tight clustering within replicates while capturing the biological differentiation along the axis of the first MDS direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). Within each sequencing technology, we observed divergence of transcript expression profiles over the course of differentiation and high reproducibility of gene and transcript quantification for replicates of the same day (Spearman <italic>&gt;</italic> 0.9) and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J-K</xref>). The Kinnex data captured expected transitions across the differentiation, including downregulation of the pluripotency gene <italic>NANOG</italic> and upregulation of several EC markers, including <italic>KDR, ETV2, CD34, SOX7</italic>, and <italic>SOX17</italic>, by day five (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Exploration of Differential Transcript Usage (DTU) revealed several dominant isoform switches across the differentiation, for example within the <italic>IPO11</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). These results support that both datasets reliably captured the biological structure of the model system.</p><p id="P6">Next, we evaluated how well Kinnex and Illumina detected transcripts and discovered novel isoforms during differentiation. We observed that Illumina was less accurate for isoform discovery based on the SIRV data as evidenced by poor precision and recall (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). Some of the SIRV isoforms that were only discovered by Kinnex tended to have higher inferential variability in Illumina quantification than isoforms found by both technologies, although the pattern was not fully clear (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). Thus, isoform discovery was performed using the Kinnex data.</p><p id="P7">Using Kinnex data from all samples (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>), we discovered 12,341 novel isoforms and 515 novel genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1N</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). SQANTI annotation along with Coding DNA Sequence (CDS) prediction and quantification of our Kinnex-derived transcriptome (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>) revealed that while 10,935 novel isoforms (89%) were relatively lowly expressed (using the mean expression in the two most highly expressed samples) at less than 10 counts per million (CPM) and an additional 69 isoforms (0.56%) had more robust expression but belonged to categories beyond standard multi-exonic, protein-coding genes (e.g., antisense, fusion, genic, and intergenic transcripts), we found that 1,337 isoforms (10.8%) had relatively robust expression (10 CPM or higher) and belonged to more realistic SQANTI categories (ISM, NIC or NNIC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1N</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. In addition, 1,097 of high-confidence isoforms were predicted to contain a viable coding region (8.9% of all novel isoforms) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>). BambuTx5158 represents an exemplary case, a predicted novel non-coding isoform from the ENSG00000254202 gene (found near loci for the <italic>RP11</italic> gene), which was moderately expressed with a CPM of 34, with clear read support from both Illumina and Kinnex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1O</xref>).</p><p id="P8">For detection, we quantified Kinnex and Illumina data against the GENCODE transcriptome, augmented with novel isoforms discovered by Kinnex (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>). We considered a transcript as detected for a particular day and technology if it had a minimum of one CPM in that sample. Illumina detected an average of 40,175 transcripts (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>) and 14,571 genes, 4,656 and 54 of which were novel (based on discovery via Kinnex), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1P</xref>). Meanwhile, Kinnex had an average of 31,908 expressed transcripts and 13,155 expressed genes, 4,027 and 77 of which were novel. Although Illumina detected more lowly-expressed transcripts (<italic>&lt;</italic>50 CPM; 36,441 vs. 28,235), detection rates were similar for higher-expressed transcripts (<italic>&gt;</italic>50 CPM; 3,734 for Illumina vs. 3,673 for Kinnex) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1P</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Oarfish performs best among Kinnex quantification methods when considering SIRV spike-ins and GENCODE data</title><p id="P9">To perform an in-depth characterization of transcript quantification, we first attempted to determine suitable quantification tools for Kinnex data, as long-read analysis strategies have continued to evolve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. We processed Kinnex data using five recently proposed methods (Oarfish, lr-kallisto, Salmon, IsoQuant, Bambu), evaluating performance primarily using the SIRV spike-ins as a ground-truth (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>), downsampled to the same number of reads for both Kinnex and Illumian (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>), and, when relevant, contrasting with Illumina results as a comparative reference (also downsampled to the same depth between platforms) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].</p><p id="P10">In evaluations of computational resource usage, Oarfish and lr-kallisto stood out with fast runtimes and low memory usage across read depths (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). Quantification performance on the SIRV data was assessed across three metrics: (1) Differential Transcript Expression (DTE) accuracy, (2) relative quantification accuracy, and (3) absolute quantification accuracy. For DTE, accuracy was defined as the ability to correctly identify differentially expressed transcripts between two conditions. Given this criteria, we found that Isoquant and lr-kallisto performed competitively with Illumina on the SIRV data, achieving comparable True Positive Rate (TPR) and lower False Discovery Rate (FDR) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). Although Bambu, Oarfish, and Salmon appeared to perform worse overall (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>), closer inspection revealed that the performance drop for Oarfish, and partly, Bambu, was mostly driven by a single outlier transcript (SIRV303), characterized as having high sequence similarity to other SIRVs in the mixture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>), rather than widespread inaccuracies, suggesting possible algorithmic vulnerabilities. Our findings for DTE accuracy were mirrored for the relative quantification accuracy, defined as the agreement between known versus measured fold changes. Isoquant and lr-kallisto again performed well, achieving Pearson correlation values similar to Illumina, whereas Bambu and Oarfish were hampered by the SIRV303 outlier, and Salmon exhibited poor performance overall (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>). All Kinnex-based quantification methods exhibited a slight length bias for SIRV transcripts shorter than ~1,250 nucleotides, suggesting that this bias may be inherent in the Kinnex library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>). Finally, for absolute quantification on the SIRVs, defined as the agreement between known and measured log CPM values, all Kinnex-based methods demonstrated moderate concordance with Pearson correlations around ~0.70, compared to higher correlations achieved by Illumina (~0.88) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Recognizing that SIRV spike-ins do not fully capture transcriptomic complexity, we next assessed quantification performance between platforms, focusing on endogenous human GENCODE transcripts. We evaluated performance based on the relative quantification efficiency and the number of significant DTE calls reproducibly supported across quantification methods and platforms (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>). Quantification efficiency was calculated as the proportion of quantified counts to raw input reads at a subsampled read depth (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>). To account for Illumina’s known challenges in resolving of highly similar transcripts, i.e., inferential variability, we evaluated Illumina results both with and without a scaling-based inferential variability correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Across both metrics, Oarfish outperformed all other methods, achieving efficiencies close to one, with higher numbers of reproducible DTE calls than other methods, including Illumina with correction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2F-G</xref>). Based on these results, as well as its favorable performance in terms of computational resource needs as well as quantification accuracy on the SIRV spike-ins (besides the SIRV303 outlier), we selected Oarfish for all downstream Kinnex-based analyses. We used Salmon for Illumina-based analyses (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Kinnex mitigates inferential variability-related quantification issues encountered by Illumina data, but suffers from length biases</title><p id="P12">To establish a baseline for platform comparison, we first evaluated Differential Gene Expression (DGE), which remains well-established and simpler than transcript-level analyses. We observed that differential gene expression calls (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>) were highly concordant between Illumina and Kinnex across downsampled read depths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating similar performance for gene-level analyses.</p><p id="P13">We next assessed the more challenging task of transcript-level quantification. Consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], Illumina exhibited substantially higher inferential variability compared to Kinnex, particularly for genes with more transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This variability was reflected by greater replicate-to-replicate fluctuations of estimated transcript abundances from the short-reads when attempting to resolve highly similar transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. A manifestation of this is the occurrence of ‘transcript flips’, where replicate quantifications for Illumina alternate between moderate-to-high or near-zero values for a given transcript, whereas Kinnex demonstrated consistent quantification for the same transcripts.</p><p id="P14">An example is the <italic>CECR2</italic> gene, in which all four transcripts are highly similar in sequence, differing only by short exons and alternative acceptor sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-D</xref>). Illumina quantifications frequently exhibited transcript flips across replicates, while Kinnex data did not suffer from this problem and tended to assign expression to one or multiple dominant transcripts and near-zero expression to the others, as evidenced by its overall notably lower inferential variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-D</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Instability caused by inferential variability in Illumina quantifications impacted downstream analyses. When computing DTE calls, Illumina initially yielded far fewer significant events than Kinnex-based Oarfish quantifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), concordant with previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. The low number of calls was attributed to Illumina’s challenges in reliably quantifying transcript abundances for genes with complex splicing structures, where high inferential variability dilutes statistical power. To address this, we applied an inferential variability correction (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>), an ‘adjustment’ that down-weights transcripts with highly uncertain quantification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. After adjustment, the concordance between Illumina and Kinnex DTE calls improved substantially, both in the number of events captured and q-value distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>). Because of this, all transcript-level Illumina analyses employed this adjustment, including those previously shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] (exception: figures that highlight quantification challenges, such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C, G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3F-H</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To further assess platform performance, we compared the number of detected genes and transcripts for each replicate, downsampled to 30M reads (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>). Kinnex detected a slightly higher number of genes on average (15,253 vs. 14,506 for Illumina), but notably fewer transcripts (29,721 vs. 37,163; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Upon closer investigation, however, we noticed examples in which the additional transcripts detected by Illumina may have been spurious. For the <italic>ALG6</italic> gene, Kinnex identified a single dominant transcript (ENST00000263440), assigning minimal expression to all other transcripts, whereas Illumina divided expression more evenly across all four transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>), despite little to no unique read support for any single transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). This suggests that higher transcript counts from Illumina could sometimes be misleading, reflecting quantification noise from short-read ambiguity rather than true biological complexity. We quantified the level of differences in gene proportions between Illumina and Kinnex by evaluating multinomial concordance between the two platforms (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>). Overall, the gene-level q-value for multinomial concordance only showed a moderate positive Pearson correlation with the mean inferential variability for that gene (once scaled by CPM, since the inferential variability measure we used attempts to be independent of the mean, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>). Correlation was notably higher for genes where Illumina detected a higher number of transcripts (Illumina overdetected), supporting our heuristic ‘transcript division’ example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). Nevertheless, we found several example genes that exhibited almost arbitrary combinations of high or low inferential variability combined with high or low multinomial concordance genelevel q-value, suggesting that inferential variability and transcript ‘division’ may be separate phenomena (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3F-H</xref>). Similar to inferential variability, the gene-level q-value associated with multinomial concordance tended to increase with the number of transcripts per gene, especially for genes for which Illumina detected more transcripts than Kinnex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>). Kinnex also exhibited certain biases. As observed with SIRV spike-ins, Kinnex exhibited a tendency for reduced detection rates of short transcripts less than 1,250 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2K</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Together, our analyses suggest at least two reasons why quantification differed between platforms. First, Illumina’s short-read limitations led to unreliable quantifications for complex genes, manifested either as transcript flips across replicates or transcript division of expression among multiple similar transcripts. Second, Kinnex exhibited reduced detection efficiency for shorter transcripts, as seen in both spike-in controls and endogenous genes. Despite these biases, transcripts detected by only one platform tended to be lower expressed, especially when no clear technical explanation was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2L</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Having established the sources of platform-specific transcript detection differences, we then evaluated how well Illumina and Kinnex quantifications agreed for transcripts reliably detected by both platforms (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>), leaving 8,797 transcripts and 12,197 genes for comparison, respectively. We note that we ended up with a lower number of transcripts than genes, since evaluating concordance of transcript-level quantification required an additional inferential variability filter, which was not necessary for gene-level quantification (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>). We observed that relative quantification (log-fold change estimates) showed very high concordance, with Pearson correlations exceeding 0.9 at the gene level and approaching 0.9 at the transcript level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2M</xref>). These results indicate that Kinnex quantifications closely matched Illumina for transcripts that could be considered as reliably quantified by both platforms. Absolute quantification (log CPM values) showed moderately lower concordance, but still exceeded correlation values of 0.8 at the gene level and 0.79 at the transcript level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2N</xref>). Both relative and absolute quantification again showed a small to moderate length bias for the Kinnex data, with shorter transcripts showing a somewhat lower correlation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3D-E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">Overall, our results supported strong quantification performance for Kinnex. Similarly to other long-read technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], Kinnex largely seemed to avoid problems of inferential variability and detected more DTE events than Illumina, even with correction. Even when applying a correction for inferential variability, Illumina suffered from issues such as transcript flips and divisions of expression, which may confound downstream analyses such as DTE. For transcripts reliably quantified across both platforms, Kinnex and Illumina showed high concordance, supporting Kinnex as an effective alternative for transcript-level studies. Nonetheless, Kinnex exhibited some limitations, particularly showing a bias against shorter transcripts and exhibiting a slightly lower performance in absolute compared to relative quantification. In addition, Kinnex and similar lrRNA-seq technologies are typically significantly more expensive than Illumina for the same sequencing depth.</p><p id="P20">Our study has some limitations. First, our dataset and analyses are a comparison between Illumina srRNA-seq and Kinnex lrRNA-seq, preventing direct comparisons to ONT data. In addition, our work does not constitute a fully exhaustive benchmark of currently existing quantification methods for Kinnex. Future work should expand these comparisons by generating datasets that encompass srRNA-seq, Kinnex, and ONT data at comparable depth, and including a broader array of lrRNA-seq quantification methods, enabling exhaustive quantification evaluations for the field.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Dataset generation</title><sec id="S9"><title>Stem cell culture</title><p id="P21">Undifferentiated human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs, WTC11, NIGMS Repository Number GM25256) were obtained through Coriell via a Materials Transfer Agreement with the University of Virginia.
