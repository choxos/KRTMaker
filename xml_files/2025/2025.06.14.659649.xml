normally controls cellular responses to hypoxia. Endogenous VHL is also utilized by proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) protein degraders, a promising class of anti-cancer agents. VHL is broadly essential for cell proliferation, yet it is a key tumor suppressor in renal cell carcinoma. To understand the functional consequences of <italic>VHL</italic> loss, and to identify targeted approaches for the elimination of <italic>VHL</italic> null cells, we have used genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening in human renal epithelial cells. We find that, upon VHL loss, the HIF1A/ARNT complex is the central inhibitor of cellular fitness, suppressing mitochondrial respiration, and that VHL null cells show HIF1A-dependent molecular vulnerabilities that can be targeted pharmacologically. Combined VHL/HIF1A inactivation in breast and esophageal cancer cells can also provide resistance to ARV-771, a VHL-based bromodomain degrader that has anti-cancer activity. HIF1A stabilization can thus provide opportunities for early intervention in neoplastic <italic>VHL</italic> clones, and the VHL-HIF1A axis may be relevant for the development of resistance to the emerging class of PROTAC-based cancer therapies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Heterozygous germline mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (<italic>VHL</italic>) lead to a tumor predisposition syndrome that is characterized by the development of phaeochromocytomas, renal cell carcinomas, hemangioblastomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Biallelic inactivation of <italic>VHL</italic> is also the tumor-initiating genetic event in ~90% of sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The VHL protein functions as a substrate recognition subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, the best-characterized substrates of which are the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF1A and HIF2A (HIFA). HIFA bind VHL when two of their conserved proline residues are hydroxylated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The HIFA prolyl hydroxylases EGLN1-3 require oxygen as a co-substrate, making them active only in normoxic conditions. Under hypoxia or in the absence of functional VHL, HIFA accumulates and dimerizes with HIF1B/ARNT, forming a helix-loop-helix transcription factor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The endogenous ubiquitin ligase target recognition function of VHL is exploited by the VHL-dependent PROTACs, small molecules that can be engineered to degrade specific endogenous proteins through the E3 ubiquitin ligase pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. These compounds serve as molecular bridges between a target protein of interest and one of a few E3 ligases, such as VHL, which directs them for proteasomal degradation. For example, ARV-771, a bromodomain degrader, and AU-15330, a SMARCA2/4 degrader, are dependent on endogenous VHL and they have shown anti-tumor activity in experimental cancer models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Even though the cellular consequences of VHL inactivation are clinically relevant in several contexts, they remain incompletely understood. For example, acute VHL loss is detrimental to cell proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, yet <italic>VHL</italic> is a tumor suppressor in renal cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. As the development of renal cancer from <italic>VHL</italic> mutant renal epithelial cells can take decades <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, VHL loss-induced vulnerabilities could be exploited for early cancer intervention strategies, especially in high-risk individuals, such as <italic>VHL</italic> mutation carriers. Bi-allelic <italic>VHL</italic> inactivation in the germline can also lead to a systemic metabolic disorder <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Such patients could benefit from therapies that limit the negative fitness effects caused by <italic>VHL</italic> inactivation. Finally, the role of endogenous VHL as a key player in PROTAC-induced anti-cancer effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> suggests that understanding the consequences of VHL loss could be important for understanding and reducing the likelihood of PROTAC-resistance in cancer.</p><p id="P5">Using experimental cell line systems and large-scale CRISPR-Cas9 functional screening we set out to investigate the mechanisms of VHL loss-induced proliferative suppression. We find that the HIF1A/ARNT complex is the central mediator of reduced fitness following VHL loss, and that VHL null cells display HIF1A-dependent genetic vulnerabilities that can be pharmacologically targeted. Moreover, we demonstrate that combined loss of VHL and HIF1A can provide a fitness advantage to human cancer cells under treatment with a VHL-dependent PROTAC. These results shed light on the functional consequences of VHL loss at the genome-wide scale and provide a proof of principle that VHL loss-dependent phenotypes can be pharmacologically targeted.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>HIF1A/ARNT-mediated proliferative suppression upon <italic>VHL</italic> inactivation</title><p id="P6">To investigate the effects of VHL loss in <italic>VHL</italic> wildtype human cells we used CRISPR-Cas9 to mutate <italic>VHL</italic> in the HK2 human renal epithelial cells, an immortalized cell line derived from human renal epithelial cells. This led to strong inhibition of proliferation and an altered cellular morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S1A-C</xref>). Reintroduction of sgRNA-insensitive <italic>VHL</italic> cDNA completely rescued the proliferation defect caused by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated <italic>VHL</italic> inactivation, confirming the specificity of the approach (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S1D-E</xref>). Unlike previously reported in mouse fibroblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, reduced oxygen level did not rescue the effects of <italic>VHL</italic> loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S1F</xref>), even though it reduced the proliferative capacity of <italic>VHL</italic> wildtype cells in longer-term assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S1G</xref>). Analysis of the large-scale Cancer Dependency Map data set revealed that apart from ccRCC cells, most of which already carry biallelic mutations in the <italic>VHL</italic> gene, cancer cell lines across different non-renal lineages were universally sensitive to VHL inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Inactivation of <italic>VHL</italic> also reduced the size of human renal epithelial organoids, but the cells still formed similar structures as wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S1H</xref>). We generated a genetic GFP-dependent HIFA reporter to confirm HIF activity, a predicted downstream effect of VHL loss, in the VHL-engineered organoids, while wildtype organoids remained GFP negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To understand the consequences of VHL loss, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen in HK2 cells. To avoid the possibility of cells adapting to VHL inactivation during propagation before the screen started and to obtain enough VHL null cells despite their reduced proliferative capacity, we engineered cell clones in which VHL expression could be regulated by doxycycline (dox), and endogenous <italic>VHL</italic> was either intact (WT8 control cells) or knocked out (MUT10 and MUT35) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S2A</xref>). WT8 cells proliferated well regardless of dox, but MUT10 and MUT35 cells proliferated significantly better when dox, and consequently VHL, was present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S2B-D</xref>). VHL expression was also associated with HIF1A and HIF2A degradation, as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S2E</xref>). Cas9 editing efficiency was confirmed in all three clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S2F</xref>) before proceeding to the genome-wide screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). The sgRNA distribution of the two <italic>VHL</italic> mutant clones showed strong correlation at the endpoint (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3A</xref>). When comparing sgRNA representation in VHL null cells at the end of the screen and pre-dox withdrawal, constructs targeting HIF1A, a known target of VHL, and its dimerization partner ARNT were clearly the most significantly enriched, with little evidence of consistent enrichment of constructs targeting other genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Consistenly, all five sgRNAs targeting HIF1A and ARNT showed enrichment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3B-C</xref>). <italic>VHL</italic> null cells were sensitive to the inhibition of several pathways, such as glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, MTORC1 signaling, DNA repair, Myc and E2F targets and the G2M checkpoint (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3D</xref>), pathways that are typically important for proliferating cells, indicating that these cells, despite their reduced proliferative capacity in comparison to <italic>VHL</italic> wildtype cells, performed as expected in the pooled screen. Fluorescence-assisted cell sorting-based competition assays confirmed that HIF1A and ARNT inactivation, but not HIF2A inactivation, rescued the proliferation defect caused by <italic>VHL</italic> loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3E-H</xref>). HIF1A and ARNT inactivation also restored the morphological appearance of <italic>VHL</italic> null cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3I</xref>). Finally, HIF1A inactivation could rescue proliferation in <italic>VHL</italic> mutant human renal epithelial organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G-H</xref>), demonstrating the relevance of our observation in primary human cells. Overall, these results suggest that the HIF1A/ARNT complex is a central mediator of VHL loss-induced proliferative suppression.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>HIF1A-dependent mitochondrial inhibition in <italic>VHL</italic> null cells</title><p id="P8">To understand how gene expression was affected by <italic>VHL</italic> inactivation, we performed transcriptomic analysis by RNA-seq on MUT10, MUT35 and WT8 cells with and without dox withdrawal. As expected, WT8 cells showed little change in gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). However, combined analysis of MUT10 and MUT35 cells revealed 220 genes significantly upregulated and 63 genes significantly downregulated upon dox withdrawal and consequent VHL depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S4B-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2-3</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis of the transcriptomic data showed that genes in categories such as hypoxia, TNF-alpha signaling, glycolysis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were upregulated, and oxidative phosphorylation, MYC targets, G2M checkpoint and E2F targets were suppressed in VHL depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Although the expression of glycolysis genes is upregulated in <italic>VHL</italic> mutant cells, oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria is the main source of ATP, suggesting that the proliferation defect of <italic>VHL</italic> mutant cells could be linked to suppressed oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in MUT10 and MUT35 cells in the absence of dox was reduced when compared to WT8 cells, with ATP production being ~90% lower than in wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-E</xref>). In agreement with the cell proliferation data, HIF1A and ARNT inactivation rescued mitochondrial function and increased ATP levels in <italic>VHL</italic> null cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F-G</xref>). As previously demonstrated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, forced HIF1A expression also reduced proliferation and mitochondrial respiration in established ccRCC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H-K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S4D-E</xref>). The HIF1A axis can thus reduce cell fitness in normal epithelial cells and advanced malignant cancer clones.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>HIF1A-dependent pharmacological vulnerabilities in <italic>VHL</italic> mutant cells</title><p id="P9">As HIF1A suppresses mitochondria, the main source of ATP, and as <italic>VHL</italic> null cells showed evidence of sensitivity to genes involved in glycolysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3D</xref>), we tested the possibility of using glycolysis inhibitors to specifically target VHL null cells. However, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and AZD3965, inhibitors of hexokinase and monocarboxylate transporter 1/2, respectively, showed only a mild effect on either <italic>VHL</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S5A-B</xref>). To explore the possibility that VHL loss resulted in other pharmacological vulnerabilities, we looked for potential druggable VHL loss-induced genetic dependencies in our CRISPR-Cas9 screen data. This identified FGFR1 and RAD51 as potential targets for which small molecule inhibitors were available (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S5C</xref>). Pemigatinib and AZD4547 are kinase inhibitors with efficacy against FGFR1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Both inhibited the proliferation of MUT10 and MUT35 cells when compared to WT8 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). They also reduced ERK phosphorylation, a downstream effect of FGFR1 activation, more efficiently in MUT10 and MUT35 cells when compared to WT8 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C-F</xref>). B02, a RAD51 inhibitor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, also inhibited the proliferation of MUT10 and MUT35 cells more efficiently when compared to WT8 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S5D</xref>). Importantly, however, cisplatin (CDDP), doxorubicin, imatinib and navitoclax showed broadly similar effects on <italic>VHL</italic> mutant and wildtype cells, demonstrating specificity of our observations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S5E-H</xref>). These results demonstrate that <italic>VHL</italic> mutations can induce pharmacological vulnerabilities with associated biochemical phenotypes in renal epithelial cells.</p><p id="P10">The central role of HIF1A in mediating VHL loss-induced proliferative suppression suggested that the VHL loss-induced genetic and pharmacological vulnerabilities could in general be HIF1A dependent. We tested this by a secondary pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screen that targeted genes the sgRNAs of which were depleted (94 genes) or enriched (250 genes) in <italic>VHL</italic> mutant cells in the original genome-wide screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S6A-B</xref>). We also included constructs that targeted 30 genes frequently mutated in ccRCC and 22 non-essential control genes. The screen was performed using MUT10 and MUT35 cells together with the corresponding VHL-HIF1A double mutant cells MUT10-1A and MUT35-1A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S6B</xref>). Overall, the secondary screen validated the original results from the genome-wide screen in the <italic>VHL</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S6C</xref>). Interestingly, in the VHL-HIF1A double-mutant cells we observed little enrichment or depletion of sgRNAs, indicating that the genetic vulnerabilities identified in <italic>VHL</italic> mutant cells were HIF1A dependent in this context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H-I</xref>). Withdrawal of dox before lentiviral transduction of the sgRNA library also resulted in strong enrichment of HIF1A and ARNT constructs, indicating that the growth suppression caused by VHL loss and HIF1A stabilization was reversible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S6D</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To further test whether the pharmacological vulnerabilities were also HIF1A dependent we treated the <italic>VHL</italic> mutant and <italic>VHL-HIF1A</italic> double mutant cells with pemigatinib, AZD4547 and B02. In all cases <italic>VHL-HIF1A</italic> double mutant cells were significantly less sensitive when compared to <italic>VHL</italic> single mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J-K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S6E</xref>). The increased sensitivity of <italic>VHL</italic> null cells to ERK inhibition was also HIF1A dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S6F-G</xref>). These data demonstrate that <italic>VHL</italic> mutant cells have pharmacological vulnerabilities that are largely HIF1A-dependent.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Fitness advantage by VHL-HIF1A axis inactivation under PROTAC therapy</title><p id="P12">The E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the VHL complex can be harnessed by PROTACs for targeted protein degradation in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). While recent evidence from functional screening suggests that several E3 proteins can be utilized for proximity-induced protein degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, the broadly essential role of VHL for cancer cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) makes it attractive for PROTAC applications in cancer. However, while VHL loss is expected to lead to PROTAC resistance, our results on renal epithelial cells suggested that a proliferation proficient PROTAC resistant phenotype would only emerge through combined loss of VHL and HIF1A/ARNT. We first tested the effect of ARV-771, a VHL-dependent bromodomain degrader that has previously shown anti-cancer activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, on a panel of cancer cell lines and the renal epithelial cell line HK2. All but HK2 cells were sensitive to ARV-771 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). As predicted, OE33, MCF7, 1833-BoM, LNCaP and KBM7 cells became resistant to ARV-771 when VHL was inactivated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). However, as HIF1A stabilization upon VHL suppression leads to reduced proliferative fitness, <italic>VHL</italic> single mutant cells were predicted not to be competitive even if they were drug resistant, whereas <italic>VHL-HIF1A</italic> double mutant cells were expected to be resistant and able to proliferate. To test this experimentally, we mixed wildtype (mCherry labelled, 40%), <italic>VHL</italic> mutant (GFP labelled, 55%) and <italic>VHL-HIF1A</italic> double mutant (BFP labelled, 5%) 1833-BoM, MCF7 and OE33 cells for triple competition assays under DMSO or ARV-711 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S7A-C</xref>), and the proliferation of WT, <italic>VHL</italic> mutant and <italic>VHL-HIF1A</italic> double mutant OE33, 1833-BoM and MCF7 cells was also tested separately (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S7D-F</xref>).

HIF stabilization is typically associated with type 1 mutations, while type 2 mutations may retain the capability to target HIFs for degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. This raised the possibility that the ability of <italic>VHL</italic> to mediate PROTAC effects could also be uncoupled from its role in HIF1A regulation. Consequently, there could be <italic>VHL</italic> mutations that disrupt PROTAC activity but do not lead to HIF1A stabilization and reduced proliferative fitness. To test this, we examined data from recent <italic>VHL</italic> saturation mutagenesis screens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and identified point mutants of <italic>VHL</italic> residues Y98 and P99 as potential candidates. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we generated dox-inducible <italic>VHL<sup>Y98F</sup></italic>, <italic>VHL<sup>P99G</sup></italic> and <italic>VHL<sup>P99M</sup></italic> expression constructs and transduced them into <italic>VHL</italic> knock-out MCF7 cells. Based on immunoblot analysis, <italic>VHL<sup>WT</sup></italic>, <italic>VHL<sup>Y98F</sup></italic> and <italic>VHL<sup>P99M</sup></italic> were able to reduce HIF1A expression, whereas <italic>VHL<sup>P99G</sup></italic> was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). In line with this, cells expressing <italic>VHL<sup>Y98F</sup></italic> and <italic>VHL<sup>P99M</sup></italic> were able to proliferate at the same rate as <italic>VHL<sup>WT</sup></italic> cells, whereas <italic>VHL<sup>P99G</sup></italic> cells proliferated significantly slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). However, while <italic>VHL<sup>WT</sup></italic> and <italic>VHL<sup>P99M</sup></italic> were sensitive to ARV-771, both <italic>VHL<sup>Y98F</sup></italic> and <italic>VHL<sup>P99G</sup></italic> showed only limited sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>). Thus, <italic>VHL<sup>Y98F</sup></italic> was able to abrogate PROTAC sensitivity while maintaining proliferative capacity at the level of <italic>VHL<sup>WT</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H</xref>). Altogether, our results show that HIF1A stabilization provides potential opportunities for early intervention in pre-neoplastic <italic>VHL</italic> clones. In addition, we propose that the VHL-HIF1A axis may be relevant for the development of proliferation-proficient therapy resistance to the emerging PROTAC-based anti-cancer strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">The VHL-HIF1A pathway regulates metazoan responses to reduced oxygen availability, and the phenotypic sequelae of VHL inactivation are relevant in several clinical contexts ranging from carcinogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and metabolic dysfunction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> to novel cancer therapies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Using unbiased functional screening in experimental systems we have thus characterized the consequences of acute VHL loss, demonstrating that HIF1A activation in VHL null cells can lead to potentially actionable genetic vulnerabilities.</p><p id="P16">Our data suggest that HIF1A is the central mediator of VHL loss-induced negative fitness effects, with little involvement of HIF1A-independent pathways detected in our screen. This is in line with recent data on mouse embryonic fibroblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, but earlier studies have also reported HIF1A-independent mechanisms through which VHL loss may inhibit cell proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Interestingly, recent data suggest that in some cell types VHL loss-induced activation of HIF2A may be the critical effector of fitness loss, pointing at cell type-specific effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. We show that VHL loss suppresses mitochondrial function, a result concordant with known effects of HIF1A on mitochondrial activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Importantly, we demonstrate that HIF1A activation in VHL null cells can result in pharmacologically targetable genetic vulnerabilities, such as increased sensitivity to FGFR1 or RAD51 inhibition. These results provide a proof of principle that non-cancerous VHL-null cells can be susceptible to therapeutic intervention, complementing <italic>VHL</italic> synthetic lethal screens previously performed in already established <italic>VHL</italic> mutant renal cancer cell lines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. For example, the cancer risk of individuals carrying heterozygous <italic>VHL</italic> mutations could be reduced even with incomplete early eradication of premalignant <italic>VHL</italic>-null clones. Expanding the concepts from our findings into in vivo models in which VHL-null cells could be analyzed in a non-proliferative state would be a critical next step. On the other hand, HIF1A-dependent suppression of mitochondrial activity in non-cancerous <italic>VHL</italic>-null cells could explain the systemic metabolic defects associated with biallelic germline mutations in <italic>VHL</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Strategies to inhibit HIF1A activity could ameliorate the severe phenotype in such patients.</p><p id="P17">PROTACs are an emerging class of versatile molecules that can harness endogenous E3 ubiquitin ligase activity for specific degradation of target proteins of interest. Most PROTACs in clinical and pre-clinical development use CRBN or VHL as the endogenous E3 ubiquitin ligase proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Loss of the relevant E3 complex compromises PROTAC activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, but as VHL is broadly essential for cancer cell proliferation, VHL loss alone is unlikely to result in clinically relevant PROTAC resistance. Our data suggest that cell proliferation-proficient resistance to VHL-dependent PROTACs, intrinsically rare compared to resistance to CRBN-dependent PROTACS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, can result from combined VHL and HIF1A inactivation, or through VHL mutations that retain the activity to target HIF1A for degradation. Reducing the probability of HIF1A inactivation in VHL deficient clones under therapy could improve long-term efficacy of PROTAC treatment. This could be achieved through the elimination of HIF1A-positive VHL-null cells before they lose HIF1A, possibly by targeting HIF1A-induced vulnerabilities as demonstrated by our data. Alternatively, the identification of synthetic lethal approaches for HIF1A null cells could be beneficial.</p><p id="P18">In conclusion, our data provide genome-wide functional insight into the molecular consequences of VHL loss in human cells. This revealed specific, mostly HIF1A-dependent genetic vulnerabilities in VHL null cells, suggesting the possibility that VHL loss-induced phenotypes could be exploited therapeutically. We also describe mechanisms that can provide cancer cells with proliferative fitness upon resistance to VHL-dependent PROTACs. This could aid the future development and clinical applicability of this promising novel class of anti-cancer agents.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="P19">The HK2 cell line was obtained from C.
