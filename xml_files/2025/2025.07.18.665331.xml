Animal models of cryptococcal meningitis are important for understanding the immune parameters that correlate with protection. However, modelling this infection in mice is challenging. There is wide variability in infection routes, doses and mouse background used in the field, which makes understanding phenotypes of mutants and immune interventions difficult to broadly apply. Our intention was to create a resource for the field on how <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> strain influences analysis of organ-specific immune responses in an intravenous mouse model of cryptococcal meningitis, focusing on impact of the fungal strain while keeping mouse genetic background (C57BL/6J) and infection route constant. We quantified myeloid and lymphoid cell recruitment and fungal-specific CD4 T-cell activation, correlating these results with fungal burdens in mice infected with the commonly used reference strain H99 or with two recently isolated clinical strains that were the same molecular type (VNI) or an unrelated type (VNB). We also analysed how dose used in murine infection models affected brain immune responses during <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection. Our work reveals intriguing patterns of organ-specific immunity that are dependent on <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain but not always explained by virulence potential, raising important questions for the field regarding the impact of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain on cellular immune responses in experimental animal models.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The fungus <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is the main causative agent of fungal meningitis in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). <italic>C. neoformans</italic> is prevalent in the environment and exposure is typically via inhalation of spores. In patients with compromised cellular immunity, particularly CD4 T-cells, <italic>C. neoformans</italic> spores may germinate into yeast and establish infection. <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infections often have central nervous system (CNS) involvement (cryptococcal meningitis), which is associated with a high mortality rates and neurological impairment in survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Protection against this infection requires CD4 T-cells, which instruct B-cells to make anti-fungal antibodies that are required for effective uptake by myeloid cells. CD4 T-cells also produce pro-inflammatory cytokine IFNÎ³, which provides killing signals to myeloid cells and prevents intracellular survival of the fungus within macrophage phagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P3"><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> was first thought to be one species but is now recognised to encompass distinct species and several molecular types. There are two species complexes, <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (the focus of this study) and <italic>C. gattii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). <italic>C. neoformans</italic> complex typically causes CNS disease in immunocompromised individuals, while <italic>C. gattii</italic> infections are more geographically restricted and develop in patients with unclear immune status. Each complex is split into serotypes based on antigenic differences within the capsule of the fungus, with serotypes A and D within the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> complex, and B and C within the <italic>C. gattii</italic> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The majority of human infections are caused by serotype A strains (referred to as <italic>C. neoformans</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Within the serotype A grouping, there are several molecular types which have wide diversity in geographical distribution, genetics and clinical presentation. Molecular type VNI and VNII strains are found globally, but VNII strains are not typically found in clinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). VNB strains are more common in South Africa and South America, and are associated with a poor patient outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P4">To better understand pathogenesis and mechanisms of disease that operate during cryptococcal meningitis, investigators have developed several animal models of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection in rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Mouse models more common in immunology studies, since they have both an innate and adaptive immune system that closely resembles the human immune system, and there are significantly more transgenic lines and molecular tools to study murine immunity than are available for other animal models. Multiple infection routes have been implemented in mice to model <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection. The most commonly used are intranasal and intratracheal routes, where yeast is delivered into the nasal passage and/or airways to initiate pulmonary infection. Even in immunocompetent mice, virulent strains of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> escape the lung without further intervention and disseminate to other organs, primarily the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). These models have been used to examine how pulmonary immunity develops and the mechanisms or drug treatments required to prevent dissemination to the brain. However, dissemination to the CNS in these models is often variable, and it can be difficult to separate mechanisms of pulmonary immunity with those of CNS-specific immunity. Researchers have therefore used more direct routes to establish brain infection that bypass pulmonary immunity, allowing a targeted understanding of CNS disease and brain-specific immune responses. These include the intravenous and intracerebral injection models, although the latter route is less common due to the expertise required to perform such injections.</p><p id="P5">In addition to the variety of infection routes used in the field, there is also variation in the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strains used. The most commonly used strain to model cryptococcal infection in mice is H99, a serotype A strain (molecular type VNI) that was first isolated in 1970s at Duke University from a lymphoma patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). It is highly virulent in mice and is useful for modelling the inflammatory responses that develop to this fungal infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. When injected intravenously, H99 drives an acute meningitis in wild-type mice within 1 week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). This strain is also a good model for examining mechanisms of intracellular fungal survival in macrophages, since it exhibits good survival rates in the phagosomes of cultured macrophages and <italic>in vivo</italic> within myeloid populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Due to these useful traits, several knock-out mutant libraries and fluorescent reporter strains have been generated on this strain background. However, there are reports of genetic drift in H99 isolates used in different laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), and concerns have been raised as to how representative this strain is, particularly as other clinical isolates tested in mice appear to be significantly less virulent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Another strain that is popular in the field is <italic>C. deneoformans</italic> 52D, a serotype D strain. When injected intravenously, 52D exhibits a strong tropism for the CNS and results in a chronic infection that resembles clinical features of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) which is a major driver of neurological sequelae in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Infections with 52D are often used to model the immune events that contribute towards pathological inflammation during cryptococcal meningitis. Despite the advantages that strains such as H99 and 52D provide, recent studies have indicated that a wider range of clinical isolates need to be tested to identify clinically-relevant virulence factors, particularly those mediating latent infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In the current study, we aimed to comprehensively characterise organ-specific cellular immune responses in wild-type C57BL/6 mice infected with <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and analyse the impact of fungal strain background using a limited number of strains, with the goal of providing the community with datasets that can be used to select reference strains to model an immune response of interest. We have primarily focused on immune responses occurring within the brain for this study as these are the most poorly understood and have therefore used the intravenous infection route to specifically study CNS localised immune responses.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Organ-specific virulence of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strains</title><p id="P7"><italic>C. neoformans</italic> may invade multiple organs during experimental infection, particularly following intravenous inoculation. The intravenous infection model therefore gives a broad analysis of organ-specific virulence potential (by measuring fungal burdens) across multiple tissue sites in the same animal. Prior to performing quantitative analysis of cellular immune responses in mice infected with different <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strains, we first assessed the virulence of recently isolated <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strains in the brain, lung, liver and spleen. We used the reference strain H99, which is well characterised in mouse models, and compared with two strains that were isolated from clinical samples taken from patients in Zimbabwe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). We chose Zc1, which is distantly related to H99 but is the same molecular type (VNI) and exhibits a significant impairment in its ability to form Titan cells in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), a key trait for <italic>C. neoformans</italic> virulence. We also chose Zc15, a VNB strain which is a molecular type associated with poor clinical outcome in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). We infected healthy C57BL/6 mice with each of the three strains intravenously, and assessed survival and weight loss over the first two weeks of infection. As expected, we found that H99 was the most virulent strain, with significantly greater mortality rate compared to both Zc1 and Zc15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). There was 100% lethality following infection with either H99 and Zc1, whereas ~40% of mice survived infection with <italic>C. neoformans</italic> Zc15 at two weeks post-infection. In the first 9 days of infection (when mice in all groups were still surviving), we found significant loss of weight in mice infected with H99, whereas mice in other groups had not lost weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Next, we measured fungal burdens in different organs at day 7 post-infection. In line with our survival data, mice infected with H99 had significantly higher fungal burdens in every organ tested compared to the other two strains, with the highest levels observed in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). In the brain, there was significantly less fungal burdens in mice infected with Zc1 and Zc15, with Zc15 exhibiting ~50 fold less fungal burdens than Zc1 and ~120 fold less than H99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). Interestingly, this pattern was not as evident in other organs. In the lung and liver, Zc1 and Zc15 had similar fungal burdens, and both were less than H99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). In contrast, H99 and Zc1 infected the spleen to a similar degree, while Zc15 had the least fungal burdens in this tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). All strains had a strong propensity to grow in the brain (with 10-100 fold higher growth in brain than other tissues), with the lung exhibiting the lowest fungal burdens across the organs for all strains in this infection model. We recovered similar burdens of Zc15 from liver and spleen, while H99 and Zc1 had greater fungal burdens in the liver than in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). Taken together, these data show organ-specific patterns of virulence that is dependent on fungal strain.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Brain invasion pattern and cryptococcoma size are influenced by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain</title><p id="P9">We next examined the pathological features in the brains of mice infected with <italic>C. neoformans</italic> H99, Zc1 and Zc15 using histology. In the brain, <italic>C. neoformans</italic> invades the brain parenchyma and forms large lesions called cryptococcomas and is also typically found in the perivascular spaces where it proliferates and contributes towards inflammation in this tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Consistent with the fungal burdens quantified from whole brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>), we observed less cryptococcal cells in lesions of brains infected with Zc15 in comparison with H99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). The size of the yeast within brain lesions was similar for all fungal strains, and we did not observe Titan cells in the brain in any sections analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). The brain lesions caused by Zc15 infection were significantly smaller compared to those caused by H99 and Zc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). However, there was little difference in the total number of lesions we observed in the brain between strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>). Regardless of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain used, the infiltration of inflammatory cells was lacking around the parenchymal lesions containing fungal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). In contrast, blood vessels were surrounded by infiltrating perivascular leukocytes in response to H99 infection whereas only small numbers of immune cells were observed in the perivascular space when mice were infected with <italic>C. neoformans</italic> Zc1 or Zc15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref>). There was no consistent pattern between the fungal strains in which brain regions the fungal cells localized to (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>). Taken together, histological analysis revealed strain-dependent variation in parenchymal lesion size and perivascular inflammation, which largely mirrors the differences observed in levels of live fungus recovered from brain tissue.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Influence of brain fungal burden on inflammatory cell recruitment is cell type and strain-specific</title><p id="P10">We next performed broad immune phenotyping of tissue-resident macrophage populations and recruited inflammatory cells in the brains of mice infected with <italic>C. neoformans</italic> H99, Zc1 and Zc15 to understand whether the differences in fungal burdens we observed between these strains translated into quantitative differences in cellular immune responses. In the brain, we found a similar number of microglia, the tissue-resident macrophages of the CNS, in all mice regardless of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). We found similar numbers of macrophages in mice infected with H99 and Zc1, with significantly reduced number macrophages in Zc15-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). In contrast, inflammatory Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, which are recruited to the brain upon infection, were significantly reduced in mice infected with Zc1 and Zc15, compared to H99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). Neutrophils, which are also recruited upon infection, had variable numbers across the groups, particularly Zc1, and there was no significant difference between H99 and Zc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). Zc15-infected mice had significantly reduced neutrophil recruitment to the brain, as we had observed for Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). Since the pattern in numbers of some of the immune populations (microglia, macrophages and neutrophils) did not mirror the difference we observed in fungal brain burdens between H99 and Zc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>), we next explored how fungal burden in the brain influenced leukocyte numbers to determine whether it was fair to assume that higher fungal burdens would equate to more immune cells. For that, we infected mice with different doses of H99 and correlated immune cells in the brain with fungal burdens measured in the same animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). These results showed that there was no correlation between infection dose, fungal brain burden and numbers of tissue-resident microglia, indicating that numbers of these cells are not influenced by fungal brain burden in this acute infection model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). In contrast, there was a significant correlation between fungal brain burdens and numbers of macrophages, and a positive trend between neutrophils and Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes that did not quite reach statistical significance, indicating that inflammatory responses measured by proliferation and/or recruitment of these cells is likely influenced by fungal brain burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). It is therefore likely that the reduction in macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils we observed in the brains of Zc15 infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>) are the result of reduced fungal brain burdens we observed with this strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). However, we saw no difference in neutrophil or macrophage numbers in brains infected with Zc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>), despite significantly reduced fungal burden compared to H99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>), indicating that there are additional strain-dependent effects that influence recruitment of these populations. Collectively, these experiments revealed positive correlations between fungal brain burden and recruitment of most immune cell types that were unaffected by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain variation, with resident myeloid cells unaffected by brain burden and fungal strain.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Cryptococci congregate near blood vessels in the liver</title><p id="P11">Liver dysfunction and advanced liver disease are an independent risk factor for several fungal infections, including those caused by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Resident liver macrophages, called Kupffer cells, are important for controlling disseminated cryptococcal infections by capturing yeast in a C3-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). We used histology to examine where <italic>C. neoformans</italic> localizes within the liver and analyzed the size and composition of infection sites to determine if fungal strain variation affected these parameters. We found inflammatory lesions in the livers of infected mice were typically found in vicinity of a blood vessel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>), in line with the use of the intravenous infection route in this model. While more than half of these lesions (65%) contained fungal cells in mice infected with H99, this was lower in Zc1 and Zc15 infected animals (45 and 40%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A,B</xref>). Lesion size and number were also affected by fungal strain, which was largely influenced by fungal burdens measured in the liver. Lesion sizes were similar between H99 and Zc1, regardless of whether lesions contained fungal cells or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>). However, there were significantly less lesions in Zc1-infected liver compared to H99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D</xref>). Zc15-infected liver had the smallest lesion areas, particularly if they did not contain fungal cells, and contained a similar number of total lesions to Zc1 infected livers. Taken together, this data shows qualitative differences in infection lesions found in the liver that are <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain dependent.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Lung resident macrophage populations are influenced by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain independent of lung fungal burden</title><p id="P12"><italic>C. neoformans</italic> infections are thought to originate in the lungs following inhalation of spores from the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Here, fungal cells closely interact with several populations of resident lung macrophages which demonstrate differing responses to fungal immune modulators and intracellular infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). To examine how <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain variation impacted on antifungal immunity and pathology in the lung, we examined lung inflammatory scores using histology and quantified populations of resident and infiltrating immune cells by flow cytometry in mice intravenously infected with H99, Zc1 and Zc15. As observed in the liver, intravenous infection resulted in cryptococcal cells localizing close to blood vessels but were also observed near bronchioles. We were only able to consistently observe these infection sites in mice infected with <italic>C. neoformans</italic> H99, as there was significantly fewer yeast cells observed in lung sections from mice infected with Zc1 and Zc15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>). We observed several instances of Titan cell formation in the lungs of H99 infected animals, aligning with previously findings which indicated Titan cell formation is likely a lung-specific phenotype and occurs at a much lower rate in the Zc1 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In mice infected with H99 and Zc1, cryptococcal cells were surrounded by infiltration of inflammatory cells, whereas this was not observed in Zc15 infected lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>). However, alveolar thickening and increasing bronchial mucosal hyperplasia and hypertrophy were present for all <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>). These inflammatory features, along with PAS-positive cells in bronchioles, were also found in some areas where cryptococcal cells are absent in all three infection groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>). Quantitative analysis of histology observations showed that alveolar thickening was more pronounced in the H99-infected lung and less in the Zc1 and Zc15-infected lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>), mirroring culturable fungal burdens from lung with these strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). We found no difference in peribronchial infiltration between the strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C</xref>), and there was no clear difference in the number of PAS-positive cells in the bronchioles between the strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To examine immune cell populations in the lung in more detail, we used flow cytometry to quantify the numbers of tissue-resident and recruited immune cells in the lungs of mice infected with H99, Zc1 and Zc15. In the lung, there are two major populations of resident macrophages. Alveolar macrophages are found in the airways, and interstitial macrophages reside in the tissue. Interstitial macrophages can be further divided into MHCII<sup>hi</sup> and MHCII<sup>lo</sup> subsets, which have different spatial localisations and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the number of all three subsets of macrophages was significantly higher in the Zc1-infected lung compared to the other two strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref>). Alveolar macrophage numbers did not differ between H99 and Zc15, while we observed a trend of less interstitial macrophages in the Zc15-infected lung compared to H99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref>). In contrast to the brain, numbers of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes did not differ in the lung between any of the strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref>). We observed a significant reduction in neutrophils in the Zc15-infected lung compared with H99, which had comparable numbers with Zc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref>). Eosinophils, which increase in number during <italic>C. neoformans</italic> lung infection, trended higher in the Zc1-infected lung but otherwise was similar between the three strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref>). Collectively, these data show that numbers of lung leukocytes do not necessarily follow similar patterns as observed with lung fungal burdens and demonstrate strain-specific effects on the population dynamics of lung leukocytes, particularly of lung-resident macrophage populations.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title><italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain variation significantly influences granulocyte recruitment to the lung following intranasal infection</title><p id="P15">Although we had observed intriguing differences in lung-resident macrophages between <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strains that did not align with fungal burden, these differences were detected using an intravenous infection model which is considered a better model for meningitis and brain infection, as the lung does not become heavily infected using this infection route and granulomas are not typically found. Instead, lung pathology that more accurately mimics clinical infection features is best observed using an inhalation infection model. We therefore performed intranasal infections with <italic>C. neoformans</italic> H99, Zc1 and Zc15 and determined whether these strains exhibited similar virulence profiles using this infection route, and whether the differences we observed in lung macrophages between the strains were consistent using the intranasal infection route. We found that the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strains broadly had similar virulence levels in the intranasal model as seen with the intravenous model; the highest lung fungal burdens were observed in the H99-infected lung at three weeks post-infection, while Zc15 had the lowest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5G</xref>).

Lymphocytes are required for protection against <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infections in humans, particularly CD4 T-cells and B-cells, which provide IFNÎ³-mediated killing signals to myeloid cells and produce antibody for effective opsonisation and phagocytosis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). We quantified lymphocyte numbers in the brains of mice infected with H99, Zc1 and Zc15 using flow cytometry. We used the intravenous model of infection for these experiments, since lymphocyte recruitment to the brain following intranasal infection is more variable due to the lower brain burdens achieved with this infection route (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5G</xref>). We found no difference in the number of CD8 T-cells or B-cells in the brains of infected mice between any of the strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>). Numbers of NK cells largely mirrored the fungal brain burden differences between these strains, with greater numbers in the H99-infected brain, followed by Zc1 and then Zc15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>). We found that H99 infection induced the highest number of brain-infiltrating CD4 T-cells during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>). Numbers of CD4 T-cells in the brains of mice infected with Zc1 and Zc15 were significantly less than H99 and were similar to each other with Zc1 exhibiting more variability between mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>). CD44 expression, a marker of T-cell activation, was largely similar by CD4 T-cells regardless of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain used although there was a slight trend of reduced CD44 expression during infection with Zc1 and Zc15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6B</xref>), which largely mimicked the pattern seen in brain fungal burdens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). Indeed, mice infected with different doses of H99 exhibited a correlation between brain fungal burden and number of recruited CD4 T-cells, particularly for effector memory and activated (CD44<sup>+</sup>) CD4 T-cell subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C</xref>). We did not observe any significant differences in the numbers of lymphocytes in the lungs between any of the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strains following intravenous infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6D</xref>).

We therefore set out to determine whether recruitment of antigen-specific CD4 T-cell populations was similarly driven by fungal brain burden. For that, we adoptively transferred CnT.II TCR transgenic CD4 T-cells into mice prior to infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7A</xref>). CnT.II T-cells express a TCR that specifically recognises Cda2, an immunodominant antigen for this fungus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). CnT.II donor animals were backcrossed onto <italic>Nr4a3</italic>-Tocky-IFNg-YFP reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) to allow tracking of IFNÎ³ production (YFP reporter) and TCR signalling (<italic>Nr4a3</italic>-Tocky reporter) by these cells in vivo. Using this model, we first measured the frequency of total CD4 T-cells that were antigen-specific in the brain (i.e. the proportion of total CD4 T-cells that were CnT.II transgenic cells). Surprisingly, we found a significantly higher proportion of CnT.II cells in the Zc1-infected brain than in H99 and Zc15 infected brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7B</xref>). There was less recruitment of CnT.II cells in the Zc15-infected brains compared to H99, although this did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7B</xref>). Since Zc15 infection resulted in poor recruitment of CnT.II cells to the brain, we focused on H99 and Zc1 for further functional analysis. We found similar production of IFNÎ³, CD44 expression and rates of cell division by CnT.II cells between H99 and Zc1 brain infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7C-E</xref>). However, TCR signalling, measured by expression of the <italic>Nr4a3</italic>-Tocky fluorescent reporter, was significantly higher in CnT.II cells infiltrating the Zc1-infected brain compared to the H99-infected brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7F</xref>). Collectively, these results show that while analysis of total CD4 T-cell populations may broadly mirror fungal brain burdens, specific analysis of fungal-specific CD4 T-cell responses are influenced by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain background that is partially independent of fungal burden.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title><italic>C. neoformans</italic> Zc1 boosts expression of MHCII by brain border macrophages</title><p id="P20">Since infection with <italic>C. neoformans</italic> Zc1 resulted in greater TCR signaling by fungal-specific CD4 T-cells in the brain compared to H99, despite lower fungal brain burdens and reduced total CD4 T-cell recruitment, we next explored how Zc1 infection influenced the expression of MHCII by brain-resident macrophage populations. Microglia are the most numerous brain-resident macrophage population but have poor capacity for antigen presentation and low expression of MHCII. In contrast, CD206<sup>+</sup> border macrophages are important antigen-presenting cells in the brain, co-expressing MHCII and positioned in sites such as choroid plexus and meninges to maximize antigen capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). CD206<sup>-</sup> macrophage populations are also found in the brain and are thought to be involved with tissue support functions due to their enhanced expression of trophic factors and reduced expression of MHCII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). We infected mice with either H99 or Zc1 and then quantified the proportion of these resident macrophage populations that expressed MHCII by flow cytometry. This analysis revealed that the frequency of MHCII<sup>+</sup> microglia was significantly lower in the Zc1-infected brain compared to H99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7G,H</xref>). Total numbers of CD206<sup>+</sup> and CD206<sup>-</sup> border macrophages were significantly reduced in the Zc1-infected brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7I</xref>), in line with our earlier observations of reduced numbers of total brain macrophages with this <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain. However, we found significantly increased frequency and expression of MHCII by both these populations in the Zc1-infected brain compared to H99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7J,K</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the reduced fungal brain burden observed with Zc1 may be influenced by exaggerated fungal-specific CD4 T-cell responses, in part driven by enhanced MHCII expression on border macrophages. To examine that, we infected wild-type and <italic>Rag2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with either H99 and Zc1 and measured brain fungal burden. <italic>Rag2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice lack lymphocytes and would therefore not exhibit the difference in T-cell responses between the two strains. However, we found a similar brain fungal burdens between H99 and Zc1 in both the wild-type and <italic>Rag2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7L</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that our observations of enhanced MHCII expression by border macrophages and correlating increased fungal-specific CD4 T-cell responses that occur during infection with <italic>C. neoformans</italic> Zc1 do not have an overall impact on fungal infection control in the brain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P21">Several studies have compared mouse survival and fungal burdens following infection with different clinical isolates of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, correlating this data with in vitro characteristics associated with virulence such as capsule size, melanin production and stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). However, many studies do not contain in-depth immune phenotyping of host leukocytes and/or do not analyse how organ-specific immune mechanisms may differ between strains. Our data demonstrate that organ fungal burden and virulence of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strains does not always equate to predictable immune responses, and this may be different depending on the organ and/or immune cell subsets analysed. This is important to consider if the goal is to study immune cell behaviour, particularly of tissue-resident cells that are the main drivers of organ-specific immune responses. We require more studies into host-fungal interactions during <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection in vivo, especially with tissue-resident cells that are difficult to model in vitro and exhibit organ-specific and often subset-specific roles during this infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). The data in this manuscript provides a framework to help investigators select strains and conditions to model an immune response of interest using the intravenous infection route, which allows for comparison of organ-specific immune responses while keeping variation in fungal burdens between animals to a minimum.</p><p id="P22">In our study, we used C57BL/6J mice, one of the most commonly used inbred mouse strains. We selected this strain because several knock-out and transgenic reporter animals are bred onto this background, including the antifungal TCR transgenic T-cell line CnT.II which we used to track fungal-specific CD4 T-cell responses in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). However, mouse strain is an important consideration in further analysis of organ-specific immune responses during <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection, since recent studies have indicated at significant differences in tissue-resident macrophage phenotype and function between inbred strains. For example, in the pleural cavity there are two major subsets of tissue-resident macrophages that derive from monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). The differentiation of monocytes into these tissue-resident subsets can be expedited by recruited type-2 polarised CD4 T-cells during parasitic infection, which is required for protective immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). However, while this protective pathway occurred in C57BL/6 mice, the conversion of monocytes to tissue-resident macrophages was stunted in BALB/c mice, helping explain why the BALB/c strain exhibited susceptibility to the parasite infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Notable differences in susceptibility to cryptococcal infection between C57BL/6 and other inbred strains has now been observed by multiple groups, with recent work demonstrating a unique resistance phenotype in the SJL/J background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). In those mice, resistance was attributed to the enhanced ability to mount protective type-1 (IFNÎ³-biased) immune responses to <italic>C. neoformans</italic> during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Indeed, prior work demonstrated a superior capacity of SJL/J derived macrophages to produce IL-12p40, a type-1 polarising cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). However, it is not known whether conversion of monocytes into different types of inflammatory and/or resident macrophages (e.g. lung interstitial subsets) depends on CD4 T-cell functional phenotype during <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection, as was recently shown for pleural cavity macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). It is also not known whether macrophages have different functional capacities or variations in ontogenic lineages in SJL/J mice, which may also contribute towards their observed resistance to <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection. It will therefore be important for future studies to determine whether potential differences in susceptibility between the inbred mouse strains is influenced by the dynamics of organ-resident immune cells and their antifungal responses. While our study focused on the influence of fungal strain, it may be important to determine how the immunology of inbred mouse strains influences control of infection in different organs, which will be required in future studies to fully examine the dynamics of host-fungal interactions.</p><p id="P23">Comparisons of clinical <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strains typically focus on expression and/or activation of well-known virulence traits for this fungus. This includes the formation of the capsule, which can shield the fungus against macrophage-mediated uptake and innate recognition, and production of melanin and urease, both of which can aid in resistance to oxidative killing and brain invasion, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Another important aspect to <italic>C. neoformans</italic> virulence is morphology, and particularly the formation of Titan cells. These are large polyploid cells that generate in response to various stresses and are found within the infected lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Titan cells are resistant to phagocytosis and can produce smaller daughter cells that may contribute to dissemination to the CNS. In addition, âseed cellsâ are another recently identified <italic>C. neoformans</italic> morphology that were shown to have enhanced capacity to invade the CNS and cause disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Initial comparisons of clinical <italic>C. neoformans</italic> isolates indicates there is wide variability in the formation of Titan and seed cells under lab-tested conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). In our study we used H99 and Zc1, which were both previously compared in Titan cell formation and related virulence potential in an inhalational model of the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Zc1 was found to produce smaller Titan cells, and similar to our findings, was a less virulent strain than H99 as there was less dissemination to the brain from the lung during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), observations that were reproducible in our study. Titan cells are thought to be more relevant in lung infection where they have been observed within infected lung tissue in various studies, whereas they appear to be a rare occurrence within the brain. This is likely related to their large size that could prohibit their growth and/or dissemination within the narrow vasculature of the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). An important future direction for the field will be to determine how different C. <italic>neoformans</italic> morphologies alter uptake and/or subsequent activation of tissue-resident immune cells, which will depend on an agreement on how to define the different morphologies for this fungus.</p><p id="P24">In addition to physical variations between <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strains, a further important consideration that may influence outcome of immunology studies is the ability of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> to reside within macrophages. Following uptake by macrophages, C. <italic>neoformans</italic> may modify the intracellular environment and prevent fungal killing pathways, aiding its survival and immune evasion. This can occur via neutralisation of phagosomal pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), or by secretion of CLP-1 which drives arginase expression within macrophages and block iNOS-mediated production of nitric oxide, which is toxic for the fungal cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Interestingly, some macrophage subtypes appear to be more susceptible to intracellular <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection than others, with lung interstitial macrophages and brain-resident microglia exhibiting higher rates of intracellular residence than other types of macrophages or recruited inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Many of these mechanisms were defined using <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain H99, which has a high propensity to grow within macrophages and develop an intracellular lifestyle in the host. However, whether these lessons are widely applicable to other <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strains is unclear, and the relative frequency of intracellular infection in human brain and/or lung is difficult to assess, given that autopsy samples only provide snap-shots. Indeed, these types of differences in the propensity to grow within host immune cells may lead to differences in how immunology studies are interpreted. For example, we recently found that depletion of microglia from adult mouse brain resulted in a reduction in fungal brain burden when mice were infected with H99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). This was due to the growth of the fungus within microglia, which represented an important intracellular niche for <italic>C. neoformans</italic> H99 in the brain. However, we did not find a difference in brain fungal burden in mice infected with Zc15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). For different <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strains, the lack of a protective role for microglia was shared but the relative importance of microglia as an intracellular growth niche appeared to be more limited to H99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). This could reflect differences in the ability of the strains to modify phagosomal environments following uptake and/or differences in phagocytosis rates by myeloid cells, related to differences in cell wall/capsule and/or morphology, as outlined above. Regardless, this example demonstrates why confirmation of key immunology observations with multiple <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strains will be necessary in future studies going forward, particularly as the data in the current study demonstrates that while organ-specific immune responses may be heavily influenced by fungal strain, this is not always explained by differences in virulence.</p><p id="P25">Indeed, we found strain-dependent effects on fungal-specific CD4 T-cell responses that did not correlate with fungal brain burden. Infection with <italic>C. neoformans</italic> Zc1 resulted in greater recruitment of fungal-specific CD4 T-cells that had higher rates of TCR engagement which aligned with higher MHCII expression by border macrophages during infection. We recovered less viable yeast from Zc1-infected brains than H99, which we hypothesised was related to this enhanced T-cell response. However, infection of mice that lacked an adaptive immune system demonstrated that these differences in adaptive immunity did not contribute towards pathogen control, at least in this infection model. We used TCR transgenic CD4 T-cells that respond to the fungal antigen Cda2 to track and analyse fungal-specific responses in the brain. Cda2 is a chitin deacetylase that was discovered to be an immunodominant antigen in mice infected with <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>) and is a protective antigen in vaccination studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Mice immunised with Cda2-loaded glucan particles were significantly protected against lethal infection, which was dependent on the presence of CD4 T-cells but not B-cells or CD8 T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Patients with cryptococcosis (who are T-cell sufficient) also have greater responses to Cda2 compared to healthy controls, indicating this may be an immunodominant antigen in humans too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Whether Cda2 activity and function differ between <italic>C. neoformans</italic> isolates isnât known, however our data suggests this could be an important driver of variation in antigen-specific CD4 T-cell responses in experimental animal models. Future studies should aim to determine how <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain variation may affect expression of immunodominant antigens and subsequent CD4 T-cell immunity, which may be an important determinant of vaccine responses and protection.</p><p id="P26">In summary, our data show important variation between organ-specific immune responses to different <italic>C. neoformans</italic> clinical isolates in an experimental animal model of acute disseminated infection, which is not always aligned to differences in fungal virulence and organ burden. It will be important to consider <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain variation in immunology studies going forward, confirming key phenotypes with multiple strains to better align research findings between research groups and models.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> strains and infections</title><p id="P27"><italic>C. neoformans</italic> strains used in this study were H99, Zc1 and Zc15.
