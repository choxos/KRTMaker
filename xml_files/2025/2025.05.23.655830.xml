The current treatment, intravenous antivenom, comes with numerous disadvantages making new therapeutics important. Optimised small molecules offer the possibility for oral use at the onset of envenoming, and the highly pathogenic, zinc-dependent, snake venom metalloproteinase toxin family represents an attractive target for drug discovery. Through systematic chemical modification guided by molecular modelling, we describe the development of hydroxamic acid DC-174, a molecule that displays potent broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibition and neutralises the procoagulant activities of multiple snake venoms. In oral-dosing studies, DC-174 showed preclinical efficacy in a mouse model of severe envenoming, with efficacy boosted by a pharmacokinetically-informed multiple dosing regimen. This rationally designed metalloproteinase inhibitor offers a potential paradigm shift from delayed treatment with antivenom in tertiary hospitals to a contemporary approach using oral drugs amenable for rapid use in snakebite-affected communities.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Background</title><p id="P2">Snakebite envenoming is a life-threatening condition predominantly affecting people in rural communities in Africa, Asia and Latin America, and results in an annual death toll of up to 138,000, with many more survivors suffering long term morbidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In 2017 the World Health Organization (WHO) reclassified snakebite envenoming as a priority Neglected Tropical Disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and a roadmap was developed to reduce the snakebite burden, with one key pillar of this strategy being to ensure access to safe and effective treatment, inclusive of improved therapeutics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Antivenoms are current standard of care snakebite treatments that consist of animal-derived polyclonal antibodies sourced from hyper-immunised animals. Despite saving lives, antivenoms have several limitations, including the requirement for administration in a clinical environment due to the necessity for intravenous delivery, management of adverse reactions and reliance on cold chain storage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Placing these constraints on patients who are often on average six hours from a hospital setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, likely contributes to poor outcomes, given the often acute and life-threatening nature of snakebite. Additional challenges include the low affordability and accessibility of antivenom in many tropical regions, which is partly due to the necessity to manufacture different products for different regions, due to the complex and variable nature of venom toxins among snake species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Despite extensive venom variation, four main pathogenic toxin families have been identified as being of greatest importance for snakebite due to their relative abundance and toxicity; the snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), snake venom serine proteases (SVSPs), phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) and three-finger toxins (3FTxs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The SVMPs are zinc-dependent enzymes present in the venom of most snakes, but are particularly abundant in viper venoms (<italic>Viperidae</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. SVMPs are divided into three subclasses (P-I, P-II, P-III) based on gene organisation; though each contains structurally and functionally distinct toxin isoforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. SVMPs induce and prolong local and systemic haemorrhage by degrading extracellular matrix proteins resulting in microvascular damage and by cleaving blood clotting factors, such as fibrinogen and prothrombin, resulting in coagulopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Their high abundance in many viper venoms (up to 74% of all toxins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>) makes SVMPs a highly attractive target for novel snakebite therapeutics.</p><p id="P5">One contemporary approach (among others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>) recently applied to more broadly inhibit diverse toxin isoforms found across snake species has been the use of small molecule drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Such molecules possess several theoretical advantages over current antivenom, including improved cross-snake species neutralisation, increased affordability and no requirement for cold-chain, but also offer the possibility of oral formulation for rapid administration in the community after a snakebite, thus reducing the critical time to treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Recently, several drugs that may generically target the active site of venom enzymes have been actively repurposed for snakebite, including the PLA2 inhibitor varespladib, which showed impressive preclinical efficacy and recently completed a Phase II snakebite trial, though the primary endpoint was not met<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Similarly, two distinct group of molecules have been reported to show promising SVMP-inhibitory activities. Metal chelating molecules, particularly 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), showed preclinical protection in <italic>in vivo</italic> envenoming models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and has since been used in a Phase I dose optimisation study to support onward clinical development for snakebite indication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The second comprises several matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors. These compounds feature a zinc-binding motif which directly engages with the active site of SVMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, and include marimastat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, prinomastat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and batimastat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. These hydroxamic acids demonstrated potent inhibition of SVMP toxins <italic>in vitro</italic>, inhibition of procoagulant venom effects in physiologically relevant bioassays, and showed variable promise in preclinical trials for mitigating the local and systemic haemotoxic effects of snake venoms in small animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">While such repurposing efforts have been highly encouraging, our understanding of the chemical space around SVMP inhibitors remains largely unexplored, as the identified repurposed drugs have not been optimised via medicinal chemistry approaches to improve their drugability for snakebite indication. To address this issue and expand the snakebite drug portfolio, we recently described a high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign that identified several potent SVMP inhibitors from a ~3,500 compound library, including the MMP inhibitor XL-784, which displayed double digit nanomolar inhibition of the SVMP activity of several diverse snake venoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Using XL-784 as a starting scaffold, here we describe the first snakebite specific medicinal chemistry campaign to identify lead candidate SVMP inhibitors that display broad cross-snake species inhibitory activity, and with superior potency and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic (DMPK) properties to current lead drugs. Following a rationally designed optimisation cascade, consisting of enzymatic and phenotypic assessments coupled to DMPK analyses, DC-174 was identified as a lead candidate molecule. This first, rationally designed, snakebite drug has desirable physicochemical and broad-spectrum venom inhibitory properties and demonstrates impressive preclinical efficacy against snakebite when dosed orally in a murine rescue model of envenoming.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Optimisation of SVMP inhibitors identifies DC-174 as lead candidate</title><p id="P7">Our prior primary HTS campaign identified several strong hits, including the known MMP-inhibitors marimastat, prinomastat and XL-784<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. XL-784 has a highly modifiable piperazine scaffold and consists of (1) primary scaffold, (2) 4-substituted aryl groups and (3) N1-side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). Based on previous structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies with human MMPs, we preserved the central core scaffold in our SAR optimisation strategy. In the related MMP-inhibitor Ro-1130830 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>) and its analogues, the hydroxamic acid is shown to chelate the zinc while forming a hydrogen bond with a nearby glutamate residue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, with further hydrogen bonds predicted between the linking sulfonamide and backbone NH groups of a nearby loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. The aromatic rings represent the S1’ binding substituent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>) shown in the development of selective MMP13 inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. X-ray crystal structures of multiple SVMP toxins suggest this region and its available volume for binding may be variable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 1</xref>), therefore modifications may affect the spectrum of SVMPs inhibited. Consequently, variation of substituents of the aromatic-ring and N1-side chain subunits were performed to investigate the structure-activity relationship against SVMPs.</p><p id="P8">Throughout our medicinal chemistry campaign, compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit enzymatic SVMP toxin activity <italic>in vitro</italic> using a previously described fluorescent-based substrate cleavage assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> against five medically important viper venoms, namely <italic>Echis romani</italic> (Roman’s carpet viper, West Africa), <italic>Crotalus atrox</italic> (Western diamondback rattlesnake, North America), <italic>Calloselasma rhodostoma</italic> (Malayan pit viper, South East Asia), <italic>Bothrops jararaca</italic> (jararaca, South America) and <italic>Bitis arietans</italic> (puff adder, Africa). We defined a potent inhibitor as having <italic>in vitro</italic> SVMP inhibition potency of less than 100 nM. The downstream testing cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>) included assessment of <italic>in vitro</italic> DMPK properties of the compounds, with thresholds for “good” compounds defined as rat hepatocyte clearance &lt;10 μL/min/10<sup>6</sup> cells, human microsomal clearance &lt;10 μL/min/mg intrinsic clearances, and aqueous solubility at pH 7.4 &gt;500 μM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Secondary inhibitory assays assessing neutralisation of venom activity on plasma clotting were used to triage synthesised molecules and benchmark against prinomastat and XL-784, before progression of lead compounds into <italic>in vivo</italic> models to evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK) and efficacy profiles.</p><p id="P9">The medicinal chemistry campaign resulted in 12 compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 1</xref>; chemical synthetic procedures can be found in the supplementary information). The parasubstitution on the aromatic ring was initially accessed and hydroxamic acid <bold>28</bold> was able to retain similar potency to parent XL-784, while showing improvement in metabolic stability (rat hepatocyte clearance of 22.8 μl/min/10<sup>6</sup> cells). Further SAR investigation of the ether linkage between the biphenyl motif showed that both para-halogenated <bold>29</bold> and <bold>30</bold> bolstered the overall SVMP potency profile, despite poor metabolic stability observed for the para-fluorinated <bold>30</bold>. The truncation of the biphenyl system demonstrated better aqueous solubility (&gt;1000 μM) and significantly lower protein binding (82% free) for compound <bold>20</bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 1</xref>). Next, the methoxy ethyl side chain was replaced with a sulfonamide group which revealed effective inhibition of procoagulant venom activity by compounds <bold>19</bold> and <bold>21-23</bold> (X-ray crystallography analysis of <bold>23</bold> can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 2</xref>). This distinct secondary activity assay measured inhibition of a key parameter of clinical envenoming, coagulopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, which is often driven by SVMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. All sulfonamide <italic>N</italic>-1 analogues displayed measurable inhibition of procoagulant venom activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 3</xref>), unlike the parent molecule XL-784, monoaryl <bold>20</bold>, and biaryl analogues <bold>29</bold> and <bold>30</bold>, which were all inactive in this assay. The thiomorpholine-based biaryl prinomastat also demonstrated inhibition of procoagulant activity, suggesting inactivity of <bold>20</bold>, <bold>29</bold> and <bold>30</bold> could be due to the <italic>N</italic>-1 substituted methoxyethyl group. This dependence on the <italic>N</italic>-1 substituent was highlighted by the observation that EC<sub>50s</sub> increased with steric bulk of the <italic>N</italic>-1 substituent from a minimum at <bold>23</bold> (cyclopropyl), increasing with <bold>22</bold> (dimethyl-isoxazole) and <bold>21</bold> (methoxyphenyl). Overall, the compact cycloproyl sulfonamide <bold>23</bold> (named DC-174) emerged as the most desirable analogue in the series with improved broad-spectrum potent inhibition of SVMP activity (4.7 - 38.6 nM EC<sub>50s</sub>), metabolic stability (13.3 μl/min/10<sup>6</sup> cells) and inhibition of procoagulant venom activity (13.4 and 135.0 nM EC<sub>50s</sub> in <italic>B. jararaca</italic> and <italic>E. romani</italic>, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>DC-174 inhibits structurally diverse SVMPs and prevents venom-induced coagulation and haemorrhage</title><p id="P10">To explore whether DC-174 inhibits the breadth of structurally-distinct SVMP isoforms, we purified the P-I, P-II and P-III SVMPs from <italic>E. romani</italic> venom (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 2</xref>) and assessed their capacity to cleave the coagulation factors prothrombin and fibrinogen, before determining whether DC-174 could prevent this coagulotoxic activity. All three SVMP classes degraded fibrinogen and prothrombin to varying extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>), except for the P-II on prothrombin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 3</xref>). Comparisons of DC-174 against parent molecule XL- 784 and prinomastat showed that all compounds protected against the degradation of fibrinogen, though XL-784 was inferior against P-II SVMP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>, see lower molecular weight degradation bands). XL-784 was also unable to protect against prothrombin degradation by both P-I and P-III SVMPs, while DC-174 and prinomastat gave almost full protection, though DC-174 was superior based on visualisation of fewer degradation products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). These data could explain the differences in potency in the earlier coagulation assay, since prothrombin activation is a critical driver of procoagulant venom activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">To further explore the improved venom inhibition of DC-174 over its parent molecule XL-784 we used advanced assays measuring coagulation (thromboelastography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>) and haemorrhage (<italic>in vivo</italic> chicken embryo model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>), respectively. <italic>E. romani</italic> venom (60 ng) induced rapid clot formation in blood from healthy human donors (clotting time of 3.7 mins [SD 0.7] vs 12.4 mins [SD 0.4], non-venom control) and induced a hypercoagulable state evidenced by increased maximum clot firmness (MCF) (65.7 mm [SD 0.6] vs 58.8 mm [SD 3.0]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). While XL-784 had no effect on clotting time and only a modest reduction of venom-induced MCF (28.9% reduction), DC-174 prolonged the mean clotting time (venom, 3.7 mins [SD 0.7] vs venom and DC-174, 8.6 mins [SD 0.7]) and returned the MCF to the normal range (mean of 60.3 [SD 0.6] vs 58.8 [SD 3.0] non-venom control, compared to 65.7 mm [SD 0.6] venom only control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). To assess protection against venom-induced haemorrhage in an <italic>in vivo</italic> vascularised system, groups (n=5) of six-day-old chicken embryos were topically dosed onto the vitelline vein with <italic>E. romani</italic> venom (10 μg/egg), followed by drug (1 μg/egg).

While XL-784 only provided partial protection against envenoming, with three (60%) embryos surviving until the 6 h experimental endpoint, treatment with DC-174 resulted in complete survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>) and also prevented venom-induced haemorrhage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Oral dosing of DC-174 shows efficacy against envenoming <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P12">We next progressed evaluation of DC-174 into a modified version of the WHO-recommended, <italic>in vivo</italic> neutralisation of venom-induced lethality murine model of snakebite envenoming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.

A venom control group received SSV only instead of drug. All mice in the venom-only group succumbed to the lethal effects of envenoming within 161 mins (111-161 mins, mean 138 mins), defined as implementation of euthanasia when humane endpoints associated with severe systemic envenoming were observed. Compound DC-174 significantly prolonged survival times (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01), with three mice succumbing to the lethal effects of the venom much later in the experimental timeframe (272, 370 and 372 minutes), while the remaining two mice survived until the 8-hour experimental endpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Blood samples were collected post-euthanasia for all experimental animals (at 8 hours for survivors) and plasma isolated for biomarker analysis.

These data may explain the drop off in efficacy observed 4 h after oral dosing, since drug levels are predicted to be 26.1 ng/mL at this timepoint, an amount that equates to only 8.4% of the C<sub>max</sub>.</p><p id="P15">To test this hypothesis, we repeated the <italic>in vivo</italic> murine efficacy study using a multiple oral dosing regimen, with mice (n=5) receiving the same 20 mg/kg oral dose of DC-174 immediately after venom challenge, followed by a second oral 20 mg/kg dose 1.5 h later. This multiple dosing regimen conferred an increase in efficacy, with only one experimental animal succumbing to the lethal effects of the venom (at 180 mins), while the remaining four animals survived the duration of the 8 h experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). Mean survival times increased from 138 mins (venom only control) to 420 mins (two dose oral regimen). Analysis of resulting plasma samples revealed a further decrease in TAT levels when DC-174 was dosed twice (mean 13.7 ng/mL), lower than those observed with a single dose (mean 18.6 ng/mL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>). The number of mice with intact plasma prothrombin and fibrinogen also increased following repeat dosing of DC-174 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>).

Molecular docking of XL-784 in the P-III SVMP bothropasin supported this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a and 6b</xref>), showing a binding pose where its hydroxamic acid coordinates with the catalytic Zn<sup>2+</sup> and its hydrophobic biaryl ether fits into the S1’ pocket<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, consistent with prinomastat binding to MMP13. The binding pocket primarily involves hydrophobic interactions with aliphatic residues Ile111, Va1414,, and Ile173. Hydrogen bonds form between the sulfone oxygen and hydroxamic acid with nearby backbone NH, carbonyl groups, and a glutamate in the Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding domain. In the P-I SVMP atrolysin C, similar interactions occur, along with halogen bonding to backbone carbonyls and π-stacking with Hisl42 in the Zn<sup>2+</sup> domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 5a and 5b</xref>). In the P-I SVMP BaP1, although the core piperazine H-bonding is conserved, the S1’ pocket is too small for the biaryl ether of XL-784, which instead extends into the P2’ pocket (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 5c and 5d</xref>). This behaviour is also seen in the P-III SVMP ecarin, where a stabilizing salt bridge forms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 5e</xref>). In the P-III SVMP RVV-X, XL-784 adopts a reversed pose, avoiding the S1’ pocket (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 5f</xref>). These findings across SVMP isoforms suggest that the size of the S1’ substituent strongly influences the binding mode and inhibitory spectrum of the molecule.</p><p id="P18">Compound DC-174 was docked into SVMP crystal structures to compare its interaction profile with XL-784.

The methoxyphenyl ring of DC-174 fits well into the Sl pocket, forming hydrophobic interactions with Ile173 and Ile111, while all key hydrogen bonds from XL-784 were conserved with additional ones formed.

In ecarin, DC-174 adopted an outward pose along the P1 and P2’ pockets, stabilized by π-cation and hydrogen bond interactions with LeulO9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6f</xref>). However, its piperazine-hydroxamic acid hydrogen bonding was not conserved, instead forming a bond via the sulfone group. Interaction analysis indicates that key hydrogen bonding motifs are conserved in both P-I SVMP isoforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 6b and 6d</xref>).

We showed that a rationally designed small molecule inhibitor can effectively neutralise diverse SVMP toxins from a wide range of medically important snake venoms. Unlike the parent molecule XL-784 and other previously described SVMP inhibitors (i.e. prinomastat)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, inhibitor DC-174 neutralises all three of the structurally diverse SVMP sub-classes (i.e. P-I, P-II and P-III), likely as the result of its truncated monoaryl ring system. Further, inhibitor DC-174 is capable of fully or near fully preventing the generation of thrombin by inhibiting prothrombin proteolysis by <italic>E. romani</italic> P-I and P-III SVMPs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The ability of certain SVMPs to generate thrombin and activate the clotting cascade forms the basis of venom-induced consumption coagulopathy (VICC), whereby venom metalloproteinases cleave and deplete the internal pool of clotting factors leading to incoagulable blood. As such, DC-174 can prevent the initiation of one of the main pathways responsible for causing coagulopathy, which in turn exacerbates haemorrhage, in snakebite patients. These findings are reinforced from the <italic>in vivo</italic> models applied, with DC-174 preventing haemorrhage in an <italic>in vivo</italic> egg embryo model and significantly prolonging survival and reducing coagulopathy when administered orally following <italic>E. romani</italic> venom challenge in a murine model of envenoming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P21">The murine PK data obtained for DC-174 shows that it only takes 30 minutes for drug levels to reach their peak following oral dosing, but that the half-life is rather short at 1.41 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>). The clearance of DC-174 may underlie the intermediate level of protection observed following single oral administration in mice (i.e. significant increase in survival times, but only 40% survival at 8 h). In agreement with this hypothesis, we showed that repeated administration of DC-174, with a second dose 1.5 h after the first, improves drug efficacy, resulting in 80% survival at the end of the 8 h experiment. Plasma biomarkers of coagulation also demonstrated that repeat dosing of DC-174 increased efficacy, with TAT, prothrombin and fibrinogen levels superior to those observed with single dosing.</p><p id="P22">To contextualise these findings, the metal chelator DMPS - an SVMP inhibiting molecule that is currently in clinical trials for snakebite indication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> - is the only other SVMP inhibiting drug with demonstrated efficacy via oral dosing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.

Collectively these results underscore the increased efficacy of DC-174 relative to its parent molecule, XL-784 and other lead SVMP-inhibiting drugs, and emphasises the importance of applying rational, structure-informed chemical modification to improve PK and PD parameters of next-generation treatments for snakebite envenoming.</p><p id="P23">This work establishes a novel drug discovery pipeline for SVMP inhibitors that provide reassurance of “on-target” mechanism of action.

The area marking the position of the embryo was then covered with medical tape, and a dish of shell removed using sharp dissection scissors. The exposed embryo was then covered using parafilm and the egg returned to the incubator overnight. Surviving embryos were then randomly allocated into groups of n = 5. Embryos then received either <italic>E. romani</italic> venom 10 μg/egg or <italic>E. romani</italic> venom immediately followed by XL-784 or DC-174 (1 μg/egg). Treatments were given in a total volume of 10 μL, administered directly onto (i.e. topically) the vitelline vein. Embryos were returned to the incubator immediately following dosing, and then observed at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours. Survival was monitored via the observation of a heartbeat. Venom pathology was captured using a Motic SMZ 171-TLED microscope system. In brief, at each observation time point (1, 2, 4 and 6 hours post envenoming) images were captured using a Moticam X5 Wi-Fi camera. To track changes across the experimental time course, the imaging position was kept consistent at each timepoint for individual embryos.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> protection against venom-induced lethality</title><p id="P36">Murine preclinical studies were conducted under protocols approved by Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Boards of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and University of Liverpool under project licence (PPL No. P5846F90) approved by the UK Home Office in accordance with the UK (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Male CD-1 mice (18-20 g) were purchased from Janvier (France) and acclimatised for 7 days prior to experimentation. Mice were housed in groups of 5 in Tecniplast GM500 cages within a specific pathogen-free facility. Room conditions were set at 20-24 °C and 45 – 65% humidity, 12/12 hour light cycles. Mice were allowed ad lib access to Picolab 5R53 food (Lab Diet, USA) and reverse osmosis water and housed with nesting material and environmental enrichment materials.</p><p id="P37">Mice weighed 22-28 g at the start of study. 10 mg/kg morphine was administered subcutaneously as an analgesic 15 minutes prior to venom administration. To determine the efficacy of DC-174, a modified version of the WHO neutralisation assay was used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Following analgesia, mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 90 μg <italic>E. romani</italic> venom in 100 μL PBS, corresponding to 5 x the intravenous LD50 dose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. DC-174 was solubilised in SSV (carboxymethyl cellulose (0.5%), benzyl alcohol (0.5%), Tween 80 (0.4% v/v) and NaCl (0.9%)) and gently sonicated at 24 °C for 5 minutes. Mice received an oral dose of either 20 mg/kg DC-174 in SSV, or SSV-only (n=5/group, 50 μL/dose), immediately following venom administration. A third group received venom followed by two oral doses of DC-174, one immediately after venom administration and a second identical dose 1.5 h later. No randomisation was used to allocate experimental groups – mice were randomly allocated into cages of five prior to the experiment, and each cage formed one treatment group. No criteria for including or excluding animals was applied, and all data points were included in analyses. Animals were monitored for humane endpoints (loss of righting reflex, seizure, external haemorrhage) for 8 hours to encompass the drug exposure timeframe, and any animals showing such signs were immediately euthanised by rising concentrations of carbon dioxide. All observations were performed by mixed gender experimenters who were blinded to the drug group allocation. Time of death, number of deaths and number of survivors were recorded, where deaths and times of death represent implementation of humane endpoint-dictated euthanasia. Kaplan-Meier survival plots were generated using GraphPad Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Envenoming biomarker analysis</title><p id="P38">Blood samples were collected from mice via cardiac puncture immediately following euthanasia. Samples were centrifuged at 1400 xg for 10 mins at 4 °C, and the plasma supernatant stored at –80 °C until use. Plasma TAT levels were determined using a sandwich ELISA provided as a commercial kit (Abcam, ab137994). Mouse plasma samples were diluted 1:150 using Diluent M and were run in duplicate alongside a standard curve. Each well received 50 μL diluted plasma and was incubated for 2 h at room temperature to allow for the reaction with the TAT complexes antibodies coated onto the plate. After five washes, 50 μL of biotinylated mouse TAT complexes antibodies were added to the plate and the reaction allowed to proceed for another 2h. Following another five washes, 50 μL of a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate were added to the plate and incubated for another 30 minutes. Next, 50 μL of a chromogenic substrate (3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine) was added to the plate and the peroxidase-dependent reaction allowed to proceed until a clear blue colour formed in the well. At this point 50 μL of stop solution was added and the absorbance read immediately at 450 nm and 570 nm. The 570 nm absorbance readings were subtracted from the 450 nm ones, and the levels of TAT complexes (ng/mL) extrapolated based on the standard curve. Data was further plotted as means with SD for each mouse sample and n=4-5 samples were used for each experimental condition.</p><p id="P39">Anti-fibrinogen and anti-prothrombin western blots were performed using mouse plasma to detect the integrity of mouse fibrinogen or prothrombin following envenoming in the presence or absence of DC-174. Mouse plasma samples were diluted 1:50 (anti-fibrinogen blots) and 1:30 (anti-prothrombin blots) and 5 μL was run on 4-20% SDS-PAGE gels (BioRad) at 180V for 1 h. The separated proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using semi-dry transfer on a Trans-Blot Turbo (BioRad) using the following conditions: 1.3 A, 25 V, 7 min. Blots were then stained for 5 min with Revert 700 Total Protein Stain (LICORbio) following the manufacturer’s protocol and imaged on the 700 nm channel on an Odyssey Fc Imaging System to detect protein abundance and ensure equal loading. Membranes were then destained in 0.1 M NaOH, 30% methanol for no longer than 10 min, then blocked in 5% milk TBST for 1 h. The primary antibodies: anti-fibrinogen (ab34269, rabbit polyclonal, Abcam) and anti-prothrombin (PA5-77976, rabbit polyclonal, Thermo Fisher) were diluted 1:1,500 and 1:1,000, respectively in 5% milk TBST. The membranes were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody for 1.5 hours at room temperature, followed by three 5-min washes in TBST. Blots were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an IRD 800CW donkey-anti rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:15000, LICORbio), followed by three 5-min washes in TBS. The blots were imaged on an Odyssey Fc Imaging System at both 700 and 800 nm.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Drug metabolism pharmacokinetic studies (DMPK) properties assays</title><p id="P40">The DMPK properties data described in the manuscript were measured via a high-throughput platform by AstraZeneca (United Kingdom).

Ltd (Qualification No.: SCXK (Hu) 2022-0009 20220009018616). Mice had access to food and water throughout the pre- and post-dose sampling period. Compound DC-174 was formulated in 0.5% MC (Sigma, SLCL7954) and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma, BCCF2036) in water (RephiLe/S21RDB0304) and administered at 20 mg/kg via oral gavage (N=9). Approximately 110 μL whole blood/time point (sampling at 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours) was collected via serial bleeding in K2EDTA tube via facial vein. The blood sample was kept on ice and centrifuged (2,000 xg, 4 °C, 5 min) within 15 minutes post-sampling. The plasma drug concentrations were determined by LC-MS/MS (ESI, Triple Quad 5500 System) on positive ion mode and using dexamethasone as internal standard. Liquid chromatography (LC) was performed using a 2.5 μm Xbridge BEH-C18 column (2.1 mm x 50 mm ,) at 60 °C with a rate of 0.6 ml/min. The following mobile phases were used; A: Water (+0.025% Formic acid and 1.0 mM ammonium acetate), B: Methanol (+0.025% Formic acid and 1.0 mM ammonium acetate). The LC method used was 5% B for 0.20 minutes, linear gradient from 5% to 60% B from 0.20 to 1.40 minutes, linear gradient from 60% to 65% B from 1.40 to 2.00 minutes, then hold 90% B from 2.01 to 2.30 minutes, followed by re-equilibration at 5% from 2.31 to 2.60 minutes.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Statistical information</title><p id="P42">For EC<sub>50</sub> data, experiments were performed as independent (biological) repeats at least in triplicate with two technical repeats per biological repeat.
