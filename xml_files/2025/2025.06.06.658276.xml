While several splicing changes have been discovered we have focused further on the apoptosis gene <italic>BCL-X</italic> isoforms.</p><p id="P4">In GEnCs, an upregulation of the <italic>BCL-XS/BCL-XL</italic> ratio was observed which resulted in an increase in GEnC apoptosis. An upregulation of <italic>IL-6</italic> was also observed; treatment with IL-6 alone induced a dose-dependent shift in <italic>BCL-X</italic> splicing to promote expression of the pro-apoptotic <italic>BCL-XS.</italic> Furthermore, we identified certain splicing factors, SF3B1 and PTBP1, involved in the <italic>BCL-X</italic> splicing regulation.

A large proportion of patients with DN will eventually progress to end-stage renal failure and require long-term kidney replacement treatment (dialysis). Due to the large number of such patients, there is a considerable, and increasing, strain on health system resources worldwide. Therefore, new treatments that can slow the progression of DN are urgently needed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P7">At present, clinicians have a few therapeutic tools to use for this purpose. Blood pressure lowering angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have long been proven to be beneficial in decreasing proteinuria and slowing the degradation of kidney function. Furthermore, more recently, SGLT2 inhibitors designed to lower glycaemia have shown remarkable effects in the protection of kidney protection function; while the mechanism is not yet completely understood, it is clearly not due only to decreasing glycaemia. However, the above-mentioned drugs, although extremely useful, were not purposely designed for the treatment of DN; their effects were discovered serendipitously. It is therefore thought that understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of DN and designing drugs to directly address these mechanisms has the potential to elicit new classes of drugs with good efficiency in slowing down the progression of DN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P8">One new area of therapeutic research in various diseases is the modulation of alternative splicing (AS). AS has been shown to occur in over 94% of genes in humans and therefore represents an important level in deciding the proteome diversity of the functional capabilities of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Since AS is so widespread, it is not surprising that virtually all diseases display aberrant splicing, which includes the appearance of new, specific disease isoforms or modifications to the ratios of existing isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Either way, AS has the potential to maintain and drive the pathogenic process. Therefore, a new research field is looking into manipulation of these isoforms for therapeutic benefit, for example, by switching ratios of splice isoforms to their normal rapport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To explore these therapeutic AS decisions further, we need to understand the potentially pathogenic isoforms. Therefore, this study aimed to determine important AS changes that occur in the progression of DN. We describe in detail one such splicing event – the pro- and anti-apoptotic splice isoforms of <italic>BCL-X</italic> (an apoptosis gene). We describe its regulation in a diabetic environment, the association of isoform ratio with DN progression, and its potential as a therapeutic target in DN.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p id="P10">Conditionally immortalized glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs) (Satchell et al., 2006) were differentiated in endothelial media (EGM + Bulletkit; Lonza) for 5 days.

Splicing variants are described in virtually every class of molecules from growth factors to tyrosine kinase/phosphatase receptors to tumour suppressors and oncogenes. Many times, the splicing isoforms have opposing functions e.g., pro- or anti-angiogenic, pro- or anti-apoptotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). There is recent evidence that the occurrence of a particular set of splice isoforms is determinant for both physiological and pathological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Indeed, there are quite a few examples were various biological processes are coordinated by networks of alternative splicing regulators - e.g. tissue and organ development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), pancreatic beta cells function and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) or epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Interestingly, a large number of apoptosis gene’s function is controlled by AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). It is highly likely that this may occur in other processes, including DN pathogenesis and may represent a novel paradigm in biology.</p><p id="P44">Diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia and the activation of proinflammatory cytokines. Hyperglycemia has been shown to cause programmed cell death in a variety of renal cells including endothelial and podocyte cells which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of DN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Therefore, understanding the mechanism involved in the anti-apoptotic to pro-apoptotic splicing in Bcl-x (a major apoptosis gene) in renal cells may be a key to rescuing renal cells from apoptosis and could also serve as a novel biomarker for DN severity.</p><p id="P45">This study aimed to determine whether alternative splicing events identified in DN can be used in a therapeutic strategy in DN as well as whether they are associated with DN severity.</p><p id="P46">We discovered in this study that the Bcl-x AS event is dysregulated in diabetic GEnC by RNAseq analysis. Recognizing the associated programmed cell death that comes with diabetic nephropathy, we sought to further understand the mechanism of the Bcl-x gene AS in diabetic conditions and how it can be exploited to rescue diabetic cells from apoptosis as well as utilized in the development of a biomarker.</p><p id="P47">Systemic increase in IL-6 together with other cytokines has been associated with obesity-related inflammation. This increase has also been implicated as a risk factor in the development of insulin resistance as well as T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Studies have shown that IL-6 regulates Bcl-x gene AS in K562 cells in favour of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). RT-PCR for the Bcl-x isoforms showed an increase in Bcl-xS band intensity as IL-6 concentration increased from 0.1 ng/ml to 50 ng/ml. Moreover, the JC-10 assay showed an increase in apoptosis of HEK293 as IL-6 concentration increased. This indicates that Bcl-x AS may be dependent on IL-6 in a dose-wise manner.</p><p id="P48">Hyperglycemia is a hallmark of diabetes and has also been associated with high IL-6 levels(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Consequently, it was necessary to determine the impact of a high glucose environment on Bcl-x AS. GS+ treatment caused a significant increase in the Bcl-xS/Bcl-xL ratio compared to NG as well as a significant increase in apoptosis of HEK293 cells in GS+ treatment compared to NG using a JC-10 assay.</p><p id="P49">Additionally, studies have demonstrated that oscillating high glucose could be more deleterious on endothelial function in comparison to stable or continuous high glucose as well as hyper activation of p53, a molecule known to be involved in apoptosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Investigating the effects of oscillating high glucose (OHG) on Bcl-x AS showed that OHG treatment caused a significant increase in Bcl-xS/Bcl-xL ratio compared to NG with a corresponding increase in apoptosis of HEK293 cells in OHG treatment compared to NG treatment using the JC-10 assay. Oscillating glucose soup (OGS+) treatment also showed a significant increase in Bcl-xS/Bcl-xL ratio compared to NG. The JC-10 results showed a significant increase in apoptosis of HEK293 cells treated with OGS+ compared to NG treatment. We therefore concluded that interleukin-6 or a combination of oscillating high glucose and interleukin-6 play a role in Bcl-x gene AS, which consequently leads to apoptosis activation</p><p id="P50">We saw a significant decrease in apoptosis between HEK293 cells treated in GS+ and then transfected with Bcl-xL transiently. This was compared to HEK293 cells treated with GS+ with transient transfection of a control plasmid. However, there was no significant difference between HEK293 cells treated in GS+ with no transfection compared to HEK293 cells transiently transfected with a control plasmid. This preliminary work serves as evidence that there is a possibility that cells can be protected from apoptosis resulting from hyperglycemia through Bcl-xL upregulation.</p><p id="P51">Using Pearson correlation analysis, we attempted to establish a relationship between kidney function parameters in research participants and urine sediment or leucocyte Bcl-xS/Bcl-xL ratio. The kidney function metric eGFR was discovered to weakly correlate with the Bcl-xS/Bcl-xL ratio acquired from patients’ urine sediments, whilst uACR moderately correlated with the Bcl-xS/Bcl-xL ratio obtained from leucocytes from patient blood. It is important to note that, while serum creatinine is used to assess renal function, additional confounding factors influence creatinine production and secretion. Muscle mass is a factor that influences creatine synthesis, levels, and, consequently, creatinine production. Age and gender appear to be the most important factors in influencing total muscle mass and, thus, creatinine production. Men create more creatinine than women because they have larger muscular mass. Lower creatinine production can also result from age-related muscle mass reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Furthermore, the amount of dietary creatine taken, typically in the form of meat, influences creatinine synthesis as well as total muscle mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Reduced creatinine synthesis is associated with pathophysiologic diseases that cause muscle atrophy and decrease muscle mass. These circumstances include long-term glucocorticoid medication, muscular dystrophy, and paralysis just to mention a few. Since multiple unconnected factors may have simultaneous effects on serum creatinine levels, it is not ideal for renal function assessment. However, it is much more advantageous to use serum creatinine, due to its low cost and availability. These drawbacks in serum creatinine levels estimation could be the reason Bcl-xS/Bcl-xL ratio from leucocyte and urine sediment do not correlate these parameters. Despite the limits and inconveniences of measuring albuminuria, chronic disease markers have been employed for many years. However, in the lack of other known and tested approaches, they are used continuously with corrections and considerations, making them more onerous. Other urine markers mentioned in reviews include Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG), type IV collagen, and nephrin, to name a few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). These markers are expected to be more durable than those now available. Future research could investigate the link between these new indicators and Bcl-x AS. Furthermore, a larger cohort will solidify our findings.</p><p id="P52">In conclusion, we discovered that oscillating high glucose and interleukine-6 impact Bcl-x gene AS, increasing the pro-apoptotic isoform Bcl-xS and inducing apoptosis in HEK293 cells. We further propose that increasing the anti-apoptotic isoform Bcl-xL protects HEK293 cells from apoptosis. Finally, the Bcl-xS/Bcl-xL ratio correlates with renal function measures, eGFR and uACR, and may serve as a potential predictive tool for DN severity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary data</label><media xlink:href="EMS206353-supplement-Supplementary_data.pptx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation" id="d38aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS206353-supplement-Table_1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d38aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS206353-supplement-Table_2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d38aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary_Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS206353-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d38aAcEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The BEAt-DKD project has received funding from the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking (JU) under grant agreement No 115974 (BEAt-DKD).
