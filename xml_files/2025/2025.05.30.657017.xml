Here, cleavage of the C-C bond is catalyzed by the Acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase complex (ACDS; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Grahame, 1991</xref>). In the hydrogenotrophic pathway, carbon dioxide is reduced to methane using molecular H<sub>2</sub> as an electron donor. In a similar vein, the methylotrophic pathway exploits methylated compounds (<italic>e.g</italic>., methanol, methylamines, methyl sulfides) to reduce the methyl groups to CH<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Costa &amp; Leigh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Uwe Deppenmeier et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hippe et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mand &amp; Metcalf, 2019</xref>). All three pathways rely on (i) the heterosulfide reductase (Hdr) to reduce the CoM-S-S-CoB heterodisulfate and thereby regenerate CoM and CoB, and (ii) final methane formation via methyl-coenzyme-M reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hedderich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Jaun &amp; Thauer, 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Members of the genus <italic>Methanosarcina</italic> possess the unique ability to deploy all three pathways for methanogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hippe et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mand &amp; Metcalf, 2019</xref>). As such, <italic>Methanosarcina</italic> species exhibit high levels of adaptability regarding available carbon and energy sources, in contrast to species of more specialized methanoarchaeal genera, <italic>e.g</italic>., <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> and <italic>Methanococcus</italic> (primarily hydrogenotrophic), <italic>Methanosphaera</italic> (methylotrophic), and <italic>Methanosaeta</italic> (acetoclastic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Liu &amp; Whitman, 2008</xref>).

Methanogenesis using H<sub>2</sub> in concert with CO<sub>2</sub> (-136 kJ/mol CH<sub>4</sub>) or methylated substrates (-108 kJ/mol CH<sub>4</sub>) is far more exergonic than acetoclastic methanogenesis (-65 kJ/mol CH<sub>4</sub>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Yi et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In the presence of H<sub>2</sub>, <italic>M. mazei</italic> grows hydrogenotrophically, reducing CO<sub>2</sub> to methane (C<sub>1</sub>-metabolic pathway). This stepwise reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> is initiated by its reduction to a formyl group bound to methanofuran (MFR). This formyl group is then transferred to tetrahydrosarcinapterin (H<sub>4</sub>SPT) and is further reduced to methenyl-H<sub>4</sub>SPT. Subsequent reduction yields methyl-H<sub>4</sub>SPT, the methyl group from which is then transferred to coenzyme M (CoM) by the membrane-bound tetrahydrosarcinapterin S-methyl transferase (Mtr)-complex. In the final step of methanogenesis, the methyl group is reduced to methane by methyl-CoM reductase. Electrons required for all reductions are supplied by H<sub>2</sub> oxidation. In the absence of sufficient H<sub>2</sub>, <italic>M. mazei</italic> uses methylated compounds as carbon and energy sources (methylotrophy). In the absence of the electron donor H<sub>2</sub>, however, reducing equivalents must originate from an alternative source. In this case, a fraction of the methyl groups is oxidized to CO<sub>2</sub>, providing the electrons required for the reduction of further methyl groups to methane. This disproportionation process involves reversing part of the C<sub>1</sub> metabolic pathway, where enzymes that normally reduce C<sub>1</sub> compounds now function in reverse and oxidize methyl groups to CO<sub>2</sub>. This process commences with the transfer of the methyl group from methyl-CoM to H<sub>4</sub>SPT, catalyzed by the Mtr-complex operating in reverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Uwe Deppenmeier et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Hitherto, our understanding of substrate-dependent regulation of metabolic pathways in response to available carbon and energy sources in <italic>Methanosarcina</italic> spp. has remained limited to the transcriptional level. In <italic>M. acetivorans</italic>, for example, expression of methyltransferase MtaC1 and MtaB1, which transfer the methyl group of methanol to CoM, are transcriptionally upregulated when methanol is present. When acetate is the sole carbon and energy source, however, expression of the ACDS complex is upregulated on the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Li et al., 2007</xref>). The molecular mechanisms underlying these regulatory processes at the transcriptional level often remain poorly understood. In addition, post-transcriptional and/or post-translational regulation has not been reported yet. Energy dependent anabolic processes might also influence the regulation of pathways in involved in energy metabolism, <italic>e.g</italic>., type of nitrogen source and availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Yi et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We examined the physiological role of the 49 aa protein encoded by small ORF16, henceforth referred to as MtrR, which is transcribed and translated in significant amounts in <italic>M. mazei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Tufail et al., 2024</xref>). We show that, despite being devoid of transmembrane domains, small protein MtrR localizes exclusively at the cytoplasmic membrane, due to interaction with subunit A of the membrane-bound Mtr complex (MtrA). Based on biochemical and genetic analyses of this small protein, we posit that MtrR is responsible for H<sub>2</sub>-dependent modulation of Mtr complex activity, most likely by impeding the methyl transfer from CoM to H<sub>4</sub>SPT via direct protein-protein interactions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Localization of oligomeric MtrR on the cytoplasmic membrane</title><p id="P9">When MtrR was fused to a C-terminal his-tag (MtrR-His<sub>6</sub>), heterologously expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified via Ni-NTA immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), elution fractions obtained at low imidazole concentrations yielded dimeric MtrR-His<sub>6</sub> (~ 14 kDa) and distinct proteins of greater molecular mass. The latter were likely larger oligomers that were not eluted at higher imidazole concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Subsequently, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) yielded a purified fraction of homogeneous MtrR-His<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Since the aa sequence of MtrR does not contain tryptophan, tyrosine, or cysteine residues, the SEC exhibits no visible peaks in the UV<sub>280nm</sub> chromatogram. Consequently, exact determinations of molecular masses are difficult. Calibration with standard proteins suggested that the smallest MtrR-His<sub>6</sub> fraction (13 ml) corresponds to a molecular mass of approximately 10 kDa, representing dimeric MtrR-His<sub>6</sub> (supplemental Fig. S1). In preceding elution fractions (11 and 12 ml), additional larger oligomers of MtrR were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).

Cytoplasmic and membrane fractions of <italic>M. mazei</italic> cells were individually subjected to western blot analyses with antibodies directed against the respective tags. Regardless of the protein tag or promoter used, MtrR was detected exclusively in the membrane fraction and was absent in the cytoplasmic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). For both tagged versions, western blot signals corresponded to protein masses of approximately 20, 25, and 55 kDa, which likely represent stable homo-oligomeric forms of MtrR, and a 20 kDa protein degradation product.

While MtrH is a soluble protein, is associates with the membrane in dimeric form via interactions with MtrB and MtrF, which comprise the central transmembrane stalk (suppl. Fig. S4F). Bearing the binding site for CH<sub>3</sub> -H<sub>4</sub>SPT, MtrH transfers the methyl group to a MtrA-bound cobalamin. Following the methyl transfer, the methyl-cobalamin-carrying MtrA dissociates from MtrH and binds the MtrCDE subcomplex, which houses cofactor HS-CoM, onto which the methyl group is transferred (suppl. Fig. S4F). MtrA is predicted to behave as a shuttle for methyl groups, tirelessly switching back-and-forth between MtrH and the membrane-bound MtrCDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Aziz et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Uwe Deppenmeier et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gottschalk &amp; Thauer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Reif-Trauttmansdorff et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p id="P18">In <italic>Methanosarcina</italic>, the Mtr-complex can catalyze methyl transfer in both directions depending on environmental conditions, thereby facilitating methylotrophic, hydrogenotrophic, and/or acetoclastic methanogenesis. When growing on methanol in the absence of H<sub>2</sub> as an electron donor, <italic>M. mazei</italic> disproportionates the methanol, where one mol of methanol is oxidized to generate the electrons required for the reduction of three other mol of methanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). The first step of this oxidation is the transfer of the methyl group from CH<sub>3</sub>-CoM to H<sub>4</sub>SPT, performed by the Mtr-complex. This is simply the Mtr-mediated reductive reaction described above run in reverse. This reversed reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable (ΔG = +30 kJ/mol), and as such needs to be driven by electrochemical membrane potential. One can speculate that the direction of this reaction is governed by environmental conditions, such as carbon sources and H<sub>2</sub> availability. However, a molecular mechanism underlying this regulation has yet to be reported.</p><p id="P19">As MtrR interacts with the Mtr-complex in <italic>M. mazei</italic> and is conserved exclusively in the <italic>Methanosarcina</italic> genus, which can capitalize a variety of carbon and energy sources, we posit a regulatory function for MtrR in energy metabolism ultimately governed by the availability of various carbon sources and electron donors. Consistent with computational predictions obtained using AlphaFold3, which provide tentative structural insights into potential interactions between MtrR and the Mtr complex (suppl. Fig. S4), MST experiments demonstrated that MtrR binds the MtrA subunit specifically. MtrR (aa 24 -28) might interact with the MtrA surface opposite the cobalamin binding site. Here, a flexible loop tethers MtrA’s catalytic domain to its membrane anchor (see suppl. Fig. S4). While these interactions may not hinder transfer of the methyl group in general, they might cause MtrA to favor transfer of the methyl group to CoM instead of H<sub>4</sub>SPT.</p><p id="P20">This hypothesis, where MtrR invokes the favoring the methyl transfer from CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>SPT to CoM, is in agreement with the growth characteristics of the chromosomal deletion mutant <italic>(</italic>Δ<italic>sORF16</italic>). Using methanol as both a carbon and energy source, wild type <italic>M. mazei</italic> grows better in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>, as it readily provides the electrons needed to reduce the methanol to methane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). As such, no disproportionation of methanol is required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>) and all methanol is reduced to methane (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, the Δ<italic>sORF16</italic> mutant strain fails to capitalize fully on these readily available electrons, resulting in the in continued partial oxidation of methanol, less energy conservation, and slower growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). When carbon dioxide and molecular hydrogen are the sole sources of carbon and energy (thus favoring hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis), the Δ<italic>sORF16</italic> mutant strain exhibits much slower growth its wild-type counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). This suggests that in the absence of MtrR, the Mtr complex partially catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group from CoM to H<sub>4</sub>SPT as part of the methyl-oxidizing pathway, resulting in lower energy yields and slower growth.</p><p id="P21">We conclude that in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>, small protein MtrR plays an important role in the post-translational regulation of the membrane-bound Mtr complex, a key driver of methanogenesis. MtrR causes the Mtr complex to favor methyl transfer from CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>SPT to CoM (reducing direction), most likely via protein-protein interactions. This unique post-translational regulation of the Mtr complex by a small protein renders superior fitness upon the organism in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>, regardless of whether methanol or carbon dioxide is available as a carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Moreover, the findings argue for a direct link between small protein modulation, energy conservation, and environmental sensing in methanoarchaea. We speculate that, based on H<sub>2</sub> presence and/or cellular energy demand, MtrR is upregulated or activated and subsequently regulates the Mtr complex by binding to MtrA. Future investigations into this regulation at the molecular and structural level, as well as the signaling pathway for H<sub>2</sub> availability, will bolster our understanding of the important regulation of the key enzyme Mtr. Acquired detailed knowledge on this regulation might in the long term allow managing production of methane as a climate friendly alternative to fossil fuels.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Protein structure prediction</title><p id="P22">Protein structures were predicted using AlphaFold3 via the AlphaFold3 Server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abramson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Construction of strains and plasmids</title><sec id="S10"><title>Small ORF16 genomic deletion</title><p id="P23">The 1-kb genomic regions flanking the small ORF16 gene on both sides were amplified from <italic>M. mazei</italic> Gö1 genomic DNA using specific primers (Eurofins, Ebersberg, Germany) listed in Table S2.
