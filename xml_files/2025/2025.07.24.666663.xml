by which atherosclerotic lesions grow. The underlying mechanisms can be studied in mouse and pig atherosclerosis, but it remains unclear to what extent the mesenchymal plaque cell types in these species recapitulate human disease. Here, we integrate published and new single-cell RNA sequencing data of plaque mesenchymal cells from human carotid and coronary arteries, pig aorta and coronary arteries, and mouse brachiocephalic arteries. By applying consensus across multiple integration and gene homology-matching strategies, we identify a conserved core continuum of mesenchymal plaque cells, ranging from SMCs to extracellular matrix-producing fibroblast-like cells, which is stable across species and vascular beds. Notably, several other populations differed between human and experimental lesions. Subpopulations of SMCs marked by DLX5 and RERGL expression were specific to human carotid and coronary plaques, respectively. Mesenchymal cell states with strong pro-angiogenic and inflammation-associated gene signatures were identified in pig, but not human, coronary plaque datasets, with the pro-angiogenic phenotype associated with early stages of necrotic core development. Pericytes were solely present in pig and human plaques, while chondrocyte-like cells were unique to mouse lesions. The presented interspecies maps of mesenchymal cell diversity, and their markers may inform translational research into the role of SMCs and their derived progeny in atherosclerosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">During atherosclerosis and other types of arterial disease, a subset of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) loses its differentiated phenotype, proliferates, and transitions to several mesenchymal cell types not typically present in the arterial intima<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Additional mesenchymal cells may enter the lesion as pericytes accompanying neovessel ingrowth or, under certain conditions, may originate from endothelial cells undergoing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transitioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> or from invading adventitial fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. SMC-derived mesenchymal cells contribute both to stabilizing components of plaques, such as the fibrous cap and extracellular matrix, and to destabilizing elements, including the necrotic core<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Their relevance to clinical outcomes and potential as therapeutic targets is underscored by their expression of multiple coronary artery disease-associated risk genes identified in genome-wide association studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The abundance and diversity of plaque mesenchymal cells have been extensively studied in mouse models of atherosclerosis. By using SMC lineage tracing with fluorescence reporter transgenes, including stochastically recombining versions that allow tracking of individual cells, up to 70% of all murine plaque cells have been found to originate from a small number of medial SMCs that undergo clonal expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In human carotid and coronary atherosclerosis, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed a large and heterogeneous population of putative SMC-derived mesenchymal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, but the extent to which these human cell types correspond to those observed in mouse models has not been systematically analyzed. Moreover, mesenchymal cell populations remain uncharacterized in large-animal models, such as pigs, whose lesions show higher morphological resemblance to human lesions than those in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Potential differences between experimental and human atherosclerosis may arise not only from divergent regulatory mechanisms governing SMC responses in different species but also from variation in the arterial sites studied. While clinically relevant atherosclerosis in humans primarily affects the coronary and carotid arteries, murine studies typically focus on the aortic root or brachiocephalic artery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, whereas porcine studies often examine the abdominal aorta as well as the coronary arteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. SMCs across these vascular regions differ in their embryonic origin, which could influence the repertoire of mesenchymal phenotypes in plaques, as embryonic programs are known to play critical roles in metaplastic processes in general<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and SMC fate decisions in particular<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Resolving the similarities and differences between plaque mesenchymal cells in human and experimental atherosclerosis is essential for determining which human processes can be reliably studied in animal models. Moreover, comparing SMC responses across multiple species may provide a valuable vantage point for distinguishing core regulatory mechanisms of SMC plasticity from species- or model-specific phenomena. It may also help define a meaningful set of markers that can be used across species to describe plaque mesenchymal cells in translational studies.</p><p id="P6">Here, we performed consensus integration of plaque mesenchymal scRNA-seq data from mouse, pig, and human atherosclerotic lesions. We identified a conserved spectrum of mesenchymal cell states, ranging from contractile SMCs to non-contractile, extracellular matrix–producing phenotypes, consistently observed across all species and vascular sites examined. Importantly, several other mesenchymal cell states were specific to models or human lesions. Based on these findings, we propose a set of consensus markers applicable across species and provide a comparative map to support cross-species interpretation of mesenchymal cell phenotypes in experimental and human atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Plaque mesenchymal scRNA-seq datasets from humans, pigs, and mice</title><p id="P7">Atherosclerosis develops both in large elastic arteries, e.g. carotid arteries and aorta, and in medium-sized muscular arteries, e.g. coronary arteries. To minimize confounding from intrinsic differences in arterial wall structure, we stratified our analysis accordingly. To compare plaque mesenchymal cells in elastic arteries across species, we obtained published scRNA-seq data from 6 human carotid plaque endarterectomies and 15 brachiocephalic artery lesions from high-fat-fed Apoe<sup>-/-</sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and generated scRNA-seq data of 6 atherosclerotic lesions from the abdominal aorta of high-fat-fed PCSK9 transgenic minipigs, as described elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). The murine dataset is similar to several published mouse atherosclerosis datasets from <italic>Apoe-/-, Ldlr</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>, and PCSK9-overexpressing mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Murine and porcine lesions were harvested without the underlying arterial wall, yielding samples comparable to endarterectomy specimens.</p><p id="P8">The mesenchymal supercluster in human and pig lesions was identified based on expression of canonical SMC and fibroblast markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A-B</xref>), whereas the mouse dataset included only lineage-traced SMC-derived cells. In all datasets, the mesenchymal supercluster comprised a main population spanning SMCs and cells with low or absent expression of contractile genes, forming a phenotypic continuum, as well as a variable number of smaller adjacent clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). To harmonize cluster granularity and naming across species, we applied the lowest clustering resolution that separated adjacent clusters from the main population and subdivided the latter into at least three clusters, labeled as contractile, intermediate, and terminal cells. These labels reflect spatial positioning in the UMAP plot and do not imply a linear transitioning trajectory - i.e., that cells necessarily pass from contractile to intermediate to terminal states. Explorative analysis showed that higher resolution did not produce subsets with distinct gene expression patterns, indicating that the chosen resolution was sufficient to distinguish relevant cell types. Full sets of cluster marker genes are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2-S4</xref>.</p><p id="P9">Following this strategy, the human mesenchymal supercluster in carotid plaques comprised 6 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), including the contractile, intermediate, and terminal clusters; a cluster of pericytes, identified by expression of canonical pericyte markers (e.g., <italic>GJA4</italic> and <italic>RGS16</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>; and two additional SMC subclusters, DLX5_Cells and CRTAC1_Cells, with unknown functional roles, named after their top-expressed genes. The porcine mesenchymal supercluster in abdominal plaques comprised 7 clusters, including the contractile, intermediate, and terminal clusters, as well as a small secondary SMC cluster with high expression of <italic>RGS5</italic>, a pericyte cluster, a small fibroblast cluster, and a cluster with a type 1 interferon gene expression signature, named IFN_Intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The murine mesenchymal supercluster in brachiocephalic plaques comprised 4 clusters, including the 3 core populations and a separate cluster of <italic>Rgs5-</italic>expressing SMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To compare mesenchymal cells in coronary atherosclerosis across species, we utilized a published human scRNA-seq dataset consisting of 8 atherosclerotic right coronary artery segments from 4 heart transplant patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, and generated scRNA-seq from raised atherosclerotic lesions in the right coronary arteries of 5 high-fat-fed PCSK9 transgenic minipigs. Murine coronary arteries are not routinely used for experimental atherosclerosis research, and no suitable datasets were available. Mesenchymal cell isolation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C-D</xref>), marker analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S5-S6</xref>), and clustering were performed as for elastic artery atherosclerosis. The mesenchymal supercluster in human coronary plaques comprised 6 populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), including the contractile, intermediate, and terminal cells, as well as pericytes, fibroblasts, and a population of RERGL_cells with intermediate expression of contractile genes and high expression of <italic>RERGL</italic>. The mesenchymal supercluster in pig coronary lesions encompassed 8 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). In this dataset, separation of adjacent pericyte and fibroblast clusters could not be achieved without splitting the intermediate cluster into two subsets. The other identified clusters were VEGFA_Terminal cells, characterized by high <italic>VEGFA</italic> expression, and IFN_Intermediate cells with a type 1 interferon signature.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Integration of plaque mesenchymal cells from mouse, pig, and human elastic arteries</title><p id="P11">The goal of scRNA-seq data integration is to generate a unified representation of cell types and states from datasets obtained under different conditions. This involves minimizing variability in gene expression caused by technical and experimental differences (batch effects) while preserving meaningful biological variation. In cross-species integration, it also requires separating trivial species-specific gene expression differences within comparable cell types from true differences in cell type and state. Numerous scRNA-seq data integration algorithms have been developed, and because their performance is highly context-dependent, it is advisable to evaluate multiple approaches on the specific datasets under study. Several metrics have been developed for this purpose to assess integration quality, including batch mixing efficiency and potential overcorrection, an undesirable effect that can mask genuine biological differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">Recently, Song et al. introduced the BENGAL pipeline, a three-step framework developed for cross-species integration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. In the first step, homologous genes are selected across datasets, using either one-to-one orthologs (O2O) or expanded sets that include one-to-many and many-to-many orthologs, selected based on average expression levels (HE) or homology confidence (HHC). In the second step, 9 integration algorithms - scVI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, scANVI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, scanorama<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, harmony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, Seurat RPCA and CCA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, LIGER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, LIGER UINMF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, fastMNN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> - are applied, generating a total of 27 integrated datasets. In the third step, the quality of integration is evaluated using batch-mixing and biology preservation metrics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">To understand similarities and differences in elastic artery atherosclerosis across species, we applied the BENGAL pipeline to the scRNA-seq datasets from human carotid, pig abdominal aorta, and mouse brachiocephalic artery plaques. UMAP representations of the 27 integrated and 3 unintegrated homology-matched datasets are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>. RPCA, CCA, scVI, and scANVI integration algorithms demonstrated the best overall performance based on a composite score of batch mixing and biology conservation metrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). RPCA and CCA provided slightly better mixing, while scVI and scANVI achieved higher biology preservation metrics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The 12 highest-performing integrated datasets - generated using the 4 top-performing algorithms and the 3 gene homology strategies - were subsequently clustered using the bluster R package, which identifies stable clusters through permutation-based robustness testing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1F</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Cluster labels were assigned based on the dominant contributing cluster from the individual species datasets. The relative species contribution to stable clusters was then analyzed using random subsampling of 1500 cells per species, omitting small clusters with less than 50 sampled cells. A cluster was considered enriched for one species if ≥80% of its cells originated from that species, or for two species if those species together contributed ≥90% of cells. Enrichment was considered robust if reproduced in ≥6 of the 12 integrated datasets. Two representative examples showing shared and species-enriched clusters are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, with additional results shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>, and a summary of findings below.</p><p id="P15">In all 12 integrated datasets, the majority of cells (median 77.1%, interquartile range (IQR) 65.0-89.8%) were assigned to shared clusters. The DLX5_Cell cluster was consistently enriched for human cells (median 95.9%, IQR 83.6-99.7%, in 8 integrations); minor mouse cell contributions were observed in scVI-based integrations, including the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, but this was not replicated by other algorithms. The pericyte cluster was highly enriched for human and pig cells (median 99.0%, IQR 94.5-100%, in 10 integrations). In contrast, a stable cluster at the tip of the terminal cells was dominated by mouse cells (median 92.3%, IQR 84.0-97.7%, in 6 integrations), while mouse cells were underrepresented in a cluster at the contractile end of the central axis (median 94.1%, IQR 94.9-100% human and pig cells, in 6 integrations).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Transcriptional profiles of shared and species-specific plaque mesenchymal cells from elastic arteries</title><p id="P16">To analyze the transcriptome of the shared and species-enriched mesenchymal cell populations, we transferred cluster labels back to the individual mouse, pig, and human datasets, assigning cells to a given species-enriched cluster if they consistently belonged to that cluster in ≥4 integrated datasets. The remaining cells were defined as shared. They were re-clustered in the integrated dataset (using HE RPCA as a representative integration) into contractile, intermediate, and terminal cells before labels were transferred, which also resolved a small, shared population of proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>).</p><p id="P17">The shared contractile cells were characterized by expression of canonical SMC markers (e.g., <italic>MYH11, CNN1, ACTA2, ITGA8</italic>), and enrichment of pathways (Gene Ontology) related to contractility (e.g., <italic>Actin filament organization, Actomyosin structure</italic>), but also <italic>Cell adhesion</italic>, and <italic>Wound healing</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-C</xref>). Notably, the shared intermediate cluster lacked strong marker genes that distinguished it from terminal cells, suggesting the absence of a distinct, conserved transitional cell state across species.

In contrast, DLX5_Cells, pericytes, and the terminal mouse-enriched cluster were truly species-<italic>specific</italic> populations, either absent or very rare in other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Human-specific DLX5_Cells were marked by expression of the embryonic contractile gene <italic>MYH10</italic> and genes associated with neural crest cell fates (e.g. <italic>DLX5, MSX2, PDGFRA</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and were enriched for gene sets related to bone development (e.g. <italic>Ossification, Osteoblast differentiation</italic>), among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, D</xref>). This cluster comprised, on average, 9% of mesenchymal cells in carotid plaques, but was present in only 3 out of 6 carotid plaque scRNA-seq datasets (data not shown). The human/pig-specific pericytes, comprising 6% and 3% of mesenchymal cells in human and pig plaques, respectively, expressed known pericyte markers (<italic>GJA4, PGF, RGS16</italic>), and their expressed genes were enriched in categories such as <italic>Artery morphogenesis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, D</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Their species specificity likely reflects the absence - or minimal presence - of plaque neovascularization in mouse models of atherosclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Finally, the mouse-specific terminal cell cluster, representing 7% of mesenchymal cells in mouse plaques, exhibited a highly distinct chondrocyte-like transcriptional profile.

Previous scRNA-seq studies comparing mouse and human lesions have addressed this for plaque macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup> and adaptive immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. In the present study, we extend this comparative approach to mesenchymal cell populations. Furthermore, we incorporate porcine atherosclerosis, which despite its close anatomical and pathological resemblance to human atherosclerosis, has not previously been analysed for mesenchymal cell diversity. We identify a conserved core of mesenchymal cell diversity present across species and vascular beds, as well as mesenchymal cell populations unique to specific contexts. Some, such as DLX5 or RERGL-expressing SMCs, are found only in human carotid or coronary atherosclerosis and not in experimental models. Conversely, <italic>Col2a1</italic>-expressing chondrocyte-like cells are present in mouse lesions but absent from advanced human carotid or coronary plaques. Recognizing these similarities and differences is essential for accurately interpreting murine and porcine studies of plaque mesenchymal cells.</p><p id="P40">A key feature of our approach is the use of consensus across multiple integration and gene homology strategies. While many studies rely on a single integration method to infer overlap in cell types between mouse and human plaques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, our analysis shows that different methods yield differing results. Using the BENGAL pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, we performed 9 data integrations and applied 3 gene homology-matching approaches, basing our conclusions on agreement among at least half of the 12 best-performing method combinations. In addition, because cluster number is subject to analyst choice, we used cluster stability metrics to select the most robust resolution.</p><p id="P41">Some of the observed differences in plaque mesenchymal cells between pig and human coronary atherosclerosis may reflect differences in lesion stage or disease activity. The <italic>VEGFA</italic>-expressing cells that were found in porcine lesions appeared to transiently populate the regions of pathological intimal thickenings destined to convert into necrotic core(s). This is consistent with <italic>VEGFA</italic> being downstream of hypoxia and with hypoxia acting as a causal driver of necrotic core formation in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. It is understandable that similar widespread hypoxic areas will be less prevalent in advanced human lesions, where hypoxic areas may have already resolved through neovessel formation or necrosis. Similarly, the increased prevalence of <italic>CD74-</italic>expressing cells may reflect the high inflammatory activity of accelerated porcine atherosclerosis compared with coronary atherosclerotic lesions from heart transplant patients, who are likely under medical therapy to lower atherosclerotic disease activity. Indeed, CD74+ mesenchymal cells have also been described in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>, and CD74 was recently implicated causally in murine atherogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. More scRNA-seq data at different stages and levels of disease activity are needed to fully clarify this.</p><p id="P42">Our cross-species comparison of atherosclerosis in major elastic arteries also involved differences in anatomical location. This could be seen as a limitation if the goal was to isolate the pure effect of species biology. SMCs vary in embryonic origin across the arterial tree<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>, and because the transition of SMCs in atherosclerosis involves the reactivation of developmental pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>, this may theoretically influence the resulting phenotypes. For example, human DLX5_Cells, bearing a neural crest signature, were found in the neural crest-derived carotid but not in the second heart field- and epicardial-derived coronary artery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. However, embryonic origin alone cannot explain the absence of DLX5_Cells in the neural crest-derived murine brachiocephalic artery, nor the presence of chondrocyte-like cells in mouse brachiocephalic but not human carotid plaques. Importantly, translational research must contend with the fact that clinically important arterial sites for human atherosclerosis cannot always be studied in experimental models. For example, pigs lack a proper carotid bifurcation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>, the predilection site of human carotid atherosclerosis, and mouse coronary arteries are small and mostly intra-myocardial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>. Therefore, using porcine and murine models to understand human carotid or coronary atherosclerosis, respectively, necessarily involves extrapolating across vascular sites.</p><p id="P43">Arguably, the most salient finding of our analysis is that the majority of mesenchymal cells belonged to shared clusters: cell types present in all analyzed plaques, irrespective of species, disease stage, or anatomical location. This supports the utility of animal models for studying key aspects of mesenchymal cell function in human atherosclerosis. To this end, we provide conserved markers and regulon analysis that may facilitate the flow of information between models and human disease. Nevertheless, two important exceptions warrant mention. First, murine chondrocyte-like cells, often referred to as chondromyocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>, were not detected to any significant extent in porcine or human atherosclerosis. While other mesenchymal phenotypes (e.g., DLX5_Cells) exhibit ossification-related signatures, they are molecularly distinct. Chondroid metaplasia has previously been reported as rare in human coronary atherosclerosis, consistent with our findings, but not uncommon in peripheral artery disease (e.g., femoral plaques)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>. Whether murine chondrocyte-like cells correspond to subtypes of mesenchymal cells in peripheral atherosclerosis remains an open question for future scRNA-seq studies. Second, markers such as VCAM1 and LGALS3, commonly used to define transitional SMC-derived states in mice, cannot be applied equivalently in human or pig lesions. Although comparable contractile and matrix-producing (fibromyocyte-like) states are clearly present across species, our cross-species analysis did not support the existence of a distinct, conserved intermediate cell type. That said, analysis of more data at higher cluster resolution could potentially uncover small, shared populations with such transitional characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Deposited scRNA-seq datasets</title><p id="P44">Murine plaque scRNA-seq data count matrices (GEO GSE150644, 15 <italic>Apoe-/-</italic> mice with lineage tracing of SMC-derived cells, Alencar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

Each of the 12 integrated datasets was clustered using assessment of cluster stability with the bluster R package to find the optimal resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Briefly, we performed 20 iterations using bootstrapping at different resolutions (ranging from 0.1 to 1), assessed the stability of clusters based on the average adjusted Rand index (ARI), and chose the resolution with maximum average ARI and at least 7 clusters for elastic arteries and 6 clusters for coronary arteries. The rationale for the minimum number of clusters was that integrated datasets should have at least the number of mesenchymal cell types observed in the individual species datasets. The final resolution varied for each dataset, resulting in a different number of clusters (8-11) in each integrated dataset.</p><p id="P51">Clusters adopted their names from the major contributor of the individual species dataset to indicate cluster properties. To find species-specific and shared clusters, we calculated the contribution of each species to a cluster and set cutoffs as follows. In elastic arteries, a stable cluster was species-specific if one species contributed ≥80% or two species contributed ≥90% (equivalent to one species contributing &lt;10%) of cells in ≥6 integrated datasets. In coronary arteries, the cutoff was defined at 90% in ≥6 integrated datasets, since only two species were analyzed. The proportions were calculated on randomly sampled cells from each species (1500 for elastic and 3600 for coronary arteries). Integrated clusters with ≥50 cells (elastic arteries) or ≥100 cells (coronary arteries) were considered for subsequent analysis. Cells in the individual datasets were categorized as being of a particular species-specific type if they belonged to that species-specific cluster in ≥4 integrated datasets. Cells not meeting that criterion were considered of a shared type. Those cells were separated and re-clustered in the HE_RPCA dataset, and labels were transferred to the individual species datasets. Markers were calculated in merged datasets with the transferred consensus labels using random subsampling of 2500 cells from each individual dataset and Seurat (v4.4.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and R (v4.4.3). Over-representation analysis was performed using the EnrichR R package (v3.2), the GO database, and marker genes identified by the FindAllMarkers() function with arguments min.pct=0.3, only.pos.=TRUE. The enriched categories were ordered by adjusted p-value, only significantly enriched categories are shown (p-value adjusted &lt; 0.05). Conserved markers for shared phenotypes were identified by overlapping lists of gene markers (log2FC &gt; 0.6) from the individual datasets.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data</title><p id="P52">Published bulk RNA-seq datasets of human carotid plaques (GSE120521), mouse atherosclerotic aortas (GSE205929), and pig atherosclerotic aortas (GSE245530) were downloaded as FASTQ files and processed with the “nf-core/rnaseq” pipeline (v3.14.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>.

Activities were binarized to mitigate the context-dependency of AUC scores in individual datasets, and the binarized matrices from both species were merged, preserving all inferred regulons. For regulons that were not found in a species, all cells were assigned an activity of 0. To analyze differences in regulon activity associated with shared mesenchymal cell types, we calculated for each shared cluster (excluding proliferating cells because of its small size) and regulon active ≥30% of cluster cells in ≥1 species the metric (f<sub>h</sub>-f<sub>m</sub>)/(f<sub>h</sub>+f<sub>m</sub>), where f<sub>h/m</sub> is the fraction of cells with the regulon active in human or mouse, respectively.

The cells were clustered at the minimum resolution that separated the adjacent cell clusters, e.g., pericyte and fibroblasts, from the main continuous cell cluster and divided the main cluster into ≥3 cellular subclusters (contractile, intermediate, terminal). The identified cellular subtypes are labeled, and top markers, selected from the top 20 over-expressed genes in each cluster, are shown in the dot plots.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207675-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Identification of shared and species-specific mesenchymal plaque cell types in elastic mouse, pig, and human arteries.</title><p><bold>A</bold>, Combined datasets produced by 9 integration algorithms (or without integration) and 3 methods for gene homology matching between mouse, pig, and human datasets. <bold>B</bold>, Combined score for the integration performance combining 5 metrics for batch mixing and 5 metrics for biological preservation of differences between known cell types.

Most mesenchymal cells form a continuous population in UMAP space, while some cell types/states (e.g., pericytes, DLX5_Cells) are sufficiently distinct to form separate clusters. Cell states that appear to be driven by specific signaling activity in intermediate/terminal cells are shown as side populations.
