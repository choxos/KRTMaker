However, the co-existence of both tumour-promoting and tumour-restraining stromal elements necessitates extensive characterisation of the TME for effective targeting. Fibromuscular cell heterogeneity in PCa remains poorly characterised, in part due to challenges in isolating cells embedded within the desmoplastic stroma. This study therefore aimed to better characterise fibroblast and smooth muscle cell (SMC) populations as the major tissue-resident stromal cell subtypes within the PCa TME.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods</title><p id="P4">A PCa single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset was re-analysed to define fibromuscular subtypes. Due to low fibroblast yields, an optimised tissue dissociation protocol was developed and benchmarked against two commercial kits via flow cytometry, immunostaining of clinical specimens and <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture. Dimensionality reduction and clustering were applied to the CD31<sup>-</sup> stromal fraction using a multiparameter surface marker panel. Annotation of the resulting clusters based on their surface marker profile was supported by integrating scRNA-seq and immuno-histological findings.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Results</title><p id="P5">The optimised protocol yielded over twice the viable cells/mg tissue compared to two commercial kits, preserved surface marker integrity, enhanced successful cultivation of mesenchymal cells and recovered diverse stromal subpopulations from benign and malignant samples. Dimensionality reduction and clustering of flow cytometry counts identified 11 distinct CD31<sup>-</sup> stromal populations. Integration with transcriptomic data and immunofluorescence of clinical specimens identified spatially- and prognostically-distinct fibroblast subtypes, including inflammatory and myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts, pericytes linked to poor prognosis and a novel SMC subset associated with stromal activation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P6">This study presents a robust workflow for improved isolation and characterisation of fibromuscular stromal cells in PCa.

Thus, the tumour microenvironment (TME) is widely considered a promising therapeutic target. The TME however is highly heterogeneous and contains both tumour-suppressive and -promoting cellular entities, which differentially influence prognosis and therapeutic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Pakula et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Prostate interstitial smooth muscle cells (PSMC) are the most abundant cell type in the benign stroma. Beyond their contractile function, PSMC support organ homeostasis and provide a physical barrier that restrains tumour progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Pederzoli et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Thomas et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). In PCa however, PSMC undergo dissociation and secretory activation followed by degeneration and elimination via poorly defined mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Taboga et al., 2008</xref>). Mural cells (vascular SMC (VSMC) and pericytes) in contrast maintain vessel integrity, elasticity and contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Muhl et al., 2020</xref>). During tumour progression however, cancer cells promote pericyte dissociation resulting in vessel leakage, which facilitates invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Pederzoli et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, in response to injury or tumour-derived signals pericytes differentiate into myofibroblasts, VSMC or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Muhl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Murray et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Pederzoli et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Such plasticity is also a hallmark of fibroblasts, which maintain homeostasis in healthy tissues but differentiate into extracellular matrix (ECM)-producing myofibroblasts during wound healing and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Muhl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Pederzoli et al., 2023</xref>). In PCa, fibroblast abundance increases, whereby their activation modulates the TME via paracrine signalling, ECM remodelling and immune regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Pakula et al., 2024</xref>). CAF exhibit a spectrum of interconvertible activation states that are governed by spatial context, biophysical/-chemical properties of the TME, tumour genotype and cellular origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Jenkins et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Pakula et al., 2024</xref>). Antigen-presenting, inflammatory and myofibroblastic CAF (apCAP, iCAF and myCAF, respectively) constitute the three major and functionally-distinct CAF phenotypes identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Galbo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). The prognostic implications of CAF states vary by cancer type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Galbo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Jenkins et al., 2022</xref>). In PCa, iCAF are abundant in PIN and less aggressive tumours, associated with favourable outcome and thus potentially represent an early/less-activated state, whereas myCAF predominate high grade tumours and are associated with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Brunner et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). Given the functional and prognostic implications of CAF heterogeneity and tumour-suppressive action of PSMC, greater characterisation of fibromuscular subpopulations in PCa is critical for the design of therapeutic strategies that specifically target onco-supportive stromal entities and/or maintain tumour-suppressive stromal elements.</p><p id="P10">Efficient tissue dissociation is essential when studying cellular heterogeneity, even in the spatial era since cell annotation remains reliant on reference single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets due to the limited depth and gene coverage of current spatial platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Gulati et al., 2025</xref>). Fibroblasts are frequently underrepresented in public scRNA-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Lendahl et al., 2022</xref>) underscoring the challenge in isolating tissue-resident cells, particularly from desmoplastic tissues, such as PCa. Whilst explant outgrowth permits primary fibroblast isolation, this approach may favour migratory subtypes and induce myofibroblastic traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Waise et al., 2019</xref>). Optimising mechano-enzymatic tissue dissociation may reduce this selection bias and permit more representative sampling of <italic>in vivo</italic> stromal diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Henry et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, pre-clinical evaluation of drug efficacy increasingly employs three-dimensional organoid models, whereby inclusion of the stromal component is deemed critical for meaningful translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Richards et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, robust tissue dissociation protocols to recover ECM-embedded cell populations are required for diverse applications and unbiased TME characterisation.</p><p id="P11">We present a tissue dissociation protocol that significantly improves isolation of stromal cell types from small prostate specimens and demonstrate that stromal composition differs between benign and malignant tissues. Using a multimodal approach, we identify and recover multiple fibroblast cell subpopulations from the prostate TME, including a myCAF population associated with poor outcome and an iCAF population linked to favourable prognosis. Further, we characterise prostatic mural and SMC subtypes, identifying a prognostically-relevant pericyte population and dedifferentiated PSMC that were enriched in activated tissues. Data presented herein enhance our understanding of fibromuscular heterogeneity within the prostate TME and may facilitate the future discovery of novel stromal-specific therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material &amp; Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Reagents</title><p id="P12">All reagents were from Sigma Aldrich (Vienna, Austria) unless otherwise specified.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p id="P13">The 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville, MD), STR validated and maintained according to the distributor’s instructions.

Cells were gated based on size and viability stain (FSC-A/7-AAD) to exclude debris and dead cells. After doublet removal (FSC-A/FSC-H), single viable cells were used to identify leukocytes (CD45), epithelial cells (non-basal: CD326<sup>+</sup>PDPN<sup>-</sup> and basal: CD326<sup>+</sup>PDPN<sup>+</sup>) and endothelial cells (non-lymphatic: CD31<sup>+</sup>PDPN<sup>-</sup> and lymphatic: CD31<sup>+</sup>PDPN<sup>+</sup>). Cells not expressing any of these markers were classified as CD31<sup>-</sup> stroma and used for further analysis of stromal subpopulations. Gates for individual stromal markers were set using unstained and FMO samples. To account for differences in tissue input and overall yield, absolute cell counts per mg of tissue were calculated for each population, enabling direct comparison of isolation efficiency across dissociation protocols. Accordingly, FC analyses are reported as counts per mg of tissue or as percentages of total counts, single viable cells, or parent gates. Absolute numbers were not reported as total cell counts varied greatly between samples and protocols.</p><p id="P23">For the eight patient-matched cohort, histopathologically-validated matched benign (BE = 12) and tumour (CA = 8) samples from eight patients were labelled with keywords for identification and annotation. The CD31<sup>-</sup> stromal counts from all twenty samples were concatenated into a single file retaining the original sample keywords. No downsampling was applied to avoid data loss and preserve rare stromal subpopulations that may not be equally represented across all samples. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (tSNE) option in FlowJo™ based on five stromal markers (MCAM, CD140b, CD90, PDPN, FAP). CD140a and CD105 were excluded since they were expressed in less than 5% (median) of the CD31<sup>-</sup> stroma and their minimal and inconsistent expression introduced noise, fragmenting the data into small, likely artefactual clusters. The learning configuration was set to auto (opt-SNE), with 1000 iterations, a perplexity of 30, and a learning rate set to 1/12 of the count of the concatenated file. The Exact (vantage point tree) KNN algorithm and the FFT Interpolation (FIt-SNE) gradient algorithm were used. Putative subclusters were calculated with XShift based on five stromal markers (MCAM, CD140b, CD90, PDPN, FAP), using 500 as the number of nearest neighbours (K), the Euclidean distance metric, a subsampling limit of 10^5, and an auto Run ID. To maintain consistency and prevent overclustering, CD140a and CD105 were also excluded in this step, following the same rationale as in the tSNE analysis. Identified clusters were viewed using ClusterExplorer and manual gating. Of the eight patients, the patient 2 BE2 punch was not included in the eight patient-matched cohort but instead used as an FMO control.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent staining of archived tissue</title><p id="P24">For immunohistochemistry, 2 μm FFPE tissue sections were stained using a Ventana Benchmark Ultra automated staining device (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Vienna, Austria) with the antibodies listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp.Table 3</xref>.

Partial co-expression of CD90 in SMA<sup>+</sup> PSMC, which co-expressed MCAM and CD140b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A-B</xref>), further supported annotation of cluster 6 as a mix of VSMC2, PSMC and pericytes. The subset of FAP<sup>+</sup> cells within cluster 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>) were considered to denote activated PSMC, which were observed in nests at the tumour front and in activated benign-adjacent tissues, particularly adjacent to glands exhibiting PIN, basal cell hyperplasia or corpora amylacea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). The benign-enriched cluster 9 co-expressed PDPN, MCAM and CD140b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6K, M</xref>, P). While basal epithelial cells and lymphatic vessels express PDPN, these cells lack MCAM and CD140b. Rather, the PDPN<sup>+</sup>MCAM<sup>+</sup>CD140b<sup>+</sup> profile of cluster 9 was strikingly similar to PSMC within the fibrotic stroma of benign hyperplastic nodules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig. 7B-C</xref>).</p><p id="P76">Cluster 11 displayed a PDPN<sup>-</sup>/CD140a<sup>-</sup>/FAP<sup>-</sup>/MCAM<sup>-</sup>/CD140b<sup>+</sup>/CD90<sup>+</sup> profile and was abundant in both benign and malignant samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6J-P</xref>). Beyond the aforementioned expression of CD90<sup>+</sup>SMA<sup>+</sup>cells in small vessels and PSMC (cluster 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6P</xref> and 7A), CD90 was also detected in SMA<sup>-</sup> cells exhibiting an elongated fibroblast-like morphology adjacent to epithelial glands and along SMC bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>) similar to previously reported “wrapping” interstitial fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Joseph et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Peng et al., 2013</xref>).

A subset of cells additionally expressed MCAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6P</xref>). Whilst the MCAM<sup>-</sup> fraction (57.2% of cluster 7) largely lacked FAP and CD105 expression consistent with an early-activated fibroblast phenotype, the MCAM<sup>+</sup> fraction (42.9% of cluster 7) displayed a greater abundance of FAP<sup>+</sup> cells (23.4%), &gt;90% of which co-expressed CD105 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E, P</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig. 6J</xref>). Immunofluorescent staining revealed the presence of MCAM<sup>+</sup>FAP<sup>+</sup>CD105<sup>+</sup> cells surrounding small vessels lacking a multi-layered vascular wall (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig. 7E</xref>) implying cluster 7 may harbour a pericyte subset consistent with reports that CD140a<sup>+</sup>CD140b<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> pericytes can express PDPN, FAP and CD105 under inflammatory and tumourigenic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Cimini and Kishore, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Ebert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Rivera and Brekken, 2011</xref>). The MCAM<sup>+</sup>FAP<sup>-</sup> fraction (74.7%) comprised both CD105-positive and -negative cells (30.0% and 44.7%, respectively) whose identity could not be discerned with confidence. It may be noted however that some non-vessel-associated FAP<sup>-</sup>CD105<sup>+</sup> cells expressed the PSMC/mural cell marker MCAM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig. 7D</xref>) potentially suggestive of SMC-/pericyte-derived myCAF or myofibroblasts as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Gao et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Hosaka et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P78">The remaining gated clusters 1, 2, 8 and 4+12 were MCAM<sup>-</sup>/PDPN<sup>+</sup> indicative of activated fibroblasts in accordance with our scRNA-seq analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Henry et al., 2018</xref>). The minor subpopulation cluster 4+12 however expressed only PDPN and could not be unequivocally annotated since non-stromal PDPN<sup>+</sup> entities, such as peripheral neurons, basal EpiC and LEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6P</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig. 7B-C</xref>), would also be expected to be negative for other stromal FC panel markers. Cluster 1, 2 and 8 were FAP<sup>+</sup> further supporting their annotation as activated fibroblast subpopulations, whereby clusters 1 and 8 also expressed CD140b but differentially expressed CD90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6M, P</xref>). Cluster 1 represented a minor subpopulation primarily isolated from the benign sample of patient 1 and lacked CD90 expression implying cluster 1 may denote fibroblasts at an early stage of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6J, P</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">True et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, the CD90<sup>+</sup> cluster 8 constituted an abundant subcluster isolated at comparable frequency from benign and malignant cores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6H, J-L, O-P</xref>) and exhibited a surface marker profile similar to CAF-S5, whose lack of contractile markers (SMA, TAGLN and TPM2) but expression of <italic>C3</italic> and <italic>C7</italic> and localization distal to tumour glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Mathieson et al., 2024</xref>), were highly reminiscent of subcluster F3/iCAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig. 1F-G and Supp. Fig. 2</xref>).

Cluster 8 was thus considered to represent iCAF. In line with these annotations, both cluster 1 and 8 lacked the myCAF marker CD105 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6P</xref>). Moreover, FAP<sup>+</sup> or CD140b<sup>+</sup> cells with an elongated fibroblast-like morphology and that lacked co-expression of the PSMC markers MCAM/SMA and myCAF marker CD105 were observed in benign and malignant tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). Robust expression of CD105 however in cluster 2 together with its PDPN<sup>+</sup>/FAP<sup>+</sup> status and enrichment in malignant samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6O-P</xref>) suggested this cluster represented myCAF.

Due to underrepresentation of fibroblasts in this and other publicly available PCa scRNA-seq datasets, we developed an optimised tissue dissociation protocol as a resource for future studies. Compared to two commercial kits, this protocol significantly improved recovery of tissue-resident populations, preserved expression of key fibromuscular cell surface markers and enhanced viable stromal cell isolation revealing differences in stromal composition between benign and malignant tissues and enabling FC-based identification of thirteen distinct stromal clusters. By integrating data from scRNA-seq and FC with immunofluorescence, clusters were annotated as distinct SMC/mural cell and fibroblast subtypes, highlighting the utility of combining orthogonal approaches for profiling heterogeneity of the benign and malignant prostate microenvironment.</p><p id="P82">Underrepresentation of the fibroblast component in many (PCa) scRNA-seq datasets is an acknowledged limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Aparicio et al., 2025</xref>) that most likely arises from incomplete release of these ECM-embedded cells, and represented our primary motivation to optimise tissue dissociation as the fundamental step upon which downstream single cell analyses of tissue heterogeneity are based. The dissociation protocol reported here was optimised with respect to the basal digestion buffer, digestion cocktail composition and downstream processing steps. Compared to two commercial formulations and published protocols that employ fewer enzymes and processing steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Costa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Dominguez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Eich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Quatromoni et al., 2015</xref>), the resulting protocol significantly improved viable stromal cell yield and preserved widely employed stromal cell surface markers. Importantly, all pre- and post-digestion steps were performed on ice, with digestion time limited to ≤one hour to minimise dissociation/stress-induced changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Denisenko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Reichard and Asosingh, 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P83">While optimised on benign prostate specimens, the protocol was also effective in dissociating the desmoplastic stroma of PCa tissues. Indeed, FC identified population shifts consistent with tumourigenic hallmarks, including increased endothelial content concordant with tumour neovascularisation, reduced isolation of basal epithelial cells in line with basal cell loss in tumourigenic glands, decreased leukocyte abundance consistent with the immunologically “cold” status of PCa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Brea and Yu, 2025</xref>) and enrichment of myCAF/FC cluster 2 in malignant samples. Importantly, our protocol was optimised on small tissue punches, making it suitable not only for cell extraction from primary tumour biopsies but potentially also from soft tissue metastases offering the possibility for clinical exploitation, for example longitudinal tracking for evaluation of therapy response or risk stratification based on stromal subtypes as well as diverse technical and patient-specific primary cell-based applications, such as <italic>ex vivo</italic> drug screening, generation of patient-derived organoids, tissue engineering, progenitor or stem cell therapies, and single-cell multi-omics. Pilot studies using lung cancer specimens similarly improved recovery of tissue-resident cells with intact cell surface marker profiles over existing procedures (data not shown) suggesting our dissociation protocol is potentially of broad applicability.</p><p id="P84">Due to the absence of unique surface markers for fibroblasts, SMC and mural cells, the FC panel employed combinations of commonly used surface antigens to identify the major prostate cell types and stromal subpopulations recovered. While scRNA-seq of optimally dissociated tissue samples is required for definitive cluster identification, integration with existing scRNA-seq data and immunofluorescent staining enabled annotation of several clusters. Concordant with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Henry et al., 2018</xref>), PDPN and MCAM successfully delineated fibroblast-rich clusters (1, 2, 7, 8) from SMC/mural cells (clusters 6, 11, 10+15), similar to <italic>PDGFRA/MCAM-</italic>based stratification of F and M scRNA-seq clusters. PDPN/MCAM co-expression in FC cluster 9 however constituted a noted exception but was consistent with tissue-based detection of PDPN in PSMC within the fibrotic stroma of benign hyperplastic nodules. Some transcriptionally-defined subpopulations (e.g. proto-myCAF F4 and VSMC/PSMC/pericytes) were less clearly resolved by the surface marker FC panel reflecting their shared lineage and stromal cell plasticity. Discrepancies between transcriptomic and surface marker expression in FC and IF (e.g. <italic>PDGFRA</italic>/CD140a) additionally highlight the challenges in surface marker-based resolution of closely-related stromal cell phenotypes. Future iterations will aim to include additional markers to improve resolution of fibromuscular cell subtypes as well as other cell types e.g. immune cell subsets, to investigate the impact of stromal cell subtypes on immune infiltrates and/or determine how tumour cell genotype influences TME composition. However, the current FC panel represents a strong foundation for stromal characterisation with the potential to evolve into a standalone tool for comprehensive evaluation of cellular heterogeneity of the prostate TME.</p><p id="P85">Although well established that tumour-associated remodelling of SMC and mural cells exerts clinically-relevant effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Pederzoli et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Taboga et al., 2008</xref>), they remain poorly characterised at the molecular level. Within our datasets we identified PSMC and dPSMC as well as two VSMC subtypes and pericytes, whose gene signature correlated with poor prognosis possibly reflecting stabilisation of the tumour vasculature and/or their contribution to the CAF pool via phenotypic switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Hosaka et al., 2016</xref>). FAP<sup>+</sup> PSMC identified via immunofluorescence in activated benign-adjacent tissues were highly reminiscent of the FAP<sup>+</sup> subpopulation within FC cluster 6. <italic>FAP</italic> was poorly represented in the scRNA-seq dataset and the current gating strategy did not stratify marker expression levels e.g. decreased MCAM in dPSMC.

Due to the lack of a unique pan-fibroblast surface marker, these cells could not be unequivocally identified via FC or immunofluorescence. However, given the quiescent nature of benign (non-activated) fibroblasts, as supported by the low number of differentially-expressed genes in subclusters F1/F2, it is plausible that they were represented by one or more of the non-annotated FC clusters (e.g. PDPN<sup>+</sup>MCAM<sup>-</sup> FC cluster 4+12 and/or non-gated cluster 13+14). Following injury and in fibrotic and cancerous tissues, fibroblasts progress along an activation trajectory comprising an initial pro-inflammatory state that culminates in an ECM-producing myofibroblastic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Pederzoli et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Wietecha et al., 2023</xref>). Again, the lack of unique surface markers makes delineating these fibroblast substates a significant challenge.

Furthermore, high expression of androgen signalling-related genes <italic>PAGE4</italic> and <italic>SRD5A1</italic> in scRNA-seq cluster F3 implies tissue-specific features of prostate iCAF, which as reported recently by us, may further underlie their positive prognostic association as stromal AR suppresses PCa progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Brunner et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Liu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P88">The myCAF-annotated scRNA-seq cluster F5/FC cluster 2 expressed canonical myCAF markers, in particular FAP and CD105 (ENG), which constituted part of a previously reported prostate CAFÉ (<italic>CTHRC1/ASPN/FAP/ENG</italic>) CAF signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">Wong et al., 2022</xref>) with CD105<sup>+</sup> CAF shown to promote differentiation to the aggressive neuroendocrine state and resistance to AR signalling inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Kato et al., 2019</xref>).
