HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the <italic>HTT</italic> gene, and the rate of somatic expansion of this CAG repeat throughout life is now known to drive the age of onset and rate of disease progression. As the CAG repeat expands, the extent to which the <italic>HTT</italic> mRNA is alternatively processed to generate the <italic>HTT1a</italic> transcript and highly aggregation-prone and pathogenic HTT1a protein increases. Several HTT-lowering modalities have entered clinical trials that either target both <italic>HTT</italic> and <italic>HTT1a</italic> together, or full-length <italic>HTT</italic> alone. We have developed siRNAs that target the <italic>HTT1a</italic> mouse transcript (634/486) and used these, together with a potent <italic>Htt</italic>-targeting siRNA (10150) to compare the efficacy of lowering either full-length <italic>Htt</italic> or <italic>Htt1a</italic>. zQ175 and wild-type mice were treated with 10150 or 634/486 alongside control groups at 2 months of age with treatment to 6 or 10 months, or at 6 months with treatment to 10 months. The siRNA potency and durability were most effective in the hippocampus. Whilst both strategies showed benefits, despite the greater potency of 10150, targeting <italic>Htt1a</italic> was more effective at delaying HTT aggregation and transcriptional dysregulation than targeting full-length <italic>Htt</italic>. These data support HTT-lowering strategies that are designed to target the <italic>HTT1a</italic> transcript, either alone, or together with lowering full-length <italic>HTT</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Huntington’s disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that manifests with motor abnormalities, psychiatric disturbances and cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). It is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene (<italic>HTT</italic>) that is translated to an extra-long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the huntingtin protein (HTT). For CAG repeats, as measured in blood, individuals with (CAG)<sub>35</sub> or less will remain unaffected, (CAG)<sub>36</sub> is a pathogenic repeat length and approximately (CAG)<sub>60</sub> or more will result in disease onset in childhood or adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). CAG repeats in the mutant range expand throughout life in specific cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), reaching several hundred CAGs in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), a phenomenon known as somatic CAG repeat expansion. Neuropathologically, HTT aggregates are deposited as nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) and synaptic and neuronal loss occurs in the striatum, cortex and other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). There are no disease modifying treatments.</p><p id="P3">Although longer CAG repeats are associated with an earlier age of disease onset, genetic and environmental modifiers also contribute and several genes involved in DNA mismatch repair processes have been identified as genetic modifiers by genome-wide association studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). It had been known for several years that the ablation of selective mismatch repair genes in mouse models of HD prevented somatic CAG repeat expansion from occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that it is the rate of somatic CAG repeat expansion in neurons that drives the age of disease onset and rate of disease progression.</p><p id="P4">In the presence of an expanded CAG repeat, the <italic>HTT</italic> pre-mRNA can be alternatively processed through the activation of cryptic polyadenylation (polyA) sites within intron 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). This occurs at polyA sites 2.7 kb and 7.3 kb into intron 1 for human <italic>HTT</italic> and 680 and 1145 base pairs into intron 1 for mouse <italic>Htt</italic>, generating the <italic>HTT1a</italic> and <italic>Htt1a</italic> transcripts, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). These small transcripts encode the HTT1a protein, which has been shown, through analysis of many model systems, to be highly aggregation-prone and pathogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). The alternative processing of the <italic>HTT</italic> pre-mRNA, to generate <italic>HTT1a</italic>, increases with increasing CAG repeat length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), and, given this relationship, the production of the HTT1a protein may be the mechanism through which somatic CAG repeat expansion exerts its pathogenic consequences.</p><p id="P5">Targeting proximal events in the HD pathogenic cascade provides a rational therapeutic strategy and approaches to lower the levels of <italic>HTT</italic> transcripts are under clinical evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). These include agents that would lower both <italic>HTT</italic> and <italic>HTT1a</italic> e.g. AMT130, a miRNA packaged in adeno-associated virus that targets exon 1 <italic>HTT</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), and V0659, an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that targets CAG repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Agents that only target full-length <italic>HTT</italic> include the ASO tominersen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) and the small molecule splicing modulators branaplam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) and PTC518 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Of these, only tominersen has been evaluated in a phase III clinical trial, which failed to show any benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Here, we have identified siRNAs that target mouse <italic>Htt</italic> intron 1 (634/486) and selectively decrease <italic>Htt1a</italic> levels in the brains of the zQ175 knock-in mouse model. These have been used, together with a potent siRNA that selectively decreases the full-length <italic>Htt</italic> transcript (10150) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), to compare the effects of targeting <italic>Htt1a</italic> or full-length <italic>Htt</italic> on molecular pathogenic phenotypes. We find that, although 10150 was more potent than 634/486, targeting <italic>Htt1a</italic> had a more pronounced effect on delaying HTT aggregation and transcriptional dysregulation.

Wild-type and zQ175 mice were injected bilaterally into the lateral ventricles (ICV) with 20 nmole (10 nmole / ventricle) 10150 or with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at 8 weeks of age and sacrificed at 12 weeks. A QuantiGene multiplex panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) was used to assess the level of full-length <italic>Htt</italic> and <italic>Htt1a</italic> mRNAs in brain regions. Full-length <italic>Htt</italic> was decreased to comparable levels in wild-type and zQ175 animals and to a greater extent in the hippocampus as compared to the striatum, cortex, and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1A</xref>). Reductions in full-length HTT protein were assessed by homogeneous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF) and found to be ~86% in the hippocampus, 74% in the striatum, 69% in the cortex and 45% in the cerebellum of zQ175 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1B</xref>). The decrease in HTT protein was slightly greater than the reduction in mRNA levels, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>).

Given that the 634 siRNA had been more potent than 486 <italic>in vitro</italic>, we opted to test 634 alone (10 nmole / ventricle) and the 634 and 486 siRNAs in combination (5 nmole of each / ventricle) as compared to untreated animals. zQ175 mice were treated by bilateral ICV injection at 8 weeks of age and sacrificed at 12 weeks as before. The use of the siRNAs in combination proved to be more potent than 634 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

Under these denaturing conditions, treatment with 10150 decreased the level of full-length HTT and its proteolytic fragments but HTT1a levels remained the same and were not increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). We considered that the apparent increase in HTT1a could be an artefact of the HTRF assay due to limiting antibody concentrations; upon the removal of full-length HTT, there may have been more antibody available to detect HTT1a. To explore this hypothesis, we immunodepleted full-length HTT by immunoprecipitation with either the MAB5490 or MAB2166 antibody from either wild-type or zQ175 lysates and measured full-length HTT and HTT1a levels by HTRF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

S2B</xref>), however, HTT1a levels were unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2C</xref>). Therefore, the apparent increase in HTT1a in response to HTT depletion upon 10150 treatment was not an artefact of the HTRF assay. We do not yet understand the mechanism for the apparent increase in HTT1a, but do not think that it reflects total HTT1a levels.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>An interventional trial to assess the efficacy of targeting <italic>Htt</italic> or <italic>Htt1a</italic></title><p id="P13">Our <italic>in vivo</italic> pilot data indicated that treatment with 10150 decreased full-length HTT levels by ~70-85% in hippocampus, striatum and cortex. The siRNAs targeting <italic>Htt1a</italic> were less potent, but the combination of 634 and 486 had resulted in a reduction of HTT1a of ~50% in these forebrain regions. Therefore, we designed an interventional study to compare the effects of depleting full-length <italic>Htt</italic> or <italic>Htt1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Treatment was initiated at 2 months of age, prior to the onset of transcriptional and aggregation phenotypes, or at 6 months of age once these phenotypes are well-established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). There were four treatment groups per cohort: untreated, NTS, 10150 (full-length <italic>Htt</italic>) or the 643/486 combination (<italic>Htt1a</italic>) (total of 10 nmole / ventricle). Three cohorts consisted of: treatment at 2 months and sacrificed at 6 months (EARLY); at 2 months, again at 6 months and sacrificed at 10 months (DOUBLE); and at 6 months and sacrificed at 10 months (LATE) (n = 18/gender/treatment group/genotype) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P14">A cohort of wild-type and zQ175 mice was also treated at 2 months of age and sacrificed at 3 months (BASELINE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), to assess the potency of the siRNAs that had been synthesized for the interventional study (n = 7/gender/treatment group/genotype).

The generation of the <italic>HTT1A</italic> transcript presents a likely candidate for the next step, as <italic>HTT1A</italic> levels increase with increasing CAG repeat length and this transcript encodes the highly pathogenic HTT1a protein. We have previously shown that preventing somatic expansion in zQ175 mice, with repeat expansions of ~185 CAGs, had no effect on the striatal HTT aggregation or transcriptional dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Therefore, as expansion beyond (CAG)<sub>185</sub> did not exacerbate these phenotypes, zQ175 mice provide an excellent knock-in model for the preclinical testing of treatments targeting the next step in the pathogenic cascade. Here we have used siRNAs to compare the effects of lowering either the full-length HTT or HTT1a proteins in zQ175 mice. We found that, although less potent, siRNAs targeting <italic>Htt1a</italic> were more effective at delaying HTT aggregation and transcriptional dysregulation phenotypes than an siRNA targeting full-length <italic>Htt</italic>.</p><p id="P31">The greatest effects of 10150 or 634/486 on HTT and HTT1a levels, respectively, occurred in the hippocampus. Treatment with 10150 led to a considerable reduction in the full-length HTT protein whereas the reduction in HTT1a was never greater than 50%. By immunohistochemistry, nuclear aggregation is first detected as a diffuse immunostain throughout the nucleus, which may progress to forming a nuclear inclusion. Treatment with 634/486 from 2 months of age greatly delayed HTT aggregation in the neuronal nuclei of the CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus. Even at 10 months of age, after 8 months of treatment, the level of diffuse aggregation and the presence of nuclear inclusions was extremely low in all three hippocampal regions. These results are in keeping with a model in which HTT1a nucleates HTT aggregation in nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Treatment with 10150 had no effect on nuclear inclusions in the CA1, but interestingly, almost prevented their formation in the CA3 and dentate gyrus, whilst at the same time, the level of diffuse aggregation remained unchanged. Therefore, at least in the CA3 and dentate gyrus, full-length HTT is contributing to the aggregation process in nuclei, and its depletion has slowed the trajectory through diffuse aggregation to the formation of inclusions. The effect of 10150 or 634/486 on transcriptional dysregulation was consistent with the extent to which HTT aggregation in hippocampal nuclei was delayed; treatment with 634/486 delayed the extent to which transcription was dysregulated in zQ175 mice more effectively than 10150, despite the lower potency. Treatment at 6 months of age, once HTT aggregation is well-established, was much less effective and the impact on transcriptional dysregulation was very small.</p><p id="P32">Treatment with either 10150 or 634/486 also resulted in a profound reduction in the number of neuropil aggregates in the CA3 and hilus. In the hilus, these inclusions will have originated from cell bodies in the dentate gyrus, and therefore, the formation of both nuclear and extranuclear inclusions was delayed by targeting full-length HTT or HTT1a in this brain region.</p><p id="P33">These data indicate that the interplay between full-length HTT and HTT1a protein levels in the initiation of HTT aggregation is complex and differs between specific types of neurons. As the CAG repeat increases through somatic expansion, the levels of the HTT1a protein increase, whilst the level of full-length HTT decreases (and consequentially, the levels of proteolytic HTT fragments) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Therefore, the relative concentration of HTT1a and small proteolytic fragments of HTT is dynamic within a neuron and changes as the CAG repeat expands. HTT aggregation is a concentration-dependent process for which the longer the polyQ length, the lower the threshold concentration required for nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), and for a given polyQ length, HTT1a (the exon 1 HTT protein) aggregates faster than other N-terminal HTT fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). We have previously shown that HTT1a and small proteolytic fragments of HTT are lost from the soluble phase of brain lysates as HTT aggregation proceeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). We speculate that both HTT1a and small proteolytic fragments of HTT contribute to HTT aggregation and that full-length HTT levels must be lowered to a greater extent than HTT1a to impact the aggregation process.</p><p id="P34">We have shown that decreasing HTT1a levels is more effective at delaying molecular phenotypes in an HD mouse model than decreasing full-length HTT. These results complement those in a companion study demonstrating that ASOs that lower both <italic>Htt1a</italic> and full-length <italic>Htt</italic> prevented HTT aggregation and transcriptional dysregulation in the <italic>Hdh</italic>Q111 mouse models of HD, whereas those targeting full-length <italic>Htt</italic> alone had no effect (Bragg et al. this issue). Together, these data suggest that it was predominantly the reduction of <italic>Htt1a</italic> and not full-length <italic>Htt</italic> that was responsible for the benefits to a wide range of molecular, physiological and behavioral phenotypes when the expression of the <italic>Htt</italic> gene was decreased through a <italic>lac</italic> repressor strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) or by the AAV delivery of zinc finger proteins coupled to a transcriptional repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>).

The DESeq2 Wald statistic was used to rank genes and a clusterProfiler <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05 was deemed significant. siRNA guide sequences nucleotides 2-8 (designated mer7m8) were used to scan 3’UTRs throughout the transcriptome for potential off-target effects using the R SeedMatchR package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Genes containing &gt; 0 mer7m8 matches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">data file S1</xref>) were excluded from the analysis of restored transcriptional dysregulation described above.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Statistics</title><p id="P49">Data were screened for outliers at sample level using the ROUT test (Q = 1%; GraphPad Prism v9) and outliers were removed from the analysis. All data sets were tested for a normal gaussian distribution (Shapiro-Wilk, Prism v9). Statistical analysis was by one-way ANOVA with either Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> tests. Non-parametric analysis was performed by the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis. Graphs were prepared using Prism v9 (GraphPad Software, California, USA).

A decrease in the expression of the mutant <italic>Htt</italic> gene by ~50% in Q140 mice through the Lac repressor from 2- to 6- and 2- to 12- months of age resulted in a profound reversal of these dysregulated profiles.
