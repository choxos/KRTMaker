to interrogate cellular functions of proteins through “chemical knockdown”. However, matched pairs of protein degraders and inhibitors, that possess high specificity and chemical complementarity, for individual components of the ubiquitin system have remained scarce. This includes reagents to modulate activity and abundance of deubiquitinases (DUBs), which critically regulate ubiquitin-mediated signaling. Here, using an integrated chemical biology approach, we explored the cellular function of the DUB USP7 as a case study comparing inhibition and degradation of this DUB in melanoma and pancreatic cancer cells. Through the synthesis of a degrader library, we identified potent USP7 PROTACs for each cancer type, established BRET-based ternary complex formation and quantified degradation efficiency. USP7 degraders and their cognate inhibitor were subsequently employed to characterize treatment-induced phenotypic alterations. Proteomic and cellular analyses revealed that highly specific degradation of USP7 modulated both shared and distinct protein sets across cancer cell types, without impacting cell growth. Notably, cellular responses to USP7 degradation differed markedly from those to USP7 inhibition. Moreover, our data uncovered broad proteomic and metabolic changes induced by prolonged USP7 inhibitor treatment. Collectively, our work provides a chemical toolbox of comprehensively characterized reagents to distinguish on-target phenotypes which will aid the understanding of the role of USP7 in malignant diseases. More broadly, our data emphasize the importance of increased specificity via PROTAC-mediated degradation and the potential of this modality to distinguish catalytic from non-catalytic as well as cell-line specific functions of DUBs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have emerged as powerful tools for both therapeutic applications and mechanistic biology.

We focused on FT671 and Compound 5, which both feature a hydroxypiperidine core, display high inhibitory potency in vitro and are suitable for cellular use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> To facilitate the streamlined synthesis of USP7 degrader candidate molecules, we devised chimeric inhibitor NK192 which retains the 4-fluorophenyl-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidinone scaffold of FT671 and comprises (R)-3-phenylbutanoic acid as a fluorine-free equivalent of this motif in Compound 5. Chiral NK192 was readily prepared in four steps from commercially available starting materials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 1a</xref>) and retained the high inhibitory potency on USP7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Both FT671 and Compound 5 are highly specific for USP7 when assayed against related human USP family DUBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, yet whether they can potently bind non-DUB proteins had not yet been investigated. We therefore set out to confirm the target specificity of our chimeric USP7 inhibitor NK192 on a proteome-wide scale. Inspection of the crystal structure of USP7 in complex with FT671 revealed that the 4-fluorophenyl group pointed away from the catalytic domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and suggested this site for chemical derivatization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 1b</xref>). By replacing the fluorine with a piperazine linker, we next prepared the biotin-functionalized, NK192-based probe NK264 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) which still potently engaged with USP7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 1c</xref>). To comprehensively assess cellular targets of NK192, we conducted a competitive pulldown experiment. Lysates of Panc89 cells were treated either with DMSO or with a high concentration of NK192 (10 μM, 500x IC<sub>50</sub>), followed by enrichment with NK264-functionalised streptavidin beads and mass spectrometric analysis. Our data revealed that NK192 exhibited very high specificity for USP7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>) as USP7 was the only protein that was significantly competed away from the beads by NK192. These data established NK192 as a suitable, potent and specific ligand for the exploration of USP7 degraders to arrive at a chemically corresponding USP7 inhibitor and degrader pair. Moreover, the biotin probe yielded a functional exit vector in NK192 for the synthesis of bifunctional molecules.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Identification of degraders for USP7 depletion in PDAC and melanoma</title><p id="P13">To arrive at a chemically diverse library of degrader candidate molecules, which would facilitate degradation of USP7 through induced proximity to the VHL E3 ligase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, we employed a modular synthesis approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Starting from a bromo-substituted NK192-equivalent as the USP7 ligand, we appended various mono-protected bifunctional amine-containing heterocycles via Buchwald-Hartwig cross coupling reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, step A). Following cleavage of the protecting groups, building blocks were either directly coupled to VHL ligand-linker conjugates (step B) or were further functionalized with linkers (step C), which were then fused to VHL ligand-linker conjugates (step D). After a first set of USP7 degrader candidates designed with long linear linkers did not yield promising degradation of USP7, we redirected our efforts toward a second-generation library of 15 compounds featuring mostly rigidified linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). We aimed to limit flexibility between both ligands to enhance ternary complex formation and thereby degradation efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Synthesized compounds thus included a diverse set of hetero-, bi- and spiro-cyclic linkers, covering a wide variety of rigidity, geometry and linker length. Molecules comprising sterically demanding cubane and cyclohexyl groups directly adjacent to the VHL ligand building block were motivated by the presence of a hydrophobic pocket in the VHL E3 ligase which can be addressed by a cyclopropyl motif (e.g. in the VHL inhibitor VH298)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Compounds were prepared with defined stereochemistry, purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC and subsequently used in cellular assays (see the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information</xref> for chemical synthesis and compound characterization data).</p><p id="P14">To identify degraders for USP7 depletion in PDAC and melanoma, we treated both Panc89 PDAC and Ma-Mel-47 melanoma cells with compounds for 24 hours and assessed USP7 protein levels by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c-d</xref>). We identified several PROTACs that effectively degraded USP7 in Panc89 cells, including NK225 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>) and NK233. While the degradation efficiency in Ma-Mel-47 was comparably lower, we also identified robust degradation of USP7 by NK225 and NK233. These compounds comprise a trans-configured cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (NK225) or cubane-1,4-dicarboxylic (NK233) as well as a piperazine (NK225) or 4,4’-bipiperidine (NK233). Taken together, these results showed that USP7 PROTACs with different linker geometries facilitated degradation of USP7 with notable efficiency differences between both investigated cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Characterization of two improved USP7 degraders customized to PDAC and melanoma cell lines</title><p id="P15">Encouraged by these results, we set out to further optimize these two degraders. To this end, we added a benzylic (<italic>S)</italic>-methyl group to the VHL ligand, which has previously been shown to improve affinity towards VHL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. This modification resulted in the third-generation PROTACs NK250 (derived from NK225) and NK266 (derived from NK233) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Additionally, we synthesized an NK225-based negative control compound NK245 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), which cannot bind VHL due to an inverted stereocenter at the hydroxyproline. Next, we treated both cell lines with these compounds and assessed USP7 levels by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Both PROTACs NK250 and NK266, but not NK245, showed improved USP7 degradation in both cell lines. Consistently, cyclohexyl-PROTAC NK250 showed more complete degradation in Panc89 cells, whereas cubane-containing PROTAC NK266 showed higher potency in Ma-Mel-47 cells.</p><p id="P16">To carry out an in-depth evaluation of both compounds, we assessed the degradation potency in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Therefore, we treated both Panc89 and Ma-Mel-47 cells for 24 hours with varying compound concentrations. We observed near complete degradation of USP7 with PROTAC NK250 in Panc89 cells already at a PROTAC concentration of 250 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, left), whereas NK266 showed a strong reduction of USP7 levels at higher concentrations of around 500-1000 nM in Ma-Mel-47 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, right). Notably, NK266 also showed similar degradation efficiency as NK250 in Panc89 cells, while NK250 was only able to fully degrade USP7 at 1 μM concentration in Ma-Mel-47 cells after 24 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 2a</xref>). Based on these data, we decided on a concentration of 1 μM compound for all following cell-based experiments and retained the use of NK250 for Panc89 and NK266 for Ma-Mel-47 cells.</p><p id="P17">To probe degradation kinetics, both cell lines were incubated with PROTACs, and USP7 levels were followed over 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Treatment with NK250 resulted in rapid degradation of USP7 in Panc89 cells with protein depletion observed already after 6 hours. In contrast, NK266 showed potent degradation after 16 hours in Ma-Mel-47 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), while the negative control NK245 did not reduce protein levels in both cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 2b</xref>). To confirm the mode of action of our degraders, we performed rescue experiments in which we blocked the degradation machinery involved in VHL-mediated protein depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Consistently, pretreatment of cells with either the NEDDylation inhibitor MLN4924 (which abrogates VHL E3 ligase activity), the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib or a tenfold excess of VHL ligand NK249 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, to block VHL engagement) rescued USP7 degradation. In addition, we confirmed USP7 degradation by immune fluorescence imaging in Panc89 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). We detected a signal for USP7 predominantly localized to the nucleus, consistent with literature on USP7 localization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, which was strongly reduced after treatment with NK250. Together, these data demonstrated potent depletion of USP7 by the PROTACs NK250 and NK266 and confirm their mode of action as Cullin-Ring-E3 ligase (CRL)-dependent degraders.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Quantitative assessments of USP7 degradation efficiency and PROTAC-mediated ternary complex formation</title><p id="P18">We next aimed to quantitatively investigate the mechanism driving their distinct degradation kinetics. We first established an additional orthogonal approach to measure cellular degradation efficiencies based on the HiBiT technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> To this end, we created an MV4-11 cell line which stably expresses N-terminally HiBiT-tagged USP7.

Indeed, when various PDAC and melanoma cell lines were treated with USP7 modulators, we observed a strong switch in the cell culture media color for the inhibitor-treated, but not for the degrader-treated samples. In line with the inhibitor-induced proteomic dysregulation observed after 3 days in both cell lines, these data pointed towards distinct phenotypic effects. To investigate this disparity systematically, we treated Panc89 cells with 1-10 μM of USP7 inhibitors FT671, NK192 and the PROTAC NK250 in standard complete DMEM medium containing either 25 mM (“high glucose”) or 5 mM (“low glucose”) D-glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). In addition, cell growth was recorded after 72 h which was not affected in all conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 6a</xref>). Interestingly, the color change of the media occurred only in high glucose cell culture media, but not in low glucose media, indicating an acidification by increased nutrient consumption of inhibitor-treated cells.

These data indicated a higher glucose dependency or glucose consumption only due to inhibitor treatment.</p><p id="P28">To further dissect this inhibitor-induced effect, we quantified cellular oxygen consumption rates (OCR) by seahorse assays. Whereas a degrader-mediated effect on OCR was much smaller and plateaued already at low doses where USP7 was fully degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 6f-g</xref>), USP7 inhibitors facilitated a persistent reduction of mitochondrial OCR in a dose-dependent manner. In both FT671- and NK192-treated cells, the basal respiration rate measured in confluence-adjusted OCR dropped far below 200 pmol/min/confluence in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 6f-g</xref>). This reduced capacity of ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation is consistent with a more anaerobic glucose metabolism in inhibitor-treated cells. This metabolic switch in turn explains the glucose-dependent acidification seen in culture medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>), whereas specific USP7 degradation upon PROTAC treatment in both PDAC and melanoma cells, through retained respiration capacity, did not induce glucose-dependency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Fig. 6f</xref>). Taken together, these data highlighted the value of highly specific USP7 degraders for distinguishing genuinely on-target USP7-mediated effects from possibly non-specific, metabolic phenotypes induced even by well-characterized inhibitors. These findings thus have important implications for the cellular use of USP7 inhibitors FT671 and NK192 under low glucose conditions or with prolonged treatment times.
