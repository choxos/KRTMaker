Aurora B-dependent phosphorylation of Thr210 has been reported, but other evidence identified a strict requirement for the Aurora A partner Bora for Thr210 phosphorylation. Here, we investigate the elusive mechanistic basis for this requirement. We show that Aurora A:Bora phosphorylates Thr210 of PLK1 in vitro, while Aurora A, other Aurora A:activator complexes, and Aurora B:INCENP fail to target T210 even at high kinase/substrate ratios. A transient interaction of Bora and PLK1, identified by structural modelling and probed mutationally, is uniquely required for Thr210 phosphorylation. Dependency on Bora for Thr210 phosphorylation is eliminated after mutating Lys208, in the Aurora consensus, into arginine. This conservative mutation turns PLK1 into an excellent substrate of nearly all tested active Aurora kinases, especially Aurora B. Collectively, these results shine a new light on the specificity of the PLK1 activation mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PLK1</kwd><kwd>Polo</kwd><kwd>Aurora</kwd><kwd>Bora</kwd><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>polo-box-domain</kwd><kwd>kinase</kwd><kwd>cell division</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The spatial and temporal orchestration of a cell’s entry into mitosis reflects the ordered activation of several master mitotic serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinases, including cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), Aurora A and B, and Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Besides reciprocally controlling their own activation and the activity of several downstream targets, these kinases are also embedded in a regulated network of protein phosphatases, including different forms of the protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A, respectively)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P4">To reach full activity, many protein kinases require post-translational phosphorylation of their activation loop (or T-loop) either by a distinct trans-activating kinase or by auto-phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). The phosphate group, typically attached to a threonine or serine residue, interacts with positively charged amino acids to induce conformational changes in the kinase that stabilize its active conformation. This consists of an inward (or “DFG-in”, where DFG stands for aspartate-phenylalanine-glycine) conformation of the activation loop that is ideally suited for substrate binding and phosphotransfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). This activation mechanism has a prominent role in the temporal and spatial control of kinase activity. A full comprehension of its regulation is therefore a crucial aspect of dissecting how the activity of protein kinases is controlled in their specific biological context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).</p><p id="P5">PLK1 activity is required for the success of several distinct events occurring predominantly between the G2 phase and the subsequent M and G1 phases, and that include, among several others, nuclear envelope breakdown, centrosome maturation and spindle assembly, chromosome bi-orientation, cytokinesis, as well as the deposition of the specialized centromere histone CENP-A in early G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). In G2, PLK1 becomes progressively activated through phosphorylation of Thr210 (in human PLK1) on the activation loop by trans-activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). PLK1 then promotes mitotic entry by activating Cell Division Cycle 25 (CDC25), which dephosphorylates and activates the master regulator of mitosis, Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).</p><p id="P6">PLK1 phosphorylates target motifs matching the consensus sequence [D/N/E]-X-[<bold>S/T</bold>]-[I/L/M/V/F/W/Y] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). This substrate preference likely explains why PLK1 is unable to autophosphorylate on Thr210, a residue embedded in a sequence motif that is typically targeted by basophilic kinases of the AGC group, which includes Protein Kinase A, and closely related members such as the Aurora kinase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). The activation segments of Aurora A and B kinases share high sequence similarity to that of PLK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), and these basophilic kinases can auto-activate through phosphorylation on T288 and T232, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Both Aurora A and Aurora B have been proposed to phosphorylate PLK1 on Thr210 to activate it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Aurora B has been implicated in PLK1 activation in the model organism <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Evidence of an Aurora B involvement in PLK1 activation in other organisms, however, remains limited. Conversely, there is ample evidence of a ubiquitous role of Aurora A in PLK1 activation in late G2 phase as well as in maintaining PLK1 activation during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Aurora A promotes PLK1 activation in complex with the protein cofactor Bora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Bona fide activators of Aurora A, such as TPX2 and CEP192, contain unfolded segments that bind the kinase’s N-terminal lobe to stabilize the active, inward conformation of the activation loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). A similar mechanism leads to activation of Aurora B by the IN-box segment of INCENP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Bora’s intrinsic disorder and recognizable sequence similarities with TPX2 led to propose that it may activate Aurora A through a structural mechanism reminiscent of that of other Aurora A activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Besides interacting with Aurora A’s kinase domain, Bora also interacts with PLK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Phosphorylation of Ser252 of human Bora (hBora) by CDK1 promotes this interaction with the polobox domain of PLK1 (PBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). The PBD is believed to stabilize an autoinhibited conformation of PLK1. Its engagement through a phosphopeptide has been proposed to relieve auto-inhibition and also to promote phosphorylation of the PLK1 activation loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Binding of the PLK1 PBD to pSer252 of Bora, however, is not required for Thr210 phosphorylation, which proceeds normally on the isolated kinase domain of PLK1 in the absence of the PBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Moreover, Bora1-224, a minimal Bora fragment lacking the PLK1 docking site but still capable of interacting with Aurora A, remains proficient in PLK1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). PLK1 binding to Ser252 is instead involved in partial degradation of Bora at the onset of mitosis through b β-TrCP(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). More recent studies have implicated phosphorylation of Ser252 in PLK1 dimerization and its controlled activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Another way in which CDK activity regulates Bora towards PLK1 is through phosphorylation of Ser112 of Bora. After phosphorylation, this residue can act in trans as mimic of Aurora A Thr288 phosphorylation, activating the dephosphorylated kinase and even bypassing the deleterious effects on Aurora A activity resulting from mutating Thr288 into valine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Mutation of Ser112 to a non-phosphorylatable residue also prevents timely mitotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), indicating that its phosphorylation enables exquisite control of the Aurora A:Bora complex by CDK activity around mitotic entry.</p><p id="P10">If the only contribution of Bora to PLK1 T210 phosphorylation were through the activation of Aurora A, other Aurora:cofactor complexes, such as Aurora B:INCENP or Aurora A:CEP192, may also be expected to activate PLK1, unless prevented by strict lack of co-localization. Indeed, besides the already mentioned evidence of PLK1 activation by the Aurora B:INCENP complex at centromeres and the central spindle during cytokinesis, evidence of PLK1 phosphorylation by Aurora A:CEP192 or Aurora A:Protein furry homolog (FRY) at centrosomes has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Puzzlingly, however, compensation by other kinases of the decrease in pThr210 levels observed upon Bora depletion has not been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), supporting the specificity of the Bora-dependent mechanism. To shed further light on this issue, it is therefore important to investigate the precise mechanism through which Bora activates Aurora A and targets it to PLK1, and to explore whether comparable mechanisms are employed by other cofactors of Aurora kinases. Here, we dissected the biochemical underpinnings of the Bora:Aurora A catalytic complex and of its activity towards PLK1 in vitro, and validated our findings in human cells when applicable. Our results indicate that Aurora A:Bora relies on a transient interaction to the PLK1 kinase domain for Thr210 phosphorylation. This interaction overcomes an intrinsic inefficiency of Aurora kinases in phosphorylating the non-canonical Thr210 motif that is effectively bypassed by the mutation of a single crucial gatekeeper residue.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>A structural prediction of the Aurora A:Bora complex</title><p id="P11">Previous structural work identified distinct but related binding modes for Aurora kinase activators (herewith referred to as Aurora cofactors). These 40- to 100-residue fragments are devoid of a stable own conformation, but adopt one upon binding to the small lobe of the cognate Aurora kinase, embracing it (as in the case for CEP192 and INCENP), or simply lining it (as is the case for TPX2) (see gallery in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We used AlphaFold (AF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>) to obtain a structural model of the complex of Aurora A with a previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) minimal activation segment of Bora (residues 18-120). AF predicted with high confidence that Bora<sup>18-120</sup> wraps around the small lobe of Aurora A, extending even beyond a full circumference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). In the complex of Aurora A with TPX2, two fragments of TPX2 (previously identified as M1 and M2, and corresponding approximately to segments TPX7-21 and TPX30-43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>)) form a hairpin near the aC helix of Aurora A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The contact with Bora predicted by AF is significantly more extensive, but segments encompassing Bora<sub>22-48</sub> and Bora<sub>89-107</sub> seem to correspond to the TPX2 M1 and M2 segments, as predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), with significant differences (e.g., the M1 regions run in opposite directions in the Bora and TPX2 models, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). In both cases, there is a predominance of contacts with the kinase through aromatic residues. In M1, the side chains of Phe25, Leu39, and Phe45 of Bora occupy positions equivalent to those of Tyr8, Tyr10, and Phe19 of TPX2, respectively. In M2, Phe103 and Phe104 are equivalent to Trp34 and Phe35 of TPX2, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Kinases and cofactors contribute to substrate preference in vitro</title><p id="P12">We assembled several Aurora kinase:cofactor complexes and assessed their ability to phosphorylate PLK1 and other substrates in vitro in comparison to Aurora A:Bora. Specifically, we expressed and purified recombinant human Aurora A, and combined it with fragments of Bora (residues 1-224), TPX2 (full length), and CEP192 (residues 400-600) encompassing the predicted or experimentally validated binding sites for Aurora A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). We also co-expressed Aurora B kinases with INCENP (residues 351-C) (a detailed procedure is described in Material and Methods). Successful binding of the cofactors to Aurora A was verified by analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). With or without cofactor, T288 in the activation segment of Aurora A was found to be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). Next, we used these Aurora:cofactor complexes in kinase assays in vitro with various substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Substrates included, besides Thr210 in the PLK1 activation loop, Ser55 in the N-terminal tail of the kinetochore protein NDC80, Ser10 in N-terminal tail of histone H3, and Ser7 in the N-terminal tail of the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-H</xref>). Phosphorylation was monitored by using phospho-specific antibodies and a procedure adapted from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The Aurora A:Bora complex phosphorylated PLK1’s Thr210 very efficiently in the conditions of our assay. Conversely, Aurora A alone, or its complexes with TPX2 or CEP192, were unable to phosphorylate Thr210. Phosphorylation of PLK1 by Aurora B in complex with its activating cofactor INCENP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) was also below the detection limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Note that the anti-pThr210 antibody cross-reacts with the auto-phosphorylated activation segment of Aurora B (as indicated by an asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>) but not with the one of Aurora A, which was netheless phosphorylated in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, only Aurora A:Bora can phosphorylate PLK1 efficiently.</p><p id="P14">Unlike Thr210 of PLK1, Ser55 of Ndc80 was efficiently phosphorylated by all the Aurora:cofactor complexes in the same time frame, including Aurora A:Bora, while Aurora A:CEP192 was the least efficient kinase on this target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). Histone H3 was also phosphorylated by all kinases except Aurora A:CEP192 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). CENP-A, on the other hand, was preferentially phosphorylated by Aurora B:INCENP and was poorly phosphorylated by Aurora A and its variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). Taken as a whole, these experiments indicate that the Aurora A: CEP192 is the least active of the tested Aurora complexes, at least towards the limited number of substrates in our set, in line with a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). These results also indicate that the activity of the Aurora A:Bora complex, at least in vitro, is not limited to PLK1, as the complex can target additional substrates. Conversely, by identifying Aurora A:Bora as a highly selective activator of PLK1, our experiments suggest that further work in vitro may unveil the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Bora promotes transient binding to the PLK1 kinase domain</title><p id="P15">To investigate how Bora directs Aurora A to the PLK1 activation loop, we hypothesized that Bora may directly bind PLK1, as suggested by previous observations that both the PBD and kinase domain of PLK1 bind Bora in cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). While the dispensability of the PBD for PLK1 activation has been demonstrated(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), the requirement of Bora binding to the PLK1 kinase domain remains unclear. Attempts to reconstitute a stable complex using Bora, Aurora A, and PLK1 in pull-down and nuclear magnetic resonance binding assays did not yield a stable complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), a finding we independently confirmed (AEV and AM, unpublished results). Nevertheless, we reasoned that in the rapid phosphotransfer reaction, even a transient interaction may contribute to target selection. We therefore queried AlphaFold (AF) Multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>) to identify possible interactions of the Aurora A:Bora complex with PLK1. In a highly reproducible prediction of the ternary complex, AF identified a binding interface built up by a segment encompassing residues 55-69 of Bora and a region encompassing the N-terminal extension, the αB-αC helices, and the b4 strand of PLK1, all in the small lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A-B</xref>). Residues 55-69 of Bora are positioned between the two TPX2-like M1 and M2 motifs of Bora, and their sequence is conserved across species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>). We refer to this region as the PLK1-binding motif of Bora (abbreviated as P1 motif). The conformation of this segment is largely identical in the predicted binary (Aurora A:Bora) and ternary (Aurora A:Bora:PLK1) complexes, and is stabilized by its extensive interactions with the Aurora A small lobe. In the prediction of the ternary complex, the Aurora A catalytic cleft is positioned in front of the PLK1 activation-loop, poised for phosphotransfer. The ternary complex as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> reveals an additional interaction whereby the PLK1 PBD docks on Ser252 of Bora. However, the interaction of the Bora P1 motif with PLK1 was predicted even with a fragment of Bora lacking the PBD docking site, as well as in the absence of Aurora A. Thus, collectively, the predictions suggest that a favorable reciprocal configuration of kinase domains in an Aurora A:Bora:PLK1 ternary complex, orchestrated by the P1 motif of Bora, may direct Aurora A to the PLK1 activation loop.</p><p id="P16">To validate this model, we generated single amino acid substitutions to alanine of highly conserved exposed residues of PLK1 predicted by AF to interact with the P1 motif, and including Arg48, Arg95, Arg106, and Glu121 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>right panel</italic>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>). None of the mutations appeared to destabilize PLK1, as demonstrated by essentially identical catalytic activity on a C-terminal truncation of SA2, a bona fide substrate of PLK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>). We then tested the effects of the mutations on PLK1 Thr210 phosphorylation. The replacement of Arg48 and Arg106 with alanine displayed a very moderate reduction in the levels of Thr210 phosphorylation in a time course assay, which was only visible at the earliest timepoint of 15’. On the contrary, mutations of Arg95 and Glu121 led to a highly potent inhibition of Thr210 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Next, we introduced alanine mutations in the Bora P1 motif, and specifically at residues Phe56, Trp58, Ser59, and Ile66, predicted to be exposed and in contact with PLK1 in our AF model. All the amino acid substitutions tested produced a deleterious effect on PLK1 Thr210 phosphorylation in single timepoint assays, with mutations of Phe56 and Trp58 appearing most penetrant, with almost no residual Thr210 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P17">CDK phosphorylation on Bora’s Ser112 reinforces binding to Aurora A, enhancing its activity towards PLK1 Thr210 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Furthermore, Bora phosphorylation activates Aurora A towards PLK1 Thr210 in the absence of Aurora A activation loop phosphorylation at Thr288, even when this residue is mutated to prevent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). We therefore asked if the deleterious effects on PLK1 phosphorylation from the mutations in the Bora P1 motif could be bypassed by pre-phosphorylation of Bora with CDK, a condition expected to mimic cellular events near the G2-M transition. To avoid confounding effects, we mutated Aurora A Thr288 to valine to entirely eliminate phosphorylation of the Aurora A activation loop (shown schematically in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). In the absence of CDK activity, Bora failed to activate Aurora A<sup>T288V</sup> to promote PLK1 Thr210 phosphorylation, whereas addition of CDK1 resulted in robust PLK1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Addition of CDK1 resulted in an apparent rescue of the negative effects of alanine mutations of Ser59 and Ile66, but the mutations of Phe56 and Trp58 remained very penetrant even under these conditions.

To evaluate the cellular consequences from expressing Bora mutants defective in PLK1 activation, we generated stable doxycycline-inducible cell lines to express mNeonGreen (mNG)-tagged versions of the most penetrant PLK1 and Bora mutated variants, including PLK1<sup>R95A</sup>, PLK1<sup>E121A</sup>, Bora<sup>F56A</sup>, and Bora<sup>W58A</sup>. After inducing the expression of the relevant transgenes, we performed pull-downs from mitotically-arrested cells to enrich PLK1 and monitor pT210 phosphorylation by Western blotting (pre-purification of PLK1 via pull-down was necessary as pT210 detection on the whole cell lysate was sub-optimal and did not result in reproducible quantifications).

Towards this goal, we depleted endogenous PLK1, or co-depleted endogenous PLK1 and Bora, and re-expressed mNG-PLK1<sup>E121A</sup> or mNG-PLK1<sup>WT</sup>. To monitor mitotic entry, we synchronized cells at the G1/S transition with a doublethymidine block, released them from the arrest, and followed their progression into G2 and M phase for 23 hours using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Over-expression of mNG-PLK1WT rescued, at least partly, the delay caused by depletion of endogenous PLK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).

This consensus sequence, also present in the activation loops of Aurora A and B, is the basis of their auto-activation mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Despite its similarity to the activation loop of Aurora kinases, the PLK1 activation loop carries lysine rather than arginine at the -2 residue (position 208 in the human enzyme; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). This substitution, albeit conservative, is a largely evolutionary conserved feature of the PLK1 activation loop (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>).

In an in vitro kinase assay using SA2 as a substrate, PLK1<sup>K208R</sup> appeared as active as PLK1<sup>WT</sup>, indicating that the mutation does not cause overt structural or functional perturbations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>). Again, we compared the ability of Aurora kinases to phosphorylate PLK1 in presence or absence of the K208R mutation. In agreement with our hypothesis, the PLK1<sup>K208R</sup> mutant allowed every Aurora species we tested to phosphorylate PLK1 Thr210, with the Aurora A:TPX2 and Aurora B:INCENP complexes being apparently as active on Thr210 as Aurora A:Bora, in sharp contrast with their complete inability to phosphorylate wild-type PLK1 within the reaction time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>; a schematic description of this experiment is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>). Mutations of two additional residues neighboring Lys208 – i.e. Glu206 to leucine (the corresponding residue in the Aurora B activation-loop) and Arg207 to lysine, did not recapitulate this effect.

So, neither mutation made PLK1 accessible to other Aurora kinases, a property that, among the mutants we tested, was only conferred by the Lys208 to arginine mutation.</p><p id="P23">To further probe the specificity of this effect, we increased the concentration of PLK1 substrate ~12-fold (to a concentration of 2.5 μM) and tested Thr210 phosphorylation with increasing concentration of Aurora A:Bora or Aurora B:INCENP, up to an equimolar concentration with the substrate. Wild type PLK1 continued to remain entirely impervious to phosphorylation by the Aurora B:INCENP complex, even under these extremely facilitating conditions, while it was readily phosphorylated by Aurora A:Bora, as anticipated. In contrast, PLK1<sup>K208R</sup> was phosphorylated at all concentrations of Aurora B:INCENP and with apparently indistinguishable rates in comparison to Aurora A:Bora, likely reflecting saturation over the entire range of conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4E</xref>).

Our new observations now suggest that the aminoacid sequence of the activation segment is also a crucial determinant of Aurora kinase selectivity. To investigate whether the sequence of the activation segment plays a role independently of its accessibility, we truncated PLK1 at the beginning of the interdomain linker (aa 326), a few residues downstream the C-side end of the kinase domain. Confirming our results that the selectivity for Aurora A:Bora is attributable to features largely localized to the kinase domain, the phosphorylation patterns of PLK1<sub>1-326</sub><sup>WT</sup> and of PLK1<sub>1-326</sub><sup>K208R</sup> remained unchanged, with Aurora B gaining access to the mutant but not to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P25">These results suggest that the PLK1 activation loop is intrinsically a better substrate for the Aurora A:Bora complexes.

We therefore asked if selective phosphorylation of Thr210 by the various Aurora species was also retained when the activation loop was fully exposed. For this, we fused a 15-residue peptide encompassing Thr210 and the seven residues downstream and upstream to His-MBP, and subjected it to <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation. The T-loop peptide with wild type sequence was poorly phosphorylated by any Aurora species, including the Aurora A:Bora complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).

A counterintuitive aspect of this model, however, is that it would imply that Aurora B:INCENP, which turned into an excellent PLK1 Thr210 kinase after mutating Lys208 to arginine, can also “open” PLK1 as a precondition for its phosphorylation.</p><p id="P27">To further investigate this issue, we focused on the coupling between conformational changes of PLK1 and its activation. For this, we measured Aurora A:Bora accessibility to the activation loop of wild type PLK1 under two conditions known to modify the reciprocal conformation of the PBD and kinase domains. First, we combined PLK1 with a peptide from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> MAP205 that binds the PBD to lock PLK1 in an inactive, closed conformation, a condition predicted to restrict access to the PLK1 activation loop(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Second, we combined PLK1 with a BUB1 peptide pre-phosphorylated with CDK1 to generate a high-affinity binding site for the PBD.

For this, we over-expressed mNG-PLK1 WT or K208R, and monitored the levels of T210 phosphorylation in Nocodazole-arrested cells, depleted of Bora. Phosphorylation of PLK1 K208R was comparable to the one of PLK1 WT, and depletion of Bora strongly affected phosphorylation of both protein variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>). Reduced Thr210 phosphorylation of PLK1 WT upon Bora depletion was not rescued by okadaic acid, a PP1/PP2A inhibitor, suggesting that in the adopted experimental conditions no alternative kinase phosphorylates Thr210 in the absence of Bora (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C</xref>). In contrast, PLK1 K208R exhibited higher overall Thr210 phosphorylation than PLK1 WT upon addition of okadaic acid, and combined Bora depletion treatment resulted in reduced but still substantial phosphorylation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C</xref>).</p><p id="P30">HeLa cell lines stably expressing mNG-PLK1<sup>WT</sup> or mNG-PLK1<sup>K208R</sup> were synchronized at the G1/S boundary and then released into the cell cycle as in the experiments described above (e.g <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). While the overexpression of mNG-PLK1<sup>WT</sup> partly compensated PLK1 depletion, it did not compensate Bora depletion, as evidence by a robust mitotic entry delay.

These observations raise interest in the accessibility of the PLK1 activation segment to phosphatase activity, a question that remains poorly studied. Specifically, we were curious to know whether the maintenance of high levels of pThr210 in spite of declining levels of Bora may reflect a poor accessibility of pThr210 by phosphatase activity. Furthermore, we also wanted to investigate the possibility that the presence of the gatekeeper Lys208 may not only make the PLK1 activation segment impervious to “ordinary” Aurora kinases, but also protect it from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases.

As a comparison, we monitored the dephosphorylation of pThr288 on the Aurora A activation segment, using PP2A-B55 in equimolar amount, revealing that pThr288 of Aurora A underwent rapid and complete dephosphorylation by PP2A:B55d under all tested conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Here, we developed an assay that, by using purified proteins, recapitulates the exquisitely selective requirement of Bora for PLK1 activation loop phosphorylation. The establishment of this assay allowed us to identify the major determinants of Aurora kinases selectivity towards PLK1. Using PLK1 kinase dead variant (K82R), we excluded that PLK1 autoactivates in presence of the Aurora A:Bora complex, in line with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).</p><p id="P36">Demonstrating that the PLK1 T-loop consensus sequence is a suboptimal Aurora substrate, a single conservative substitution from Lysine to Arginine in position -2 from Thr210 was sufficient to promote phosphorylation by nearly all Aurora complexes tested <italic>in vitro</italic>. Despite a well-documented preference of Aurora kinases for arginine over lysine at position -2, the presence of the latter residue does not universally prevent efficient Aurora phosphorylation of substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>).

Thus, we cannot affirm that Lys208 is the sole element controlling the gatekeeping mechanism we have discovered. However, PLK1 variants bearing other amino acid substitutions at Thr210 neighboring sites (i.e. PLK1<sup>E206L</sup> and PLK1<sup>R207K</sup>) displayed a very different behaviour compared to PLK1<sup>K208R</sup>.</p><p id="P37">We also considered a potential role of steric hindrance in making the PLK1 activation loop impervious to Aurora kinases in the absence of Bora. A hypothetical accessibility barrier to the PLK1 activation loop may arise from an intramolecular interaction of the PLK1 kinase domain and the PBD. It was proposed that in the resulting “closed” state of PLK1, the region spanning residues 312-360 of the interdomain linker may mask the activation loop, making it inaccessible to Aurora A and inhibiting Thr210 phosphorylation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). We were unable to perform experiments on PLK1<sup>1-312</sup>, the construct used by Xu and colleagues (reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>)), as it appeared poorly stable. Nevertheless, their conclusion seems inconsistent with our findings, as we show that Thr210 is equally accessible when the intramolecular interaction between PLK1’s kinase domain and the PBD is actively stabilized (by using an inhibitory MAP205 peptide) or destabilized (by adding a CDK-phosphorylated BUB1 peptide). Furthermore, a short peptide exclusively encompassing the activation loop of PLK1 and exposing a lysine residue at position 208 was a poorer substrate than the same peptide exposing an arginine, indicating that the main obstacle that Bora needs to overcome is intrinsic to the specific sequence of the PLK1’s activation loop, rather than to its conformation.</p><p id="P38">Instead, our work suggests that overcoming the intrinsic barrier to phosphorylation requires the Aurora A:Bora complex to interact directly, albeit transiently, with PLK1. While we were not able to trap the complex biochemically, due to its instability, we validated a high-confidence AF prediction by mutationally targeting the complementary interacting interfaces predicted by structural modelling. The αC helix is an extremely well-conserved feature in the small lobe of protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). It contributes to the folding of the small lobe and positions residues that stabilize ATP in the active site, promoting catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>). Unlike the standard regulation mechanisms involving the spatial orientation of the αC helix by post-translational modifications or cofactor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), the PLK1 αC helix and neighboring residues dynamically bridge the interaction with a short N-terminal α-helix of Bora (the P1 element). Mutations in these regions of Bora and PLK1 impaired Thr210 phosphorylation. Particularly, the predicted hydrogen bond between PLK1 Glu121 and Bora Trp58 may be essential for efficient catalysis. We conclude that Bora bypasses the unfavorable phosphorylation reaction of the PLK1 activation-loop by forming a physical connection between Aurora A and the PLK1 kinase domain. We speculate therefore that the main role of Bora is to prolong the residency of the PLK1 activation loop in the proximity of the Aurora A active site, ultimately overcoming a kinetic barrier to phosphorylation introduced by the peculiar sequence of the PLK1’s activation loop, which deviates from the ideal Aurora consensus.</p><p id="P39">The effects on cell cycle progression from depleting Bora in different model systems range from a modest to a complete blockade to mitotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). In cultured human cells, the main consequence is a delayed mitotic entry, but the effect is strongly exacerbated if cells are forced to recover from a temporary cell cycle arrest caused by DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). We mimicked this effect with mutants preventing the Bora:PLK1 interaction. In a study that developed independently in parallel with ours, Pillan and colleagues also studied the mechanistic basis of Bora activation of PLK1 phosphorylation, coming to conclusions that are perfectly in line with ours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>). Using model systems that emphasize the role of Bora for mitotic entry in comparison to human cells, their study also provides a compelling biological demonstration that the interaction of Bora and PLK1 is essential for PLK1 activation and function in Xenopus egg extracts.</p><p id="P40">Contrary to the mutations at the Bora:PLK1 interface, substitution of Lys208 to arginine showed a more nuanced situation than the one observed <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thr210 phosphorylation of the PLK1<sup>K208R</sup> variant remained dependent on Bora. Only upon phosphatase inhibition, we observed Bora-independent PLK1 Thr210 phosphorylation of the mutant motif, but not of its wild-type counterpart. The reason why the activation loop motif of PLK1 remain impervious to Aurora kinases even after introduction of the conservative arginine mutation at the -2 position will need further investigation. It may reflect the low cellular concentrations of PLK1 and its activating kinase in vivo, which may justify a decreased but continuous requirement for Bora. A non-mutually exclusive additional explanation is that the lysine-to-arginine conservative substitution at position 208 makes pThr210 a better phosphatase substrate. In line with this idea, we observed a small but highly reproducible acceleration of pThr210 dephosphorylation of the activation loop of PLK1<sup>K208R</sup> relative to that in PLK1<sup>WT</sup>. Whether the effect we observed in vitro explains our results in vivo will require further studies. Nonetheless, the observation that Thr210 of PLK1 is largely impervious to PP2A and PP1 phosphatases is tantalizing, as it may explain the puzzling observation that the decrease of Bora levels in mitosis does not have major consequences for the PLK1 activation state, provided that low residual levels of Bora are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). While it was initially speculated that the persistence of pThr210 under these conditions or after Aurora A inhibition may reflect temporal inactivation of the appropriate phosphatase during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) or protection by additional cofactor proteins such as Apolo1 (reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>)), our results suggest that also sequence or structural elements around pThr210 site hamper its dephosphorylation by active phosphatases.</p><p id="P41">There are some corollary observations in our data that deserve a brief comment. First, our experiments with the Aurora A:Bora complex demonstrate that it can phosphorylate other substrates in addition to PLK1. Whether this property of the Aurora A:Bora complex is physiologically significant will require further analysis. Second, our observations indicate that CEP192 acts as a partial inhibitor of Aurora A towards the substrates tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). This result is partly in line with recent work showing CEP192 does not activate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) or even inhibits Aurora A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). The result is also consistent with the AlphaFold prediction of the Aurora A:CEP192 complex, where the cofactor is shown to intrude deeply into the catalytic pocket of the kinase, predicting inhibition. It has been proposed that oligomerization of Aurora A on CEP192 in presence of an oxidative environment promotes activation loop auto-phosphorylation and activation of Aurora A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>). The specified condition cannot be straightforwardly tested using in vitro phosphorylation assays, and therefore we cannot exclude that CEP192-bound Aurora A at the centrosome is able to activate PLK1. Nevertheless, we can say that at least intrinsically, the complex phosphorylates PLK1 inefficiently on the activation-loop.</p><p id="P42">Our results are graphically summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>. We identify PLK1 as a suboptimal Aurora kinase substrate whose phosphorylation requires Bora. Such requirement can be bypassed by replacing lysine 208 of the activation loop with arginine. On the other hand, mutating residues at the Bora:PLK1 interface that we have identified abrogates Thr210 phosphorylation altogether, an effect that is rescued by introducing the K208R mutation. Thus, the two crucial elements of this mechanism are a) the suboptimal target sequence of the motif containing Thr210, which creates a major barrier to phosphorylation, and b) the overcoming of this limitation through a direct interaction of Bora with PLK1’s kinase domain. Although additional studies will be needed to fully comprehend the network generated by the binding of Bora to crucial mitotic kinases such as CDK1, Aurora A, and PLK1, our data offer the long-sought-for molecular explanation for why Bora is required as an Aurora A cofactor to phosphorylate Thr210 of PLK1.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Mutagenesis and sub-cloning into expression plasmids</title><p id="P43">All DNA constructs were generated by PCR amplification of the DNA fragment encoding the protein (insert) and the expression vector of choice or PCR amplification of the insert only and vector cleavage with restriction enzymes.
