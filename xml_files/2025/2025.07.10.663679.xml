However, pathological clot formation can result in thrombosis, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality across the world. The search for better diagnosis and treatments for thrombotic diseases remains a priority.</p><p id="P8">Physiologically, haemostasis is triggered by vessel wall injury, which exposes subendothelial collagen matrix and tissue factor (TF) and initiates clot formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Simultaneously, activation and adhesion of platelets to collagen fibrils and/or von Willebrand factor (VWF) released from activated EC results in the formation of the platelet plug, followed by platelet degranulation and further platelet aggregation. Secondary haemostasis involves the coagulation cascade and activation of plasma clotting factors, leading to fibrin formation stabilising the clot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p><p id="P9">Multiple factors can disrupt the complex balance of haemostasis and lead to thrombosis. Abnormalities or an increase in circulating coagulation and fibrinolytic factors, which increase the risk of thrombotic events, are well described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. However, despite the equal systemic exposure of the vasculature to circulating factors, thrombotic diseases tend to prefer specific sites. The reasons for this are unclear but suggest local factors, likely related to the activation state of the endothelium. In support of this concept, endothelial activation caused by inflammation and/or disturbance of blood flow has been widely correlated with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, including arterial and venous thrombosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P10">In homeostatic conditions, the endothelium presents as an anti-coagulant surface; this switches to a pro-coagulant surface when required and then reverts to its homeostatic state. Pathological activation of the endothelium results in loss of its anti-thrombotic properties. Endothelial function and phenotype are influenced by multiple factors in the microenvironment, including the extracellular matrix (ECM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], substrate stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], blood flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] and the crosstalk between the EC and other vascular cell types, such as fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells and pericytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Little is known about the contribution of these factors to thrombosis. These pathways may be of crucial importance to understand local mechanisms of thrombosis, and thus offer new targets for diagnosis, biomarkers and anti-thrombotic therapies.</p><p id="P11">Most diagnostics and therapies focus on circulating factors rather than aiming at reducing the pro-coagulant activity of the endothelium. This may be partly due to the lack of <italic>in vitro</italic> models of thrombosis that incorporate vascular cells. Encompassing all the key factors contributing to thrombus formation in a single <italic>in vitro</italic> model is challenging. Standard 2D cell culture techniques cannot reproduce the complexity of the physiological microenvironment; hence new models that capture multiple features to bridge the gap between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> models are required. Lately, a significant effort has focused on the development of cell-based <italic>in vitro</italic> microfluidic or ‘organ-on-chip’ models that include ECs, ECM, other vascular cells and/or whole blood and shear stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. As recently reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], an ideal ‘organ-on-chip’ vascular model would allow for the incorporation of EC, mural and other vascular cells, an elastic interface that can allow for ECM-EC signalling, and a set up that allows the generation of physiological and pathophysiological flow. Furthermore, investigation of thrombus formation also requires the ability to perfuse blood and record thrombus formation by time-lapse microscopy. The geometry of these devices is crucial, since red blood cells promote the margination of platelets, increasing the frequency of interactions with EC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Direct contact between EC and ECM creates an environment close to physiological stiffness, also capable of accommodating other cells lineages and blood perfusion. Recently, several models have been developed to investigate thrombus formation <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]; however, the challenge remains to develop a model with relevant geometry that can incorporate all variables.</p><p id="P12">The ambitious goal of precision medicine requires access to patients’ own cells and biological samples. For the vascular endothelium, this is now possible thanks to endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC), circulating progenitors isolated from donors’ peripheral blood that can be expanded in culture for multiple applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. A recent study showed dysregulation of the TNF pathway in ECFC from patients with unprovoked thromboembolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], supporting the value of this approach in investigating hidden causes of thrombosis.</p><p id="P13">In this study, we develop a vessel-on-chip model of thrombosis that incorporates the above-mentioned key components of haemostasis and allows for precision medicine approaches. A needle-based fabrication technique was used to create a 3D cylindrical channel embedded in a collagen matrix, which was then lined with EC. The model allows for direct contact between EC and ECM, exposing cells to physiological stiffness; it includes perfusion and exposure of EC to shear stress; it allows live imaging of thrombus formation, inclusion of activators and inhibitors, and molecular analyses of ECs, including patients’ own EC, for the development of a personalised model of thrombosis. The model is amenable for future development to include vascular mural and tissue cells, different ECM and different shear stress.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Vessel-on-chip fabrication</title><p id="P14">Model fabrication was based on needle casting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] to generate a cylindrical perfusable microfluidic channel and involved three steps: i) polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is cast in a 3D printed mould to create the chip, ii) the chamber in the chip is filled with collagen around a needle, which is withdrawn to create the lumen, iii) the lumen is endothelialised and cultured to achieve a mature monolayer.</p><sec id="S9"><title>Manufacturing the chip</title><p id="P15">A mould (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) was printed with a polyjet 3D printer (Objet 30 Prime, Stratasys, USA). The outer rim of the mould was designed with two ECM ports and two vessel ports, all leading to a chamber for the ECM (diameter=5 mm, height=1.3 mm). Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing (OD=0.6 mm, Sigma Aldrich, USA) was then inserted into the ECM ports through two holes in the chamber region. To create the main vessel structure, a 300 μm diameter stainless-steel acupuncture needle (Seirin, Japan) was inserted through the ECM chamber, through tubing at the vessel inlets, leaving approximately 2 mm between the tubing and the ECM chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning, USA) was mixed at a 10:1 elastomer to curing agent ratio, poured into the mould and polymerised at 65°C for two hours. After curing, the tubing and needle were removed, leaving hollow inlets in the PDMS and a cavity for the ECM. The PDMS support structure was then removed from the mould and sealed with a glass coverslip, which was bonded to the PDMS using oxygen plasma treatment of both the glass and PDMS surfaces, followed by post-treatment baking at 65°C for one hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Creating the lumen of the vessel-on-chip</title><p id="P16">All inlets and the ECM chamber were sterilised with 70% ethanol and washed with PBS. To promote adhesion of the collagen gel to PDMS, the ECM chamber and ECM inlets were coated with neutralised collagen solution (rat-tail collagen I 50 μg/ml, Corning, USA) overnight at room temperature. After removing the collagen solution, the ECM chamber and all inlets were filled with PBS, and an identical 300 μm stainless-steel acupuncture needle, sterilised with 70% ethanol, was inserted through the vessel inlet into the ECM chamber. The PBS was then aspirated from the ECM inlets.</p><p id="P17">Collagen was neutralised in HEPES (1M, Sigma Aldrich, USA) and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (37 g/l reconstituted in MilliQ water, Sigma Aldrich, USA) at an 8:1:1 ratio on ice to slow down polymerisation during preparation. The neutralised collagen gel (4 mg/ml) was injected through one ECM inlet, filling the ECM chamber around the needle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) and left to polymerise at 37°C overnight. Following collagen polymerisation, the needle was withdrawn, leaving a straight hollow cylindrical channel, surrounded by collagen in the ECM chamber. Stainless-steel rods, sterilized with 70% ethanol, were inserted to seal the ECM inlets to inhibit flow (diameter=0.8 mm, length: ~2-3 mm cut from a wire, RS Components Ltd., UK) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Endothelialising the lumen</title><p id="P18">Two types of EC were used in the study. Human umbilical vein ECs (HUVEC, from Lonza, UK: pooled, 10 donors) were used at passage 4-6. Alternatively, endothelial colony forming cells (ECFC) from healthy donors were isolated from blood samples as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. ECFC from five individual donors were combined at passage 4 to generate a pool, which was further expanded for one passage to passage 5. Written informed consent for ECFC isolation and use was obtained under the Imperial College Healthcare Tissue Bank (HTA licence 12275; REC approval 17/WA/0161).</p><p id="P19">HUVEC or ECFC in EC growth medium-2 (EGM2, Lonza, UK) were seeded in the lumen at a density of 5x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml, by injecting 2.5 μl of cell suspension through the vessel inlet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). The device was incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes to allow cell adhesion to the collagen; then the device was rotated 180° and the cell seeding process was repeated to ensure cell coverage.</p><p id="P20">To maintain cell viability and allow for parallelisation, the device was connected via PTFE tubing (ID=0.3 mm, OD=0.76 mm, Adtech Polymer Engineering Ltd, UK) to a perfusion unit, fabricated from nylon (PA2200) using a SLS 3D printer (Forge Labs, Canada) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). To prevent leaking, the 3D printed reservoirs were coated with PDMS and incubated overnight in an oven at 65°C for polymerisation. The perfusion unit has the dimensions of a rectangular tissue culture plate, in order to fit on a microscope stage and allows optical access through holes in the base. The unit has five separate inlet and outlet reservoirs to enable culturing of five vessels in parallel. Hydrostatic pressure-driven flow from the inlet reservoirs to the outlet reservoirs was used to ensure a continuous renewal of culture media for the cells. As fluid flows from the inlet to the outlet reservoir, the height of fluid in the inlet reservoir decreases and the height of fluid in the outlet reservoir increases; this reduces the pressure gradient driving the flow and limits the duration that a given flow rate can be maintained. To allay this effect, the outlet reservoirs were designed with an overflowing feature to maintain fluid height (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix A1</xref>). This enabled continuous media turnover of at least one vessel volume per minute, with media replacement required only once per day. The shear stress induced by continuous flow through the vessel was low throughout the culture period (&lt;0.3 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix A1</xref>). The perfusion unit was sterilized by autoclaving before use. Cell culture media was replaced once per day with 3 ml of EGM2 supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, pre-conditioned overnight to incubator conditions to minimise air bubble formation in the tubing and vessel. Endothelialised vessels were cultured for up to 9 days prior to IF or thrombosis assays.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Immunofluorescence (IF) staining</title><p id="P21">Fixation, permeabilisation, blocking and PBS washes were performed by perfusion; all steps in the protocol were performed on the same day and at room temperature. Vessels were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 15 minutes and permeabilised with 0.2% Tween-20 for 20 minutes, followed by 30 minutes blocking with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The primary and secondary antibodies were injected into the vessel through the vessel inlet. The primary antibody for VE-cadherin was delivered in two steps, injecting 5 μl antibody solution (diluted in 1% BSA) and incubating for 45 minutes and then rotating the device 180°, adding an additional 5 μl antibody solution and incubating for another 45 minutes. The vessel was then washed with PBS for 10 minutes followed by incubation with the secondary antibody and DAPI (nuclear stain), which were delivered using the same method as for the primary antibody but with 30-minute incubations. The vessel was washed again with PBS for 10 minutes prior to microscopy or storage at 4°C.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Thrombosis assay</title><p id="P22">Blood was collected ~30 minutes prior to starting the thrombosis assay from healthy volunteers (male and female, age 25-40) who had not taken any pain relief medication known to affect coagulation for the past two weeks. Blood was collected in 3.2% trisodium citrate in a syringe with a 21G butterfly needle. The first 3 ml of blood were discarded and the sample was mixed by slowly inverting the collection tube to minimise shear-induced platelet activation. Blood was stored at room temperature and used within 3h. Platelets were labelled using a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human CD41 antibody (BioLegend, USA) at a ratio of 1:100 antibody:blood. Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated fibrinogen from human plasma (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was added to blood at a ratio of 1:200. Five minutes prior to perfusion, blood was recalcified by adding a recalcification buffer (100 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 75 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in PBS) at a ratio of 1:10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>].</p><p id="P23">The perfusion unit was placed on a confocal microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss, Germany) for real-time monitoring. One vessel at a time was perfused with blood using a 1 ml plastic syringe and a syringe pump (Model X, Harvard Apparatus, USA); with the PTFE tubing in the perfusion unit connected to the syringe via a custom PDMS connector. Recalcified blood was perfused at 40 μl/min for 20 minutes, inducing a shear stress of ~10 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup> Every 2 minutes, a z-stack of 14 images was captured (each image was 512x1024 12-bit pixels) at the centre of the bottom surface of the vessel using a 10x objective, keeping gain, laser power and pinhole settings constant for all experiments.</p><p id="P24">Platelet adhesion and fibrin deposition were quantified by analysing the total number of pixels in the z-stack with positive fluorescent intensity and normalising to the captured vessel surface area to account for variability between vessels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix A3</xref>). In selected experiments, an anti-Tissue Factor (TF) antibody (mouse monoclonal, IgG<sub>2a</sub>, Enzyme Research Laboratories) or IgG control were used at 25 μg/ml, diluted in cell culture media to the desired concentration and added to the vessel for 20 minutes after TNF-treatment and prior to blood perfusion.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>RNA extraction and RT-qPCR</title><p id="P25">HUVEC were lysed within the microfluidic device by pipetting Arcturus PicoPure Extraction buffer (Applied Biosystem, Thermofisher, USA) into the vessel and RNA was extracted using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA isolation kit. For ECFC experiments, the collagen gel was removed from the ECM chamber by breaking the coverslip and digested at 37°C in 1 ml of collagenase A solution (Sigma, 2 mg/ml) reconstituted in EGM2 cell culture media for 2-5 minutes until it was no longer visible. The sample was centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature, after which the collagenase solution was discarded, cells were lysed with Arcturus PicoPure Extraction buffer, and RNA extracted using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA isolation kit.</p><p id="P26">Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA). ICAM1, thrombomodulin (TM), tissue factor (TF), von Willebrand factor (VWF) and E-selectin were measured in HUVEC (n=8 vessels); ICAM1, TM, TF and VWF were also measured in ECFC (n=3 vessels). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using PerfeCTa SYBR Green Fastmix (Quanta Biosciences, USA) on a CFX96 system (Bio-Rad, UK). Gene expression values were normalised against the housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Fold differences were calculated using the ΔΔCt (delta-delta cycle threshold) method, averaging across all controls.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Permeability</title><p id="P27">Permeability was measured by replacing the media in the inlet reservoir with 3 ml TRITC-dextran solution (65-85 kDa, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate dextran, Sigma Aldrich, USA), reconstituted in the HEPES-supplemented EGM2 cell culture media to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml). The 3D-printed perfusion unit was placed on the confocal microscope stage and imaged by time-lapse microscopy (7 seconds between images, 65 images, size: 1024x1024 pixels). Microscopy settings were kept the same for all experiments. Following confocal imaging, the dextran solution in the inlet reservoir was replaced with HEPES-supplemented EGM2 cell culture media (pre-conditioned in the incubator) and the perfusion unit was placed back in the incubator for continued cell culture. Permeability assays were performed on different days, to capture different stages of cell confluency and maturation, and to evaluate the progression of monolayer formation and the integrity of the vessel. 14 vessels in total were measured, with 6 having longitudinal measurements to evaluate progression.</p><p id="P28">Permeability (P<sub>s</sub>) for a vessel at a given timepoint was estimated by quantifying the rate of change of fluorescent intensity inside the ECM over time, using methods similar to those previously reported with minor modifications to the implementation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix A2</xref> for details).

Some platelet adhesion was observed in untreated vessels, possibly due to low-level platelet activation induced by blood sampling; minimal levels of fibrin were detected in untreated samples. Quantification shows a significant increase in platelet adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) and fibrin deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) in TNF-α-treated vessels compared to untreated vessels (p&lt;0.01 for platelet adhesion and p&lt;0.001 for fibrin deposition). Variability in the signal prompted us to investigate reproducibility within the same blood donor, by testing the same blood sample on different vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-B</xref>, inset). These showed some variability in the platelet adhesion, and more so in the fibrin accumulation data, suggesting that this parameter might be more sensitive to variability between blood vessels.</p><p id="P34">TF expression on ECs is upregulated by TNF-α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Thus, an anti-TF blocking antibody (25 μg/ml) was added to the vessel 20 min prior to blood perfusion to evaluate the contribution of TF to thrombus formation in this assay. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> shows representative images of platelet adhesion and fibrin deposition upon TNF-stimulated HUVEC in the presence of anti-TF or IgG isotype control antibodies. Blocking TF reduced fibrin deposition compared to IgG control or TNF-α alone (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), confirming the involvement of TF in this process. Interestingly, blocking TF also resulted in inhibition of platelet deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting a possible indirect effect from thrombin inhibition, or a contribution of platelet TF.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>ECFC-lined vessels</title><p id="P35">Vessels lined with pooled ECFC from healthy donors were used to evaluate the potential for disease modelling. Images show that TNF-α treatment increased platelet adhesion and fibrin deposition compared to untreated controls (representative images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C-D</xref>; p&lt;0.01 for both), comparable to that observed in HUVEC-lined vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-B</xref>). Platelet deposition was remarkably similar between experiments; however, variability in fibrin deposition was observed, again pointing to vessel variability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Validation of endothelial activation by RNA profiling</title><p id="P36">To verify endothelial activation following TNF-α treatment, gene expression was quantified with qRT-PCR, in HUVEC (n=9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>) and ECFC (n=3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). As expected, TNF-α treatment resulted in a significant upregulation of ICAM1 and E-selectin in HUVEC (37-fold and 63-fold on average respectively, p&lt;0.001). Average TF gene expression was upregulated by TNF-α (2.9-fold) but no statistical difference was detected; no differences in VWF and TM mRNA levels were detected (p&gt;0.05). In ECFC, TNF-α stimulation also resulted in upregulation of ICAM1 (39-fold, p&lt;0.01), and TF, the latter with a stronger response compared to HUVEC (11-fold, p&lt;0.01). TNF also caused a 10-fold reduction in TM on average; however, this was not statistically different from zero (p&gt;0.05) likely due to the small sample size. No change in VWF gene expression was detected. These results confirm activation of EC by TNF-α in a 3D vessel structure surrounded by ECM.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Assessment of endothelial barrier function</title><p id="P37">Given the variability observed in some repeat samples, we set out to confirm the functional integrity of the monolayers. Barrier function was determined over time by perfusing fluorescent dextran solution through the vessels and estimating monolayer permeability. Confocal fluorescent images taken after 5 min of perfusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-B</xref>) show a reduction in the amount of solute diffusing across the endothelium at Day 9 compared to Day 3. Fluorescence intensity profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-D</xref>) confirm this trend. At Day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A and C</xref>), fluorescent dextran was readily transported across the vessel wall, with an increase over the 5 min interval, indicating that the endothelial barrier function has not yet been established. At Day 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B and D</xref>), minimal dextran transport is shown by the low intensity of fluorescent signal in the collagen around the vessel, indicating a tight endothelial barrier.</p><p id="P38">In a subset of vessels, permeability was monitored longitudinally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). A consistent increase in barrier function over time in all vessels was observed; however, variability in the time required by different vessels to achieve a barrier function was observed. The measured permeability values are consistent with previous reports in comparable models (0.001-0.06 μm/s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]IF staining for junctional VE-Cadherin of a representative vessel at day 5 confirms that a tight barrier corresponds to a confluent endothelial monolayer without visible gaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>, permeability quantified as 0.013 μm/s).</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Co-culture with pericytes</title><p id="P39">In the microvasculature, the endothelium is surrounded by mural cells, specifically pericytes in capillaries and vascular smooth muscle cells around arterioles and venules. Mural cells wrap around EC and are exposed to blood following vascular injury. Recently pericytes were shown to express TF, thus able to initiate and propagate the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. The contribution of pericytes to endothelial activation and thrombosis in intact vessels is still largely unknown. We tested whether our new platform was suitable for co-culture of EC with pericytes. Confocal microscopy showed an endothelial monolayer with established continuous junction and pericytes wrapped around the endothelium with thin cellular protrusions around the vessel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). These images demonstrate the viability of this approach, although the density of pericytes was variable and requires further optimisation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S26" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P40">In this paper, we report the development of an <italic>in vitro</italic> 3D model of thrombosis-on-chip in a controlled microenvironment, using human endothelial cells and whole blood. We demonstrated that the model can be used to study thrombus formation in real time over TNF-α activated endothelium, using blood with fluorescently labelled components and real-time confocal imaging. The model also allows for molecular analysis of endothelial gene expression and incorporation of pericytes and therefore has the potential to incorporate all key components of haemostasis: EC, blood factors, blood cells, ECM, shear stress and perivascular cells. The design supports both biological assays (i.e. immunostaining and real-time qPCR) and functional assays (i.e. permeability and thrombosis assays).</p><p id="P41">The design of this chip presents several advantages with respect to existing microfluidic models of thrombosis. Contrary to many other devices, the emphasis of our model is on the endothelium: this design is particularly suited to study pathological activation of the endothelium by inflammatory agents and shear stress. Several microfluidic models are fabricated using methods that yield rectangular cross sections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. This results in a non-uniform distribution of shear stress on the ECs that could lead to EC activation. To avoid this, we used the needle casting approach, which generates a circular cross-section that provides a uniform shear stress; this method also has the advantage of being easier and cheaper than other microfabrication techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, the use of inlet and outlet ports that are in-line with the endothelialised vessel are particularly suitable for blood perfusion, as these avoid sharp corners that could potentially induce high local shear-stresses that could activate platelets during perfusion. The model presents an alternative to designs that have incorporated geometries to induce a ‘pathological’ flow profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] which result in non-uniform distributions of shear stress. Our system uses the simpler approach of having a single shear stress condition for each vessel that can be controlled via a syringe pump or alternative perfusion device. This provides the flexibility to investigate the different shear stresses associated with venous and arterial thrombosis in a controlled manner.</p><p id="P42">Endothelial activation by TNF-α was confirmed by the regulation of well-characterised gene targets ICAM1 and E-selectin. Upregulation of TF was observed in ECFC, and the average TF expression was increased in HUVEC, although a statistical difference was not detected. Similarly, the anticoagulant TM was significantly downregulated following TNF-α treatment in ECFCs but not HUVEC; more studies will be required to determine differences between HUVEC and ECFC in response to activating agents. Overall, the response of TNF-α target genes was variable between samples, possibly reflecting a technical issue due to the low quantity of RNA that can be extracted from each vessel. Pooling of multiple vessels could reduce variability. Other endothelial activating agents could be used, including cocktails of pro-inflammatory cytokines for disease modelling of thrombosis.</p><p id="P43">The model allows manipulation of the coagulation response from both the endothelium and blood components, thus presenting an opportunity to dissect novel pathways and investigate the crosstalk between cellular and circulating regulators. By using anti-TF antibodies, we show that the model is suitable for pathway detection. Our data show that ECFC perform similarly to HUVEC in supporting platelet adhesion and thrombus formation. This is the first step towards developing a personalised model of thrombosis, a key tool to investigate the mechanisms underlying thrombosis of unknown causes. ECFCs are a unique tool to create an autologous model of thrombosis, by pairing ECFCs with blood isolated from the same patient for pathway investigation and drug testing.</p><p id="P44">Another key feature of our device is the direct interaction between EC and the surrounding ECM, thus allowing the cells to sense the substrate stiffness and crucially engage in signals from the ECM. By changing collagen concentration or ECM substrate, future studies could investigate the importance of stiffness in the response of the endothelium to activation and the consequent thrombus formation.</p><p id="P45">Finally, our vessel-on-a-chip platform can be used to investigate the crosstalk between EC and pericytes, embedded in the same ECM and thus able to engage in direct cell-cell interactions without separation by a barrier; this would not be possible using membrane-based co-culture or microfluidic models.</p><p id="P46">There are limitations to this study. While the needle-casting fabrication method provides the advantages noted above, it is practically limited to vessel scales on the order of 100μm or larger and straight cylindrical geometries. Nonetheless, given the need for parallelisation to achieve sufficient statistical power for an assay, the addition of complexity could hinder the practical use of the assay. We observed variability between the vessels, which could be due to several elements. By testing the same blood sample on multiple vessels in the same experiment, we concluded that some variability could be attributed to the vessels. A low but detectable level of platelet adhesion was detected on non-activated vessels. This was not a major issue for model evaluation, as TNF-α stimulation resulted in &gt;3-fold increase in platelet adhesion compared to baseline. However, the presence of background platelet adhesion could become a limitation if a less powerful inflammatory stimulation is used, or to detect spontaneous platelet adhesion. Although platelets activation state could be characterised prior to this assay to provide a baseline assessment of donor variability, there is a practical time limitation as blood samples should be used within hours of collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Since close to zero fibrin deposition could be detected in unstimulated vessels, this suggests that the background level of platelet adhesion in unstimulated vessels was not thrombin-dependent, but rather that the platelets were already activated before entering the vessel, as a consequence of sample manipulation. Further optimisation will be required to reduce this background.</p><p id="P47">The value of using live-imaging to study thrombus formation has been extensively demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. The flexibility in labelling different blood components could allow to investigate the contribution of other cells, i.e. leukocytes, to thrombus formation. Time-lapse imaging enabled the dynamic response of platelet adhesion and fibrin deposition to be captured; optimisation experiments showed that 20 minutes imaging time was sufficient to capture differences in coagulation between the two treatment groups (control and TNF-α). Using z-stacks was important to capture the surface area of the vessel; however, the current method for data analysis relies on the platelet channel for defining the vessel boundaries. This might result in an underestimation of the vessel boundaries, especially in the control vessels with lower platelet coverage. Live labelling of ECs could more accurately define vessel boundaries; this would provide higher accuracy for determining the start point of the z-stack, thereby reducing the number of images required per z-stack, which would reduce the imaging time. However, reagents used for live cell staining are often toxic to cells. More reliable methods for fluorescent labelling, including lentivirus, can reduce cell viability in long-term culture and would be practically inconvenient to implement with patients’ ECFCs.</p><p id="P48">In conclusion, we have developed a vessel-on-a-chip microfluidic model of thrombosis that provides flexibility to manipulate multiple variables relevant to thrombus formation within a 3D vessel structure. This model provides a platform to dissect the mechanisms of thrombus formation, investigate the effect of coagulation inhibitors, predict thrombotic side effects of drugs and study the pathological mechanisms underlying thrombus formation in patients with thrombosis of unknown causes, using patients’ own EC and blood in an autologous, precision medicine approach.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Appendices</label><media xlink:href="EMS207137-supplement-Appendices.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d41aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary data</label><media xlink:href="EMS207137-supplement-Supplementary_data.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d41aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by Imperial College NHLI- British Heart Foundation (BHF) PhD studentship (JJE); BHF programme grant RG/17/4/32662 (MD); the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Imperial Biomedical Research Centre Cardiovascular Theme (AMR; CPer); Imperial BHF Research Excellence Award (4) – RE/24/130023 (AR); PNRR PNC-E3-2022-23683266 PNC-HLS-DA, INNOVA (TM, AR); Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship RF201617\16\18 (JvBS); Versus Arthritis Career Development Fellowship 21223 and the Imperial College–Wellcome Trust Institutional Strategic Support Fund (CPer).

The Anti-TF Ab also decreases TNF-α induced platelet deposition. C: ECFC-lined vessels in control and TNF-α stimulated conditions.

For both cell types, TNF-α treatment significantly increased platelet adhesion (p&lt;0.01) and fibrin deposition (HUVEC: p&lt;0.001, ECFC: p&lt;0.01). In HUVEC-lined vessels, anti-TF treatment completely abolished both platelet and fibrin deposition, whilst IgG control had no effect. Each symbol represents a single blood donor; when the same blood sample was tested on multiple vessels, the mean value is shown in the main graph and the repeats are shown in the inset panel [Ctrl (1), TNF (2) and TNF + Anti-TF (3)]. E-F: Assessment of endothelial activation by RNA profiling of ICAM1, VWF, TM, TF and E-sel (the latter for HUVEC only). HUVEC vessels (n = 9): TNF-α treatment resulted in a significant upregulation of ICAM1 and E-sel gene expression (p&lt;0.001), a trend towards increase for TF which did not reach statistical significance (p&gt;0.05) and no changes in VWF and TM. ECFC vessels (n = 3): TNF-α treatment induced an upregulation of ICAM1 and TF gene expression (p&lt;0.01); TM was downregulated in all vessels but the sample size was insufficient to conclude a statistical difference (p&gt;0.05); VWF expression was not affected.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207137-f003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Permeability.</title><p>Functional evaluation of endothelial barrier tightness. Permeability assay: Dextran diffusion traced after 5 min from dextran homogeneous diffusion in the channel lumen. Confocal images and relative fluorescence profile plotted across the vessel wall of the same microvessel monitored at Day 3 (A and C) and at Day 9 (B and D) of culture. At Day 3, dextran leaked through the monolayer, as sign of an immature endothelial barrier. At Day 9, dextran was completely retained inside the lumen, proving the tightness of the monolayer and a well-established barrier. E: Permeability monitored multiple times across different days in the same vessel (each vessel represented by a different colour) or as individual measurements (grey) in additional vessels is reported; time course data show a decrease in permeability over time for all vessels.
