Current approaches to risk mapping vary widely in their methodology, data sources, output metrics and applications. Many existing approaches focus on predicting ecological suitability and produce high-resolution risk maps based on environmental conditions, yet high-resolution incidence maps remain scarce, leaving a critical gap in guiding precise, location-specific interventions. The prediction of disease incidence or transmission intensity remains relatively uncommon in disease ecology, largely due to data limitations, reporting biases, and the inherent complexity that arises from transmission dynamics. In this study, we applied disaggregation regression modelling to downscale aggregated dengue case data from 14 countries in Central and South America, generating fine-resolution incidence estimates that we subsequently projected onto the African continent. We then compared the resulting predictions from the incidence-based risk map with three widely used approaches: vector suitability index, dengue environmental suitability index, and mechanistic transmission potential (Index P). The disaggregation model achieved relatively strong predictive accuracy within the training region (mean correlation = 0.72) and showed partial alignment with reported burden across Africa (Spearman ρ = 0.33). Other risk maps exhibited similar or weaker correlations with reported cases in Africa, including ρ = 0.33 for dengue environmental suitability, ρ = 0.32 for transmission potential and ρ = 0.23 for Aedes aegypti suitability. Disaggregation regression offers a valuable tool for translating reported case data into spatially explicit estimates of burden, bridging the gap between ecological risk and epidemiological relevance. While spatial agreement was high in parts of coastal West Africa across the different risk map approaches, notable divergences highlight the distinct assumptions underlying each framework.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Dengue fever remains a significant global public health concern, with rising incidence and geographic expansion driven by urbanization, climate change, and human mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Accurately mapping dengue risk is essential for informing surveillance, vector control strategies, and resource allocation in endemic and emerging regions. Over the past two decades, a range of approaches have been developed and applied to characterise spatio-temporal dengue risk, each leveraging different data sources and modeling frameworks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p><p id="P4">These approaches can be broadly grouped into four categories based on their conceptual framework and data inputs: ecological niche models (ENMs) that use environmental covariates to predict the suitability of either vector or viral occurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]; biologically-informed mechanistic models that estimate climate-driven transmission potential based on experimentally derived parameters like mosquito lifespan and incubation period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]; incidence-based models that use reported case counts to estimate disease burden and transmission intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]; and observational serological studies such as seroprevalence surveys and cohort analyses, which offer insights into population-level exposure and immunity. While the first two categories aim to predict areas of risk based on ecological or biological suitability, incidence-based models aim to quantify burden, providing estimates of where transmission is actually occurring. Despite differences in resolution, assumptions, and required inputs, they each provide a different and potentially complementary lens on where, when and how dengue risk emerges and evolves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Lim et al. (2023) conducted a systematic review of the methodologies, covariates, and geographic extent of these different modeling approaches, offering a comprehensive synthesis of how <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne arbovirus transmission risk has been mapped to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. A brief summary of their input data, pros, cons, and public health applications is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Table S1</xref>.</p><p id="P5">These divergent methods reflect a broader complexity in dengue modeling, where multiple factors, including virus serotypes, mosquito vector ecology, human demographics, and socio-environmental conditions interact in nonlinear ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. As highlighted by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], comparing these models helps identify areas of agreement and divergence, assess the reliability of model predictions and clarify which representations of risk are most appropriate for specific decision-making contexts. This is particularly critical in settings like Africa, where dengue is historically underrecognized and underreported, yet evidence of endemic and epidemic transmission is growing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>].</p><p id="P6">In settings with limited data and high vulnerability, such comparative evaluations are critical to guide targeted interventions and resource allocation. For instance, ecological risk maps have been used to predict the likelihood of onward Zika virus transmission in Europe following case importations, thereby informing surveillance prioritization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Transmission potential risk maps of dengue have also been leveraged to estimate the importation risk of dengue into non-endemic regions, supporting international preparedness and prioritization of ports of entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Moreover, effective dengue risk models ideally capture both spatial and temporal dynamics, incorporating climate, population, and socio-environmental factors across diverse geographies. However, the selection of appropriate covariates remains a core challenge, as models emphasise different mechanisms and relationships between the key aspects in transmission - host, vector and virus. These differing assumptions and structures often result in divergent risk predictions, raising important questions about model comparability and validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Rather than viewing such differences as contractions, they should be understood as a reflection of the varied conceptual frameworks and objectives each model brings. In this context, risk models should be seen as complementary tools, each offering distinct insights into dengue and more broadly, vector-borne disease transmission dynamics.</p><p id="P7">One key challenge is that ecological risk mapping for dengue estimates environmental suitability for transmission, but does not directly capture actual disease burden, as case numbers are also shaped by surveillance capacity, healthcare access and socio-demographic factors. Additionally, the relationship between the probability of dengue occurrence and the intensity of transmission may be non-linear, meaning areas predicted as highly suitable do not necessarily correspond to areas with high case counts. To explore how different risk mapping approaches characterize dengue risk in Africa, we compare three widely used ecological suitability models with an incidence-based model derived using a disaggregation regression approach. This statistical approach, which has shown promise for malaria burden estimation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], downscales aggregated case data to finer spatial resolutions using covariate relationships. We train the model using detailed subnational case data from Central and South America and then apply it to Africa to generate high-resolution incidence estimates. It also allows for direct comparison with dengue risk maps and evaluation of how well a model trained in a data-rich setting performs in a data-limited context.</p><p id="P8">The dengue risk indicators used for comparison includes: (1) dengue suitability index built from dengue occurrence data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], (2) vector suitability index representing environmental suitability for <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, the primary dengue vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]; while not a direct measure of dengue risk, it offers insight into the ecological potential for transmission, and (3) transmission potential map derived from mechanistic modelling of experimental mosquito-virus interactions (<italic>Aedes Aegypti)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p><p id="P9">Beyond comparing modeling approaches, a key contribution of this study is the generation of high-resolution dengue incidence predictions for Africa, where such estimates are largely unavailable. By applying a disaggregation regression framework, we offer a practical tool that can support public health decision-making in settings where surveillance data are limited. At the same time, this work provides a critical look at how models developed in data-rich regions perform when applied to a different context, and whether more regionally tailored approaches may be needed. In doing so, we hope to contribute both a useful product and a broader reflection on how best to map and respond to dengue risk in under-surveilled parts of the world.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Dengue Disaggregation Regression in South America, Model Performance and External Validation Across Independent Countries</title><p id="P10">To estimate fine-scale dengue burden from aggregated case data, we applied a disaggregation regression model trained on subnational case reports from 14 countries in Central and South America, using data from 2018 and 2019 to maximise spatial coverage and resolution. The model uses environmental and demographic covariates to downscale aggregated case counts to ~10 km<sup>2</sup> resolution. Model performance was evaluated using 5-fold spatial block cross-validation, wherein the study area was divided into five spatial blocks of approximately equal size. We selected five spatial blocks to balance spatial representativeness with computational feasibility, as increasing the number of folds would have substantially raised the computational burden given the scale and resolution of the dataset. The model was iteratively trained on four blocks and tested on the fifth to assess predictive accuracy within the training region. The reported correlation reflects the agreement between observed and model-predicted dengue incidence at the administrative level, calculated by aggregating pixel-level model predictions and comparing them to reported surveillance data. We used Spearman’s correlation because it assesses monotonic relationships and is more robust to non-normal distributions and outliers, making it suitable for our data, which includes skewed incidence values and varying case magnitudes across regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. The posterior means and 95% credible intervals for the estimated covariate effects and hyperparameters are presented in supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>. Temperature and urban built-up areas were positively associated with dengue incidence, while normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and humidity were negatively associated. Spatial hyperparameters confirmed the presence of strong residual spatial structure, supporting the inclusion of spatial random effects in the model.</p><p id="P11">The model achieved a mean incidence correlation (Cor_I) of 0.72, calculated as the Spearman correlation between observed and predicted incidence in the selected countries of South America, suggesting moderately strong predictions within the training region. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 A&amp;B</xref> illustrates the transition from aggregated dengue case data to the resulting fine-scale predicted cases through the disaggregation regression framework. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> shows the reported dengue incidence per 100 000 inhabitants, collected at administrative levels 1 and 2 across Central and South America, highlighting areas with high reported burden, particularly in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. These data form the basis for model fitting, yet their spatial resolution is limited by the reporting standards in each country. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> shows the predicted dengue cases, modeled at ~10 km<sup>2</sup> resolution. High case concentrations are predicted in densely populated areas such as southeast Brazil, northern South America, and parts of Central America, while lower predicted case counts are observed in the southern cone.</p><p id="P12">To evaluate model generalizability, the model was then trained on all five blocks and predicted onto seven countries (Australia, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Phillipines, Saudi Arabia and Thailand) for which dengue incidence data were available at least at the first administrative level outside of Central and South America. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref> shows scatter plots comparing predicted and observed dengue incidence at the administrative level, with correlation used as evaluation metric, as it reflects per capita risk rather than absolute burden. The strongest positive correlation was observed in Myanmar (Cor_I = 0.76, p = 0.0061), followed by Australia (Cor_I = 0.51, p = 0.0062) and Thailand (Cor_I = 0.25, p = 0.0031), suggesting reasonable alignment between predictions and reported data in these settings. In contrast, Malaysia exhibited a significant negative correlation (Cor_I = -0.22, p = 0.0519), while correlations were weak in India (Cor_I = 0.26, p = 0.0121) and Philippines (Cor_I = 0.11, p = 0.0394) or non-significant in Saudi Arabia (Cor_I= 0.06, p = 0.0914). Those poor correlations may reflect a combination of factors, including differing population immunity profiles, localized vector control interventions, or inconsistencies in surveillance and reporting systems that affect the comparability of observed data across regions.</p><p id="P13">To further interpret model performance and contextualize the observed correlations, we compared reported incidence to three additional dengue risk indicators: transmission potential, vector (<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>) suitability, and dengue suitability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Figure S3</xref>). For each of the seven independent countries, we extracted these indicators by averaging the values of each risk surface over the corresponding administrative units. Transmission potential also exhibited relatively strong alignment in several countries, including Myanmar (Cor = 0.67, p = 0.001) and Australia (Cor = 0.51, p = 0.01), but was weak and insignificant in others such as Malaysia (Cor = -0.06, p = 0.08). <italic>Aedes</italic> suitability showed moderate correlations in Myanmar (Cor = 0.49, p = 0.005) and India (Cor = 0.5, p &lt; 0.001). Dengue suitability, while positively correlated in Myanmar (Cor = 0.71, p &lt; 0.001) and India (Cor = 0.57, p &lt; 0.001), displayed weak or negative associations in countries like Thailand (Cor = –0.15, p = 0.02) and Philippines (Cor = –0.11, p = 0.03). These findings highlight the challenges of transferring models across regions with differing epidemiological dynamics, surveillance systems, and population distributions.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Predicting Dengue Incidence in Africa</title><p id="P14">The trained disaggregation regression model was then applied to the African continent to generate high-resolution predictions of dengue incidence based on environmental and demographic covariates for Africa. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> shows predicted cases per 10km<sup>2</sup> in Africa, the map highlights regions of west Africa as high-burden zones, a pattern driven primarily by high incidence rate combined with large population sizes and recent urban growth. The predicted pixel-level incidence map (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Figure S4A</xref>) reveals a heterogeneous distribution of dengue risk across Africa, with areas of elevated incidence concentrated across the Sahel region of Africa (Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, northern Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, and Eritrea) and parts of eastern Ethiopia and Somalia. These spatial patterns appear to align with areas where conditions may be increasingly favorable for dengue transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. In contrast, lower predicted incidence are observed in northern and southern Africa, regions characterized by climatic conditions generally considered less suitable for <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito survival and dengue virus transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. We can further observe this pattern looking at the aggregated dengue incidence per country (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). District-level (administrative level 1) aggregation highlights subnational variation, revealing localized hotspots; particularly in Sudan, Ethiopia, and Senegal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Figure S5</xref>). We also show model uncertainty (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Figure S4B</xref>) associated with the predicted incidence across Africa and we find that much of the variation is concentrated in the Sahel region.</p><p id="P15">To explore where model predictions and reported observations align or diverge, we compared them to country-level reported (suspected) dengue cases compiled in a review by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], to which we added cases reported for the year 2024 compiled from publicly available reports. The resulting correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) was moderate (Cor_I = 0.33, p = 0.01), indicating a reasonable alignment in the ranking of countries by predicted and reported dengue burden. Several countries; including Ivory Coast (CIV), Comoros (COM) and Togo (TGO) showed close alignment between predicted and reported incidence. Others such as Mauritius (MUS) and Sao Tome and Principe (STP), the model underpredicted incidence in these countries relative to reported case numbers. Nigeria exhibits high predicted dengue incidence alongside elevated dengue suitability, vector suitability, and transmission potential. However, reported case numbers remain comparatively low. This divergence could likely reflect underreporting or gaps in surveillance rather than true absence of disease, which highlights areas that require enhanced diagnostic capacity and more robust surveillance infrastructure.</p><p id="P16">We also assessed the relationship between the three additional dengue risk indicators and country-level suspected dengue cases in Africa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Along with our predicted incidence model, dengue suitability index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) and Transmission potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) showed the strongest positive correlations with reported cases (Cor_I = 0.33 and 0.32, respectively) and vector suitability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) showed the weakest association (Cor_I = 0.22). In Burkina Faso and Senegal, while the virus-based environmental suitability model predicts relatively low suitability on average, both the vector suitability and transmission potential indices indicate elevated values. This suggests that although ecological conditions specifically favoring dengue transmission may be limited according to the dengue suitability model, the broader suitability for the vector and its conducive transmission conditions are present, highlighting a potential underestimation of dengue risk when relying solely on virus-based environmental suitability.</p><p id="P17">To examine the degree of spatial agreement between all four dengue risk indicators, we computed pixel-wise correlations (cor) between all pairs of risk maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). The highest correlation was observed between the Transmission Potential and Vector Suitability Index (cor = 0.69, p&lt;0.001), likely due to their shared reliance on temperature and humidity. The correlations between the predicted incidence and other models are moderate; cor = 0.36 (p&lt;0.001) with transmission potential, cor = 0.31 (p&lt;0.001) with vector suitability, and cor = 0.49 (p&lt;0.001) with the dengue suitability index. The dengue suitability index, derived from presence-only data, showed the weakest overall correlations with other surfaces, potentially due to differences in occurrence data quality, spatial resolution, or bias in reporting locations. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the environmental covariates used in this study (temperature, humidity, NDVI, GDP and urbanisation) revealed the distinct environmental niche occupied by each of the four dengue risk models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). In the main plot, ellipses indicate the environmental space where each model’s high predictions are concentrated. Transmission potential and vector suitability models occupy similar regions of environmental space, indicating strong alignment with climatic variables such as temperature and humidity. In contrast, the predicted incidence and dengue suitability models show more distinct and less overlapping distributions, potentially suggesting a stronger association with socio-environmental variables like GDP and urbanisation. The inset panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>) presents a PCA of the four risk model outputs, summarizing their spatial correlation structure across the study area. The PCA biplot shows that transmission potential and vector suitability align with a similar underlying gradient, while predicted incidence and dengue suitability are oriented along a different gradient.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Overlap Between Model-Predicted Incidence and Other Dengue Risk Indicators in Africa</title><p id="P18">To assess how our model qualitatively compares with existing risk frameworks, we compared the spatial estimate output from our disaggregation model: predicted incidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) and three widely used dengue risk indicators: (i) the dengue Suitability Index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), (ii) the transmission potential (Index <italic>P</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), and (iii) the vector suitability index for <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Assessing agreement and divergence among them provides insight into where models converge to flag consistently high-risk areas, and where uncertainties remain.</p><p id="P19">To enable direct spatial comparison and identify areas of high-risk concordance, we applied model-specific thresholds to each risk surface: &gt;0.5 for both the <italic>Aedes</italic> vector suitability and dengue environmental suitability indices, &gt;0.5 for the transmission potential (Index P) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], and &gt;1 predicted case (per 100k inhabitants per pixel) for the disaggregation-derived incidence map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>-<bold>Inset</bold>). We then created binary high-risk maps and overlaid them to count how many models flagged each pixel as high-risk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The comparison between all four dengue risk maps reveal high concordance across much of the coastline of West Africa, in countries such as Nigeria, Benin, Togo, Ghana and Ivory Coast. We also observe notable overlap across parts of the southern Sahel (including Burkina Faso, southern Mali, and southwestern Niger, northern part of Nigeria). In these regions, the predicted incidence from the disaggregation model aligns spatially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>-<bold>Inset</bold>) with both high transmission potential and vector suitability, suggesting that environmental and epidemiological conditions are simultaneously favorable for dengue transmission. Mauritius also seems to be at the intersection of high risk across at least three indicators.</p><p id="P20">In contrast, several areas of Eastern Africa and Central Africa exhibit elevated transmission potential and vector suitability but relatively limited overlap with the other risk maps. These mismatches may reflect underlying differences in model assumptions, such as the emphasis on ecological suitability versus actual disease burden, or differences in input datasets, including climatic baselines and mosquito surveillance data. From a public health standpoint, such discrepancies between model types underscore the importance of not overlooking regions simply because ecological models signal lower risk. Instead, these areas may represent critical frontiers for proactive surveillance and risk validation, particularly in the face of rapid urban growth and climate variability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P21">This study presents the first continent-wide estimates of subnational dengue burden in Africa using a data-driven, incidence-based modeling framework. By applying disaggregation regression to coarsely aggregated case data, we demonstrate its utility in generating fine-scale, interpretable predictions of dengue incidence; information that is directly tied to disease burden and highly relevant for public health planning. In contrast to vector or occurrence-based models, which reflect ecological suitability or presence, disaggregation regression emphasizes transmission intensity and expected case load. Crucially, our comparison of the three widely used risk mapping approaches alongside the disaggregation-derived predicted incidence reveals that these models capture different dimensions of risk and often diverge in the areas they flag as high priority. Rather than viewing these outputs as competing or conflicting, our findings underscore the importance of using them in a complementary manner to inform more robust and context-sensitive decision-making, especially in data-scarce settings like Africa.</p><p id="P22">Within the training region, the disaggregation model achieved moderate predictive accuracy (mean correlation = 0.72), capturing spatial variation in dengue burden at subnational levels. Importantly, the model preserved spatial heterogeneity in risk when downscaling to ~10 km<sup>2</sup> resolution, allowing the identification of localized predicted high-incidence clusters that would otherwise be obscured in coarser aggregated data. Across the seven countries assessed, we observed strong correlation at administrative level 1 in Myanmar and Australia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). We also found varying degrees of alignment between reported dengue cases and each of the four risk indicators at administrative level 1. Predicted incidence and transmission potential both displayed a negative correlation with reported cases in Malaysia while vector and dengue suitability displayed a positive correlation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). These results point towards the importance of considering local epidemiological contexts, health system capacities, and surveillance completeness when applying incidence-based or other risk models across regions. In particular, poor performance in some countries may reflect substantial underreporting, limited diagnostic capacity, or inconsistencies in case definitions; all of which reduce the reliability of input data and constrain the model’s ability to capture true transmission patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</p><p id="P23">Despite known challenges in building disaggregation regression models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]; particularly in data-scarce settings or when working with coarsely aggregated case data, this approach remains a valuable addition to the dengue risk mapping toolkit. While performance may be sensitive to the scale and quality of input data, especially under model misspecification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], these models offer a unique opportunity to translate available incidence data into interpretable, high-resolution surfaces. Rather than replacing other frameworks, disaggregation regression helps uncover potential transmission dynamics that may be overlooked by purely ecological or mechanistic approaches, reinforcing the value of combining multiple perspectives in areas where data limitations are the norm.</p><p id="P24">Moreover it is also important to examine both metrics: predicted incidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) and total predicted cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) to gain a comprehensive understanding of dengue risk. Incidence reflects the intensity of transmission, identifying areas where individuals face the highest likelihood of infection. This is particularly useful for detecting emerging hotspots and targeting interventions aimed at reducing transmission risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. In contrast, predicted cases are driven by both incidence and population size, offering insight into the potential burden on health systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Relying on only one of these metrics may lead to an incomplete or misleading assessment of risk; together, they provide a more nuanced picture that supports both targeted transmission control and broader resource allocation planning.</p><p id="P25">While risk projections inherently comprise large margins of uncertainty; given the lack of training data from Africa, they provide a starting point for further investigation and surveillance planning. The model identified several areas with elevated risk, including coastal West Africa and the Congo Basin, and parts of Eastern Africa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). These predictions align broadly with regions previously suggested to be vulnerable based on vector presence and climatic suitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Subnational estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) revealed localised pockets of elevated incidence, for instance, the 2023 outbreak in Ethiopia started in the Afar region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. The predicted incidence for Burkina Faso also followed closely patterns found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Moreover, our results were in line with case numbers reported in the review by Mwanyika et al., (2024) and the perspective piece by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. The moderate correlation between model-predicted case counts and reported suspected dengue cases (2013-2024) (Cor_I = 0.32) suggests that the model reasonably captures the relative distribution of dengue burden across countries, despite the lack of African data in model training. The correlation between the other three dengue risk indicators were also modest, with the highest correlation of 0.33. The weak correlations may reflect differences in reporting systems, or surveillance coverage, which can influence case detection independently of true transmission intensity.</p><p id="P27">Several methods have been developed to improve understanding of the spatial distribution of dengue burden and to identify areas at elevated risk, with the aim of informing burden estimation, enhancing preparedness, and guiding public health response strategies. Each method carries its own set of assumptions and limitations, offering a distinct perspective on dengue risk. Whether focused on ecological suitability, transmission potential, or estimated disease burden; these approaches emphasize the importance of understanding what type of information each approach is designed to capture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Comparisons between the disaggregation model and three widely used dengue risk indicators (vector suitability index, dengue suitability index, and transmission potential) revealed areas of both concordance and divergence. Overlapping high-risk zones in coastal West Africa suggest a strong signal of ecological and epidemiological suitability across models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The central region of Burkina Faso shows overlap across all four models, indicating a potential high-risk area that aligns with regions previously affected by major dengue outbreaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. We also observe overlaps across all four dengue risk indicators in regions of Eastern Africa, notably the coastal part of Kenya and Tanzania where dengue circulation has previously been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>].</p><p id="P28">However, across most parts of central Africa we observe fewer model agreements which highlight the differing assumptions, inputs, and outputs of these models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. We observe that vector suitability and transmission potential occupy more similar regions of environmental space compared to the dengue suitability and predicted incidence models. For example, the vector suitability index assumes that areas with suitable temperature and humidity for <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> are at high risk, which leads it to flag much of Angola and Zimbabwe as high-risk, where dengue occurrence data are lacking. In contrast, the disaggregation model captures actual disease burden as reflected in reported cases and is thus more directly epidemiological in nature. Moreover we identified regions where only our incidence-based model predicted elevated dengue risk (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Figure S6</xref>), including countries such as Burundi and Rwanda. In Rwanda, for example, our model estimates approximately 735 cases annually. Notably, a recent seroprevalence study reported that 30.4% of 2,286 samples tested positive for dengue antibodies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], with the highest proportion of seropositive individuals observed in the eastern region, an area that our model also highlights as having the greatest predicted burden (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Figure S5</xref>).</p><p id="P29">These divergences between approaches are not necessarily flaws but reflect the fact that different approaches intentionally seek to model distinct facets of transmission risk. In settings, where surveillance is limited or ecological data are sparse, model selection is often driven by data availability and end-user needs. While ecological niche models may highlight potential for vector presence, mechanistic models describe climate-based thresholds for transmission, and disaggregation regression translates case data into spatial burden estimates. Depending on the question at hand; whether estimating current burden, forecasting future trends, or targeting intervention, different tools may be more appropriate[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Importantly, the answers to complex global health questions may emerge from triangulating across multiple modeling frameworks, even when they yield contrasting results.</p><p id="P30">Despite its contributions, this study has several limitations. First, the disaggregation model was trained exclusively on Latin American data and applied to Africa, which may limit its accuracy in new ecological and epidemiological contexts. There are modelling avenues that need to be further explored, especially with dengue being most common in urban settings. Another key limitation is that we estimate annual incidence, which may obscure important temporal variation and mask periods of heightened transmission risk, given the seasonal nature of dengue outbreaks. The quality and granularity (e.g size of polygons/districts) of input case data varied by country, and underreporting which is common in dengue surveillance may also introduce bias. The comparisons with other risk models also rely on static surfaces and may not reflect dynamic changes in climate or transmission potential over time.</p><p id="P31">In conclusion, disaggregation regression offers a promising tool for generating high-resolution, incidence-based dengue risk maps in data-limited settings. Despite the challenges of cross-regional application, the model successfully captured meaningful spatial patterns in dengue burden and produced predictions for Africa that are broadly consistent with the distribution of reported cases to date. Our comparative analysis underscores the importance of considering both ecological suitability and epidemiological burden when mapping dengue risk, particularly in under-studied regions such as Africa. Future work should be built by incorporating multi-model approaches, improving real-time data availability, and expanding ground-truth case reporting to further strengthen public health preparedness and response.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Dengue Case Data</title><p id="P32">We compiled dengue case data from 14 countries in Central and South America where subnational surveillance records are available for the year 2019, while using data from a single year does not allow for assessment of temporal generalizability, it enables a focused evaluation of the model’s spatial prediction capacity.

mosquito-borne viral disease with expanding global impact. Accurately mapping dengue risk is essential for identifying areas of high transmission and targeting interventions effectively. Most current approaches to mapping dengue risk focus on environmental suitability for the virus or its mosquito vector, rather than estimating actual disease burden. In this study, we used an incidence-based approach; disaggregation regression, to estimate dengue cases at high spatial resolution using national and regional case data from Latin America. We then applied the model to Africa, where surveillance data are limited, and compared its predictions to three other common types of dengue risk maps. Our results showed that while all approaches provided some insight into geographic risk patterns, they often highlighted different areas as priorities. Our incidence-based model captured both where dengue might occur and how intense transmission may be, helping bridge the gap between environmental and ecological suitability of transmission and real-world disease burden. This approach can support more informed decision-making in areas with limited surveillance and guide targeted control efforts.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>From reported dengue cases to model-predicted incidence across Central and South America.</title><p>Panel (A) shows aggregated reported dengue case counts at administrative levels 1 and 2 for the year 2019, used as input for model fitting.
