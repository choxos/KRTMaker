This includes the formation of membrane-less cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein structures called stress granules (SGs) that sequester and protect mRNAs encoding many housekeeping genes. SGs are not static biomolecular condensates but transform into solid states during a maturation phase. Although SG maturation is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative pathologies, little is known about the mechanisms and physiological relevance underlying the maturation process. Here we show that yeast SGs mature into a solid-like state during long-term stationary phase stress, which delays SG disassembly and cell cycle restart. Profiling of phosphorylation sites during stationary phase revealed that SG maturation is driven by protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of the SG proteome. Indeed, upon stationary phase the catalytic PKA subunits condense in SGs where they maintain kinase activity, while during this time cytoplasmic PKA is inhibited. PKA-mediated phosphorylation of key SG components, like the pyruvate kinase Cdc19, is necessary and sufficient for its timely accumulation in SGs, where Cdc19 assembles into amyloid-like structures. Importantly, inhibiting PKA during long-term stationary phase prevents SG maturation, delaying ordered re-start of cell growth after re-feeding. Taken together, these results describe a SG maturation mechanism, selectively activated during chronic stress, that preserves SG integrity and promotes cell survival.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P5"><fig id="F8" position="anchor"><label>Graphical Abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS207147-f008"/></fig>

This includes profound rearrangements of their cytoplasm, like viscoadaptation and the assembly of non-membrane bound compartments such as stress granules (SGs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. SGs have been well studied in yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, in which acute, transient stress such as e.g. rapid heat shock, provokes an immediate reaction, in contrast to prolonged stress e.g. long-term starvation, which initiates a chronic stress response to prepare cells for long-term cell survival <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Studying SGs during chronic stress conditions may be more relevant to unveil their involvement in human diseases that often last months to several years.</p><p id="P7">With both transient and prolonged stress, SG formation starts by signaling pathways that stall translation initiation, causing ribosomes to run-off their transcripts. Released RNA molecules (mRNAs), associated with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), such as Pub1 and Ded1, and translation initiation factors then coalesce into SGs that are initially small and dynamic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. SGs are thought to have a primary function to protect released and sequestered mRNAs and RBPs from degradation, leaving free ribosomes to preferentially engage stress response transcripts to resolve stress induced damage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. But this simple model of SGs as a transcript reservoir is incomplete. Indeed, despite a global shutdown of translation, only ~10-15% of bulk mRNA accumulates in SGs and some still undergo translation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Moreover, inhibiting SG formation has no effect on mRNA half-life and cells are still able to inhibit translation of housekeeping proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Thus, a more thorough understanding of the physiological functions of SGs will require the dissection of critical components, regulatory mechanisms and cellular phenotypes.</p><p id="P8">Yeast SGs contain a conserved set of proteins, which may vary with the type of stress and duration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. SG components include various metabolic enzymes, such as the pyruvate kinase Cdc19, which assembles into rigid, enzymatically inactive amyloid-like structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. This structural conversion is initiated by a stress-induced decrease in cytosolic pH, which directly regulates protonation of a short amyloid-core motif in Cdc19 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Importantly, disassembly of Cdc19 aggregates is required to restart ATP synthesis after stress release, thereby coupling cell growth and metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">In addition to metabolic enzymes, SGs also sequester signaling components such as the Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1) and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. These growth promoting kinases control many cellular processes during exponential growth, including metabolism and cell cycle progression, and their inactivation is important for cells to respond to stress, such as nutrient starvation, and sporulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. PKA is composed of the partially redundant catalytic subunits Tpk1, Tpk2, and Tpk3, which are activated by the Ras-cAMP signaling pathway through dissociating the inhibitory subunit Bcy1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. During exponential growth the PKA subunits are mostly nuclear and cytoplasmic, while Tpk2, and in part Tpk3, associate with P-bodies and SGs during stationary phase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Thus, SGs may generally sequester and protect essential cellular components to allow stress survival, but it remains obscure why PKA and other signaling components are recruited into SGs.</p><p id="P10">While SGs are initially small and mobile, they undergo a maturation phase upon prolonged stress conditions, characterized by a liquid-to-solid phase transition, changing their composition, structure and dynamics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. As aberrant, matured SGshave been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD), it is believed that physiological SGs mature into irreversible, pathological aggregates during disease onset <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. However, it remains unclear whether SG maturation itself is merely a feature of an aberrant development, or rather a physiological process to protect SG integrity and function during prolonged stress conditions that can go out of control.</p><p id="P11">Here, we show that yeast SGs mature into a hardened state during long-term starvation, accompanied by a global increase in phosphorylation of the SG proteome. This conversion is mediated by PKA, which accumulates in SGs and alters their biophysical properties in chronic, long-term starvation, but not acute heat stress conditions. Surprisingly, localized PKA maintains its kinase activity in SGs upon starvation, phosphorylating Cdc19 and other SG components at specific sites, in contrast to cytoplasmic PKA, which is inhibited as expected. PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc19 is necessary and sufficient for timely SG localization and promotes its structural transition into an amyloid-like state. Our data suggest that PKA-mediated SG maturation is functionally important for the ordered restart of cell growth after stress release.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Yeast stress granules mature during long-term stationary phase</title><p id="P12">To study the mechanisms regulating SG maturation, we characterized SG structures marked with mCherry-tagged Ded1 and GFP-tagged Cdc19 during long-term stationary phase stress in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Starting 24 hours after inoculation during exponential phase, the SG markers Cdc19 and Ded1 began to localize in cytoplasmic foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>). While the number of SGs stayed constant throughout the time course, their average size increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>), indicating that SGs gradually accumulate macromolecules. Indeed, SG density measured by quantitative phase imaging (QPI)-microscopy increased upon prolonged starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) revealed that the mobility of Cdc19 in SGs decreased during stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B and 1E</xref>), implying SG solidification. Consistent with this notion, sedimentation assays demonstrated that the fraction of soluble Cdc19 decreased with increasing time in stationary phase, in contrast to exponential growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1F</xref> and quantification 1G). To elucidate whether decreased SG dynamics and solubility are accompanied by structural re-arrangements, we probed the amyloid transition of Cdc19 by measuring its SDS resistance. Indeed, starting at day 5 and 6, but most prominent at day 7 and 8, a SDS-resistant Cdc19 fraction was apparent, characteristic of an amyloid-like state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). As a control, we analyzed the prion Sup35, which showed the expected SDS-resistance in its prion [PSI+] state but not its non-prion [psi-] state at day 8 of stationary phase. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SG foci, marked by Cdc19, change their biophysical properties as they mature in yeast cells exposed to prolonged starvation conditions.</p><p id="P13">To examine whether SG maturation has functional consequences, we characterized the recovery of yeast cells that were maintained in stationary phase for different times. Interestingly, after refeeding, the lag time before biomass accumulation increased proportionally with the time spent under starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). Although the number of dead cells increased during stationary phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>), the delayed biomass accumulation after refeeding scaled with the re-budding kinetics of individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>). Moreover, re-budding correlated with prior dissolution of Cdc19 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1K</xref> and quantification 1L), suggesting that cells resolubilize their SGs before cell cycle entry. We conclude that SG maturation during long-term stationary phase leads to slower SG disassembly and delayed cell cycle restart upon nutrient re-addition.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Stress granule proteins become increasingly phosphorylated during long-term stationary phase</title><p id="P14">To identify the mechanisms governing SG maturation, we profiled phosphorylation events during long-term starvation. Proliferating cells (Expo) were grown into stationary phase, and samples were harvested at different times from day one to day eight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). As a control, we included cells treated with the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, which, like nutrient depletion, triggers cell cycle arrest in G1, but does not lead to the formation of stress granules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. After lysis and protein digestion, each sample was split: in one half phosphopeptides were enriched, while the other half was analyzed as full proteome without phosphopeptide enrichment to normalize for protein abundance. In both cases, samples were acquired using a DIA-MS workflow <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. We focused on phosphopeptides that exhibited significant intensity level changes (ANOVA, p-value BH-adjusted &lt;0.01 and absolute log2(fold change)&gt;1) compared to the overall mean of all conditions. Following this analysis, we identified 16’908 phosphopeptides belonging to 11’369 phosphosites from 1’564 proteins (~27% of all yeast proteins, assuming 5’800 total proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000002311">www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000002311</ext-link>)). Among 11’369 phosphosites significantly regulated, 6’595 sites are listed in the BioGRID PTM database (version 4.3.194, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>), while 4’774 sites are new and were not previously annotated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that phosphorylation changes are more pronounced compared to the changes at protein levels, indicating that stationary phase is predominantly regulated by post-translational mechanisms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a clear separation of samples from exponential growth phase or rapamycin treatment. Moreover, phosphorylation changes also differ among samples taken at different days in stationary phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>), implying a regulated maturation process.</p><p id="P15">Unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on the profiles of significantly changing phosphopeptides resulted in 12 distinct clusters, ensuring maximum separation between cluster centers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2C and S2D</xref>).

Interestingly, cluster 9 combines 1’238 phosphosites that showed a continuous, gradual increase in intensity over the long-term stationary phase time course. Gene ontology analysis revealed that cluster 9 is enriched in proteins functionally linked to RNA/mRNA-binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>) and characterized as components of cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules and cytoplasmic stress granules (e.g. Cdc19 and Ded1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), including many identified by proximity dependent ligation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.

Taken together, this comprehensive time resolved analysis revealed that many SG components are gradually phosphorylated during stationary phase, thus correlating with SG maturation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates stress granule proteins during stationary phase</title><p id="P16">To identify the kinase(s) phosphorylating SG components during stationary phase, we inferred kinase-substrates relationships using the NetworKIN algorithm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. This method predicted potential kinases for all starvation-regulated phosphorylation clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), displaying for cluster 9 a significant enrichment for eight kinases (highlighted in red). This analysis was validated via a microscopy screen with fluorescently tagged candidate kinases, which confirmed that from the kinases predicted for cluster 9: Prk1, Tpk2, Tpk3 and Hrr25 assembled cytoplasmic foci during stationary phase, while the other kinases diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm or localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>, highlighted in red). The identification of Tpk2 and Tpk3 is further supported by the presence of the PKA consensus motif (R-R-X-S/T-Y <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>) in many phosphosites of cluster 9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>), as well as stable or increased Tpk2 and Tpk3 levels during starvation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>). While nuclear and diffuse under exponential growth conditions, GFP-tagged Tpk2 and Tpk3 accumulated in SGs during stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A</xref>), in contrast to the inhibitory subunit Bcy1 that remained solely cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B</xref> and overview PKA life cycle S3D) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Based on these data we speculate that upon recruitment into SGs, PKA progressively phosphorylates SG components during prolonged starvation.</p><p id="P17">It is generally assumed that PKA is active during exponential phase but inactivated upon nutrient starvation to allow cell cycle exit, and the nuclear import of the transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 that activate the expression of many stress defense genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Yet, our results suggest that PKA remains active in SGs during stress conditions. To clarify this apparent paradox, we used a strain harboring an analog-sensitive (as) variant of endogenous PKA (<italic>pka-as</italic>) that can be specifically inhibited by the ATP analog NM-PP1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. As expected, the bonafide PKA substrate Msn2 accumulated in the nucleus when its phosphorylation was abolished by treating exponentially growing <italic>pka-as</italic> cells with NM-PP1, but rapidly relocalized to the cytoplasm upon washout of the inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3E</xref>). To directly test whether PKA phosphorylates SG components during starvation but uncouple possible effects of PKA on cell cycle exit, NM-PP1 was added after <italic>pka-as</italic> cells enter starvation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3F</xref>). We confirmed that Msn2-GFP accumulated in the nucleus before NM-PP1 addition, validating that the starved cells had already inactivated cytoplasmic PKA and initiated G1 exit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3F</xref>, upper panel). Moreover, Msn2-GFP remained in the nucleus after prolonged starvation, irrespective of whether PKA was further inhibited by NM-PP1 addition. To explore which phosphosites are regulated by PKA in exponential growing and starved cells, we performed phosphorylation profiling in the presence or absence of the inhibitor NM-PP1. As expected, adding NM-PP1 to exponentially growing <italic>pka-as</italic> cells downregulated predicted PKA phosphosites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3G</xref>). Strikingly, this analysis (Table 2) showed that phosphorylation sites identified in the previous experiment in cluster 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), and in particular SG components, were phosphorylated in a PKA-dependent manner in stationary phase (8 days), but not during exponential growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3H</xref>). Gene ontology enrichment analysis confirmed PKA dependent phosphorylation of cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules, stress granules (GO Cellular Component) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) and components involved in RNA/mRNA binding (GO Molecular Function) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3I</xref>) after 8 days in stationary phase, in contrast to cytosolic proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Together, these results show remarkable PKA dependent phosphorylation of many SG components during stationary phase.</p><p id="P18">To validate these data, we exploited targeted proteomics (Table 2) to quantify phosphorylation sites in Msn2 and Cdc19. Phospho-enrichment showed that Cdc19 was hyperphosphorylated upon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref> from dataset presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), showing gradual increase of phosphorylated S56, S70 and S175 in its catalytic domain during stationary phase. Indeed, PRM analysis confirmed that S56 and S70 were phosphorylated during stationary phase and this phosphorylation was dependent on PKA activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>, top and bottom). Surprisingly however, neither S56 nor S70 were phosphorylated by PKA in exponentially growing cells, although cytoplasmic PKA is fully active under these conditions. As expected, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Msn2 on S288 was high in exponentially growing cells but abolished upon PKA inhibition, whereas Msn2-S288 phosphorylation was low in stationary cells in the presence or absence of NM-PP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>).

Active Cdc19 exists as tetramers, which dissociate into monomers upon nutrient depletion, prone to assembly into amyloid-like fibers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. It is possible that these PKA phosphorylation sites are not accessible in Cdc19 tetramers and are only exposed in Cdc19 monomers or amyloid fibrils.

It is possible that untimely release of ATP-consuming proteins from SGs deplete limited energy resources. Similarly, mRNAs may be liberated without re-engaging with translating ribosomes, leading to their degradation. We speculate that orchestrated assembly and dissolution of SGs might help to preserve limited energy resources and critical functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7I</xref>). Alternatively, SG maturation might contribute to efficiently shut down cellular metabolism under prolonged stress conditions. Indeed, metabolomic analysis revealed that several key metabolites do not decrease as expected during stationary phase when PKA is inhibited (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). For example, Cdc19 continues to metabolize PEP to produce pyruvate, which in turn enters the citric acid cycle to produce alfa-ketoglutarate. Continued energy metabolism may thus deplete important resources during starvation, explaining delayed ATP synthesis after glucose re-addition.

The search parameters were as follows: ± 25 ppm peptide mass tolerance, semi-tryptic specificity, two missed cleavages allowed, cysteine carbamidomethylation as fixed modification and methionine oxidation as variable modifications. For the phospho-enriched analysis, phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues were considered as variable modification. Results were further processed using peptideProphet and filtered at 1% FDR (PSM level). A consensus library for phospho-enriched (ConsPhosphoLib_luciphor_openswath_curated_concat.tsv) and not enriched (ConsNonEnrichedLib_openswath_curated.tsv) datasets were generated using SpectraST using the following parameters: 5 most intense fragments per peptide (charge 1+ or 2+), y or b fragment ions for each spectrum within the mass range 350-2000 m/z.

Phosphopeptide abundance (22’121) was calculated from the average intensity of filtered phosphoprecursors. The average of phosphopeptides per condition was normalized for the average abundance per condition of proteins containing the phosphoprecursor.

The number of clusters (12) was determined by minimizing intra-cluster variance and maximizing the average silhouette. Before clustering, data were standardized to ensure that all normalized phosphopeptides across all conditions had a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Only phosphopeptides with a minimum membership threshold of 0.6 were assigned to a specific cluster, otherwise they were assigned as “cluster NA”. To calculate protein abundance from the non-enriched dataset, intensities of precursors were log2 transformed and then normalized using the median across all runs. Precursors identified sparsely across the matrix were filtered out (44’072 precursors identified in duplicate in at least one condition being considered). Missing values were imputed as described above for the phosphorylation dataset. Protein abundance for each condition was determined by averaging the levels of all identified precursors per protein, considering only proteins with at least three precursors.

The search parameters were set to include semi-tryptic peptides, maximum two missed cleavage, carbamidomethyl as static peptide modification, oxidation (M), deamidation N terminal, phosphorylation (S, T, Y) as variable modification and “match between runs” option. The MS and MS/MS mass tolerance were set to 20 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. False discovery rate of &lt; 1% was used at the PSM level. Phosphorylation sites identified in the table “Phospho (STY)Sites.txt” were filter for localization (localization score &gt; 0.6) and only phosphosites identified at least in two replicates in at least one conditions were considered (7’152 phosphosites identified). Intensity values of phosphorylation sites were log2 transformed, median normalized and imputed using random sampling from a normal distribution generated from the 1% lower intense values of the whole dataset. ANOVA statistical analysis was performed to identify significantly regulated phosphorylation sites (p-values were corrected for multiple hypothesis using Benjamin Hochberg method).

The identification of kinase-substrate relationships was calculated by NetworKIN algorithm and the identification of kinases significantly enriched was assessed by hypergeometric test with the background set consisting of the identified phosphosites in the dataset. For targeted PRM analysis, peptides were manually examined using Skyline daily software <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref></sup>. Endogenous phosphorylated peptides were identified by matching the coelution and peak shapes of precursor and product ions with those of the reference peptides. Quantification was carried out using data from the file “Transition_Results_240608.csv,” summing five fragment ions per peptide. The intensity of endogenous peptides was normalized to the intensity of the heavy peptides. After log2 transformation and normalization against the mean phosphorylation intensities in the exponential condition without treatment, the significance of changes was evaluated using p-values obtained from two-sided, unpaired t-tests.

Shown are representative AFM images and the height (<bold>F</bold>) and length (<bold>G</bold>) profiles of Cdc19 assemblies taken during pre-fibril formation quantified in two independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined by an unpaired t-test.</p><p><bold>(H)</bold> (Model – Part 1) During growth conditions (“No stress”), the catalytic PKA subunits (green) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs, pink and purple) are dispersed in the cytosol. Ribosomes translate housekeeping mRNAs and stress granules (SG) are absent. Upon nutrient depletion in stationary phase (“Early-Phase Stress”), complexes of RNA and RBPs assemble SGs, and sequester active PKA, while its regulatory subunit Bcy1 remains cytoplasmic. Active PKA in SGs gradually phosphorylate(s) SG components, leading to maturation into a solid state (“Chronic Stress”), together with other factors such as the co-aggregation of misfolding-prone proteins, and counteracted by chaperones such as Hsp104. SG constituents mature into a solid state that is non-dynamic and inactive, and some, like the metabolic enzyme Cdc19, adopt amyloid-like structures. In contrast, the catalytic “active” PKA subunits remain dynamic and active, and thus are in a more liquid-like subdomain.</p><p><bold>(I)</bold> (Model – Part 2) PKA activity inside SGs (top) during chronic stress matures SG components incl. metabolic enzymes, which inhibits catalytic activity and decreases metabolic flux to preserve limited energy resources required to efficiently restart growth after stress subsides. Experimental inhibition of PKA during chronic stress (bottom) prevents SG maturation, enforcing a liquid-like state with residual activity of metabolic enzymes during stationary phase. This increased SG fluidity consumes critical energy resources and as a result delays growth restart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207147-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
