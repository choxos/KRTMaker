Through the activation of cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptors (CB<sub>1</sub>R) expressed by neurons and oligodendrocyte lineage cells, endocannabinoid signaling restricts neurodegeneration and promote remyelination in preclinical MS models. However, despite accumulating evidence that supports a crucial role for these receptor populations in brain physiology and pathology, the implications of astrocyte CB<sub>1</sub>R signaling in MS initiation and progression remain uncertain. Using complementary <italic>in vivo</italic> disease models, here we investigated the effects of targeted genetic deletion of astrocytes CB<sub>1</sub>R on the expression of MS-like pathology in mice. Interestingly, astrocyte-specific deletion of CB<sub>1</sub>R reduced demyelinating neuropathology, attenuated astrocyte reactivity and improved clinical deficits during the time-course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Mice with astrocyte CB<sub>1</sub>R inactivation displayed unaltered oligodendrocyte populations both in EAE lesions and in lysolecithin-induced remyelinating spinal cord lesions, likely excluding that astrocyte CB<sub>1</sub>R modulate myelin repair processes. Conversely, inactivation of CB<sub>1</sub>R in astroglial cells restricted humoral and leukocyte parenchymal infiltration and reduced the expression of vascular effectors in EAE lesions. Finally, loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) function induced by cortical microinjection of VEGF-A was less severe in GFAP-CB<sub>1</sub>R-KO mice.</p><p id="P2">These results show that astrocyte CB<sub>1</sub>R signaling constitutes a significant pro-inflammatory mechanism in MS and bring to light a deleterious role for endocannabinoid-mediated modulation of astroglial cells with potential implications in the etiopathology and therapy of neuroinflammatory disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>Astrocyte</kwd><kwd>CB<sub>1</sub> receptors</kwd><kwd>Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</kwd><kwd>Blood-brain barrier</kwd><kwd>Remyelination</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and one of the most prevalent neurological disorders leading to chronic disability among young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). The main pathological hallmark of MS is the formation of demyelinating lesions in the brain and spinal cord associated to neuroaxonal degeneration as primary substrate of the irreversible clinical deficits that characterize disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Focal lesions in MS are thought to be caused by the bidirectional interaction between peripheral immune cells that infiltrate into the CNS parenchyma, including T cells, B cells and myeloid cells, and activated resident immune cells, mainly astrocytes and microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). A subset of lesions in MS patients are characterized by a variable extent of remyelination suggested as a mechanism of neuroprotection and clinical recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). At present, treatment strategies for clinical exacerbation in MS include almost exclusively immunotherapeutic drugs that target peripheral immune cells and their trafficking into the CNS and lead to a substantial reduction in lesion formation and clinical relapse rate but do not prevent the progression of clinical disability.</p><p id="P4">Astrocytes support brain homeostasis and function through a plethora of mechanisms that include the modulation of synaptic transmission through the release of gliotransmitters, the metabolic assistance to neurons and oligodendrocytes and the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), among others. In recent years, complementary lines of evidence have shown that astrocytes adopt a wide spectrum of reactive states during neuroinflammation that confer these cells the potential to exacerbate damage or facilitate repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Aberrant astrocyte activation critically contributes to inflammatory lesion formation and progression in MS through the release of molecules that promote the loss of BBB integrity and the recruitment of peripheral immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). However, astrocytes may also facilitate the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPCs) and support the survival of mature oligodendrocytes to ensure successful remyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). An improved understanding of astrocyte regulatory mechanisms in neuroinflammatory contexts may thus provide novel therapeutic targets that reduce MS pathology and clinical severity during acute and progressive phases of the disease.</p><p id="P5">Cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) is one of the most abundant G protein-coupled receptors in the mammalian brain and the primary molecular target of endogenous cannabinoids - anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol - and Δ<sup>9-</sup>tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of the hemp plant <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Endocannabinoids acting on CB<sub>1</sub>R heterogeneously expressed in neuronal populations and glial cells modulate physiological brain functions through a wide variety of mechanisms and exhibit neuroprotective potential during CNS damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Pharmacological and genetic studies conducted so far have demonstrated that cannabinoid agents that potentiate CB<sub>1</sub>R-mediated signaling attenuate neurodegeneration and suppress neuroinflammation while promoting myelin repair in rodent models of MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). However, the clinical efficacy of cannabinoid-based medications in MS is limited, and therapeutic optimization requires a better understanding of endocannabinoid and CB<sub>1</sub>R related networks in inflammatory demyelinating contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). On mechanistic grounds, there is consensus that the neuronal population of CB<sub>1</sub>R provides neuroprotection from excitotoxic damage in rodent models of MS by limiting synaptic glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Experimental <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence from conditional mutant mice has also recently grounded the hypothesis that CB<sub>1</sub>R expressed by OPCs promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and favor remyelination in MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). However, the implications of CB<sub>1</sub>R in astrocytes during MS onset and progression have been largely neglected despite the fundamental contribution of these receptor pools as effectors of (endo)cannabinoid-mediated signaling in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Indeed, CB<sub>1</sub>R activity has arisen during the last decade as crucial modulator of astrocyte-derived gliotransmitter release and metabolic supply with emerging implications in neuroinflammatory disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>)</p><p id="P6">In this study, we aimed at disentangling the roles of astrocyte CB<sub>1</sub>R (aCB<sub>1</sub>R) signaling in MS neuropathology using mice where this receptor population is selectively ablated in astroglial cells and a combination of rodent models that recapitulate autoimmune demyelination, BBB breakdown and myelin repair. Our results highlight that aCB<sub>1</sub>R exacerbates neurological disability during autoimmune demyelination by fostering BBB permeability and recruitment of peripheral immune cells towards lesion sites. These observations identify a previously unexpected pathogenic role of aCB<sub>1</sub>R during CNS inflammatory lesion formation with potential implications in MS pathogeny and therapy.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mice</title><p id="P7">All experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council Committee, 2011) and the European Communities Council Directive of 22 September 2010 (2010/63/EU74).

To gain further insights on the mechanistic implications of aCB<sub>1</sub>R during autoimmune inflammation we addressed the expression of immune and vascular effector molecules at acute EAE disease. The expression levels of <italic>Ccl2</italic>, <italic>Ccl5</italic> and <italic>Cxcl2</italic> determined by RT-qPCR in spinal cord lysates of EAE mice were highly heterogeneous and not significantly modulated in the aCB<sub>1</sub>-KO group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). Conversely, gene expression analysis highlighted significantly lower levels of <italic>Icam1</italic> and <italic>Vcam1</italic> that were confirmed by immunoblotting and confocal imaging of spinal cord tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4a-b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S5a-b</xref>). Moreover, double immunostaining for GFAP and ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 showed reduced expression of both adhesion molecules in astrocytic profiles within EAE lesions and perilesion areas of aCB<sub>1</sub>-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). Of note, VEGF-A expression was drastically downregulated in spinal cord tissue and reactive astrocyte profiles of aCB<sub>1</sub>-KO mice as compared to the aCB<sub>1</sub>-WT group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S5a-b</xref>).

To further investigate potential links between astrocyte CB<sub>1</sub>R and BBB breakdown <italic>in vivo</italic>, we analyzed the effects of VEGF-A in astrocyte-specific CB<sub>1</sub>R null mice. We stereotactically delivered mouse VEGF-A<sub>165</sub> into the left cerebral cortex of aCB<sub>1</sub>-KO mice and littermate aCB<sub>1</sub>-WT animals and measured changes in barrier function at 2 days post-lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>). Compatible with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>), we observed BBB breakdown measured by fibrinogen and IgG immunoreactivity in VEGF-A<sc>165</sc>-injected areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). The endothelial TJ markers CDH-5 and ZO-1 appeared patchy and discontinuous in both aCB<sub>1</sub>-WT and a-CB<sub>1</sub>-KO mice and these changes were accompanied by parenchymal accumulation of CD45<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). Importantly, BBB disruption, as measured by serum protein and immune cell extravasation, was attenuated in aCB<sub>1</sub>-KO mice despite unaltered expression levels of CHD-5, ZO-1 and the endothelial cell maker PODXL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5c-d</xref>). Reminiscent of our observations in the EAE lesions, aCB<sub>1</sub>R null mice showed reduced astrocyte reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5e</xref>), and lower levels of the astrocyte TJ protein CLN-4 in areas of BBB disruption but not of CLN-1(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5f</xref>). These studies show that aCB<sub>1</sub>R engages mechanisms downstream of VEGF-A that promote BBB leakiness and allows for the infiltration of peripheral immune during inflammatory lesion formation.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S25" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P37">Studies conducted during the past decades have demonstrated that CB<sub>1</sub>R signaling restricts clinical disability in MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Potential mechanisms for (endo)cannabinoid-mediated protection mediated by CB<sub>1</sub>R in MS patients include neuroprotective and remyelination promoting effects, as defined by analyzing the phenotype of constitutive CB<sub>1</sub>R-KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) and transgenic mice lacking CB<sub>1</sub>R on neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) and OPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) in preclinical disease models. However, the specific roles of CB<sub>1</sub>R expressed by astrocytes in MS have remained largely neglected despite the critical involvement of these cells in disease initiation and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), and the emerging implications of the astrocyte CB<sub>1</sub>R pools in endocannabinoid-related modulation of brain functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>). This study is the first to our knowledge that highlights the significance of CB<sub>1</sub>R endocannabinoid signaling mediated by astrocytes in the generation of clinical deficits in CNS inflammatory disease. Upon characterizing the phenotype of mice lacking aCB<sub>1</sub>R in models of acute and chronic CNS damage, we depict an unprecedented deleterious role of CB<sub>1</sub>R in astroglial cells during inflammatory lesion formation linked to the modulation of BBB permeability. On mechanistic grounds, we show that aCB<sub>1</sub>R deletion restricts humoral and cellular leakage associated to BBB disruption, at least in part, by engaging cellular processes downstream VEGF-A signaling. These observations uncover a novel mechanism underlying astrocyte-related control of the BBB in inflammatory CNS disease and shed light on the roles of endocannabinoids and CB<sub>1</sub>R in MS pathogeny.</p><p id="P38">In this study, we show protective effects of astrocytic CB<sub>1</sub>R inactivation during the time-course of EAE at the clinical and neuropathological level. Attenuation of neurological disability occurred in concert with changes in astrocyte reactivity and expression of molecules related to the acquisition of disease promoting functions in MS patients and preclinical disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). These observations are consistent with a scenario in which astrocytic CB<sub>1</sub>R signaling facilitates the emergence of neurotoxic phenotypes that impede astrocyte-oligodendrocyte interactions underlying myelin repair as potential mechanism of disease exacerbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Studies specifically designed to investigate the involvement of cell autonomous astrocyte responses mediated by CB<sub>1</sub>R in remyelination are currently lacking. Thus, we addressed this possibility by histologically targeting oligodendrocyte populations in lesion and perilesion areas of aCB<sub>1</sub>-KO mice at acute EAE disease. This analysis did not evidence significant modulatory effects encompassing the attenuation of inflammation and myelin pathology that resulted from deletion of astrocytic CB<sub>1</sub>R. Consistently, analysis of remyelinating spinal cord lesions induced by microinjection of LPC did not highlight oligodendrocyte differentiation promoting effects in astrocyte-specific CB<sub>1</sub>R null mice. Although the possibility that endocannabinoids target CB<sub>1</sub>R in astroglial cells to modulate remyelination <italic>in vivo</italic> cannot be fully disregarded in the absence of a detailed myelin ultrastructure analysis during the time-course of myelin repair, these results suggest that astrocytic CB<sub>1</sub>R do not impede remyelination as potential mechanism of clinical exacerbation in demyelinating disease.</p><p id="P39">Our present data support the hypothesis that astrocyte responses to CB<sub>1</sub>R signaling modulate the formation of CNS lesions as principal mechanism of disease exacerbation. This possibility sits well with the fundamental roles of astroglial cells in regulating the BBB breakdown during CNS inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) and with reports of enriched CB<sub>1</sub>R expression in perivascular astrocytic profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Indeed, the clinical benefits of astrocyte-specific CB<sub>1</sub>R inactivation during EAE are observed at the onset of neurological symptomatology and occur in concert with reduced inflammatory lesion load at established disease, both in cortical and spinal cord tissue. These observations prompted us to investigate the phenotype of aCB<sub>1</sub>-KO mice in terms of BBB disruption during EAE. Here, as expected if CB<sub>1</sub>R in astrocytes would promote BBB permeability defects allowing circulating inflammation to enter the CNS parenchyma, aCB<sub>1</sub>-KO mice exhibited lower levels of humoral mediators and infiltrating leukocytes in inflammatory demyelinating EAE lesions and surrounding perilesion areas. Notably, these changes were associated with reduced expression levels of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 by reactive astrocytes in EAE lesions. These findings may explain, at least in part, the restricted presence of infiltrating immune cells observed in mice with astrocyte-specific CB<sub>1</sub>R deletion, according to the established roles of both adhesion molecules in mediating leukocyte movement across the BBB during CNS inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). Reactive astrocytes in EAE lesions from aCB<sub>1</sub>-KO mice also exhibited lower levels of the angiogenic and pro-permeability factor VEGF-A, identified as a key driver of astrocyte-mediated BBB disruption, leukocyte infiltration and neuropathology during CNS inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Reductions in astrocyte VEGF-A expression might directly limit leukocyte entry as primary mechanism underlying reduced lesion load in astrocyte-specific CB<sub>1</sub>R null mice. Concomitantly, lower levels of adhesion molecules or other potential astrocyte mediators may further restrict BBB permeability as evolving inflammation drives astrocyte VEGF-A expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>). Using the focal, directly induced VEGF-A model in transgenic mice allowed us to selectively examine the role of CB<sub>1</sub>R-related astrocyte responses on BBB breakdown and lymphocyte entry downstream this vascular effect molecule. Critically, mice with astrocyte-specific CB<sub>1</sub>R deletion showed milder humoral and cellular extravasation induced by VEGF-A, thus mirroring the restricted inflammatory phenotype observed in EAE lesions. Altogether, these findings suggest that CB<sub>1</sub>R signaling in astrocytes facilitates the formation of CNS inflammatory lesions by targeting effector mechanisms engaged by VEGF-A that promote BBB disruption.</p><p id="P40">Our combined observations reflect a general protective astrocytic phenotype in terms of BBB permeability resulting from CB<sub>1</sub>R deletion in astroglial cells. Notably, these changes occurred in concert with reduced levels of the astrocyte TJ protein CLN-4, whose induction has been associated to the emergence of a protective astrocyte barrier that limits the access of peripheral inflammation to the CNS parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). These seemingly contradictory findings can be explained on the basis that the evolving inflammation in lesions sites, which we find to be significantly reduced in mice lacking aCB<sub>1</sub>R, is a driving force for the induction of junctional adhesion proteins at the glia limitants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). A striking observation in this study, however, is that attenuated parenchymal leakage of circulating inflammation in lesions from astrocyte-specific CB<sub>1</sub>R was not encompassed by significant endothelium abnormalities, as expected according to reports that BBB breakdown results from disruptions of endothelial junctional proteins such as CLN-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Nevertheless, our present findings do not exclude the possibility that astrocyte-specific CB<sub>1</sub>R null mice exhibit preserved endothelial barrier functions at initial stages of BBB dysfunction in the EAE and VEGF-A models, as compared to non-transgenic animals. Disruption of the BBB precedes immune cell infiltration during CNS lesion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>) and it seems plausible that early-onset differences in endothelial permeability between genotypes are masked at later states by the evolving inflammatory neuropathology. Future studies targeting the time-course of CNS lesion formation <italic>in vivo</italic> combined with clinically relevant <italic>in vitro</italic> models of BBB dysfunction may uncover the mechanistic basis of astrocyte signaling to endothelial cells under the control of endocannabinoids and astrocytic CB<sub>1</sub>R pools that lead to clinical exacerbation during demyelinating disease.</p><p id="P41">Endocannabinoids and their exogenous counterparts dampen CNS inflammation in multiple disease paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). However, there is a paucity of studies that investigate the signaling events engaged by these lipid mediators at the BBB permeability level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>). In this context, available evidence supports a protective role for CB<sub>1</sub>R expressed by endothelial cells in attenuating leukocyte transmigration induced by Theiler’s virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>). More recently, perivascular astrocyte CB<sub>1</sub>R has been postulated to promote stress resilience in mice through the preservation of BBB functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). In this landmark study, viral-mediated astrocyte overexpression of CB<sub>1</sub>R mitigated inflammatory responses and morphological changes in the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model of depression. These observations are in apparent contrast with our present findings that astrocyte CB<sub>1</sub>R deletion preserves BBB function and restrains circulating inflammation to enter the brain parenchyma. It should be noted, however, that stress-induced inflammation and autoimmune demyelination are intrinsically different disease contexts that involve dissimilar etiopathological mechanisms. Furthermore, the protective phenotype of astrocyte CB<sub>1</sub>R at the vascular level reported by Dudek and collaborators was ascribed to astrocyte populations within the nucleus accumbens shell in male mice resilient to CSDS. Conversely, this study, that we performed in female mice, suggests more generalized mechanisms underlying the control of BBB permeability by astrocytic CB<sub>1</sub>R during CNS lesion formation, as aCB<sub>1</sub>-KO mice showed attenuated spinal cord white matter and cortical grey matter inflammatory pathology in complementary disease models. Remarkably, CSDS and viral-induced downregulation of endothelial <italic>Cln5</italic> increase astrocyte CB<sub>1</sub>R and endocannabinoid levels <italic>in vivo</italic> while acute inflammatory challenges with IL-6 upregulate the expression levels of <italic>Cnr1</italic> in culture systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). These recent observations suggest that BBB disruption facilitates astrocytic CB<sub>1</sub>R signaling though inflammation-related mechanisms. In this scenario, it seems plausible that distinct inflammatory environments engage endocannabinoid signaling through specific astrocyte CB<sub>1</sub>R receptor pools at the plasma membranes and/or mitochondrial compartments, leading to context specific modulation of BBB functions. Mechanistic considerations notwithstanding, our study adds to the growing body of evidence that support essential roles for the astrocytic populations of CB<sub>1</sub>R in regulating the astrocyte-endothelial interface in neuroinflammatory disorders.</p><p id="P42">The exact cascade of events that modulate BBB permeability downstream astrocytic CB<sub>1</sub>R signaling during CNS lesion formation remains a matter of future research efforts in the context of autoimmune inflammation. According to the existing literature, early-onset activation of astrocytic CB<sub>1</sub>R may potentially preserve BBB function by attenuating astrocyte reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). This possibility is supported by a series of <italic>in vivo</italic> ablation studies showing that early onset inhibition of reactive astrogliosis facilitates circulating inflammation to reach the CNS parenchyma and exacerbates clinical disease in the EAE model of MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). Some tentative additional support for this hypothesis comes from prior research showing that pharmacological blockade of endocannabinoid hydrolysis inhibits astrocyte reactivity while attenuating disease neuropathology and clinical severity in the EAE and TMEV models of neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>). However, these <italic>in vivo</italic> studies did not target CB<sub>1</sub>R as potential underling mechanism and research specifically designed to address the role of CB<sub>1</sub>R in regulating the functions of reactive astrocytes is still scarce. In this context, it is worth mentioning that the protective phenotype of astrocyte-specific CB<sub>1</sub>R null mice in the EAE model that we report here is consistent with recent <italic>in vivo</italic> observations of decreased neuronal death following cerebral ischemia in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>).</p><p id="P43">To summarize, we propose that early, endogenous activation of astrocyte CB<sub>1</sub>R drives the pathogenicity of CNS inflammatory lesions by mechanistic interactions with VEGF-A signaling that promote BBB permeability. This study challenges the traditional neuroprotective role of endocannabinoids in MS and adds to the accumulating evidence that point to relevant roles of endocannabinoid signaling via astrocyte CB<sub>1</sub>R in the neurovascular adaptations that shape neuroinflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS207019-supplement-Supplementary_figure_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d23aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary figure 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS207019-supplement-Supplementary_figure_2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d23aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary figure 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS207019-supplement-Supplementary_figure_3.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d23aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary figure 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS207019-supplement-Supplementary_figure_4.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d23aAcEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary figure 5</label><media xlink:href="EMS207019-supplement-Supplementary_figure_5.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d23aAcEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS207019-supplement-Supplementary_Table_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d23aAcEgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplementary Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS207019-supplement-Supplementary_Table_2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d23aAcEhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all members of the S Mato’s and G Marsicano’s lab for useful discussions and advice, as well as the personnel of the Animal Facilities of the University of the Basque Country and Neurocentre Magendie for mouse care.</p><sec id="S27"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was funded by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (PI21/00629, to S.M.) and cofounded by the European Union, the Basque Government (PIBA_2023_1_0046; 2023111031; IT1473-22, to S.M.; CannaMetHD, to S.M. and G.M.; IT1203-19, to C.M.), ARSEP Foundation (ARSEP-1310 to S.M. and G.M.; ARSEP-1317 and SEP-10 to V.T.), the European Research Council (MiCaBra, ERC-2017-AdG-786467, to G.M.), INSERM (to G.M.), Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale (FRM, DRM20101220445 to G.M.), Region Aquitaine (CanBrain, AAP2022A-2021-16763610 and -17219710 to G.M.), French State/Agence Nationale de la Recherche (HippObese, ANR-23-ce14-0004-03; ERA-Net Neuron CanShank, ANR-21-NEU2-0001-04; CaMeLS, ANR-23-CE16-0022-01, to G.M.), La Caixa Research Health 2023 (PsychoCannabis, HR23-00793, to G.M.), the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (SAF2015-74332-JIN and PID2023-152688OB-I00 to V.T.; PID2019-109724RB-100 to C.M.), Consellería de Educación, Universidades y Empleo-Generalitat Valenciana (CIDEXG/2023/23 to V.T.), BIOEF-EITB-Maratoia (BIO23/EM/008 to C.M.) and Walk on Project Foundation.
