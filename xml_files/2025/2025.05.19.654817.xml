While the biological roles of ribonucleoprotein-condensates are better understood in eukaryotic systems, the knowledge of metabolic processes that govern their formation and their contribution to stress adaptation remains at a nascent stage in bacterial RNA biology. Hfq is an RNA-chaperone conserved in many bacteria that undergoes condensation in response to diverse stresses. Using nitrogen (N) starvation in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as a model stress condition, we show that Hfq condensation occurs independently of any extracellular cues, cytoplasmic shrinkage that cells undergo during N starvation or the canonical NtrBC-dependent adaptive response to N starvation. However, we demonstrate that Hfq condensation is coupled to the inhibition of carbon assimilation in N-starved <italic>E. coli</italic>. Further, by comparing the transcriptomes of wild-type bacteria and bacteria unable to form Hfq-condensates, we reveal that Hfq-condensates contribute to the stabilisation of Hfq-associated non-coding regulatory RNAs. We propose that coordination of carbon and N metabolism during N starvation, critical for metabolic adaptation, is accompanied by preservation of non-coding regulatory RNAs via Hfq condensation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Bacteria often exist in a growth attenuated state for long periods of time, as many environments inhabited by bacteria are limited for nutrients. As such, bacteria exhibit a range of adaptive responses to long-term nutrient starvation. Many of these are underpinned by changes in gene expression at the level of RNA metabolism. At the level of RNA synthesis, specific transcription regulators respond to cellular cues and modulate the activity of the RNA polymerase, reprogramming the transcriptional landscape and thereby activating or downregulating specific metabolic pathways. In parallel, regulatory non-coding RNA molecules, hereafter referred to as small RNAs (sRNA), mediate the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in bacteria. Some sRNAs are <italic>cis</italic>-acting and are expressed from the same locus as their sole mRNA target. However, the majority of sRNA are <italic>trans</italic>-acting and target multiple mRNA targets at different genetic loci. As such, unlike <italic>cis</italic>-acting sRNAs, <italic>trans</italic>-acting sRNAs share only partial complementarity with their mRNA targets and significantly depend on RNA binding chaperone proteins to interact with their targets. sRNA can affect the fate of their cognate mRNA in at least four different ways (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>)): (i) they facilitate translation of the target mRNA by altering RNA secondary structure and allowing ribosomes access to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence; (ii) they prevent ribosomes access the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, translationally repressing the target mRNA, (iii) they enable the rapid degradation of target mRNA by the RNA degradosome or (iv) they protect the target mRNA from being degraded by RNases.</p><p id="P3">Nitrogen (N) is used for the biosynthesis of the building blocks of all proteins (amino acids), nucleic acids (nucleotides) as well as numerous metabolites and cofactors in bacteria. As such, N is an essential component of the bacterial cell. Many groups have used <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as the model bacterium to understand the adaptive response to N-starvation - the transcriptional regulatory basis of the adaptive-response to N-starvation is well-understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Briefly, this involves the two-component system, NtrBC, in which the phosphorylation of the response regulator NtrC by its cognate sensor kinase NtrB allows NtrC-P to activate the transcription of ∼100 genes. These include <italic>relA</italic>, the gene responsible for the synthesis of the RNA polymerase binding stress signalling nucleotide guanosine pentaphosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), and <italic>nac</italic>, which encodes a global transcription regulator - nitrogen assimilation control protein, Nac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Consequently, this leads to a large-scale reprogramming of the transcriptome to allow N scavenging from alternative sources of N, concomitant with the quiescing of cellular processes which consume N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). In contrast, very little is known about the post-transcriptional regulatory basis of the adaptive response to N starvation in bacteria. Emerging results have now begun to shed light on the role of Hfq-dependent sRNAs in N-starved <italic>E. coli</italic>. Walling et al. showed that the sRNA GlnZ promotes cell survival by regulating genes linked to nitrogen and carbon flux in N starved <italic>E. coli</italic> (see later) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). McQuail et al. used genome-scale analyses to reveal that Hfq-mediated sRNA-mRNA interactions in <italic>E. coli</italic> are extensive and dynamic during N starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), indicating a continuous requirement for post-transcriptional regulation during N-starvation.</p><p id="P4">Notably, we previously showed that ∼50% of all Hfq molecules gradually assemble into foci-like subcellular condensates near the cell poles as a function of time under N starvation by a process analogous to liquid-liquid phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). These Hfq-condensates are notably reversible, i.e. they disperse when N is replenished. Further, the Hfq-condensates co-localised with condensates of the RNA-degradosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). In a subsequent study, Goldberg et al. showed that Hfq-condensates also exist in stationary phase <italic>E. coli</italic> grown in lysogeny broth or in bacteria experiencing osmotic shock, suggesting that the Hfq-condensates are a prevalent feature in the subcellular landscape of stressed bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). The Hfq-condensates that form in stationary phase and osmotically stressed <italic>E. coli</italic> did not co-localise with the RNA-degradosome but with a condensate formed by a protein called TmaR. The TmaR protein binds to and inhibits the phosphotransferase system (PTS) enzyme I, and the presence of TmaR-condensates is indicative of inhibition of sugar uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Strikingly, the Hfq-condensates do not form in cells devoid of <italic>tmaR</italic>, indicating that condensation of Hfq in stationary phase and osmotically stressed bacteria depends on TmaR-condensates; conversely, the TmaR-condensates form independently of Hfq-condensates. Whether TmaR condensates are required for Hfq condensation during N starvation is unknown.</p><p id="P5">We further showed that the efficacy by which the Hfq-condensates form in N-starved <italic>E. coli</italic> is affected by the RNA binding activity of Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Consistent with this view, Goldberg et al. demonstrated that RNA is a constituent of the Hfq-condensates by assembling Hfq-condensates <italic>in vitro</italic>. This study further showed that some polar-enriched RNA molecules in osmotically stressed bacteria, including sRNAs, were destabilised in Δ<italic>tmaR</italic> bacteria (which do not contain Hfq-condensates), implying, but not directly demonstrating, that the Hfq-condensates have a role in RNA stabilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). A recent study by Guan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) revealed that long-chain polyphosphates (polyP), which accumulates during N starvation, serves as a scaffold for the assembly of the Hfq-condensates. This study also supported a role for the Hfq-condensates in RNA stabilisation and showed that Hfq-condensates are a nucleoprotein hub, serving to protect mRNA transcripts, while simultaneously facilitating the degradation of transcripts less essential for survival and growth resumption.</p><p id="P6">A characteristic property of the Hfq-condensates in N-starved <italic>E. coli</italic> is that they form gradually as a function of time during N starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Under conditions used in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) and in the recent study by Guan et al., Hfq-condensates are not readily detected until ∼6 hours following N run-out in the media. After which time, the Hfq-condensates gradually formed and, ∼80-90% of all cells contained the Hfq-condensates by 24 hours into N starvation (N-24). Interestingly, in an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain devoid of polyP (Δ<italic>ppk</italic>), no Hfq-condensates are detected following 6 hours of N starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>); however, ∼30-40% of cells in the Δ<italic>ppk</italic> population still contained Hfq-condensates 24 hours after the onset of N starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Therefore, whilst polyP certainly contributes to the formation of Hfq-condensates, it is clearly not strictly required, nor sufficient, for Hfq-condensate formation.</p><p id="P7">The formation of biomolecular condensates by RNA and proteins associated with RNA metabolism, henceforth referred to as ribonucleoprotein condensates, is an emergent and prevalent feature in the subcellular landscape of diverse stressed bacteria (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>)). However, we are yet to understand what metabolic cellular processes drive the formation of ribonucleoprotein condensates, or how they contribute to adaptive stress responses. In the current study, we used Hfq-condensates that form under N starvation to address some of these outstanding questions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Bacterial strains and plasmids</title><p id="P8">All strains used in this study were derived from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K-12 and are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Briefly, 1 ml of culture was centrifuged, washed and resuspended in a small amount of Gutnick minimal medium without any NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + 0.4% glucose; samples taken at N+ were resuspended in Gutnick minimal medium with 3 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + 0.4% glucose; samples in C-source experiments were resuspended in Gutnick minimal media without either NH<sub>4</sub>Cl or glucose. One μl of the resuspended culture was then placed on a Gutnick minimal medium agarose pad (1x Gutnick minimal medium with no NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + 0.4% glucose with 1% (w/v) agarose); samples taken at N+ were placed on a pad made with Gutnick minimal medium with 3 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, samples in C-source experiments were placed on a pad made with Gutnick minimal media without either NH<sub>4</sub>Cl or glucose. Cells were imaged on a PALM-optimized Nanoimager (Oxford Nanoimaging, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://oni.bio/nanoimager/">https://oni.bio/nanoimager/</ext-link>) with 15 millisecond exposures, at 66 frames per second over 10,000 frames. Photoactivatable molecules were activated using 405 nm and 561 nm lasers. Fields-of-view typically consisted of 100-200 bacterial cells. For SMT, the Nanoimager software was used to localize the molecules by fitting detectable spots of high photon intensity to a Gaussian function. The Nanoimager software SMT function was then used to track individual molecules and draw trajectories of individual molecules over multiple frames, using a maximum step distance between frames of 0.6 μm and a nearest-neighbour exclusion radius of 0.9 μm. The software then calculated the apparent diffusion coefficients (<italic>D*</italic>) for each trajectory over at least four steps, based on the mean squared displacement of the molecule. To calculate %H<sub>IM</sub>, we collated D* values from multiple fields of view and determined the proportion of D* values that fell into our previously defined immobile population (D* ≤0.08 μm/s<sup>2</sup>).

Three biological replicates of each strain were taken and mixed with a phenol:ethanol (1:19) solution at a ratio of 9:1 (culture:solution) before harvesting the bacteria immediately by centrifugation.

RNA was purified with PureLink RNA Mini Kit extraction columns (Invitrogen, 12183018A) and largely in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol for Total Transcriptome Isolation except with a final ethanol concentration of 66% to increase the yield of smaller RNA species. Analysis of extracted RNA was performed following depletion of ribosomal RNA molecules using a commercial rRNA depletion kit for mixed bacterial samples (Lexogen, RiboCop META, #125). The ribo-depleted RNA samples were first fragmented using ultrasound (4 pulses of 30 s at 4°C). Then, an oligonucleotide adapter was ligated to the 3' end of the RNA molecules. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase with the 3’ adapter as primer. After purification, the 5' Illumina TruSeq sequencing adapter was ligated to the 3' end of the antisense cDNA. The resulting cDNA was PCR-amplified using a high-fidelity DNA polymerase and the barcoded TruSeq-libraries were pooled in approximately equimolar amounts. Sequencing of pooled libraries, spiked with PhiX control library, was performed at a minimum of 7 million reads per sample in single-ended mode with 100 cycles on the NextSeq 2000 platform (Illumina).

Under these conditions, when ammonium chloride in the growth medium runs out (N-), the bacteria enter a state of N starvation and become growth-arrested. However, sufficient glucose still remains to support growth if the N source becomes replenished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). The Hfq-condensates are not detected at N-but form gradually as N starvation ensues and become detectable ∼6 hours into N starvation (N-6) and, by 24 hours following N-starvation (N-24) ∼80-90% of all cells in the population contain the Hfq- condensates. Further, Hfq- condensates also form in bacteria that have been treated (at N-) with rifampicin (transcription inhibitor) or chloramphenicol (translation inhibitor), implying that Hfq- condensates does not depend on <italic>de novo</italic> gene expression during N starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). We considered whether Hfq condensation is triggered in response to an extracellular cue that accumulates over time under N starvation. To investigate this, we used bacteria from N+ (when cells are not N-starved, and Hfq-condensates are absent) and N- (when cells are N-starved, but Hfq-condensates are absent) and resuspended the bacteria in ‘spent’ media from cultures of bacteria grown to N-24. Although the spent media contains glucose (see above), it does not have any N source to support growth. We then periodically monitored the diffusion dynamics of individual Hfq molecules by photoactivated localisation microscopy (PALM) in live cells. We reasoned that if an extracellular cue existed, then Hfq-foci formation would occur faster in spent media (in which such a cue would have accumulated) than it would when bacteria become progressively more N-starved over time in normal (unspent) media. A quantitative parameter to measure Hfq-condensate formation, %H<sub>IM</sub>, was calculated as the proportion of total Hfq molecules with an apparent diffusion less than 0.08 um<sup>2</sup>/s, which had previously been defined as the ‘immobile’ population of Hfq molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). The %H<sub>IM</sub> was calculated based on all trajectories of Hfq in 50-200 bacterial cells within a given field of view. We did not detect any differences in %H<sub>IM</sub> as a function of time following inoculation of bacteria from N+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) or N- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) into spent media and, in both cases, the Hfq-condensates became detectable and clearly distinguishable from the mobile population of Hfq molecules ∼6 hours following incubation; the rate of Hfq condensation in both cases was similar to that observed in bacteria becoming progressively N-starved in unspent media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). We conclude that Hfq condensation is not mediated by any extracellular cues but represents a response exclusively to changes that occur inside <italic>E. coli</italic> cells during N-starvation.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Cytoplasmic shrinkage during N starvation does not contribute to Hfq condensation</title><p id="P17">It is well established that the cytoplasm of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells shrinks during nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). This inevitably increases the viscosity of the cytoplasm, affecting the diffusibility of macromolecules. We considered whether progressive shrinkage of the cytoplasm in response to N-starvation could trigger Hfq condensation. Therefore, we measured the average cytoplasmic area of bacterial cells and correlated this with the presence and dispersion of the Hfq-condensates. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, as expected, the average cytoplasmic area decreased from ∼1509 arbitrary units to ∼1235 arbitrary units when N+ bacteria became N-starved. Notably, no difference in the average cytoplasmic area was detected between N- (Hfq-condensates absent) and N-24 (Hfq-condensates present) bacteria. When N-24 bacteria, where the Hfq-condensates have fully formed, were resuspended in fresh media that supported growth recovery (ammonium chloride and glucose present; N+/C+) and led to the dispersion of the Hfq-condensates, the average cytoplasmic area reverted to that seen in N+ bacteria. However, when N-24 bacteria were resuspended in fresh media which only contained ammonium chloride but no glucose (N+/C-) and hence did not support growth recovery but caused the dispersion of the Hfq-condensates, the average cytoplasmic area did not increase and resembled that seen in N-24 bacteria (where the Hfq-condensates exist). Conversely, in control experiments when N-24 bacteria were resuspended in fresh media that contained no ammonium chloride but only glucose, where the Hfq-condensates <italic>did not</italic> disperse, the average cytoplasmic area also did not increase and resembled that seen in N-24-bacteria. Overall, we conclude that cytoplasmic shrinkage during N starvation does not contribute to Hfq condensation.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Hfq condensation in N-starved <italic>E. coli</italic> requires TmaR</title><p id="P18">Based on our results thus far, we focused our investigation on intracellular events that drive or require Hfq condensation. The dependency of Hfq-condensates on TmaR has been demonstrated in late stationary phase and osmotically stressed <italic>E. coli</italic> but not in N-starved <italic>E. coli</italic>. In addition, the Hfq-condensates and the TmaR-condensates colocalise in stationary phase and osmotically stressed <italic>E. coli</italic> and, notably, in both stress conditions, Hfq condensation in N-starved bacteria is dependent on TmaR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). To investigate the role of the TmaR on Hfq condensation under N-starvation, we compared the diffusion dynamics of Hfq and TmaR (containing a photoactivatable mCherry tag fused to its C-terminal end) by PALM. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, the percentage of cells containing the TmaR-condensates steadily increased during N starvation and, by N-24 ∼80% of cells contained the TmaR-foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). In N-24 Δ<italic>tmaR</italic> bacteria we did not detect the Hfq-condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). We note that, unlike the Hfq-condensates, under our conditions, a substantial proportion of cells contain TmaR-condensates before the Hfq-foci become detectable. For example, at N+ and N-, when Hfq-condensates are entirely absent, ∼40% and ∼60% of the cells contained TmaR-condensates. It is known that glucose uptake rates in N-starved <italic>E. coli</italic> decreases more drastically than any other stress condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). As the TmaR condensation leads to the inhibition of PTS enzyme I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), the results imply that the inhibition of glucose uptake in bacteria entering N starvation is not homogenous.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Hfq condensation is an adaptative response that occurs independently of the canonical NtrBC pathway</title><p id="P19">Nitrogen starvation reduces the flux of α-ketoglutarate (αKG) out of the Krebs cycle into amino acids biosynthesis, leading to a rise in αKG levels, repression of glucose uptake and inhibition of cAMP synthesis. The latter prevents the global transcription factor CRP from activating transcription of genes required for uptake and catabolism of other sugars. Thus, αKG is a critical metabolite for coordinating the regulation of carbon assimilation during N starvation in <italic>E. coli</italic>. During growth in glucose, a particularly critical interaction linking N availability to glucose uptake is the inhibition of the PTS enzyme I, the target of TmaR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), by αKG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). As the dependency of Hfq condensation relies on TmaR, we speculated whether addition of exogenous αKG to N- bacteria, when Hfq-condensates are absent would cause Hfq condensation (recall that Hfq-condensates only become detectable by N-6). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>, when dimethyl-ketoglutarate (dmKG), a membrane-permeable ester that is cleaved by intracellular esterases to form αKG, was added to N- bacteria, Hfq condensation could be ‘induced’ and Hfq-condensates formed much sooner in dmKG treated compared to untreated bacteria. Control experiments showed that the dynamics of the TmaR foci remained unaffected by dmKG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). Additional control experiments showed that dmKG induction of Hfq-condensates was dependent on both TmaR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>) and polyP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, Hfq-condensates could be induced with dmKG even in the presence of the transcription inhibitor rifampicin and translation inhibitor chloramphenicol, suggesting that the induction of Hfq condensation by dmKG occurs independently of any changes in gene expression due to the addition of dmKG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Recall that the adaptive response to N starvation requires the two-component system NtrBC, where NtrB is the sensor kinase and NtrC the transcription regulator (see Introduction). At a low αKG concentration (e.g. under N-replete conditions), GlnB (PII) binds to αKG, which allows it to interact with NtrB, inhibiting its kinase activity and activating its phosphatase activity to dephosphorylate NtrC, rendering the latter unable to activate transcription. However, at higher αKG concentrations (e.g. upon N starvation), GlnB binds additional molecules of αKG and is unable to interact with NtrB, such that NtrB acts as a kinase to phosphorylate NtrC, allowing it to activate transcription of genes required for adaptation to N starvation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). We thus considered whether dmKG induces Hfq condensation by overstimulating the NtrC regulon by binding to GlnB. However, Hfq-condensates could still be induced with dmKG in Δ<italic>glnB</italic> bacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3B and 3C</xref>). Therefore, it seems that, during N starvation, the condensation of Hfq is a response that occurs independently of the canonical NtrBC-dependent adaptive response pathway. Indeed, in the absence of NtrC (Δ<italic>glnG</italic>), Hfq-condensates form faster than in WT bacteria, underscoring the view that Hfq condensation is not associated with the canonical NtrBC-mediated adaptive response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3D</xref>). This view is further supported by the fact that Hfq condensation, in both dKG untreated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) and treated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>) bacteria occurs independently of <italic>de novo</italic> gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Hfq condensation in N-starved <italic>E. coli</italic> occurs concomitantly with the inhibition of glucose uptake</title><p id="P20">Given that: addition of dmKG induces the Hfq-condensates, αKG contributes to the inhibition of glucose uptake via inhibiting PTS enzyme I (see above) and Hfq-condensates can form independently of the NtrBC pathway, we considered whether Hfq condensation in N-starved <italic>E. coli</italic> occurs concomitantly with the inhibition of glucose uptake. To investigate whether the addition of dmKG indeed led to decreased glucose uptake, we measured extracellular glucose concentration as a function of time during N starvation from cultures of dmKG treated and untreated bacteria. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, the change in extracellular glucose concentration as a function of time under N starvation did not substantially differ in the media of bacteria treated with dmKG and untreated controls (p=0.7160). However, we note that following the onset of N starvation (N-), the rate of decrease of glucose in the media (i.e. glucose uptake) of untreated bacteria was very low and therefore any differences between the treated and untreated samples would be too small to detect by measuring extracellular glucose concentrations. Hence, we used LC-MS to investigate the intracellular concentration of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), the metabolic intermediate into which the majority of glucose is converted to during import into the cell. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, in dmKG untreated bacteria, G6P concentration gradually increased during the first 9 hours of N starvation. In contrast, we observed a notable delay in the increase of G6P in the dmKG treated bacteria. Whilst this difference was not found to be significant at any individual time point, the overall treatment effect across all times points was found to be significant (p=0.0267). We next calculated the rate of change in G6P concentration between time points (calculated as per hour). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>, the rate of change in G6P concentration between N- (when dmKG was added) and N-3 was significantly lower in the dmKG treated cells than in untreated cells. Following N-3, rate of change in G6P concentration largely stabilised between dmKG treated and untreated cells, with rate of change in G6P concentration falling in the untreated cultures by N-6. We note that rate of change in G6P concentration represents the cumulative effect of changes in both uptake and metabolic use. Thus, the results must be interpreted with this consideration in mind. Nonetheless, the results clearly indicate an overall decrease in glucose uptake following dmKG treatment that concomitantly leads to Hfq condensation. We further note that Hfq condensation in the untreated (at N-6) and dmKG treated (at N-3) correlates with a period of decreased change in the concentration of G6P, and thus inhibition of glucose uptake during N starvation. We conclude that Hfq condensation in N-starved bacteria occurs concomitantly with the inhibition of glucose uptake.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Hfq-condensates contribute to stabilising sRNAs in N-starved <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p id="P21">We recently defined the Hfq-mediated RNA-RNA interactions during N starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) and further demonstrated that the absence of Hfq specifically leads to the destabilisation of most Hfq-associated sRNA species in N-24 <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Given that ∼50% of Hfq molecules are within the Hfq-condensates at N-24, we considered whether the Hfq-condensates have a role in sRNA stabilisation. As the Hfq-condensates do not form in Δ<italic>tmaR</italic> bacteria and therefore, unlike dmKG treatment, represents a binary response with respect to Hfq condensation, (i.e. Hfq-condensates present in wild-type bacteria and Hfq-condensates entirely absent in Δ<italic>tmaR</italic> bacteria), we compared the transcriptomes of N-24 wild-type and Δ<italic>tmaR</italic> bacteria to determine how the absence of TmaR, <italic>ipso facto</italic>, Hfq-condensates, affects sRNA abundance at N-24. We defined differentially expressed genes as those with expression levels changed ≥2-fold with a false discovery rate adjusted P &lt; 0.05. According to this threshold, the absence of TmaR led to a dysregulation of ∼305 genes (∼89 and ∼216 genes up- and downregulated, respectively), corresponding to ∼7% of all genes in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Put differently, despite the significant subcellular difference in WT and Δ<italic>tmaR</italic> bacteria (i.e. presence or absence of Hfq-condensates, respectively) the absence of TmaR only had a modest impact on the transcriptome of <italic>E. coli</italic> following 24h of N-starvation. Notably, although there is no detectable difference in Hfq levels in N-24 WT and Δ<italic>tmaR</italic> bacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>), of the 25 sRNAs that interacted with Hfq at N-24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), 6 (24%) were downregulated in N-24 Δ<italic>tmaR</italic> bacteria, suggesting that the Hfq-condensates contributes to sRNA stabilisation in N-starved bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Therefore, we considered whether the absence of Hfq-condensates would perturb the RNA-RNA interaction network <italic>ipso facto</italic> post-transcriptional regulation at N-24, which consequently could compromise cellular homeostasis. In support of this view, the number of viable cells in the population of N-24 Δ<italic>tmaR</italic> bacteria were ∼25% less than in the N-24 WT population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). We note that this decrease in viable cells was not as great as that seen in the population of N-24 Δ<italic>hfq</italic> (∼53% decrease) bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). The difference in viability between N-24 Δ<italic>tmaR</italic> and Δ<italic>hfq</italic> bacteria is perhaps unsurprising since the Hfq molecules not in the condensate in the Δ<italic>tmaR</italic> cells are still able to contribute to adaptive post-transcriptional regulation during N starvation. The efficacy by which bacteriophages infect and replicate in bacteria can serve as an indicator of bacterial metabolic ‘health’. Therefore, we measured how quickly the prototypical <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteriophage T7 replicated and caused collapse of the N-24 WT (Hfq-condensates present) and Δ<italic>tmaR</italic> (Hfq condensates absent) cultures. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>, following addition of T7, the culture of N-24 Δ<italic>tmaR</italic> bacteria collapsed ∼0.5h after that of the WT bacteria. Notably, this lag in culture collapse was not seen in with N+ bacteria where Hfq-condensates are absent in both the Δ<italic>tmaR</italic> and WT bacteria, confirming a role for Hfq-condensates in maintaining cellular homeostasis. However, whereas N-24 Δ<italic>hfq</italic> bacteria were also compromised for growth-recovery following inoculation into fresh growth media, Δ<italic>tmaR</italic> bacteria recovered like WT bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>), underscoring a role for Hfq-condensates specifically in the cellular homeostasis during growth-arrest. Overall, we conclude that the Hfq-condensates contribute to preserving the stability of sRNAs during N starvation and thereby to cellular adaptation to N starvation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">Ribonucleoprotein-condensates are an emergent feature in the subcellular landscape of stressed bacteria and, like analogous condensates such as stress granules or P-bodies in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), they contribute to the adaptive metabolism and homeostasis of RNA. In bacteria, key proteins involved in RNA synthesis, RNA degradation and RNA regulation have been described to undergo phase condensation.

Despite the prevalence of ribonucleoprotein condensates in stressed bacteria, most studies to date have focused on understanding their function in stress physiology through determining their composition. We have now shown that Hfq condensation is an adaptive response to N starvation. Inspired by the observation made by the Amster-Choder laboratory revealing that Hfq condensates co-localise with condensates of a novel glucose uptake regulator TmaR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), we have now shown that the formation of Hfq-condensates occurs concomitantly with inhibition of glucose uptake in N-starved <italic>E. coli</italic>. An important breakthrough in our study is the finding that Hfq-condensates could be induced by αKG – the key metabolite involved in nitrogen and carbon metabolism in <italic>E. coli</italic>. It is well established that intracellular concentration of αKG increases upon entry into N starvation but is unlikely to rise further during long-term N starvation as it is found in the supernatants of N-starved cultures (suggesting active export of αKG to prevent its hyperaccumulation inside cells)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Thus, we propose that Hfq condensation is unlikely to be due to the accumulation of αKG as a function of time under N starvation. Interestingly, computational predictions indicated a potential interaction between Hfq and αKG (our unpublished observations). However, these predictions are not supported by experimental data from isothermal titration calorimetry and dynamic light scattering, which demonstrated that αKG does not bind to Hfq (our unpublished data). Therefore, the effect of αKG on Hfq is likely to be indirect and independent of TmaR, as TmaR-condensates were not detectably affected by αKG. Nonetheless, our results showing that Hfq condensation can be induced by αKG, which concomitantly results in the inhibition of glucose uptake, clearly indicates that Hfq condensation is a cellular process that is coupled to the inhibition of carbon assimilation during N starvation.</p><p id="P25">The majority of bacterial cells contain Hfq-condensates following 24h under N starvation. Therefore, we regard Hfq-condensates that exist in N-24 bacteria as fully formed. By leveraging the finding that Hfq-condensates do not form in N-24 Δ<italic>tmaR</italic> bacteria and our previous data describing the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) and genome-wide Hfq-associated RNA-RNA interaction network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) at N-24, we have now revealed a function for Hfq-condensates in preserving sRNA stability in N-starved <italic>E. coli</italic>. We note that a limitation of this conclusion is the absence of evidence showing that the destabilized sRNA species in N-24 Δ<italic>tmaR</italic> bacteria are indeed physically associated with the Hfq-condensates, but this will be subject of future studies. Nonetheless, our conclusions are consistent with and expand results of a recent study from the Jakob laboratory showing Hfq-condensates that form under N starvation function to preserve polyadenylated mRNAs (which would otherwise be degraded) and mRNA encoding components of the translation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). We previously reported that condensates of the RNA degradosome colocalise with Hfq-condensates in N-starved <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).

Pertinent to this study, the abundance of the Hfq-dependent sRNA GlnZ increases upon entry into N starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).

Nonetheless, our study now highlights that the post-transcriptional basis of the adaptive response to N starvation extends beyond canonical sRNA-mediated regulation and involves condensation of Hfq, stabilisation of sRNAs by Hfq-condensates and the inhibition of carbon assimilation and flux through the Krebs cycle.</p><p id="P27">In sum, our study has shown that Hfq-condensates are associated with the inhibition of carbon assimilation in N-starved <italic>E. coli</italic> and has expanded the current perception in the field that Hfq-condensates contribute to just preserving RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Although both of these functions of Hfq-condensates might not be mutually inclusive, Hfq-condensates clearly contribute to maintaining cellular homeostasis during N starvation. Most bacterial stress ribonucleoprotein-condensates, including Hfq-condensates, are heterotypic in nature and their formation is underpinned by multivalent interactions between different proteins and different types of RNA molecules. Although we are now beginning to understand why they form and how they contribute to stress adaption, their heterotypic nature implies that neither their formation is triggered by a universal ‘stress signal’ nor they are restricted in their functions. Instead, as bacteria must respond and adapt to and survive ever-changing conditions, it is likely that the formation of ribonucleoprotein-condensates is precipitated by a combination of diverse cellular and physical factors and contribute to different adaptive, albeit RNA metabolism associated, functions in the cell.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS205729-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d23aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Ben Luisi, Cambridge University, for help with the Hfq-αKG interaction assays and Martin Buck, Imperial College, for critical comments on manuscript.</p><sec id="S19"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the BBSRC (BB<italic>/</italic>V000284<italic>/</italic>1) and Leverhulme Trust (RPG-2020-050) project grants to S.W.
