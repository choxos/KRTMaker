As neurohormones, AVP and OXT are mainly produced in magnocellular neurons (MCNs) located in the hypothalamus. Development of both neuron types requires coordinated expression of transcription factors OTP, SIM1, ARNT2 and POU3F2. However, the exact transcription factors involved in the differential differentiation of the AVP and OXT lineages are yet unknown. We used a publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset of the developing mouse hypothalamus to identify gene regulatory networks linked to AVP and OXT neuronal differentiation. We identified RORA, EBF3, FOXP1, FOXP2, and BCL11B as transcription factors with possible relevance for <italic>Avp</italic> and <italic>Oxt</italic> MCN divergence. We then modeled developmental gene expression dynamics using computational cell fate mapping.

These neurons are located in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON), where they produce the neuropeptides arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OXT). Structurally, AVP and OXT are closely related nonapeptides, differing at only two amino acids. The genes encoding for AVP and OXT are only 10 kb apart on the human genome, and thought to be the result of a gene duplication event around the origin of vertebrates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Despite their evolutionary relatedness, AVP and OXT differ in hormonal function: AVP regulates arterial blood pressure and water homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, while the best known function of OXT is the induction of parturition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and lactation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. As systemic hormones, AVP and OXT are released from MCNs projections to the posterior pituitary. Despite their similarities, AVP and OXT are predominantly produced in neuropeptide-specific MCNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">AVP and OXT MCNs are clearly distinct, yet similar in some respects. A common feature is the known developmental trajectories of both lineages. Development of both AVP and OXT MCNs necessitates expression of transcription factors (TFs) OTP, SIM1, ARNT2 and POU3F2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Also, it has been known for some time that AVP and OXT MCNs express mRNA for their counterpart peptides, though at levels differing orders of magnitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Recently, we corroborated these findings with a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the PVN, and found the AVP and OXT MCNs to be highly transcriptionally correlated, yet also distinct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The evolutionary relatedness, high level of transcriptional similarity and largely overlapping ontogeny implies a common developmental progenitor. Yet, the presumed transcription factor(s) involved in the divergence of the AVP and OXT lineages have not been described yet.

A key difference is the overall expression levels of these factors, which were higher for <italic>Foxp2</italic> than for <italic>Foxp1</italic>. This lower <italic>Foxp1</italic> expression and subsequent smaller absolute difference between populations may also explain the observed lack of significant <italic>Foxp1</italic> expression difference between <italic>Avp</italic> and <italic>Oxt</italic> MCNs.

For validation of this hypothesis in a physiologically relevant context, we opted to analyze whole hypothalami of <italic>Foxp1</italic> heterozygous knockout mice (<italic>Foxp1</italic><sup>+/-</sup>), the only model available to us.

Previous research on the differences between AVP and OXT MCNs has focused mainly on the neuron-specific expression of the respective neuropeptides, through investigation of specificity conferring promoter regions, rather than on the TF(s) responsible for the broader divergent differentiation. Instead, we leveraged single-cell computational analysis to investigate differentially active TFs between AVP and OXT MCN transcriptomes. Our analysis yielded five candidate TFs that may mediate the divergent differentiation of these neurons. For all candidates but RORA, we subsequently found diverging developmental gene expression patterns, supportive of the validity of the gene regulatory network analysis.</p><p id="P16">Our analysis of the SCRs of the <italic>Avp</italic> and <italic>Oxt</italic> promoters identified only RORA as a TF binding the <italic>Avp</italic> promoter, and three candidates (RORA, FOXP1, FOXP2) were predicted to bind the <italic>Oxt</italic> promoter. Interestingly, RORA was implicated here with several TFBSs in both promoters. However, these findings lack interpretability due to earlier conflicting findings and reports. The expression dynamics of <italic>Rora</italic> between populations were virtually identical, unlike the regulon activity and gene expression which were found enriched in <italic>Avp</italic> neurons. These findings are complicated by previous work, experimentally showing RORA to drive the mouse <italic>Oxt</italic> promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. In addition, RORA expression might not be evolutionarily conserved. In rats, previous work has found <italic>Rora</italic> to be enriched in <italic>Oxt</italic> neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, in contrast to our findings in mice. Due to this ambiguity surrounding the role of RORA, we focused our analysis on FOXP1 and FOXP2, instead.</p><p id="P17">Next, we used the <italic>Foxp1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mouse model, the only model available to us. In this mouse line, we investigated whether <italic>Foxp1</italic> haploinsufficiency affects AVP and OXT neuron abundance in the PVN and SON. As this study focused solely on MCNs, it should be noted that the PVN contains both MCNs and parvocellular neurons (PCNs). Thus, the decreased OXT neuron abundance in the PVN may also be attributed to the PCNs present there, and this effect cannot be deconvolved with our current data. Nevertheless, the SON does contain only MCNs, and these results do conclusively determine the effect of <italic>Foxp1</italic> haploinsufficiency on MCNs.</p><p id="P18">We observed that the partial loss of <italic>Foxp1</italic> expression decreased abundance of both AVP and OXT neurons at P10. The effect on the AVP neurons was unexpected, though not without plausible explanation. Our modeled expression dynamics show decreased <italic>Foxp1</italic> and <italic>Foxp2</italic> expression in AVP neurons, but not entirely lacking. As such, these factors may affect AVP neuron development as well, albeit much less impactfully. Importantly, the OXT neuron abundance was disproportionally decreased at P10. This validates our prediction that there is a previously unrecognized role for FOXP1 in OXT neurons.</p><p id="P19">Although OXT and FOXP1 have not been related before in the literature, some notable phenotypic parallels can be found that connect the two. One of these is the mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) that are emitted by pups in various situations, including isolation from the nest. In mice that (partially) lack <italic>Foxp1, Oxt</italic> or its receptor (<italic>Oxtr</italic>), the number of USVs has been shown to decrease markedly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Another parallel is autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social deficits, repetitive behaviors, and sensory processing differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. In mice, the knockouts of <italic>Oxt</italic> and <italic>Oxtr</italic> lead to social deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, while <italic>Foxp1</italic> knockout mice display both social deficits and repetitive behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. In humans, ASD has been linked to lower plasma OXT levels and variants of the OXT receptor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Moreover, individuals with FOXP1 syndrome, harboring a deleterious variant in the <italic>FOXP1</italic> gene, often present with ASD as one of its various features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Until now, these effects were often thought to occur due to the important role of FOXP1 in striatal medium spiny neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. However, given our new results, these phenotypic similarities may also partially be explained through the effect of FOXP1 variants on OXT MCNs.</p><p id="P20">This study does present with some limitations. First, based on our current data, we cannot conclusively determine if the deficient OXT MCN abundance in <italic>Foxp1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice should be viewed as delayed or impaired OXT MCN development, although functional implications may not differ strongly. Even delayed development could plausibly result in social deficits, due to the critical postnatal window for OXT system development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. This phenomenon can be observed in two mouse models with OXT dysfunction. In mice lacking the <italic>Magel2</italic> gene, a series of early-postnatal OXT injections rescued social and learning behavior in adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Similarly, in mice lacking the <italic>Cntnap2</italic> gene, postnatal OXT injections rescued the social behavioral phenotype in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Interestingly, <italic>Cntnap2</italic> is a known target gene of FOXP1 and FOXP2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. These results show that the postnatal time period is crucial for normal development of OXT signaling, and <italic>Foxp1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice might be similarly affected even if OXT neuron development is only delayed.</p><p id="P21">Second, we used a whole-body mutant mouse line, and not a PVN- or MCN-specific knockout. Thus, the decreased neuron abundance observed in the mutant mice may have arisen through interactions with other brain regions or peripheral tissues. However, as our computational analysis independently suggests a role for FOXP1, we estimate this alternative explanation to be unlikely.</p><p id="P22">Third, as we did not test RORA, EBF3, BCL11B, or FOXP2 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we cannot rule out relevance of these other candidate TFs in differential differentiation. In particular, we might assume that FOXP2 likely contributes to OXT MCN development as well. This may be through FOXP1:FOXP2 heterodimerization, or FOXP2 may function as a redundancy mechanism. Considering the MCN phenotype of the haploinsufficient <italic>Foxp1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mutant mice, the former seems the more likely option. For follow-up research, other viable candidates are the <italic>Avp</italic> MCN enriched TFs, which might drive AVPergic differentiation.</p><p id="P23">While there are many potential additional avenues for follow-up work to be tested, our data unequivocally shows that FOXP1 has a role in MCN development, and that its reduced presence disproportionally affects OXT neurons. This finding might help explain social aspects of FOXP1 syndrome and could unlock novel treatment strategies that target OXT system deficiencies.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>scRNA-seq data collection and preprocessing</title><p id="P24">For the mouse developmental dataset from Romanov <italic>et al</italic>.

Brightness and contrast settings are adjusted using the “Min display” and “Max display” values to ensure that no image data is lost. Using the rectangle selection tool, the region of interest is selected, either the PVN or SON. In the case of the SON, two separate files are created to analyze the left and right sides independently. From the “Image” tab, the “Image commands” menu is opened and “Send region to ImageJ” is selected with the following settings: resolution set to 2, inclusion of ROI, inclusion of overlay, and all z-slices selected. Once the region is sent, ImageJ opens, and the image is saved via the “File” menu as a TIFF (.tif) file. The saved TIFF file is then opened in Imaris version 10.0.1. In the display adjustment settings, the red channel (channel 1) is turned off along with either the green (channel 2) or blue (channel 3) channel. Typically, the green channel is left on for initial analysis. The display intensity is manually adjusted to reduce background noise as much as possible, based on visual assessment rather than fixed values. The spot function is selected for cell detection. Spot creation parameters are left at their default settings. When needed, the “segment only a region of interest” option is used to simplify the selection of spots. All other algorithm settings remain unchanged. During the spot detection process, channel 2 (green) is first selected as the source, and the estimated cell diameter is set to 10.00 μm, while all other parameters for spot detection are left at their default values. The optional filtering step for spot selection is generally not used, but when cell density is high, the filter is used intuitively to limit false positives and reduce manual workload. The filter is applied conservatively to ensure only visually confirmed cells are selected. Following automatic detection, the “Edit” function is used to manually verify and adjust spot selection. This step is performed by visual inspection, rotating the 3D image to avoid missing any cells and to minimize human error, as no fixed parameters can be defined for this process. Once all cells are selected, the “Statistics” function is used to generate a count of the detected spots. The data is then exported using the “Export statistics on Tab display to file” function into an Excel (.xls) file. This process is repeated for each image containing a visible PVN, for both sides of the SON, and separately for each recording channel, including repeating the same analysis using the blue channel.
