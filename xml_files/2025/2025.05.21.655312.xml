Environmental enrichment (EE) that enhances cognitive and physical stimulation can reduce cue-evoked sucrose seeking in mice and recruitment of sucrose cue-reactive neurons or ‘neuronal ensembles’ in the prelimbic cortex (PL), which regulates appetitive behaviors. Hence, EE provides us with a behavioral model and neuronal targets to identify ‘anti-craving’ relevant mechanisms. Here, we investigated in the PL how EE modulated neuronal excitability and activity patterns in cue-reactive neuronal populations. Chemogenetic inhibition of cue-reactive neurons in PL blocked cue-evoked sucrose seeking, thereby confirming the function of these neurons in sucrose cue memory. EE boosted the baseline excitability of ‘originally’, or before EE exposure, cue-reactive, excitatory pyramidal cells in PL. Furthermore, their sucrose cue-specificity was lost – resulting in their persistent activation and non-cue selective activation or ‘excitatory overdrive’. Furthermore, EE reduced recruitment of cue-reactive, inhibitory interneurons reflecting ‘inhibitory underdrive’. Taken together, impaired neuronal food cue processing due to simultaneous prefrontal cortical excitatory ‘overdrive’ and inhibitory ‘underdrive’ likely underlies EE’s anti-craving action, thereby serving as potential neurophysiological targets to develop novel medications that help control food cravings.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Environmental enrichment</kwd><kwd>Pavlovian appetitive conditioning</kwd><kwd>neuronal ensembles</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>pyramidal cells</kwd><kwd>inhibitory interneurons</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">External stimuli or ‘cues’, such as fast-food advertisements, associated with palatable foods trigger the retrieval of food memories and can provoke food cravings that promote unhealthy overeating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Likewise in laboratory animals, food cues provoke motivated behaviors such as food seeking or ‘cue-evoked food seeking’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Therefore, to better understand how cues can provoke such reactions, considerable efforts have been made to reveal the corresponding brain mechanisms with the goal of intervening with the ‘pro-craving’ system. However, more needs to be established about how the brain ‘suppresses’ food cue reactivity. Such research is critical for understanding how the brain could harness its existing neuronal circuits to dampen cue reactivity and thus promote ‘anti-craving’ relevant effects.</p><p id="P3">Interestingly, cognitive and physical stimulation, including playing games and physical exercise reduces attentional bias towards food cues and subjective food cravings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. We and others have provided such stimulation to laboratory rodents by providing housing with environmental enrichment (EE).

First, chemogenetic inhibition of PL neurons that were ‘originally’ cue-reactive, i.e. before EE exposure, blocked cue-evoked sucrose seeking, thereby confirming their functional role in food cue memory. Next, related to excitatory overdrive, EE upregulated the baseline excitability of an originally (before EE) cue-reactive, pyramidal cell ensemble that established a food cue memory. Following cue-evoked sucrose seeking, EE still induced reactivation of these ensembles. Additionally, EE induced a loss of cue specificity and general elevation of PL pyramidal cell activity <italic>in vivo</italic> during sucrose seeking. Finally, related to inhibitory underdrive, EE reduced recruitment of inhibitory interneurons, suggesting reduced local inhibition that permits pyramidal cell overdrive. Since the general suppression of PL activity is known to reduce reward seeking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], our findings provide deeper insight into how both excitatory and inhibitory PL mechanisms accompany how EE protects against food cue reactivity. Together, we reveal a mechanism that is relevant to ‘anti-food seeking’ consisting of PL pyramidal cell overdrive and interneuron underdrive, where neurons engaged by food cues and EE are modified. We discuss below the implications of the EE-induced, neurophysiology- and activity-related alterations and their impact on cue-evoked sucrose seeking.</p><sec id="S20"><title>EE-induces excitatory overdrive of cue-reactive PL ensemble</title><sec id="S21"><title>Enhanced baseline excitability of cue-reactive ensemble</title><p id="P33">Interestingly, EE enhanced the baseline (prior to cue exposure) excitability of pyramidal cells that belonged to an ‘originally’ (before EE) cue-reactive PL ensemble that mediated cue-evoked sucrose seeking. This demonstrates that EE modified the properties of pyramidal cells that established a learned food cue memory, as prefrontal ensembles are primarily composed of pyramidal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. This enhanced excitability might reflect a homeostatic, compensatory mechanism to decreased excitatory inputs to these ensemble neurons following EE, as we previously found decreased excitatory synaptic strength onto Fos-expressing, neuronal ensembles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Another possibility is that the enhanced ensemble excitability results from forming new learned associations between the physical attributes of the EE cage (e.g. exercise wheel) and the rewarding EE experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. In support, we previously observed enhanced prefrontal ensemble excitability following the initial, but not final, sucrose conditioning session as mice were learning about sucrose and the cues predicting their availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Thus, from this perspective EE may take advantage of the existing cue-food ensemble and modify its excitability to encode a new cue-reward association.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Reactivation of cue-reactive ensemble during sucrose seeking</title><p id="P34">Contrary to our expectation, EE did not modulate reactivation of the originally, cue-reactive neuronal ensembles that formed a sucrose cue memory, as cue-tagged neurons were still reactivated in <italic>FosTRAP2:Ai14</italic> mice. This result was surprising given that we previously saw reduced likelihood of reactivation of the ‘original’ mPFC neuronal ensembles that were persistently activated in conditioning as mice suppressed sucrose seeking during extinction learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and the suppression of responding to conditioned cues is associated with reduced reactivation of ensemble neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>].</p><p id="P35">Although a similar number of ensemble neurons were reactivated across EE and standard housing conditions, EE may have recruited a ‘distinct’ set of neurons within the originally cue-reactive (tdTomato+) neurons compared to standard housing conditions. These distinctly recruited neurons may exert top-down control to brain structures that regulate the expression of conditioned responses, such as the basolateral amygdala (BLA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Thus, future studies need to investigate these possibilities by labelling specific projections of these cue-reactive neurons using retrograde tracers. Finally, the enhanced ensemble excitability following EE may render these neurons to become more readily activated and express Fos. We argue below that this overactivity in cue-reactive neurons might impair cue impair cue-specific responses during sucrose seeking.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>PL activity <italic>in vivo</italic> prior to and during sucrose seeking and links to enhanced ensemble excitability</title><p id="P36">Fiber photometry combined with genetically encoded calcium sensors (GCaMP) measures bulk calcium activity <italic>in vivo</italic> from defined cell populations. Here, prior to cue exposure, EE mice exhibited increased mean frequency, but decreased mean amplitude, of calcium transients from PL pyramidal cells. An explanation for the former may be due to increased detection of activity events from increased pyramidal cell ensemble excitability and increased frequency of excitatory inputs. On the other hand, the latter may result from weaker excitatory inputs to PL from afferent structures including the BLA, whose activity is reduced during the suppression of cue-induced reward seeking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], i.e. EE increases the frequency of baseline excitatory input events, while weakening each event. Furthermore, since action potential amplitude and half-width influences calcium influx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], the reduced calcium transient amplitude may result from EE-induced decrease in action potential amplitude and half-width in tdTomato– neurons. Of note, unlike baseline excitability and Fos parameters, baseline calcium signals were obtained in the training chamber. Thus, future studies should also measure baseline calcium signals under less behaviorally arousing conditions in the home cage.</p><p id="P37">During sucrose seeking, we observed that EE impaired the cue specificity of cue-reactive, PL pyramidal cells and generally enhanced their activity <italic>in vivo.</italic> This lack of difference in cue-related activity resembled what was observed in early conditioning sessions, prior to establishment of a robust cue-food association. Since alterations in excitability correlate with alterations in bulk calcium signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>], the increased peak responses may arise from the enhanced excitability of pyramidal cell ensembles following EE, combined with increased recruitment of excitatory afferents to PL such as ventral hippocampus and BLA neurons. Additionally, the decreased action potential amplitude in in tdTomato– neurons and decreased recruitment of Fos+ and tdTomato– neurons suggest a dominant contribution of calcium signals from pyramidal cell ensembles. The increase in peak responses are thought to indicate an increase in synchronous activity from a set number of neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Our study cannot elucidate the precise source of this enhanced peak response. One possibility is that the reduced interneuron recruitment following EE may reduce local inhibition and allow more excitatory input to dominate and enhance peak responses.</p><p id="P38">If enhanced pyramidal cell excitability promotes loss of cue specificity and general enhancement of peak activity, then this enhancement may represent alterations in encoding cue-related information. Related to this, we have observed disrupted sucrose cue responding following chemogenetically enhancing mPFC ensemble excitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Additionally, increased pyramidal cell activity <italic>in vivo</italic> may increase behavioral control over food cues, as PL hypoactivity is known to produce the opposite effect and decreases inhibitory behavioral control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>].</p><p id="P39">Distinct PL projections play different roles in reward seeking. For instance, food cue presentations largely excite and suppress PL neuronal ensembles that project to the nucleus accumbens and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. A caveat of this fiber photometry study is that the activity of specific neuronal ensembles and projection pathways cannot be revealed. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that distinct neurons were recruited with larger or more synchronous activity following EE. Future studies should utilize tools such as miniature endoscopes that provide single-cell resolution to reveal altered encoding patterns of individual PL projection neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] which are newly recruited following EE and/or the ensembles which are normally recruited under standard housing conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S24"><title>EE-induces inhibitory underdrive in PL interneurons</title><p id="P40">Despite EE still reactivating neurons that established the ‘original’ (prior to EE) sucrose cue memory, EE attenuated the recruitment of neurons that were not cue-tagged with tdTomato.

These neurons inhibit activity of nearby pyramidal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>] and facilitate the suppression of sucrose seeking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Hence, EE-mediated decreases in the recruitment of PV-expressing interneurons, may contribute to decreased PL Fos expression as well as persistent activation and generally elevated <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of pyramidal cells.

Here we demonstrated how EE dynamically modulated PL neuronal excitability- and activity-related properties, and engaged mechanisms linked to excitatory overdrive and inhibitory underdrive. We revealed how a non-pharmacological intervention can harness prefrontal circuits that are relevant for understanding the ‘anti-food seeking’ network. Critically, EE boosted the excitability of cue-reactive neurons that ‘originally’ established a sucrose cue memory, indicating its ability to modify behaviorally relevant neurons. Since these neurons exhibited decreased rheobase, future investigations could identify sources of this decrease and investigate factors such as alterations in sodium channel conductance and subunit composition, using ‘Patch-seq’ that combines whole-cell recordings with transcriptomic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>].</p><p id="P43">Furthermore, PL ensembles activated during sucrose self-administration project to reward- and motivation-relevant structures such as the BLA and nucleus accumbens<sup>26</sup>. Hence, an interesting future investigation is to reveal whether EE exerts its ‘anti-food seeking’ actions via modifying the downstream connectivity of cue-reactive PL ensembles in these structures. In summary, our current study sheds further light on the complex nature of excitation- and inhibition-relevant PL adaptations that might contribute to reducing the impact of food cues and thus contribute to EE’s ‘anti-craving’ effects. Such neurons may serve as potential neurophysiological targets that guide development of novel therapeutics that control food cravings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental information</label><media xlink:href="EMS205859-supplement-Supplemental_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d181aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Dr. Andre Chagas and Prof. Hans Crombag (University of Sussex), Drs.
