While we have a good understanding of the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species typically responsible for spoilage, we know very little about how these bacteria interact with food surfaces during spoilage. Here we assessed the spoilage capabilities of a large panel (n=124) of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species food-derived isolates on meat (chicken) and leafy greens (spinach). Most isolates (71/124) were capable of spoiling both foods, but some were only capable of spoiling only chicken (21/124) or spinach (23/124), or neither (9/124). Our data also demonstrated that the type of fresh food the strain was isolated from influenced spoilage capabilities: strains isolated from meat were likely to spoil both chicken and spinach, while those isolated from leafy greens were more likely to spoil only spinach. We used fluorescence microscopy to visualise how <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spoilage species interacted with the meat or leaf tissue and observed significant tissue destruction associated with biofilm formation. For chicken, this was associated with the formation of dense biofilm pillars that penetrated deep into the tissue. For spinach we observed biofilms on the leaf in areas of tissue degradation. Finally, we explored the correlation between potentially relevant phenotypes (<italic>in vitro</italic> biofilm, motility and secreted enzyme production) and spoilage capabilities. There was no significant correlation between any of these phenotypes and spoilage, except for secreted protease activity and chicken spoilage. Overall, this study increases our understanding of processes involved in food spoilage by <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Almost 10% of the world’s population do not have enough to eat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">FAO, 2020</xref>). Given that the world’s population is predicted to reach 9.8 billion by 2050, more than a 50% increase in food availability is needed to feed the growing population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">WRI, 2018</xref>). Despite these drastic numbers approximately 17% of food produced for human consumption worldwide is lost or wasted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">UNEP, 2021</xref>). Food loss is defined as food products being discarded prior to the retail stage, for instance during production, harvesting, and preparation, whilst food waste is defined as food products being discarded at the retail, food service provider, consumer and household stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">World Food Program USA (WFP USA), 2022</xref>). These processes also squander resources such as water, energy and land that go into producing food. Reducing food loss and waste is one of the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations, which aims to significantly increase global sustainability by 2030 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">United Nations, 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Food spoilage is a major contributor to food loss and waste, and is due to physical, chemical and/or microbial factors that cause changes in the texture, smell, taste or appearance of food, leading to it be discarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Mafe et al., 2024</xref>). Many foods provide an ideal environment for growth and proliferation of certain microbes. During growth, these microbes can produce a range of molecules that cause food spoilage, including by-products of metabolism that produce off-odours, off-flavours and discolouration; production of extracellular polymeric substances that cause a slimy texture; and secretion of enzymes that break down food, causing malodour and changes in texture and flavour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alegbeleye et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Barth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Braun et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Non-pathogenic <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species, like <italic>P. fluorescens, P. fragi</italic> and <italic>P. putida</italic>, are common spoilers of a range of meat, poultry, seafood, vegetable, fruit and dairy products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Karanth et al., 2023</xref>). These species are capable of growing at a wide range of temperatures, including cold storage temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Raposo et al., 2016</xref>). Food spoilage by these species occurs due to the production of secreted enzymes, such as proteases, lipases and cellulases; production of extracellular polymeric substances such as proteins, extracellular DNA (eDNA) and polysaccharides, which creates a slime layer on food; production of pigments, such as pyoverdine (yellow-green) and pyomelanin (brown-black), which result in food discolouration; and production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can result in off-flavour and off-odour of foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Karanth et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Wickramasinghe et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Food spoilage microbes grow on food in complex 3D communities called biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Korber et al., 2009</xref>). A biofilm is a community of microbes that are encased within an extracellular matrix/slime, composed of exopolymeric substances (EPS), that attaches microbial cells to a surface and/or to one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Sauer et al., 2022</xref>). Biofilm development typically begins with attachment of microbes to a biotic or abiotic surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Stoodley et al., 2002</xref>). During biofilm development microbes produce EPS that facilitate cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions within the biofilm matrix, to grow the structure and maintain integrity. The most common EPS matrix components are polysaccharides, extracellular DNA (eDNA) and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Flemming et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Biofilms are a protected mode of growth that allows microbes to thrive in hostile environments, by providing protection from antibiotics, disinfectants and immune system factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Flemming et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, biofilms are extremely difficult to eradicate once they have formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Singh et al., 2017</xref>). Given this, significant efforts have been made to prevent biofilm formation, or to disrupt biofilms once they have formed in a range of settings, including the food chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Galié et al., 2018</xref>). In this setting, a major focus has been on targeting biofilms on food processing surfaces using chemical and enzymatic treatments, as well as the use of microbial-derived antibacterial compounds (bacteriocins, such as nisin, and biosurfactants) or essential oils obtained from plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Galié et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Despite significant efforts to target biofilms in the food chain, food spoilage remains a major global challenge. One contributing factor is that while biofilms have been well-studied under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions, and on abiotic food chain surfaces like stainless steel and plastic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Carrascosa et al., 2021</xref>), biofilms on the surface of food have not been extensively studied. To our knowledge no studies have characterised <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spoilage species biofilms on post-harvest leafy greens. Two prior studies have visualised <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spoilage species biofilms on the surface of beef or pork, from when the meat was fresh until spoiled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Delaquis et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Wickramasinghe et al., 2019</xref>). These studies mainly focused on visualising biofilm structures on the meat surface, i.e. above the tissue and reported a range of distinct morphological characteristics for different <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species over the course of spoilage.</p><p id="P8">In this study we characterised spoilage capabilities of a large panel (n=124) of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species food-derived isolates on fresh skinless chicken breast and fresh baby spinach. Given that spoilage is associated with significant alterations in the meat or leaf tissue we wanted to understand how <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spoilage species interacted with the respective tissue during spoilage. We found that biofilm formation was associated with significant destruction of both tissue types and in the case of chicken, with deep penetration into the tissue. We also explored the correlation between potentially relevant phenotypes (<italic>in vitro</italic> biofilm, motility and secreted enzyme production) and spoilage capabilities.

See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for the full list of isolates. <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> isolates were cryogenically stored at -70°C in 15% (v/v) glycerol, cultured on lysogeny broth (LB) solidified with agar at 1.5% (w/v) for routine maintenance and grown in LB prior to use in assays where specific media was used, as detailed below.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Food spoilage assays</title><p id="P10">Skinless chicken breast and baby spinach (<italic>Spinacia oleracea</italic>) leaves were obtained from the a supermarket in Norwich, United Kingdom, on the day of the experiment. A cold storage chain was maintained from the supermarket to the lab. To remove the native microbiota from the food surface, the chicken or spinach leaves were washed in sodium hypochlorite (0.1%, [v/v]) followed by a wash in sterile deionised water, with each wash repeated twice. Each food product was then exposed to UV in a Stratalinker UV Crosslinker 2400 machine (Stratagene) for a period of 10 min (chicken) or 5 min (spinach) at 3000 μjoules. For chicken the bleached outer surface was removed with a scalpel aseptically, and the sterile inner tissue was cut into small strips which were subjected to additional UV treatments (on each side), then further cut with a 8 mm biopsy punch to generate pieces of chicken that were approximately 8 mm in diameter and 6 mm high, which was subjected to a final UV treatment on each side before use. For spinach only the leaf region (i.e. not stem or rib region) was used and was cut into pieces that were approximately 6 mm in diameter, which was UV treated on each side prior to use. The sterilised food samples were inoculated with a <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> isolate as follows. Each isolate was grown in LB at 25 °C, shaking at 200 rpm, overnight. Prior to inoculation the overnight culture was diluted 1:100 into Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and one piece of sterile chicken or spinach added to the cell suspension. This was incubated at room temperature (approx. 22 °C) for 1 h after which the cell suspension was then removed. Sterilised chicken and spinach were also inoculated with PBS in the absence of bacterial cells as controls. These chicken and spinach samples were incubated at room temperature (~ 22 °C) under humid conditions by placing the samples in a plastic box which contained paper towel dampened with 10 mM Mg<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Spoilage scored at 2 and 7 days. A Sensory Evaluation assessment was used by a panel of trained individuals to score changes in the smell, colour and texture of the chicken and spinach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">de Bouillé and Beeren, 2016</xref>) compared to the uninoculated control.

To visualise biofilms formed by live cells, the tetrazolium redox-based dyes, 5-Cyano-2,3-Ditolyl-Tetrazolium Chloride (CTC; Merck) and 2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC; Merck) were used to visualise biofilms on chicken and spinach, respectively. Respiring cells reduce these dyes to CTC- or TTC-formazan crystal, which is visualised in the red fluorescent channel or as red visible light, respectively. To stain biofilms, CTC (1.5 mg/mL [w/v] in PBS) or TTC (0.5% [w/v] in PBS) was added to the chicken or spinach sample, respectively. The samples were fully immersed in the dye solution and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, protected from light. For chicken, the samples were also stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (2 μg/mL [w/v], Merck) and/or ethidium homodimer-III (EthHD-III) (5 μM, Biotium) for 30 min at room temperature, protected from light. The dyes were then removed and the sample washed twice with PBS. The sample was then fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4 °C. The next day the PFA was removed, and the sample was washed twice with PBS prior to imaging.</p><p id="P12">For chicken, the sample was then transferred to a μ-Plate 24 well glass bottom plate (Ibidi) and imaged with fluorescence microscopy on a DeltaVision Elite Widefield inverted microscope (Image Solutions) with a PCO Edge 5.5 monochrome sCMOS camera (Excelitas) and a Spectra 7 Light Engine (Lumencor) using a x10 UPlanFLN Semi Apochromat objective (Olympus), SoftWoRx acquisition software (Applied Precision), and filter sets for DAPI (excitation 395 nm/25 nm, emission 455 nm/50 nm), EthHD-III (excitation 550/15, emission 605/52) and CTC (excitation 470 nm/24 nm, emission 605 nm/52 nm).

Many of the isolates (71/124) could spoil both spinach and chicken, 21/124 were only capable of spoiling chicken, 23/124 were only capable of spoiling spinach, and 9/124 were incapable of spoiling either food, even after 7 days incubation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Looking at spoilage capabilities at the species level, 100% of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (14 isolates), <italic>P. furukawaii</italic> (3 isolates) and <italic>P. trivialis</italic> (1 isolates) were capable of spoiling both chicken and spinach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-D</xref>).

For isolates from meat products the majority were capable of spoiling chicken (85% of isolates) and spinach (82% of isolates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-F</xref>); for isolates from seafood more were capable of spoiling chicken (95%) than spinach (55%); and for isolates from leafy greens, they were overall much better at spoiling spinach (78%) than chicken (45%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-F</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Next, we wanted to visualise where live <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species were located on chicken and spinach during spoilage. To visualise live bacteria, we used the redox-based dyes, 5-Cyano-2,3-Ditolyl-Tetrazolium Chloride (CTC) for chicken and 2,3,5-Triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) for spinach. Respiring cells reduce the tetrazolium dye to a formazan crystal, which is visualised in the red fluorescent channel (CTC) or as red visible light (TTC). The chicken samples were also stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to stain the chicken tissue, then fixed and imaged using wide-field deconvolution fluorescence microscopy. For spinach we used light microscopy and a colour camera to visualise red TTC staining on the green leaf. Since both chicken and spinach samples were washed multiple times prior to imaging, we were only visualising biofilm structures that were strongly attached to the food surface; any loosely attached cells/aggregates and/or slime was removed and not visualised. This allowed us to visualise how the bacteria were interacting with and potentially modifying the tissue structure during spoilage.</p><p id="P27">We saw destruction of chicken tissue in cases where chicken spoilage had occurred compared to the uninoculated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This destruction is clearly visible in the DAPI channel images where we observed large voids of varying sizes that extended down into the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-D</xref>). Remarkably, most of these voids were filled with CTC-stained <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> biofilms, demonstrating that chicken spoilage is associated with the formation of dense, pillar-like biofilm structures that extend into the chicken tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-D</xref>). Since DAPI was added to samples pre-fixing i.e. cells were live, the DAPI stain did not penetrate the bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, the DAPI stain was not localised to nuclei in the chicken tissue, as would be expected in live, intact muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This diffuse DAPI staining was also observed in the uninoculated sterile control, however in this sample no voids in the DAPI staining were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P28">To determine if the biofilms formed by <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> isolates on sterilised chicken were representative of the spoilage biofilms formed by microbes present on retail chicken, we allowed fresh chicken to spoil under the same incubation conditions. Macroscopically the samples appeared similar to chicken spoilage in our single-species assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Additionally, when we stained these retail chicken samples with CTC and DAPI we observed similar voids in the chicken tissue that were filled with biofilm structures that penetrated the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This demonstrates that our chicken spoilage assay is a good model for understanding the development of biofilms associated with chicken spoilage.</p><p id="P29">We also followed biofilm development by <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> isolate #95 that was capable of a high degree of chicken spoilage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). This isolate was inoculated onto sterilised chicken and stained and imaged at days 2 and 4. We used DAPI and CTC stains as above and included the cell impermeant DNA stain, ethidium homodimer-III (EthHD-III), since extracellular DNA (eDNA) is a common component of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Okshevsky et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). As for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, there was no alteration in the chicken tissue for the uninoculated sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), whereas <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> isolate #95 caused significant destruction of the chicken tissue at day 2, which was even more pronounced at day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-C</xref>). The biofilms extended in pillar-like structures into the chicken tissue at day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). These structures were also observed at day 4, however, at this time point there were also some large regions (~100-200 μm in diameter) of tissue destruction which were filled with biofilms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). There was also eDNA and/or dead bacterial cells observed in the inoculated samples that was associated with the pillar-like biofilm structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-C</xref>).</p><p id="P30">For spinach spoilage we saw clear destruction of the leaf tissue that was often associated with regions containing live bacteria (i.e. TTC stained) that were arranged in biofilm aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-F</xref>). For strains with low levels of spoilage whilst we saw many biofilm aggregates on the leaf and rib region, there was minimal leaf destruction (i.e. holes) visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). For strains with moderate spoilage capabilities, we observed biofilm aggregates on the leaf and rib with more regions of tissue degradation being visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-D</xref>). For strains with high spoilage capacity the cuticle and upper epidermis was degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). In these samples we observed few biofilm aggregates on the actual leaf surface and more surrounding the rib region, presumably since this was the region with the highest level of structural integrity that remained in the spoiled leaf. The leaf degradation and biofilms formed by <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> isolates in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-E</xref>) were similar to spoilage caused by the native microbiota on spinach that had not be sterilised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). This confirms that our spinach spoilage assay is a good model for studying biofilms associated with spinach spoilage.</p><p id="P31">Our data suggests that spoilage bacteria attach to food surfaces, form biofilms and cause spoilage via tissue degradation. We wanted to further explore the correlations between spoilage and phenotypes associated with biofilm development and secreted enzyme production. It is well established that <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilm formation requires initial attachment to the substratum, which in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species is often mediated by twitching and swimming motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">O’Toole and Kolter, 1998</xref>). <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spoilage species secrete several extracellular enzymes, including lipases, proteases and cellulases that are thought to be involved in either tissue degradation and/or food spoilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alegbeleye et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Barth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Braun et al., 1999</xref>). We therefore assayed the panel of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> isolates for attachment/early biofilm formation, twitching and swimming motilities, and secreted enzyme activities using well-established <italic>in vitro</italic> assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). To determine if <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotypes correlated with spoilage capabilities, we performed separate multiple logistic regression analyses with chicken or spinach spoilage outcome (i.e. spoilage or no spoilage) as the dependent variable and <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotypic data as the independent variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Overall, these analyses show that there is no significant correlation between spinach spoilage and any of the <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotypes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). There was no significant correlation with any of the <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotypes and chicken spoilage other than secreted protease activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P32">We also investigated whether the presence of genes encoding secreted enzymes correlated with spoilage capabilities. We looked for the presence of genes encoding known <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> secreted proteases, AprX, AprA, Piv, LasA, LasB and PaaP, secreted lipases TliA, LipC and LipA2 and secreted cellulase BcsZ by performing tBLASTn searches against the whole genome sequences of all isolates using a 70% amino acid identity and 70% coverage cut off (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). The genes <italic>aprA, piv, lasA, lasB, paaP</italic> and <italic>lipC</italic> were encoded in 100% of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates, which were all capable of spoiling chicken and spinach. These genes were not found in any of the non-<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates except for <italic>P. furukawaii</italic> isolates, which possessed <italic>paaP</italic>. To determine if there was a correlation between the presence of genes encoding other secreted proteases, lipases and cellulases (<italic>aprX, tliA, lipA2 and bcsZ</italic>) in the non-<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates with spoilage capabilities we performed Pearson’s correlation coefficient analyses. This revealed that there was no significant positive correlation for any of these genes and spoilage capabilities, except for <italic>aprX</italic> and chicken spoilage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Interestingly, almost all isolates that possessed <italic>aprX</italic> (54/58 isolates; 93%) were capable of chicken spoilage. Of the isolates that did not encode <italic>aprX</italic>, 46% of these (24/52 isolates) were capable of chicken spoilage, which suggests that there are other secreted enzymes involved.</p></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P33">It is well established that various members of the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> genus cause food spoilage and that the relative abundance of these species within the microbial community increases from when food is fresh until it is spoiled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Karanth et al., 2023</xref>). Here we wanted to understand how widespread the prevalence of food spoilage capacity is in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains isolated from fresh food. We used a panel of 124 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains and determined their individual capacity to spoil chicken and spinach. We developed models of chicken and spinach spoilage that were excellent representations of the real-world situation as they recapitulated spoilage observed with the native <italic>in situ</italic> communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). For the uninoculated controls in both models, we observed no changes in the chicken or spinach tissue over time, which indicates that the observed changes in the spoiled food were due to microbial activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P34">To our knowledge this is the most comprehensive study of food spoilage by <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species. We observed that most isolates were capable of spoiling both foods, with a few isolates displaying specialisation for chicken or spinach spoilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Our data also demonstrated that the type of fresh food the strain was isolated from influenced spoilage capabilities: strains isolated from meat were likely to spoil both chicken and spinach, while those isolated from leafy greens were more likely to spoil only spinach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-F</xref>). Interestingly, a small number of isolates were not capable of spoiling either food in isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), however since food microbiomes are comprised of mixed communities, it is possible that these isolates may contribute to spoilage as a member of a more complex community.</p><p id="P35">There has been little exploration of how <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species interact with food tissues during spoilage. Here we showed that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species that were capable of chicken and spinach spoilage formed biofilms associated with significant tissue destruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). To our knowledge, our study is the first to visualise <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spoilage species biofilms on post-harvest spinach. The <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species biofilms on post-harvest spinach appear similar to previous reports of biofilms formed on (live) leaf surfaces pre-harvest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Morris et al., 1997</xref>). As spoilage progresses, there is more degradation of the cuticle and upper epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), and biofilms are found less frequently on the leaf region and are more often localised to the rib region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-F</xref>). This suggests that active degradation of the leaf tissue forces the bacteria to either move to another, intact, location on the leaf or rib, or to disperse.</p><p id="P36">During chicken spoilage, we observed deep penetration of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species biofilms into the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first time that spoilage-associated biofilms have been visualised below the surface of the chicken tissue. The ability to penetrate the chicken tissue is likely because the tissue is dead, thus the cell membranes are easily breached and there is no host immune system to protect against microbial invasion. In the current study we are unable to determine if there are specific components of the chicken tissue where cells preferentially attach to then penetrate the tissue. Overall, the biofilms formed on chicken and spinach are unique compared to well-studied <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilms where the substratum is inert and unchanging e.g. on plastic or glass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Sauer et al., 2022</xref>). This is consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilm assay results, which did not correlate with spoilage capabilities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Indeed, previous studies have shown that while <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilm assays facilitate high throughput rapid screening experiments, the conditions and nature of the biofilms formed are typically not a good representation of biofilms formed in real-world settings (Bjarnsholt et al., 2013).</p><p id="P37">Our results show that chicken spoilage capabilities were only significantly correlated with either <italic>in vitro</italic> secreted protease activity or the presence of a gene encoding a known secreted protease (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Of the 92 isolates capable of chicken spoilage, 73 (80%) had either <italic>in vitro</italic> secreted protease activity, or encoded a secreted protease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Tables 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">4</xref>).

This suggest that there may be other proteases that are involved in chicken spoilage in these strains. The lack of correlation between other secreted enzyme activity or genes (lipases and cellulase) and spoilage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>) suggests that these secreted enzymes are unlikely to play an important role in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species spoilage of chicken or spinach, or that the environmental conditions in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays are not representative of the <italic>in situ</italic> conditions. It also suggests that there are other secreted enzymes involved in spoilage that target different cellular components.
