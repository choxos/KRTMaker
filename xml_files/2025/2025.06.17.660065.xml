The auxin inducible degron is a method developed to achieve this end and is effective in mammalian and yeast cells. The approach is dependent on the recognition of a tagged target protein by an endogenous E3 ubiquitin ligase modified by the expression of a plant F-box protein. This approach was initially unsuccessful in trypanosomes probably due to a lack of interaction between the endogenous E3 ubiquitin ligase and the plant F-box protein. This was overcome by expressing the entire rice E3 ubiquitin ligase in trypanosomes and here we describe the production of the auxin inducible degron competent cell lines and tagging of target genes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Trypanosome</kwd><kwd>auxin inducible degron</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The ability to specifically ablate a protein still underlies the majority of investigations into the function of a particular gene. The first approach used to identify a role for a gene in a process involved making null or conditional mutants through random mutagenesis and screening for a particular phenotype. This type of forward genetics, in various guises, remains a powerful tool as it requires no knowledge of the identity of the gene. The advent of widely available genome sequences allowed the identification of target genes that may or may not be involved in a process of interest and led to an explosion in reverse genetics. In this approach, the gene was identified from sequence, altered in some way, and the resulting phenotype investigated. Any phenotype usually results from the loss of a protein in a cell and this can be achieved at three levels: deletion of the gene, ablation of the mRNA by RNAi, or targeted degradation of the protein. All are effective but each has disadvantages; recovery after gene deletion may result in a compensatory change that masks a phenotype. RNAi based degradation of a specific mRNA occurs rapidly but not always completely, also the protein lingers on and often has to drop below a threshold before a phenotype becomes apparent. This makes it difficult to separate primary and secondary phenotypes. Protein ablation through targeted degradation is not always complete but is rapid and provides an opportunity to identify a primary phenotype.</p><p id="P3">The African trypanosome <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> is the causal agent of disease in humans, livestock and wild animals. It has been intensively studied for more than 100 years and research now centres on both the causes of pathology and on basic cellular and molecular processes of a divergent eukaryote. Forward genetics is non-trivial as trypanosomes are diploid, crosses occur in the salivary glands of the tsetse fly and are a non-obligatory part of the life cycle. The genome was sequenced 20 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] and this opened up the use of reverse genetics as an approach to address questions about trypanosome biology. The dominant approach has been RNAi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] which has been successful both in identifying the role of individual genes and has been modified for forward genetics using whole genome RNAi libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. The RNAi approach usually uses tetracycline-inducible promoters to produce double stranded RNA and the target mRNA is dramatically reduced within one hour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. However, in many experiments a phenotype does not appear for another 24 hours or more (for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]) and this has been interpreted as the time taken for the protein of interest to drop below a threshold by dilution resulting from cell proliferation. This lag means it can be difficult to separate primary and secondary phenotypes. The time taken for protein levels to diminish is a particular problem in experiments investigating mRNA turnover as the half-life of mRNAs in trypanosomes ranges from a few minutes to a couple of hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. The time taken for protein depletion after RNAi induction means it is difficult to resolve which mRNAs are altered as a primary effect of the RNAi knock down and which changes are secondary. To get around this problem we have adapted the auxin degron system for use in trypanosomes and here we describe its use in procyclic form <italic>T. brucei.</italic></p><p id="P4">The auxin dependent degron is based on an Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase that contains TIR1 as the F-box protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. TIR1 determines specificity by binding to a substrate protein in an auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) dependent manner. The degron system was developed for use in yeast and mammalian cells and involved two steps. First, ectopic expression of TIR1 and second, the tagging of a target protein with an auxin induced degradation (AID) domain from the plant IAA17/AXR3-1 protein that is sufficient for binding to TIR1 in an auxin-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. On the addition of exogenous auxin, the target protein is the ubiquitinylated and subsequently degraded by the proteosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). There is no known equivalent of the auxin dependent SCF in fungi or mammals and for the system to work the plant TIR1 has to bind the SKP1 component of the endogenous SCF. In addition, the endogenous levels of IAA in the experimental system have to be below the threshold for activating the SCF-TIR1.</p><p id="P5">Initial experiments with procyclic form <italic>T. brucei</italic> in culture were unsuccessful, most likely due to a failure of TIR1 to interact with the endogenous SKP1. After a lot of faffing about, we decided to reconstruct the entire plant SCF-TIR1 in trypanosomes using the sequences of the components from rice as trypanosomes are cultured at 28°C or 37°C depending on the developmental stage. However, cell lines expressing these transgenes were only partially effective. Tagging of target proteins with AID domains in cell lines expressing the rice E3 ubiquitin ligase resulted in decreased expression levels in the absence of exogenous auxin. However, there was a glimmer of hope as addition of IAA resulted in degradation of the residual protein. The reduced level of the tagged protein is almost certainly due to levels of endogenous auxin produced by the metabolism of tryptophan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Success followed the removal of this problem by altering the IAA binding site on TIR1 through changing phenylalanine 74 to glycine and using 5-phenyl IAA as the inducer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P6">The above serves as background to the methods below which describe first how to make a trypanosome cell line expressing rice SCF-TIR1 plus ARF, and second how to then produce a cell line with a specific gene tagged with a degron. The protocols are based on <italic>T. brucei</italic> Lister 427 procyclic forms but are applicable to other cell lines and developmental stages.</p><p id="P7">The open reading frames of four rice proteins, CUL1 (cullin/CDC53), SKP1, RBX1, and TIR1, were modified to include a single Ty epitope tag at the C-termini and were made synthetically after being codon optimised to increase expression in trypanosomes. In addition, a domain from rice auxin response factor 16 (ARF16) with an N-terminal Ty epitope tag was added to the mix as this had been reported to improve the functioning of the system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. The five transgenes were cloned into plasmid vectors in two sets: p4919 contains CUL1, SKP1, RBX1 and a G418 resistance marker; p5179 contains TIR1 F74-&gt;G, ARF16 fragment and a blasticidin resistance marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Both plasmids contain PacI sites flanking the inserts and both were designed for read through RNA polymerase II transcription after integration into either the tubulin locus for p4919 or the PFR1 locus for p5179.</p><p id="P8">To make a protein susceptible to auxin inducible degradation the gene is altered so that the encoded protein is a fusion with an AID domain. The method below is based on using derivatives of the pPOT plasmid series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] as a template for making a PCR product that is used to modify the endogenous locus of the gene of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Trypanosomes are diploid and so this process is performed twice so both alleles are modified, one set of pPOT template plasmids encodes puromycin resistance, the second hygromycin. The success of the modification can be determined by western blotting either using an antibody recognising the protein of interest or epitope tags added as part of the modification of the endogenous gene and/or whole cell mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials"><label>2</label><title>Materials</title><sec id="S3"><title>Follow local safety regulations when handling <italic>Trypanosoma brucei.</italic></title><p id="P9">Prepare all solutions with ultrapure water and filter sterilize all solutions and store at 4°C.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2.1</label><title>Growth of procyclic form <italic>T. brucei</italic> in culture</title><list list-type="order" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P10"><italic>T. brucei</italic> cell lines are available from www.atcc.org.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P11">SDM79 medium plus 10% heat inactivated foetal bovine serum.
