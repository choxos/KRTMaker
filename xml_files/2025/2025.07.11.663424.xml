Recently, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) has released basecalling models capable of detecting several RNA modifications. However, their accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, as well as cross-reactivity against other modification types, remains largely unexplored. Here, we systematically benchmark modification-aware models by evaluating their performance on a highly-multiplexed panel of synthetic molecules covering all possible sequence contexts, as well as on biological samples from a diverse set of species. We find that modification-aware models reliably detect diverse RNA modification types across a broad range of sequence contexts. However, they are prone to elevated false positive rates and exhibit notable cross-reactivity with other RNA modification types. We show that the use of modification-free controls allows significant, yet incomplete removal of false positives, thus constituting an essential control. Finally, we demonstrate that basecalling error patterns and alterations in current features can identify differentially modified sites, for modifications for which modification-aware models are absent. Overall, our results underscore the utility and accuracy of modification-aware basecalling models for RNA modification detection, while highlighting the importance of including diverse control samples to mitigate false positive rates.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">RNA modifications, collectively referred to as ‘the epitranscriptome’, are chemical moieties present in RNA molecules, fine-tuning their structure, function and molecular fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). In recent years, the possibility to sequence native RNA molecules has emerged, enabling the direct capture of RNA modifications without the need for reverse transcription or PCR amplification, bypassing the need for selective antibodies or chemical probing reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). This has been enabled by the nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS) platform, currently commercialised by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).</p><p id="P3">To detect RNA modifications, approaches developed so far can be binned into three main categories: i) methods that rely on systematic basecalling errors, which exploit the fact that RNA modifications cannot be base-called by models that were only trained to detect canonical bases (A, C, G, U) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>); ii) methods that rely on alterations in raw current features, such as signal intensity, trace or dwell time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>); and iii) modification-aware basecalling models, which have been trained to detect a modification of interest, and thus can directly predict RNA modifications in individual reads, in addition to the four canonical bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Recently, ONT has released several modification-aware basecalling models, namely for <italic>N6</italic>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A), inosine (I), 5-methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) and pseudouridine (Ψ). These models offer the possibility to predict RNA modifications <italic>de novo</italic>, with single nucleotide and single molecule resolution. However, their accuracy, false positive rates and cross-reactivity with other RNA modifications remain unclear.</p><p id="P4">Here we assess the performance of modification-aware basecalling models released (September 2024) by ONT (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) on synthetic modified and unmodified RNA molecules, as well as on rRNAs from diverse species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Globally, our results show that modification-aware basecalling models capture the most modified sites at high stoichiometries, but can mispredict a significant number of sites. Moreover, some models show strong cross-reactivity with other RNA modifications found on the same nucleobase, which could lead to inaccurate conclusions if the models are used for <italic>de novo</italic> prediction of RNA modifications. We find that the use of modification-free controls that cover equivalent sequence contexts to the samples of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) are necessary to remove false positives from nanopore basecalling models. However, we also show that these controls are insufficient to remove all false positives, warranting future improvements to the basecalling models or correction methods. Finally, for those RNA modifications for which modification-aware basecalling models are not available, we demonstrate that diverse RNA modification types can be identified in the form of differential base-calling errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) and altered current features, demonstrating that previously developed approaches for RNA002 chemistry can still be used in the context of the new RNA004 chemistry.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Expanding direct RNA-sequencing demultiplexing to 96 barcodes for RNA004 chemistry</title><p id="P5">To ease the systematic benchmarking of diverse synthetic and <italic>in vivo</italic> RNA molecules with known modifications, we reasoned that a multiplexing model to barcode all samples in a single flowcell would greatly simplify the experimental setup and downstream bioinformatic analysis, as well as significantly minimize the batch effects observed across samples that are sequenced in different flowcells. However, no commercial barcoding kit exists for the latest direct RNA sequencing chemistry (SQK-RNA004), limiting the technology’s use and cost-effectiveness. To this end, community-driven efforts have recently been released for multiplexing DRS runs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), some of which are compatible with the newest chemistry, showing high precision and recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). However, these efforts are so far limited to multiplexing a few barcodes in the case of RNA004 chemistry.</p><p id="P6">Here, we extended previous efforts by training a model capable of demultiplexing up to 96 samples with the latest SQK-RNA004 kits (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). We found that the newly trained 96-barcoding model (b96_RNA004) reached a precision of 99.3% with 100% recall on the validation dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Furthermore, the processing time was not significantly affected compared to our four-barcode model (b04_RNA004), resulting in a mean real-time of 1.3 min per 100,000 reads processed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). Finally, we tested the performance of the b96_RNA004 demultiplexing model on an additional independent test dataset in which barcodes 21, 59, and 88 were absent from the run (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). We found that 0.00009% of the total reads were misassigned to either of these barcodes after the default cutoff of baseQ &gt; 50 was applied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>), suggesting that this model provides a highly accurate and rapid way to sequence up to 96 samples in a single flowcell.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Systematic benchmarking of modification-aware RNA basecalling models with synthetic sequences</title><p id="P7">In September 2024, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) released a set of modification-aware basecalling models (m6A_DRACH, inosine_m6A, pseU, and m5C) that can detect four different RNA modification types (m<sup>6</sup>A, I, Ψ and m<sup>5</sup>C) using their proprietary basecalling software <italic>dorado</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado">https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado</ext-link>). To systematically benchmark these models on datasets with known ground-truths in which the modification stoichiometry at each position is known, we employed synthetic RNA constructs covering all possible 5-mer sequences (n = 1024), referred to as ‘curlcakes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), which have been previously used to assess the detection of diverse RNA modification types using the DRS platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), as well as to train diverse algorithms to detect RNA modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Specifically, here we generated ‘curlcake’ constructs with either canonical nucleobases (A, C, G or U) –the unmodified control–, or with one different modified nucleobase at a time, including those for which modification-aware basecalling models have been trained (m<sup>6</sup>A, m<sup>5</sup>C and Ψ), and for other RNA modification types for which there are currently no modification-aware basecalling model available (hm<sup>5</sup>C, ac<sup>4</sup>C, m<sup>1</sup>Ψ and m<sup>5</sup>U). Next, highly-multiplexed DRS libraries of synthetic modified and unmodified controls were generated in triplicates and sequenced on a PromethION flowcell (FLO-PRO004RA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Following sequencing, the raw sequencing data was basecalled with either of the four modification-aware basecalling models using the MasterOfPores nextflow workflow (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Finally, per-read modification probabilities were extracted using the ONT <italic>modkit</italic> software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit">https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit</ext-link>), and per-site modification stoichiometries were calculated using default modification probability thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We first evaluated the performance of each model in identifying their designated RNA modification (e.g., m<sup>6</sup>A), compared to their unmodified counterpart (e.g., A). In the case of m<sup>6</sup>A detection, both the ‘all-context’ model (inosine_m6A) and the ‘context-aware’ model (m6A_DRACH) were examined. We should note that the latter restricts its predictions to the mammalian m<sup>6</sup>A modification consensus motif DRACH. We then extracted per-read modification probabilities across all possible 5-mers, finding that the models globally yielded median modification probabilities ranging from 0.79 (m5C model) to 0.94 (m6A_DRACH model). Thus, performance varied strongly depending on the model, with the m5C model being the one reporting the overall lowest modification probabilities at modified sites, as well as showing a higher overlap between the distribution of modification probabilities of modified and unmodified sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To quantitatively assess these differences, we then calculated the performance of each model at per-read level, and built Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for each model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). All models showed a good performance globally (ROC-AUC = 0.914-0.965), with the m5C model being the one showing lowest Area Under the Curve (AUC) values. Considering that m<sup>6</sup>A mainly occurs in DRACH sites, we then compared the performance of m6A_DRACH and inosine_m6A models to detect m<sup>6</sup>A modifications in DRACH sequence contexts, finding that the m6A_DRACH model showed improved performance (ROC-AUC=0.965) compared to the ‘all-context’ inosine_m6A) counterpart (ROC-AUC=0.955) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Similarly, Precision-Recall (PR) curves were built for each model to examine how the models would identify positive instances (true positives) while minimizing the false positives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Our analyses revealed that the AUC values ranged from 0.821 (m5C model) to 0.895 (m6A_DRACH model), suggesting that the former has a higher amount of false positives.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Modification-aware basecalling models show cross-reactivity against other RNA modification types</title><p id="P10">Current ONT modification-aware basecalling models are trained to specifically identify a given modified base against its canonical counterpart (e.g., m<sup>6</sup>A versus A). However, whether these models cross-react with other similar chemical marks that also exist on the same nucleobase remains largely unexplored. To investigate the potential cross-reactivity of these models, we examined their performance on m<sup>1</sup>Ψ- and m<sup>5</sup>U-modified sequences (for the pseU model), and on hm<sup>5</sup>C- and ac<sup>4</sup>C-modified sequences (for the m5C model). This analysis revealed substantial cross-reactivity of both models against other modified bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-E</xref>). Indeed, the pseU model strongly cross-reacted with m<sup>1</sup>Ψ modifications (AUC = 0.925, PR-AUC = 0.853), with near-identical AUC values to those obtained against the primary target, pseudouridine (AUC = 0.937, PR-AUC = 0.825), suggesting that this model cannot distinguish the two modification types. Of note, for most <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses, this should still be tolerable, as <italic>N</italic><sup>1</sup>-methylpseudouridine is a lowly abundant RNA modification occurring on few RNA biotypes, such as archaeal transfer RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Additionally, this cross-reactivity could be exploited for examining the quality of mRNA vaccine candidates, which are largely generated using m<sup>1</sup>Ψ modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), without the need of m<sup>1</sup>Ψ-specific models. By contrast, m<sup>5</sup>U cross-reacted to a lesser extent, yet still significantly better than random (AUC = 0.718, PR-AUC = 0.629). Similar results were observed when examining the cross-reactivity of the m5C model towards its hydroxylated version hm<sup>5</sup>C (AUC = 0.766, PR-AUC = 0.672) and ac<sup>4</sup>C (AUC = 0.718, PR-AUC = 0.629) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D,E</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). We should note that in the case of m<sup>5</sup>C and hm<sup>5</sup>C, this cross-reactivity could potentially lead to misinterpretations on <italic>in vivo</italic> data, where the two modifications are known to carry out different functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Notably, these results also suggest that the cross-reactivity of the base-calling models also significantly varied depending on the k-mer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>K-mer specific biases of modification-aware basecalling models</title><p id="P11">Current ONT basecalling models have been trained with synthetic oligonucleotides in which the modified base is surrounded by a degenerate sequence, with the exception of the m6A_DRACH model. For this reason, they should in principle detect RNA modifications in all sequence contexts. However, previous works have shown that the alteration of the current signal relative to the unmodified counterpart varies depending on the sequence context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), suggesting that modifications embedded in certain k-mer contexts might be better predicted than others. To systematically examine the potential k-mer preference for detecting RNA modifications, we calculated the median modification probability for each 5-mer containing a single central modified base (n = 81), finding that certain kmers were likely underrepresented, reflected by lower median modification probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Next, we performed motif enrichment analysis on those 5-mers whose modification probabilities were lower than 0.75 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>), revealing that certain sequence contexts are indeed especially problematic for the detection of modifications. Notably, these contexts varied depending on the model; for example, A/U-rich contexts were troublesome for the m5C model, whereas GC-rich contexts showed decreased modification probabilities for detecting Ψ modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Modification stoichiometry is underestimated by modification-aware basecalling models</title><p id="P12">Next, we examined the ability of modification-aware basecalling models to make correct predictions in terms of the relative amount of molecules that are modified at a given position, also referred to as percent modified or modification stoichiometry. To examine the accuracy of the models at predicting modification stoichiometry, we built ‘curlcake’ constructs that contained different proportions of modified NTPs (0, 12.5, 25, 50, 75 and 100%), and used the ONT <italic>modkit</italic> tool with default parameters to extract per-site modification levels (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). The results revealed that all models systematically underestimated the stoichiometries present in the sample, with models predicting a median modification stoichiometry of 72.2-87.2% for samples that were 100% modified, and with high variance in modification stoichiometry across k-mers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). We should note that the observed stoichiometry values will vary depending on whether the future user is only interested in a subset of k-mer sequence contexts.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Benchmarking of modification-aware basecalling models on <italic>in vivo</italic> total RNA samples</title><p id="P13">We then evaluated the performance of the models on rRNA sequences from <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> for which accurate maps of rRNA modifications exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Importantly, they contain a large number of Ψ modifications as well as several m<sup>5</sup>C modifications. For each species, total RNA was extracted and <italic>in vitro</italic> polyadenylated, prepared with standard DRS library preparation, and basecalled using either the pseU or m5C model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We first examined the replicability of the modification stoichiometry of predicted modified sites, finding that the estimates of modification stoichiometry were highly replicable across biological replicates in both species (R<sup>2</sup>=0.976-0.993) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). However, we should note that a significant proportion of modified sites identified were lowly modified (&lt;25%) albeit most sites are expected to be fully modified, based on previously published LC-MS/MS experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We then examined whether the sites predicted by the pseU and m5C models overlapped with annotated Ψ and m<sup>5</sup>C sites, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C,D</xref>). Indeed, we observed that a significant proportion of predicted Ψ sites (31% in yeast and 21% in <italic>E. coli</italic>) overlapped with annotated Ψ sites; however, several sites containing other modification types (e.g. Um and m<sup>5</sup>U) were also captured by the pseU model and thus were mispredicted as Ψ-modified sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) in addition to a significant proportion of unmodified sites (66% in yeast and 74% in <italic>E. coli</italic>). Similarly, the m5C model captured the two annotated m<sup>5</sup>C modified sites in yeast, and two out of three in <italic>E. coli</italic>, but also a vast proportion of false positives, which included both Cm-modified and unmodified sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). We should note, however, that most of the high-modification stoichiometry sites corresponded to true positives, and these were top-ranked in terms of modification stoichiometry, leading to very high AUC-ROC values (AUC-ROC:0.920-0.999), but more modest AUC-PR values (AUC-PR:0.21-0.90) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Altogether, our results show that <italic>in vivo</italic>, modification-aware basecalling models are able to capture highly modified Ψ and m5C-modified sites, but at the expense of a substantial amount of false positives, including other modification types for which the models cross-react with (e.g., Um, m<sup>5</sup>U, Cm) as well as unmodified sites that are mispredicted as modified, suggesting that there is a strong need for external fully-unmodified controls to remove false positive predictions when using modification-aware base-calling models.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Removal of false positives using modification-free synthetic matched controls</title><p id="P16">Previous works have proposed the use of modification-free control datasets to remove false positive predictions in epitranscriptomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). We therefore imagined that using such constructs would remove mispredicted sites reported by modification-aware basecalling models. To this end, we generated modification-free rRNA molecules from <italic>E. coli, M. musculus</italic>, and <italic>H. sapiens</italic> using <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of cDNA products (IVT), previously amplified to incorporate a T7 promoter. Samples were then basecalled using either the pseU or m5C model to perform pairwise comparisons of the predicted per-site modification frequencies of the unmodified control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Our results revealed that a significant proportion of RNA modifications predicted in WT were also predicted in the IVT sequences, suggesting that IVT controls can be useful for the removal of false positive predictions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S5 and S6</xref>). Notably, replicability of the predictions in the IVT sequences was very high (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.88-0.99), suggesting that these false predictions are not random but rather systematic, and possibly related to the sequence context itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A-B</xref>).</p><p id="P17">We then specifically assessed whether the use of IVT controls would eliminate all false positives identified in WT sequences. To this end, we compared the predicted stoichiometry of WT and IVT samples basecalled with either the m5C or pseU models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S5</xref> and <bold>S6</bold>). We found that, while most of the false positive (FP) sites were predicted in both samples – i.e., those found in the diagonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>)–, several FP sites were only detected in the WT sample. Upon closer examination, we observed that some of these FP sites exclusively found in WT samples corresponded to cross-reactivities against modifications affecting the same nucleotide (e.g., m<sup>3</sup>Y in the case of pseU model) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B-C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>), in agreement with our previous observations using synthetic RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). However, we also found that many FP sites corresponded to unmodified residues that had an RNA modification neighboring them (e.g. C<sub>m</sub> or m<sup>6</sup> <sub>2</sub>A in the case of the m5C model) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B-C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). This suggests that IVT controls are essential, yet insufficient, to remove FP predictions from basecalling models. Notably, in the case of <italic>H. sapiens</italic> we observed a higher median modification stoichiometry for sites with neighboring modifications than those having a different modified nucleotide from the target one, suggesting that neighboring modifications, even when found at different bases, can be a major confounder when using modification-aware basecallers, causing the neighbouring unmodified base to be predicted as modified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Finally, we quantitatively examined how many false positives would be identified in rRNAs after applying a double threshold, requiring a minimum modification frequency on the WT samples (&gt;10%) as well as maximum modification frequency on the IVT samples (&lt;5%).

Altogether, our work shows that the use of IVT samples allows significant removal of false positives; however, it also identifies a previously disregarded source of false positives that can neither be eliminated by the inclusion of additional modifications in the model, nor by the use of IVT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Identification of modifications in the absence of modification-aware basecalling models</title><p id="P19">While modification-aware basecalling models open the possibility to identify modifications in individual molecules, this approach is only applicable to a handful of RNA modifications for which a model is currently available.

Therefore, we first examined whether the different canonical models released for dorado (<italic>fast, hac</italic> and <italic>sup</italic>) would capture different RNA modification types, using synthetic ‘curlcakes’ sequenced with RNA004 chemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S7</xref>).

By contrast, ac<sup>4</sup>C, m<sup>1</sup>Ψ and m<sup>5</sup>U modifications produced high basecalling ‘errors’ compared to their unmodified counterparts (ΔSumErr), confirming that base-calling ‘errors’ can be used to detect RNA modifications for which no modification-aware basecalling model exists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Next, we examined whether the ‘error’ pattern would be centered in the modified site, or in a neighbouring position.

Our results demonstrate that base-calling models capture most annotated modified sites; however, they mispredict a significant number of sites as modified, leading to an overall high proportion of false positives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). While we demonstrate that IVT controls can significantly reduce the number of false positives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), we show that a large proportion of incorrectly predicted sites still remain after a double filtering step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). These potential mispredictions could lead to incorrect conclusions when interpreting the biological results, and could further increase controversies in the RNA modifications field, specially in scenarios in which the existence of RNA modifications in certain RNA biotypes has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Therefore, caution must be taken when interpreting the results to acquire novel biological insights of previously uncharacterized RNA species.</p><p id="P25">There is a growing consensus about the need to incorporate modification-free transcriptome-wide in vitro controls (IVT) as negative controls to improve the accuracy of RNA modification predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>).

Incorporating such controls will likely become routine practice in most laboratories doing RNA modification analyses. We should note however, that in our work we identify three main sources of false positives by modification-aware basecalling models, some of which cannot be removed using IVT controls: i) those inherent to the k-mer context, which can largely be removed using IVT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>); ii) those caused by cross-reactivity with other RNA modification types that exist at the same reference base, which cannot be removed with IVT controls –but could be potentially removed in the future once modification-aware basecalling models for additional modifications become available– (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B-C</xref>); and iii) those caused by cross-reactivity with other RNA modification types present at neighbouring positions, causing misprediction of a modified residue at an unmodified site (e.g., m<sup>6,6</sup>A neighboring an unmodified C, leading to m<sup>5</sup>C misprediction by the m5C model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Notably, this latter type of false positives will remain even if modification-aware models incorporate additional modifications. This can significantly limit the applicability of modification-aware base-calling models in highly modified RNA biotypes, such as tRNA, rRNA or synthetic RNA constructs.</p><p id="P26">A key strength of the RNA004 chemistry, in addition to the availability of ONT-supported RNA modification-aware base-calling models, is a major increase in sequencing yield, compared to the previous RNA002 chemistry. Consequently, there is a pressing need to multiplex DRS runs. While ONT recently announced the availability of DRS multiplexing kits in the near future, to date this is not yet available, and the number of barcodes to be released remains unclear. Here, we provide a pre-trained 96-barcode demultiplexing model compatible with the latest RNA004 chemistry, enabling high-multiplexing of DRS RNA004 sequencing runs. The possibility to multiplex up to 96 barcodes in a single sequencing flowcell does not only improve the cost-effectiveness of DRS sequencing, but also significantly reduces batch effects across flowcells and samples, as these are otherwise sequenced and prepared independently. Moreover, the possibility of multiplexing enhances the incorporation of control samples by future users, such as IVT conditions, ensuring that future works using modification-aware basecalling models can also reduce false positives in their future experiments.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title><italic>E. coli</italic> culturing and total RNA extraction</title><p id="P27"><italic>E. coli</italic> strains used in this work were obtained from the Keio Knockout Collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>), including the reference wild type strain (BW25113) (Cultek).
