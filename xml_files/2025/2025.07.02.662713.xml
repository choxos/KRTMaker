While DNA ADP-ribosyltransferase (DarT2) toxin mono-ADP-ribosylates a single-stranded DNA sequence motif and potentially induces bacterial dormancy, its cognate DNA ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase (DarG) antitoxin reverses the modification and restores bacterial growth. Therefore, developing DarG selective inhibitors may represent a promising and novel strategy to combat drug-resistant tuberculosis. However, no small molecule inhibitors targeting DarG have been identified to date and establishing a high-throughput screening assay based on its DNA ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity would be challenging. Here, we developed and optimized a simple and robust fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based high-throughput screening assay to identify small molecule inhibitors targeting DarG macrodomain in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. We generated a FRET pair of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> DarG macrodomain and poly-ADP-ribosylated peptide fused with compatible fluorophores. Screening the target-focused phenotypic library using this method led to the identification of pranlukast, which selectively inhibited the DNA ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity of DarG in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and its orthologues without affecting human mono-ADP-ribosyl binders and erasers. Since pranlukast has previously been reported to reduce <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> burden, further investigation into its action mechanism in this context would be valuable.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ADP-ribosylation</kwd><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis;</italic> Macrodomain</kwd><kwd>DarG inhibitor</kwd><kwd>FRET</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">ADP-ribosylation is a reversible modification in which ADP-ribosyltransferases transfer an ADP-ribose unit from β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (β-NAD<sup>+</sup>) to target molecules that can be proteins, nucleic acids or antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Typically, the modification is mono-ADP-ribosylation (MAR), but in case of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP1, PARP2) that detect DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] and in case of tankyrases (TNKS1, TNKS2) that control stability of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], the modification can be extended to branched or linear poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) chains, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, PAR chains vary in length and can extend up to 200 ADP-ribose units interconnected by glycosidic bonds, with branching observed approximately every 20 to 50 residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. PAR chains are reported to exhibit a helical secondary structure, showing structural similarities to RNA and DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. This is evidenced by the cross-reactivity of antibodies raised against PAR with both RNA and DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. ADP-ribosylation plays important roles in many cellular processes, such as DNA damage repair, stress and immune response, chromatin and transcriptional regulation, protein biosynthesis, and cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Proteins that contain a macrodomain, an evolutionarily conserved protein fold, can bind to or act as ADP-ribosyl hydrolases to degrade this modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Macrodomains are widely identified in all kingdoms of life from virus to human and implied to be involved in a variety of pathogenesis of human diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and bacterial-, viral-mediated infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p><p id="P3">ADP-ribosylation can be also utilized by toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems which contribute to the pathogenesis of many infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Recently, the ADP-ribosylation-dependent DarTG2 TA system, identified in various bacteria including the global pathogen <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, has gained attention due to its significant role in regulating cell growth and inducing bacterial persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Moreover, this TA system represents the first known example of reversible DNA modification mediated by ADP-ribosylation. In detail, the toxin DNA ADP-ribosyltransferase (DarT2) modifies thymidine bases in a single-stranded chromosomal bacterial DNA. The sequence motif targeted by DarT2 can diverge depending on the species, DarT2 from thermophilic bacterium <italic>Thermus aquaticus</italic> targets TNTC motif while <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> orthologue prefers TTTT and TTTA motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. As a result, the modification blocks DNA replication, slowing growth of the bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. The antitoxin DNA ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase (DarG) is a homolog of human terminal ADP-ribose glycohydrolase 1 (TARG1) and possesses a conserved N-terminal macrodomain that specifically removes ADP-ribosyl groups from DarT2-modified DNA, thereby preventing excessive toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Further investigation showed that partial depletion of DarG triggers a DNA-damage response and sensitizes <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to drugs targeting DNA metabolism and respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. This function makes DarG a crucial component and a potential drug target for tuberculosis and other diseases caused by pathogens that express DarTG2 TA system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p><p id="P4">The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has posed a serious challenge to tuberculosis control efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. The high rates of antibiotic resistance highlight the urgent need for alternative treatment strategies. Since the DarTG2 system causes bacteriostatic effects, this TA module is recognized as an alternative potential drug target for antibiotic-resistant <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. The potential of targeting ADP-ribosylation as a therapeutic intervention has remained largely unexplored, primarily due to the limited understanding of reversible ADP-ribosylation and its functions in bacterial signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Development of small molecule inhibitors targeting this TA system could provide powerful tools, chemical probes, to gain a better understanding of the DarTG2 system and potentially provide a new avenue for tuberculosis treatment.</p><p id="P5">Here, we describe the development of an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to screen inhibitors for DarG macrodomain in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD). The method uses fluorescent fusion proteins expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, resulting in a robust and fast high-throughput assay. The assay measures ratiometric FRET (rFRET) signals upon the binding of mCerulean (CFP) fused <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD to the PARylated mCitrine (YFP)-GAP where GAP-tag refers to a C-terminal peptide of a Gαi protein. The assay was validated for high-throughput screening (HTS) in 384-well plate format and tested by screening a target-focused phenotypic library, allowing us to identify pranlukast as the first small molecule inhibitor targeting <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD. Pranlukast had an IC<sub>50</sub> of 4 µM and was selective for <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD over a wide panel of human macrodomains. Moreover, pranlukast inhibited the enzymatic activity of <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG and its bacterial orthologues including DarG in <italic>Thermus aquaticus</italic> and SCO6735 in <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic>, suggesting the broad-spectrum inhibition of pranlukast against thymidine-linked DNA ADP-ribosylhydrolases.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Set up a FRET assay</title><p id="P6">We previously showed that TARG1, which is structurally similar to DarG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], showed a high rFRET signal for the interaction in the FRET pair of CFP-TARG1 and MARylated YFP-GAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD might similarly bind to a MARylated peptide as TARG1 does and tested the applicability of FRET-based assay using CFP-<italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD and MARylated YFP-GAP. However, no FRET signal indicative of the binding was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Moreover, nanoDSF analysis showed that free ADP-ribose did not stabilize the <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). These findings suggest that <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD requires the DNA attached to the ADP-ribose for efficient binding. The DNA modified by DarT would, however, be hydrolyzed by <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD and therefore a mix-and-measure type of high-throughput assay would require more complicated procedures and preparation of specific MARylated and tagged DNA oligonucleotides.</p><p id="P7">Given that <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG binds to MARylated DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] and PAR chains can mimic the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], we hypothesized that PAR chains might facilitate binding of <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG. Indeed, the FRET-based assay using CFP-<italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD and PARylated YFP-GAP yielded a detectable rFRET signal, indicating the energy transfer from CFP to YFP. We described here in detail the principle of FRET-based assay for CFP-<italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD and PARylated YFP-GAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The construct of <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD was recombinantly expressed as a fusion protein with fluorophore mCerulean CFP. The fluorophore mCitrine YFP was fused with a C-terminal Gαi-based 10-mer peptide (GAP-tag), which was subsequently MARylated at cysteine residue by pertussis toxin subunit S1 (PtxS1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. To extend the PAR chain from the MARylated YFP-GAP, we utilized PARP2, resulting in the formation of the branched PAR chain. Upon excitation of the reaction mixture containing the FRET pair at 410 nm, the rFRET signal was calculated as the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the YFP emission at 527 nm to the fluorescence intensity of the CFP emission at 477 nm. Binding interactions between the <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG and PAR chain led to a decrease in CFP emission and an increase in YFP emission, thereby enhancing the rFRET signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Guanidine HCl (GdnHCl) used as a negative control unfolds proteins and disrupts the binding interaction, but at the used 0.6 M concentration it does not interfere with the fluorescence of CFP and YFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Signal verification for <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD and PAR binding</title><p id="P8">To confirm the specific interaction between CFP-<italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD and PARylated YFP-GAP, we investigated whether the removal of the <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG macrodomain and the PARylated GAP from the fluorophores would result in the loss of the FRET signal. Since the expression constructs were designed with a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site between the <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG macrodomain or PARylated-GAP and the fluorophores, the FRET reaction mixture was treated with 100 nM TEV protease to cleave away CFP and YFP tags. The results demonstrated that the presence of 100 nM TEV led to the decrease of the rFRET signal, which gradually dropped to the basal level after approximately 17 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Additionally, we assessed the effect of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), known for its hydrolysis activity against PAR chains but not MARylated substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], on the interaction between <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD and PAR. At a tested concentration of 0.5 nM, PARG effectively hydrolyzed PAR chains and rapidly reduced the rFRET signal to the basal level within around 8 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). These findings implicate a specific interaction between <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD and the PAR chain, and that the MARylated GAP-tag does not bind to <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG consistent with our earlier result.</p><p id="P9">However, we noticed that the rFRET signals of samples without TEV protease or PARG treatment were unstable and slightly decreased over the testing time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>). This instability might be due to the protein aggregation or unstable complex formation in tested buffer consisting of 10 mM BTP pH 7.0, 25 mM NaCl, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 mM TCEP. Therefore, we next optimized the buffer condition to gain stable signals before proceeding with further experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2-S4</xref>). The optimum pH for the signal was slightly acidic at 6.0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>) and was sensitive to increased salt concentration at the low protein concentrations of 500 nM PARylated YFP-GAP and 100 nM CFP-<italic>Mtb</italic>DarG used in the assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). We also observed that in the presence of 5-10% (v/v) glycerol, the signals were significantly more stable over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>) and subsequently selected the final buffer conditions as 10 mM MES, pH 6.0, 25 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.5 mM TCEP. This buffer, referred to as FRET assay buffer, was utilized for all subsequent experiments.</p><p id="P10">To further confirm specific interaction between <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD and PAR chain, we conducted a competition assay using unlabeled <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD and PARylated PARP2. The results showed that the addition of unlabeled proteins led to a concentration-dependent reduction in the rFRET signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C-D</xref>). As both unlabeled <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD and additional PAR effectively dropped the rFRET signal, the measured FRET signal is due to a specific binding interaction and not just non-specific aggregation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Dissociation constant of <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG macrodomain and PAR chain interaction</title><p id="P11">To determine the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of the interaction between <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD and PAR chain, we employed the FRET method as described by Song et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. The FRET emission (EmFRET) was assessed by mixing a constant concentration of CFP-<italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD (30 nM) with increasing concentrations of PARylated YFP-GAP (0-1.5 µM) to achieve saturation of the CFP with YFP signal. The saturation curve was plotted with EmFRET against the concentration of PARylated YFP-GAP. Since the binding stoichiometry is unknown, the data were fitted using a 1:1 binding model. The resulting saturation curve showed that the apparent binding affinity of <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD and PAR was 316 ± 34.7 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Optimization of the assay conditions and signal validation</title><p id="P12">Next, we optimized protein concentrations for the HTS assay. It was observed that high salt conditions disrupted the binding interaction between CFP-<italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD and PARylated YFP-GAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). The buffer containing 1 M NaCl can be used as negative control instead of 0.6 M GdnHCl. We tested different concentration ratios of CFP-<italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD to PARylated YFP-GAP and found that a ratio of 1:10 produced consistent signals with higher signal-to-noise ratios compared to a ratio of 1:20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). For the HTS assay, we selected conditions with 30 nM CFP-<italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD and 300 nM PARylated YFP-GAP to minimize protein consumption, making it suitable for large-scale screening campaigns.</p><p id="P13">After establishing the optimal conditions for the assays, we evaluated the assay quality to ensure its robustness for HTS. The validation process involved assessing the reproducibility of rFRET signals across multiple plates and different days. We used 384-well plates, with each plate containing 176 replicates of the negative control (FRET pair in the presence of 1 M NaCl) and 176 replicates of the positive control (FRET pair only) and measured the rFRET signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Statistical parameters demonstrating the assay quality for HTS are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>. The Z'-factors, which measure the separation between the negative and positive control signals, were calculated for five different plates and found to be between 0.67 and 0.75. The Z’-factor above 0.5 indicates that the FRET signal shows sufficient separation between negative and positive control and the assay is considered excellent for HTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Our results confirm that the FRET assay is robust, reproducible, and suitable for reliable HTS.</p><p id="P14">Small molecule compounds in screening libraries are typically dissolved in DMSO, which can potentially impact assay performance. To ensure the robustness of our assay, we evaluated the effect of DMSO, up to 2.5%, on the rFRET signal. The results demonstrated that the assay performed well in the presence of DMSO at least up to 2.5% (v/v), indicating that the assay is robust and suitable for compound screening under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Validatory screening</title><p id="P15">To validate the assay for inhibitor screening, we applied this FRET-based assay to screen the target-focused phenotypic screening library to identify the inhibitors for <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD and PAR interaction. This library consists of 1832 bioactive compounds with established mechanisms covering more than 600 drug targets. Therefore, the potential hit compounds could be suitable to be tested in the <italic>in vivo</italic> system directly to validate the targeting of <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG. Compounds were screened at a single concentration of 20 µM, and reaction volume was 10 μL. At this concentration, the assay contained 0.02% (v/v) DMSO which was shown to have no effect on the assay performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P16">For the screening, we implemented several approaches to exclude compounds that non-specifically inhibit the FRET interaction or exhibit intrinsic fluorescence at the wavelengths measured. Intrinsic fluorescence of certain compounds can interfere with the ratiometric signal, leading to false positives or inaccurate readings. The exclusion process is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>. Firstly, compounds were excluded if their raw fluorescence values were 120% higher than that of the positive control at the 527 nm readout or 80% lower than that of the positive control at the 477 nm readout. These thresholds were chosen to identify and remove compounds that exhibited excessive intrinsic fluorescence, which could interfere with accurate FRET signal measurements. This initial filter successfully excluded 154 compounds (8.4%). Secondly, we applied an additional excitation wavelength of 430 nm for FRET measurement to further identify compounds with significant fluorescence interference. Compounds with such interference typically exhibit stronger excitation at either 410 nm or 430 nm, resulting in discrepancies in the rFRET signals between these two excitation wavelengths. Compounds showing more than a 30% difference in apparent inhibition between the 410 nm and 430 nm readouts were excluded, eliminating an additional 59 compounds (3.2%).</p><p id="P17">After passing through several filters, compounds with inhibition higher than 36.4% (Three standard deviations above the mean value) were considered hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). In the primary screening, we identified 17 compounds as initial hits for <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD, corresponding to a hit rate of 0.93%. Since the screening was conducted in singlet, we re-tested these hits at 20 μM of compound concentration using the FRET assay to confirm their inhibitory activity. Upon re-testing, all compounds showed the inhibition activity against the <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD-PAR interaction, confirming their status as hits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Hit validation</title><p id="P18">To rule out the possibility that the observed rFRET signal disruption is due to protein destabilization, we conducted nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) analysis for identified hit compounds. Our results demonstrated that four compounds, including pranlukast, GW501516, tiplaxtinin, and BMS303141, caused right shifts in the melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) of the <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD, with increases of 1.18 ± 0.05 °C, 1.52 ± 0.08 °C, 1.31 ± 0.06 °C, and 1.21 ± 0.10 °C, respectively. These shifts suggest a high likelihood that compounds directly bind to and stabilize <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-B</xref>). While pranlukast and tiplaxtinin demonstrated the most potential inhibitory activity, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of 4 µM (pIC<sub>50</sub> ± SEM: -5.40 ± 0.02) and 5.7 µM (pIC<sub>50</sub> ± SEM: -5.24 ± 0.03), respectively, the IC<sub>50</sub> values for GW501516 and BMS303141 were 56.5 µM (pIC<sub>50</sub> ± SEM: -4.25 ± 0.01) and 18.7 µM (pIC<sub>50</sub> ± SEM: -4.73 ± 0.03), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C-F</xref>). However, the IC<sub>50</sub> curves exhibited considerable steepness, which may indicate a promiscuous aggregator effect of these compounds or suggest that compounds may interact with multiple distinct sites on the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Because 0.01% Triton X-100 was included in buffer condition to mitigate nonspecific inhibitory effects from compound aggregation, the observed inhibitory activity is less likely due to aggregate formation. In addition, dynamic light scattering data from nanoDSF showed that the presence of the compounds did not increase light scattering relative to the protein-only control, suggesting the absence of detectable aggregates under the tested buffer condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). Nevertheless, nonspecific inhibition by aggregators is a common artifact in HTS and it is important to carefully further validate specificity of these hits before drawing conclusions about their activities.</p><p id="P19">To eliminate the possibility of nonspecific inhibition, we assessed the potential of the compounds to interfere with the binding interactions of various macrodomains. Four compounds were tested at a single concentration of 20 μM using the FRET-based assay, as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. The results indicated that tiplaxtinin and BMS303141 interfered with the binding activity of several macrodomains, including PARP9 MD1, PARP14 MD1, PARP14 MD3, and PARP15 MD2. In contrast, pranlukast and GW501516 had very low or no effect on the binding interactions of other macrodomains, demonstrating their high selectivity against <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG without broadly affecting other macrodomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Next, we tested a wider panel of human ADP-ribosyl binders/hydrolases with the most potent inhibitor, pranlukast, to evaluate its potential as an antibacterial agent. Notably, pranlukast remained selective for <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG over a profiling panel including its structurally similar paralog TARG1 even at a high tested concentration of 100 µM. Only weak inhibition was observed for PARP9 MD1, PARP14 MD1 and PARP15 MD1 with IC<sub>50</sub> values of approximately 100 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>).

Notably, pranlukast inhibited the enzymatic activity of <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG on this ADP-ribosylated ssDNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). In addition, pranlukast exhibited an even higher inhibitory potency against DarG from <italic>Thermus aquaticus</italic> bacterium (<italic>T.aq</italic>. DarG) and SCO6735. SCO6735 is a DNA damage-inducible macrodomain protein from <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> bacteria, related to DarG and TARG1, that also has the ability to hydrolase ADP-ribosylation from thymine bases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>].

A major challenge in treating tuberculosis is drug resistance, which is largely due to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>’s ability to replicate slowly and enter a dormant state. Therefore, understanding and targeting the mechanisms that regulate bacterial replication may provide novel therapeutic strategies. One such mechanism is the DarTG2 TA system, which has emerged as a regulatory checkpoint for controlling bacterial DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] and disrupting this TA system by small molecule inhibitors may sensitize <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to antibiotic treatments. Specifically, the DarG is an essential gene in the context of active DarT toxin protein so targeting the antitoxin component DarG using small molecule inhibitors may represent a promising strategy to kill <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p><p id="P22">While HTS assays have been developed to identify inhibitors of various macrodomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>], the specific function of DarG to target MARylated ssDNA, but not MARylated proteins, presents a unique challenge in design of effective screening assays. Here, we developed a FRET-based assay consisting of a FRET pair of CFP-<italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD and PARylated YFP-GAP to identify small molecule inhibitors targeting <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG MD. This “mix-and-measure” format eliminates the need for separation steps or specialized reagents and is readily scalable to a standard 384-well plate format, making it suitable for HTS applications. The assay was validated through Z’-factor analysis, demonstrating its robustness and reproducibility. Although it was developed specifically for <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG, the assay can potentially be adapted to screen inhibitors of other DNA-linked ADP-ribosyl binding proteins.</p><p id="P23">However, the assay has certain limitations. The PARylated substrate used does not accurately reflect the physiologically relevant MARylated ssDNA that DarG interacts with <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additionally, the molecular basis of the interaction between <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG and PAR remains unclear. We hypothesize that <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG possibly binds to PAR chains through the terminal ADP-ribose unit. Electrostatic interactions may also play a role, because the negatively charged diphosphate of PAR could mimic the charge distribution of DNA. We used PARP2 to extend the branched PAR chains, and the effect of linear PAR chains on binding was not evaluated.</p><p id="P24">Through a validatory screening campaign, the most potent compound identified to inhibit <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG was pranlukast, a selective leukotriene LTC4/D4/E4 receptor antagonist that is FDA-approved for the treatment of bronchial asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Notably, pranlukast has previously been reported to act as a novel allosteric inhibitor of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> ornithine acetyltransferase, an enzyme involved in arginine biosynthesis, with a dissociation constant of 139 µM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>].

Notably, its potency against <italic>Mtb</italic>DarG in both the FRET-based binding assay and the hydrolysis assay was higher than that observed for ornithine acetyltransferase.
