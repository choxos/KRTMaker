Through systematic screening of understudied ubiquitin-like modifiers (UBLs), we identify UFM1 as a previously unrecognised regulator of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Using a structure-guided chemical biology strategy, we develop a photo-crosslinkable UFM1 probe and, together with high-resolution NMR, uncover non-canonical UFM1-binding regions in core NHEJ components, including XRCC4. Mechanistically, proximity-dependent proteomics reveals Ku70 as a key UFMylation substrate, establishing a functional axis in which XRCC4 engages UFMylated Ku70 to promote the chromatin assembly of NHEJ factors. Perturbation of UFM1 signalling, via UFSP2 depletion or a hypomorphic UBA5 allele in patient-derived fibroblasts, impairs these processes, linking UFMylation defects to altered regulation of DSB repair. Our findings define a complete UFM1 signalling module in genome maintenance and uncover a molecular connection between hereditary UFMylation disorders and dysregulated DSB repair pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>UFM1</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin-like protein (UBL)</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)</kwd><kwd>genetic code expansion</kwd><kwd>photo-crosslinking</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Maintenance of genome stability is key to cellular survival and human health, yet our DNA is under constant assault from both endogenous and exogenous sources. To deal with these attacks, cells have evolved a complex and highly coordinated network of pathways known as the DNA damage response (DDR). The DDR detects, signals, and repairs DNA lesions while modulating cell cycle progression to allow time for repair or, when necessary, triggering apoptosis. Deficiencies in these repair mechanisms are linked to a wide array of human diseases, including cancer, immunodeficiency syndromes, neurodegenerative conditions, and premature ageing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are amongst the most cytotoxic lesions and are primarily repaired by two major pathways: homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). HR is a highly accurate repair process that uses the sister chromatid as a template, restricting it to the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. By contrast, NHEJ can function throughout interphase but can be mutagenic. Despite that, it is the predominant DSB repair pathway in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. NHEJ is initiated by the binding of the Ku70:Ku80 heterodimer to DNA ends, followed by recruitment of the core NHEJ kinase DNA-PKcs to form the DNA-PK holoenzyme. This complex then facilitates chromatin recruitment of a series of NHEJ factors, including XRCC4, XLF (also known as NHEJ1), PAXX, and DNA ligase IV (LIG4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The functions of many DDR proteins, including those involved in DSB repair, are tightly regulated by posttranslational modifications (PTMs), particularly ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs). While ubiquitin, SUMO, and NEDD8 have well-established roles in DNA damage responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, most other UBLs encoded in the human genome remain understudied. This knowledge gap limits our broader understanding of how UBL-mediated signalling networks regulate genome stability and cellular stress responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. UBLs, like ubiquitin, are typically conjugated to substrate proteins via a conserved enzymatic cascade involving an E1 activating, an E2 conjugating, and an E3 ligating enzyme, with the modifications influencing the functionality of their targets in different ways, often mediated through selective binding by downstream reader or receptor proteins. As such, UBL receptors play a central role in translating upstream UBLylation events into specific biochemical outcomes. To fully delineate the regulatory potential of these modifications in the DDR, it is essential to define both the upstream UBL-conjugated substrates and their corresponding receptor proteins. However, these interactions are often transient and weak, presenting significant challenges for conventional biochemical identification methods. This bottleneck has limited their discovery and characterisation to often less than a handful known UBL substrate-receptor axes.</p><p id="P5">Here, we employ a two-pronged functional screening strategy to systematically interrogate the contribution of 10 understudied UBLs to DSB repair. This approach reveals diverse and pathway-specific roles for multiple UBLs across different branches of the DDR. Amongst these, UFM1 emerged as the most prominent hit across several independent DDR readouts. As the most recently identified UBL, UFM1 is garnering increasing attention for its roles beyond its canonical functions at the endoplasmic reticulum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. To address the challenge of defining UFM1 substrate-receptor relationships, we develop a fully functional, photo-crosslinkable UFM1 probe for receptor screening. The approach identifies a broad spectrum of UFM1-interacting proteins, spanning biological processes known to be regulated by UFM1 as well as unknown associations. Notably, several core NHEJ components ranked prominently amongst the candidates. Through site-directed mutagenesis, crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), biochemical assays, and high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we validate and characterise non-canonical UFM1-binding regions on several NHEJ proteins, including XRCC4. To identify upstream UFMylated targets of these receptors, we performed proximity labelling of the UFM1 E2 enzyme UFC1 in cells, pinpointing the DNA-PK complex as a UFMylation substrate, amongst a wide range of candidate targets, with implications in DDR settings as well as broader cellular contexts. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that UFMylation is critical for facilitating the recruitment of key NHEJ components to damaged chromatin and that – within this context – XRCC4 functions as a receptor for Ku70 UFMylated at K526, defining a novel functional UFM1-Ku-XRCC4 axis in genome stability maintenance. Beyond providing structural, mechanistic and functional insights into DSB repair pathways, our findings establish a link between impaired NHEJ and UFMylation deficiency in patients, highlighting shared developmental phenotypes such as microcephaly, observed in UFMylation disorders as well as classical NHEJ syndromes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Systematic UBL screening reveals UFM1 functions in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)</title><p id="P6">To systematically assess the roles of understudied UBLs in DSB repair, we performed loss-of-function screening in U2OS cells using siRNA pools targeting 10 UBLs with limited involvement in the DDR. These included ATG12, FAT10, FUBI, ISG15, UBL3, UBL4A, UBL4B, UBL5, UFM1, and URM1. The screen was carried out using a two-pronged approach. Module 1 employed the traffic-light reporter (TLR) system to quantify HR and mutagenic end-joining (mutEJ) efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), while Module 2 measured the formation of ionising radiation-induced foci (IRIF) of γH2AX, 53BP1 whose recruitment requires ubiquitin, and conjugated ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Depletion of several UBLs, including FUBI, UBL5, ATG12, UFM1, and ISG15 resulted in reduced efficiency of both HR and mutEJ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Others, such as UBL4B, UBL3, URM1, and UBL4A, predominantly impaired HR, suggesting more pathway-specific contributions to DSB repair. Follow-up analyses indicated that the effects observed for FUBI were likely attributable to off-target activity, potentially due to sequence overlap between one of the siRNAs and UBE2I (also known as UBC9), the E2 conjugating enzyme for SUMO. Given SUMO’s well-established roles in DSB repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, FUBI was therefore excluded from further analysis. Strikingly, depletion of several UBLs with distinct DSB repair efficiency profiles, namely UFM1, ISG15, URM1, and UBL4A, also disrupted ubiquitin conjugation and/or 53BP1 IRIF formation at DNA damage sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Amongst these UBLs, UBL5, which scored highest in the TLR screen for promoting HR, is known to support the Fanconi anaemia pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and maintains expression of the HR factor XRCC3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, providing orthogonal validation of our screening approach. UFM1 and ISG15, both of which compromised HR, mutEJ and IRIF formation upon depletion, have previously been implicated in DNA replication stress and DDR functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Furthermore, autophagy, for which ATG12 is crucial, can promote the DNA damage response in different genotoxic contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, and UBL4A has been reported to facilitate BRCA1 recruitment to DNA damage sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. However, these previously reported functions cannot explain the complex phenotypes we observed for multiple UBLs in different DSB repair processes. Together, the findings of our screen reveal a functionally diverse involvement of UBLs in DSB repair, uncovering both established and previously unrecognised roles in genome stability maintenance and opening new avenues for mechanistic investigation.</p><p id="P7">Amongst all UBLs, UFM1 scored as the strongest candidate across multiple screening readouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), indicating an important role in diverse DDR aspects. Like ubiquitin and other well-characterised UBLs, UFM1 is conjugated to substrates via an enzymatic cascade, consisting of a single member of an activating E1 enzyme (UBA5), a conjugating E2 enzyme (UFC1) and an E3 ligating complex (UFL1 in association with DDRGK1, also known as UFBP1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Previously reported roles in ATM signalling through UFMylation of MRE11 and histone H4,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> are consistent with the HR defects we observed in our TLR screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). However, these known roles do not explain the additional impacts we observed on end-joining repair and IRIF kinetics, the latter of which we validated using two independent UFM1 siRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-C</xref>). To further assess the importance of UFM1 in end-joining repair, we employed a complementary assay based on random plasmid integration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Using two independent siRNAs targeting UFM1, the E2 (UFC1), or the E3 (UFL1) enzyme, significantly impaired end-joining efficiency to levels comparable with depletion of XRCC4, a core NHEJ factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A-B</xref>). Consistent with this, loss of UFM1 pathway components hypersensitised cells to IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Collectively, these results highlight UFM1’s functional importance across a range of DDR readouts, including end-joining repair.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>A photo-crosslinkable probe for UFM1 receptor discovery</title><p id="P8">Given the important role of downstream UBL receptors in determining the outcomes of UBLylation events, we employed a bottom-up strategy to systematically identify UFM1 receptors. Our goal was to illuminate the mechanisms underpinning UFM1-dependent end-joining repair and to use receptor discovery as a springboard for defining upstream UFMylation axes. Recognising that UBL:receptor interactions are often transient and weak, we developed a photo-crosslinkable, non-conjugatable UFM1 probe lacking its C-terminal exposed glycine to stabilise these interactions through light-inducible covalent bonds. To facilitate stringent purification, the probe was equipped with a biotin handle conjugated to a cysteine added to UFM1’s C-terminus, enabling affinity-based enrichment and subsequent identification of covalently bound receptors via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In designing the probe, we leveraged structural insights into UFM1’s interaction with its E1 enzyme UBA5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, which is mediated through an α-β groove on UFM1, a known receptor interaction hotspot for paralogues of a related UBL, SUMO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. We reasoned that, analogous to SUMO, this surface may also mediate broader receptor interactions for UFM1.</p><p id="P9">We engineered three UFM1 probes by incorporating the photo-crosslinkable, unnatural amino acid 4-benzoyl-(L)-phenylalanine (BpF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> at residues K34, F35, and E39 – each located within crosslinking distance to UBA5 and predicted to not disrupt binding based on the reported UFM1:UBA5 interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>). Amongst these, a conjugatable version of the F35 probe best preserved wild-type activity in E2 charging assays <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>), possibly due to BpF more closely representing aspects of phenylalanine’s physicochemical features than those of lysine or glutamate.

Whether UFSP2 localisation at telomeres contributes to constraining aberrant NHEJ in this context presents an intriguing avenue for future investigation.</p><p id="P30">Beyond basic DNA repair biology, the dysregulation of UFMylation has been linked to cancer, acting both to suppress and drive carcinogenesis in different contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup>.

Images were captured with a 40 ×/1.4 oil objective and a Hamamatsu 2048 by 2048-pixel Orca fusion camera using cellSens software (Evident/Olympus) for image capturing. GFP fluorescence was excited with a 488 nm laser at 20% power, 1000 ms exposure. Throughout the experiment, the cells were maintained at 37 °C in HEPES-containing phenol red-free media (Gibco). Plasmids containing GFP-tagged XRCC4 (wildtype or Δ256-263) were transiently transfected in 35 mm imaging dishes with a coverslip thickness (1.5 H/170 µm) glass bottom that had been seeded with U2OS XRCC4 knock-out cells. Following transfection, cells were pre-sensitised in 10 μM BrdU for 24-48 h prior to laser micro-irradiation and imaging. Micro-irradiation was performed with a Rapp UGA-42 Caliburn laser ablation system. The 355 nm laser (with an output energy 200 µJ at 1.2 kHz and a pulse duration of 1.4 ns) was controlled by cellSens’ FRAP module in the software’s experiment manager. The laser path was created by drawing a straight-line region-of-interest (ROI) in cellSens. ROIs were drawn across the cell nuclei avoiding nucleoli, which were then ablated along the lines. The laser was set to 50%, and a 10% neutral density filter in the laser path reduced the power at the objective to 5%. 10 repetitions per ablation cycle were performed and imaging of the cells was performed in confocal mode before, during and after the ablation. The Olympus Xplore Spin system undergoes regular quality control for resolution and laser power, and a 16-point calibration was performed for the Rapp laser ablation system before imaging. GFP signal intensities at micro-irradiated sites were quantified using Fiji/ImageJ. For each time point, values were normalised to both background fluorescence (measured in an undamaged nuclear region) and the pre-damage baseline intensity at time point t=0. To reduce noise, a 15-second averaging window was applied, and the normalised intensity at t=0 was set to zero.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS)</title><p id="P52">20 µM UFM1 F35-BpF proteins were incubated with 20 µM UFM1 receptor proteins in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C in 0.2 ml thin-walled polypropylene PCR tubes (Greiner Bio-One).

Gel-purified PCR products were sequenced by Sanger sequencing using the primers: F-seq: 5’-CGTCTTCTCTATCCAGGGCTG-3’ and R: 5’-CAAACTAGAACCAGGATTTAATGTGA-3’.</p></sec><sec id="S41"><title>Chromatin fractionation following DNA double-strand break induction</title><p id="P73">Chromatin fractionation experiments broadly followed a previously established method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. Stock solution of calicheamicin γ1 (Cali, CAS: 108212-75-5, #HY-19609, MedChem Express) was made at 250 μM in DMSO and stored at -70 °C. For drug exposure, exponentially growing cells in 60 mm or 100 mm (U2OS and HEK293T cells) or 150 mm (fibroblasts) diameter dishes were either mock-treated (DMSO) or treated with 5 nM Cali in fresh medium for 1 h at 37 °C. In chase experiments, cells were washed with fresh media and incubated in fresh media without Cali at 37 °C for the indicated time points. Cells were washed with PBS and harvested using trypsin-EDTA followed by two washes with ice-cold PBS. For chromatin fractionation, cells were first resuspended for 7 min on ice in 100 µL of extraction buffer I (50 mM Hepes-KOH pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 × EDTA-free cOmplete protease inhibitors, 1 × protein phosphatase inhibitors) with intermittent gentle vortexing. Following centrifugation at 17,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 3 min, the supernatant was removed and stored on ice, and pellets were gently resuspended with pipette tips in 100 µL of extraction buffer II (50 mM Hepes-KOH pH 7.5, 75 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.025% Triton X-100, 30 U RNAseA/T1 (NEB)), incubated for 15 min at 25 °C under agitation and centrifuged as above. The supernatants from both centrifugation steps were pooled (soluble protein fraction). Pellets (chromatin fractions) were resuspended in 100 µL extraction buffer III (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3% SDS) and sonicated for 20 s at 30% amplitude in 10 s pulses (QSonica Q125 sonicator with a 2 mm diameter probe). Protein content was measured with BCA reagent (Pierce). Immunoblotting was performed as described. For quantification of chromatin-bound NHEJ factors, bands were quantified in Image Lab (Bio-Rad) or Image J and normalised to the β-actin loading control from the same blot after subtracting background blot intensity. Amounts were normalised to the “wildtype” or “normal” condition within the same antibody blot.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Text and Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS206984-supplement-Text_and_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d17aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S42"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Stephen P.
