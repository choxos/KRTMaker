Ample studies have linked covert visual-spatial attention to the direction of small fixational eye movements called microsaccades, offering researchers and clinicians a potential non-invasive tool to track internal states of covert attention. However, other studies have reported only a weak link or no link at all. We now show that the link between covert visual-spatial attention and microsaccades critically depends on the stage of attentional deployment. Across two experiments—each employing a distinct but widely adopted approach to fixational control—we show that spatial microsaccade biases were more pronounced (Experiment 1) or even exclusively present (Experiment 2) during the initial stage of shifting covert spatial attention, even when covert attention was subsequently maintained as testified by enhanced visual discrimination. This shows that the involvement of the brain’s oculomotor system in covert visual-spatial attention qualitatively changes over the course of attentional deployment, and how its peripheral fingerprint in the form of microsaccades reliably indexes shifting but not necessarily maintaining covert visual-spatial attention.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Visual-spatial attention refers to the dynamic process by which the human brain selects and prioritises the processing of currently relevant visual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Visual-spatial attention can operate in two modes: overtly, by physically directing gaze towards relevant stimuli, and covertly, by attending to peripheral visual information outside of the current fixation. Extensive research has established that the neural circuitry that mediates shifts of overt visual-spatial attention, namely the oculomotor system, also contributes to covert visual-spatial attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). A canonical behavioural manifestation of this overlap in neural circuitry comes from the study of microsaccades—small eye movements that occur even during attempted fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). In particular, many studies have reported an association between spatial biases in microsaccade direction and the allocation of covert visual-spatial attention.</p><p id="P3">This link between microsaccades and covert visual-spatial attention has been demonstrated repeatedly: both in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) and non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), and both during externally directed perceptual attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) and internally directed attention within visual working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). At the same time, the link between covert visual-spatial attention and microsaccades is not always found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), leading to mixed results in the literature. Notably, in a recent article, Willett &amp; Mayo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) reported no bias in microsaccade directions, despite clear behavioural and neural demonstrations that covert attention was allocated to the relevant visual stimulus.</p><p id="P4">One possible source underlying the mixed results that pervade the literature may be that ‘attention’ has been treated as a unitary and static construct. This is problematic under the hypothesis that the link between microsaccades and covert attention may only be reliable for specific stages associated with the deployment of spatial attention, such as when shifting between locations, but not when subsequently maintaining attention at the new location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Indeed, while most studies that reported a link used tasks that required <italic>shifting</italic> covert visual-spatial attention, the recent study by Willet &amp; Mayo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) that questioned this link used a task that required <italic>maintaining</italic> covert visual-spatial attention after it had already been shifted. Thus, whether—and how reliably—microsaccades track covert visual-spatial attention may fundamentally depend on whether one considers the period of shifting attention, or the ensuing period of maintaining attention after the shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>).</p><p id="P5">This differentiation by stage of attention also naturally follows from the putative function of the brain’s oculomotor system in attention. Consider the case of overt attention: when aiming to attend to an object by looking at it, the oculomotor system is initially engaged once to shift the eyes. Once the eyes have landed on the attended location, no further eye-movements are necessary, yet overt attention can remain at this location. We pose that the same may apply for covert attention: shifting covert attention may engage the oculomotor system particularly to relocate the focus of covert attention, leading to a bias in microsaccade direction particularly while the shift occurs. Once shifted, visual-spatial attention may effectively remain at the covertly attended location, but with a distinct contribution from the oculomotor system that does not necessarily result in a bias of microsaccade direction.</p><p id="P6">To address the hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) that microsaccades may particularly track <italic>shifting</italic> covert visual-spatial attention—in comparison to <italic>maintaining</italic> attention at this location after the initial shift—we conducted two complementary experiments that each employed a distinct but widely adopted approach to gaze control during the task. Consistent with our hypothesis, microsaccades predominantly (Experiment 1) or exclusively (Experiment 2) tracked shifting compared to maintaining covert visual-spatial attention, even though covert attention was maintained at the attended location after the initial shift, as evidenced by visual discrimination performance.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P7">Forty-eight healthy human volunteers performed a covert visual-spatial attention task in which a central colour cue indicated which of two laterally presented stimuli (positioned on the left and right below central fixation) would be most likely to show the target event: a slight orientation change that had to be judged as being clockwise or anticlockwise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). To be able to study covert attention across both shifting and subsequent maintaining phases, we varied the interval between cue and target from 500 to 3200 ms. This necessitated shifting attention immediately in response to the cue (as the target event could already occur 500 ms after cue onset) as well as maintaining it on the cued stimulus (since the target event would often occur after longer cue-target intervals). We conducted two versions of this task, differing only in the approach to fixational control during the task. In Experiment 1, central fixation was instructed and monitored by the experimenter. Experiment 2 included gaze-contingent trial termination whenever gaze deviated more than 2° from central fixation, as controlled by custom software. Adopting both approaches enabled us to relate our findings to a broader set of prior studies given that both are widely used in the vast literature on covert visual-spatial attention.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Attention was successfully shifted and maintained</title><p id="P8">We first verified that our task was successful in inducing early shifts of visual-spatial attention that were maintained even for target events occurring several seconds after the cue that prompted the initial attention shift. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, responses were faster and more accurate for target events occurring at the cued (valid) versus the other (invalid) stimulus, with cue benefits extending across all cue-target intervals. Cue-validity effects are summarised in the bar graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, and were robust in both experiments, for both reaction times (E1: t(23)=4.673, p=1.052e-04, d=0.540; E2: t(23)=4.098, p=4.407e-04, d=0.894) and accuracy (E1: t(23)= 3.281, p=0.003, d=0.383; E2: t(23)= 3.062, p=0.006, d=0.745). (For cue-validity effects at each of the tested cue-target intervals, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>.)</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Attention was accompanied by a bias in microsaccade direction</title><p id="P9">Building on prior demonstrations of a bias in microsaccade direction accompanying the spatial allocation of covert visual attention (see introduction), we assessed whether microsaccades are also biased towards the cued stimulus in our orientation change detection task. We were specifically interested in the <italic>temporal dynamics</italic> of such a microsaccade bias in our task, which invoked both shifting covert attention to the cued visual stimulus, as well as maintaining it there until the target event (the orientation change) would occur.</p><p id="P10">We exclusively analysed directional microsaccade biases prior to the orientation change, to ensure our results are uncontaminated from potential responses related to the target event itself. To ensure sufficient trials for analysing microsaccades, we included all trials where the orientation change occurred later than 1400 ms after cue onset. This provided a good trade-off between having sufficient trials, while also having sufficient time to capture microsaccade biases during the initial shifting phase and the ensuing phase in which attention was maintained on the cued stimulus after this shift. Importantly, our conclusions remain unaffected when investigating the entire time course through a complementary analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p><p id="P11"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the time-resolved rates of downwards saccades made either towards the cued stimulus or towards the other stimulus, for both experiments. To zoom in on the ‘attentional modulation’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> shows the spatial saccade bias, as the difference in saccade rates toward the cued versus the other stimulus. In both experiments, a significant saccade bias is present towards the cued item, starting around 200 ms after cue onset (E1: cluster p &lt; 0.001; E2: cluster p=0.036). While in Experiment 1 saccade directions remain significantly biased towards the cued stimulus throughout the entire investigated period, in Experiment 2—where fixation demands were more strict, as trials were terminated upon breaking fixation—this bias became short lived, occurring only within the typical window associated with attentional shifting (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Rather than classifying saccades as ‘micro’ or ‘macro’ based on an inherently arbitrary threshold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> shows the attentional modulation (saccade bias) as a function of the size of the saccades that contributed to it. Consistent with our instructions to deploy attention covertly, the reported bias was not driven by participants looking directly at the cued stimulus at 5 degree visual angle from central fixation, but rather by smaller saccades that were <italic>biased</italic> in the direction of the cued stimulus. Indeed, the saccade bias was driven predominantly (Experiment 1) or exclusively (Experiment 2) by saccades in the classic microsaccade range, i.e. below 1 degree.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Microsaccade directions are biased predominantly during attentional shifting</title><p id="P13">To summarise our findings, we finally quantified the observed spatial bias separately in two time windows that were chosen a-priori to capture either the period of ‘shifting’ or the ensuing period of ‘maintaining’ covert attention at the cued stimulus, after the initial shift. Specifically, we defined the shift period as the time period from 200 to 600 ms after cue onset, consistent with prior microsaccade studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) as well as with complementary behavioural studies showing that voluntary attentional deployment unfolds between 200-600 ms after an endogenous attention cue (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Following the logic that participants were required to shift attention to the cued stimulus and retain it there, we defined the maintenance period simply as the interval immediately following the period of shifting: from 600 to 1400 ms after cue onset.</p><p id="P14"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> shows a quantification of the directional bias in both timeframes. This confirmed a significant directional bias during the ‘shift period’ in both experiments (E1: t(23)=3.117, p=0.005, d=0.615; E2: t(23)= 2.543, p=0.018, d=0.502), while the bias in the ‘maintain period’ was significantly only in Experiment 1 (t(23)=2.838, p=0.009, d=0.560) and no longer present in Experiment 2 (t(23)=0.889, p=0.383, d=0.175). To clarify this result, we found moderate Bayesian evidence for the absence of a bias during the maintenance period in Experiment 2 (BF<sub>01</sub>=3.26). This corresponds with the absence of a significant cluster in Experiment 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Finally, complementing the findings for Experiment 1 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>—where we found a single cluster spanning both shift and maintenance periods—an additional targeted quantification revealed that in Experiment 1, the bias was still significantly larger during the shift than during the post-shift maintain period (t(23)=2.300, p=0.031, d=0.329).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">By investigating attention as a dynamic process, we reveal how the relationship between microsaccades and covert visual-spatial attention critically depends on the stage of attentional deployment. Specifically, our results show that microsaccade directions are predominantly (Experiment 1) or even exclusively (Experiment 2) biased during the initial process of shifting covert attention to a relevant visual stimulus, as opposed to the subsequent stage of maintaining attention on this stimulus after the initial shift. We observed this even though visual discrimination performance confirmed the allocation of attention well beyond the initial shift window. The insight that the relation between microsaccade direction and covert visual-spatial attention depends on the stage of attention provides a critical nuance in our general understanding of the relationship between the oculomotor system and covert attention. This insight may not only clarify apparent inconsistencies in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), but also has important theoretical and practical implications, as we elaborate below.</p><p id="P16">When considering microsaccades as a peripheral marker of the oculomotor system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), our data suggest that role of the oculomotor system is likely distinct during different stages of covert attentional deployment. While the role of the wider oculomotor system in attention is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), the notion that this role may fundamentally differ across stages of attentional deployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) remains underappreciated. Yet, this dynamic stage-dependent participation is highly plausible when we consider that the same system is responsible for both covert and overt shifts of attention. In the case of overt attention, we make an eye movement to bring a new object into view once, and then simply keep this object foveated. By studying microsaccades, we provide evidence that a similar dynamic participation of the oculomotor system likely holds for covert visual-spatial attention. This does not necessarily imply that the oculomotor system contributes <italic>more</italic> during attentional shifts—it simply contributes differently. For example, shifting covert attention may principally recruit populations of motor and visual-motor neurons within the oculomotor system, while after attention has been shifted, covert attention may be held in place primarily by visually selective neurons in the same system that do not bias microsaccade directions (for the widely studied distinction between visual, motor, and visual-motor tuning, see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Future work using direct neurophysiological recordings are required to asses this possibility.</p><p id="P17">Our findings also have practical implications. When using microsaccades as a marker to study covert attention, our data demonstrate that this marker is predominantly useful for tracking attentional shifts, but less so for tracking subsequent maintaining of visual-spatial attention. This does not necessarily negate its use to also track more sustained forms of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), but our data make clear how this is less reliable and may break down, especially when employing stricter fixational control (as was shown in Experiment 2). Furthermore, while our data confirm a robust link between microsaccade direction and shifts of covert visual-spatial attention on a trial average, it is important to note that microsaccades are not necessarily a reliable marker of attention shifts at the single-trial level. In fact, previous research has shown that microsaccades and attention shifts can decouple at the single-trial level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), and that attention shifts only influence the likelihood of microsaccades following the same direction as attention, without directly triggering any new microsaccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).</p><p id="P18">In this current work, we assessed the relationship between microsaccades and covert attention in two experimental settings with different approaches to fixation control: instructed fixation with monitoring by the experimenter (Experiment 1) or with gaze-contingent trial termination controlled by custom software (Experiment 2). Because both approaches are commonly employed in the field, this set-up allows our data to be comparable with a broader literature on covert attention. In both cases, microsaccades were more reliably associated with the initial shifting of attention. Moreover, during the stricter fixation demands of Experiment 2, the link between microsaccades and attention could exclusively be established during the initial shifting period. This was the case even though we observed clear performance benefits at intervals far beyond the initial shift period. Together, these complementary experiments reinforce our central conclusion that the link between microsaccades and covert visual-spatial attention critically depends on the attention stage under investigation. In addition, they show how the exact mode of fixation control can shape the observed nature of this link.</p><p id="P19">The present study specifically examined microsaccade biases in relation to shifting and the ensuing period of maintaining covert visual-spatial attention in a task where the target event could occur anywhere between 500 and 3200 ms after cue onset. In future work, it will be valuable to extend our findings to situations where covert visual-spatial attention must be sustained over much longer timescales. Such situations may also naturally invoke lapses of attention that then require a re-establishing or re-shifting of covert visual-spatial attention. Whether such refocusing resembles the cue-induced shifts studied here—and is therefore similarly tracked by microsaccades—remains an interesting question for future research.</p><p id="P20">By considering attention not as a unitary and static construct but as a dynamic process, our data highlight how the involvement of the oculomotor system in covert visual-spatial attention fundamentally depends on the stage of attentional deployment, as reflected peripherally by microsaccades. This provides new insight into the intricate dynamics of covert visual-spatial attention and its oculomotor underpinnings and carries implications for the utility of microsaccades as an accessible peripheral marker of attention and its dysfunction in various neurological and psychiatric conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p id="P21">All experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

This consisted of a covert visual-spatial attention task requiring participants to detect and discriminate a sudden orientation change in one of two presented Gabor patches. Prior to the orientation change, a colour cue was shown indicating with 80% reliability which Gabor patch would contain the target event (i.e., the orientation change).</p><p id="P25">Both experiments contained 20 blocks of 40 trials each.

Left and right cues were equally likely and counterbalanced across trials. The interval between cue onset and the target event (the orientation change of either stimulus) varied from 500 to 3200 ms in discrete steps of 300 ms, resulting in ten possible cue-target intervals. Cue-target intervals were randomly drawn and counterbalanced across trials. The inclusion of early target events ensured that participants had an incentive to shift attention upon cue onset, while the inclusion of later target events enabled us to also study the period of subsequently maintaining attention on the cued stimulus.</p><p id="P27">After the orientation change occurred, participants reported the direction of the orientation change (i.e. clockwise or anticlockwise) by pressing either the ‘z’ (anticlockwise) or ‘m’ key (clockwise).

After blink removal, data were epoched relative to cue onset. Finally, all trials with a premature keyboard response were removed from the saccade data analyses. In Experiment 2, we additionally removed all trials that were terminated by a break in fixation before the target event had occurred. In total, this yielded an average of 752±45 (M±SD, out of 800) trials per participant for Experiment 1 and 633±74 for Experiment 2.</p><p id="P35">For our main analysis (the results of which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) we exclusively analysed directional microsaccade biases prior to the target event (i.e., the orientation change of either visual stimulus). This ensures our results are uncontaminated from potential responses related to the target event itself. To also ensure sufficient trials for analysing microsaccades, we included all trials where the orientation change occurred later than 1400 ms after cue onset. This provided a good trade-off between having sufficient trials, while also having sufficient time to capture microsaccade biases during the initial shifting phase and the ensuing phase in which attention was maintained on the cued stimulus after this shift.</p><p id="P36">Importantly, our conclusions remain unaffected when investigating the entire time course through a complementary analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). In this analysis, all data occurring after the orientation change were removed on each trial (by replacing these data with NaNs), thereby also ensuring our results are uncontaminated from potential responses related to the target event itself. While this complementary analysis does allow for examination of the full time course, the disadvantage of this approach is that the number of available data points decreases progressively towards the end. Consequently, statistical inferences become less stable at later time points. Because of this limitation, we did not adopt this approach as our main analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Saccade detection and visualisation</title><p id="P37">To detect saccades, a previously established and validated velocity-based method was employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) (building on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>)). In this approach, saccades are detected by finding those samples where the 2-dimensional velocity exceeds a certain trial-based threshold. Gaze velocity was obtained as the derivative of gaze position that was smoothed in the temporal dimension with a Gaussian-weighted moving mean filter with a 7-ms sliding window (using the built-in MATLAB function ‘smoothdata’). The velocity threshold was set at 5 times the median velocity in any given trial, which is consistent with earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). A minimum delay of 100 ms between successive saccades was imposed to avoid counting the same saccade multiple times.</p><p id="P38">Saccade size (in degrees) and direction were calculated by estimating the difference between the pre-saccade gaze position (−50 to 0 ms before threshold crossing) and the post-saccade gaze position (50 to 100 ms after threshold crossing). Because stimuli were placed at a 45° angle <italic>below</italic> the central fixation dot we only included downwards saccades, following the same logic as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). This ensured that all saccades were either toward the cued stimulus or toward the other stimulus, while neglecting upward saccades back to the fixation marker. (Note how this deliberate analysis choice also renders saccade rates lower than in many other articles that include saccades in all directions). Depending on the direction of the saccade and the side of the cued item, we thus classified saccades as ‘towards the cued stimulus’ or ‘towards the other stimulus’. After detecting and classifying the saccades, the time courses of saccade rates (in Hz) was determined by using a sliding time window of 100 ms, advancing in steps of 1 ms.</p><p id="P39">To also investigate the size of the saccades that contributed to our findings without imposing an arbitrary threshold, we additionally decomposed saccade rates into a time-size representation, showing the time courses of saccade rates as a function of the saccade size (as also done in 14, 18, 23). For this, we used successive saccade-size bins of 0.5 degrees visual angle in steps of 0.1 degree.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P40">For the analysis of the behavioural data, we employed paired-sample Student’s t-tests to compare average response times and accuracy scores between trials in which the target event occurred in the cued (valid cue) or other (invalid cue) stimulus, collapsed over all cue-target intervals.</p><p id="P41">To statistically evaluate the time series gaze data, we employ a non-parametric cluster-based permutation approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). The permutation analysis was conducted using Fieldtrip with default clustering settings (grouping adjacent time points that were significant in a mass-univariate comparison). A permutation distribution of the largest cluster size was acquired by randomly permuting the trial-average data at the group level 10,000 times and identifying the size of the largest clusters after each permutation. The p-values of the clusters observed in the original data were calculated as the proportion of random permutations where the largest cluster was equal to or larger than the cluster that we observed in the original data.</p><p id="P42">The cluster-based permutation approach only identifies temporal clusters of significance, but is not suited to directly compare modulations between the pre-defined time windows of shifting vs. maintaining attention. In order to compare the magnitude of the saccade bias between the two time windows of interest, we defined the shift window as the window between 200-600 ms after cue onset (determined a-priori, based on prior work, see 14, 18, 23 and consistent with ample related literature, see 32–34) and we defined the subsequent stage of attentional maintenance in the period following this (in the main analysis, this period lasts from 600 until 1400 ms after cue onset). This enabled us to average the saccade biases (defined as the difference in saccades rates toward the cued versus the other stimulus) in both a-priori defined time windows and to compare these biases using paired-sample Student’s t-tests. As this analysis resulted in a non-significant p-value, we supplemented this analysis with a Bayesian analysis to also quantify evidence in favour of the absence of an effect. This was implemented in JASP using default settings (i.e., the prior distribution is a Cauchy distribution with location 0 and scale 0.707).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS207357-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d8aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by an ERC Starting Grant from the European Research Council (MEMTICIPATION, 850636) and an NWO Vidi Grant from the Dutch Research Council (14721) to F.v.E.</p></ack><sec id="S16" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data, Materials, and Software Availability</title><p id="P43">All study data and analysis code will be made public prior to publication.

Several studies have linked covert attention to the direction of miniscule eye-movements known as microsaccades. Other recent studies have questioned this link. We now explain this discrepancy by treating ‘attention’ not as a single static construct but as a dynamic process. We show that the link between microsaccades and covert attention critically depends on the stage of attention—with microsaccades robustly tracking shifting but not maintaining covert attention. This reveals how the contribution of the brain’s oculomotor system to attention changes dynamically over time. These findings have implications for the use of microsaccades as an accessible marker of attentional (mal)function across psychological and neurological conditions.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Attention was successfully shifted and maintained.</title><p>(A) Schematic showing the progression of a single example trial. A colour change of the central fixation dot cued which of two visual stimuli was most likely to change orientation (the visual target). After a variable delay, the target event (the orientation change) occurred in either the cued (80% of trials, valid) or other (20%, invalid) stimulus and participants reported whether it was clockwise or anticlockwise.
