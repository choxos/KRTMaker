Mammalian gene regulation is controlled by promoters and enhancers with rapidly divergent activities. However, the interplay between human non-coding genetic variation and regulatory evolution remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated promoter and enhancer evolution in the mammalian heart using genome-wide epigenomic profiling, intersected these elements with genetic variants associated with cardiovascular traits, and experimentally tested candidate regions in human cardiomyocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells. First, we applied a comparative genomics approach to identify epigenomically-conserved promoters and enhancers in the heart, as well as elements with primate-specific or human-only epigenomic signals. Second, we evaluated the association of common genetic variation and signatures of cell-type specific gene regulation with mammalian epigenomic conservation. We report an enrichment of common genetic variants in epigenomically-conserved promoters and enhancers, which also associate with regulatory pleiotropy across cardiac cell types, and promoter-enhancer contacts in cardiomyocytes. Based on these findings, we selected candidate epigenomically-conserved elements across three cardiovascular genetics loci (<italic>KCNH2, CPEB4</italic> and <italic>PRKCE</italic>), and investigated gene expression and cellular outcomes upon CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of each region in human cardiomyocytes. These analyses inform how mammalian epigenomic conservation associates with specific gene expression contributions and downstream cellular responses, such as cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and sensitivity to hypoxia/reoxygenation. Moreover, the comparative analyses we present here contribute to ongoing efforts to prioritise and functionally characterise cardiovascular association signals from human population genetics.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Gene regulation in mammals is largely controlled by collections of non-coding regulatory elements, such as promoter and enhancer regions with characteristic biochemical hallmarks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Genetic alterations in specific regulatory regions are known to lead to a range of diseases, including developmental disorders and cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Moreover, human population studies over the last decade have consistently found most common disease-associated variants reside in non-coding regions of the human genome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, further suggesting alterations in gene regulation underlie interindividual disease susceptibility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Whilst the contribution of selected common variants has been addressed in specific disease models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, the recent and vast expansion of human population genetics increasingly complicates experimental investigation of individual enhancer variants.</p><p id="P5">During evolution, and in contrast to relatively stable coding sequences, mammalian regulatory elements show substantial evolutionary turnover, especially for enhancers controlling cell-type specific gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Previous comparative epigenomic studies have extensively documented promoter and enhancer evolution across several mammalian tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and largely suggested a greater functional relevance for conserved regulatory activity. In contrast, lineage-specific elements appear to associate with low contributions to downstream gene expression, and are often compensatory to proximal losses in regulatory activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. However, only a handful of studies in mammalian tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> or cellular models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> have investigated the relationship between mammalian turnover of non-coding regulatory elements and human common genetic variation. Work across primate tissues in human and marmoset found lineage-specific enhancers were highly variable across individuals, and contributed poorly to downstream transcription <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. On the other hand, enhancers harbouring disease-associated variants were often conserved in human and marmoset tissues. In contrast, comparative work in human and mouse <italic>in vitro</italic> cardiac differentiation models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> suggested disease-associated genetic variation can also occur in enhancer elements active specifically in human cardiomyocytes.</p><p id="P6">Here, we sought to characterize the evolutionary turnover of promoters and enhancers in the mammalian heart, a tissue that has been underexplored in previous comparative studies. This resource allowed us to characterize the interplay between common genetic variation associated with cardiovascular diseases and traits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> in relation to epigenomic conservation of cardiac regulatory elements. Our results support previous observations on the association of trait- and disease-associated common genetic variation with conserved regulatory activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, and delineate candidate enhancers and promoters with retained epigenomic activity across mammals which also harbour human common genetic variants for cardiovascular traits. We further leveraged induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> as an <italic>in vitro</italic> system to investigate candidate elements via CRISPR/Cas9 genomic deletion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> across three cardiovascular loci, and report the impact of each candidate element on gene expression and cellular phenotypes relevant to cardiovascular disease susceptibility, such as cardiomyocyte hypertrophy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and resistance to oxidative stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Heart epigenomes across 11 mammals identify a subset of epigenomically-conserved promoters and enhancers associated with core heart processes</title><p id="P7">To investigate epigenomic conservation of promoters and enhancers in the heart, we generated histone mark chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data across tissue samples from ten mammalian species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Using two to four biological replicates per species, we obtained an average of around 20,000 promoters and 50,000 enhancers reproducibly detected across individuals (Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). We next used pairwise whole-genome alignments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> to compare regulatory regions across our study species with those active in the human heart <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). First, we identified promoters and enhancers with a reciprocal alignment between the human genome and the other species' genomes in our study phylogeny. This approach allows us to compare epigenomic signals across species in our study for the subset of alignable promoters and enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, ~70% of promoters and ~60% of enhances). Second, we categorized levels of epigenomic conservation into three categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). We defined epigenomically-conserved promoters and enhancers as orthologous regions displaying histone mark enrichment across all study species, which correspond to regions with highly-conserved regulatory activity. As an illustrative example, we show an epigenomically-conserved promoter and an intronic, epigenomically-conserved enhancer in the <italic>MEF2D</italic> cardiac locus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We also defined sub-sets of promoters and enhancers with lower levels of epigenomic conservation, namely restricted to primate species and to the human heart ("primate-specific" and "human-only", respectively). In agreement with previous reports in other mammalian phylogenies and tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, we identified hundreds to thousands of epigenomically-conserved and primate-specific promoters and enhancers; and larger numbers of human-only regulatory regions. Moreover, orthologous promoters with higher levels of epigenomic conservation are more abundant than enhancers in the same category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Consistent with epigenomic conservation associating with core regulatory function, ontology terms across these categories showed significant enrichment of heart-related processes in epigenomically-conserved enhancers, and general metabolic and transcriptional categories for epigenomically-conserved promoters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). These results closely agree with those reported in similar datasets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and indicate that across our study species we capture promoters and enhancers corresponding both to constrained and fast-evolving sequences.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Epigenomic conservation in the heart enriches for trait-associated genetic variation and cell-type specific gene regulation</title><p id="P8">We next focused on characterizing the interplay between epigenomic enhancer and promoter conservation, human non-coding genetic variation and downstream gene regulation in the heart. Previous reports in primate tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and <italic>in vitro</italic> models of heart muscle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> begun to explore this association, which our data addressers in an extended phylogenetic framework. To this end, we obtained common genetic variants associated with major cardiovascular traits and diseases in human population studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> (Methods), which we intersected with epigenomically-conserved, primate-specific and human-only promoters and enhancers. This analysis revealed a consistent enrichment of common genetic variation within epigenomically-conserved promoters and enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>), with less pronounced enrichments found for primate-specific elements and cardiovascular traits such as QT interval duration. We also observed epigenomically-conserved elements associate with expression quantitative trait loci <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> in heart but not in liver (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>). Our results are consistent with previous reports in primate tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, and suggest the association of epigenomically-conserved regulatory elements and trait-associated genetic variation can inform the contributions of heart gene regulation to cardiovascular traits.</p><p id="P9">To further characterize the regulatory properties of epigenomically-conserved promoters and enhancers, we leveraged publicly-available datasets across human heart cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. First, we observed significant differences in chromatin accessibility across cardiac cell types between epigenomically-conserved and human-only elements. Whereas human-only promoters and enhancers have a higher average accessibility in cardiomyocytes, epigenomically-conserved elements show similar accessibility levels across major cardiac cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). This observation is consistent with earlier reports on increased regulatory pleiotropy associating with epigenomic enhancer conservation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Second, epigenomically-conserved regulatory elements are overrepresented among significant promoter-enhancer interactions in iPSC-cardiomyocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> (p=1e-18 for enhancers and p=1e-87 for promoters; hypergeometric test with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>). On average, 48% of epigenomically-conservedelements overlap a known promoter-enhancer interaction in this cell-type, compared with 26% of human-only enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). On the whole, these observations support the notion that epigenomic conservation associates with downstream signatures of gene regulation across heart cell types, and in cardiomyocytes specifically.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Genomic deletion of epigenomically-conserved enhancers and promoters during cardiomyocyte differentiation</title><p id="P10">Post-GWAS interrogation of candidate trait-associated regions from human population studies remains a significant challenge.

Specifically, we employed a range of selection criteria (Methods) to define candidate genomic elements from epigenomically-conserved promoters and enhancers that harbour trait-associated genetic variation and signatures of gene regulation in human cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>).</p><p id="P12">From these, we selected three cardiovascular loci for targeted perturbation experiments in human induced pluripotent stem cells via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic deletion (Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>). For each tested region, we obtained heterozygous and homozygous deletions in human iPSCs, and assessed the impact of each deletion on target gene expression at two different time-points during <italic>in vitro</italic> cardiomyocyte differentiation.</p><p id="P13">First, we selected two candidate enhancers in the <italic>KCNH2</italic> locus: an epigenomically-conserved intronic element and a control human-only element nearby (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). <italic>KCNH2</italic> codes for a transmembrane potassium channel involved in electrical conduction in cardiomyocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, and the selected epigenomically-conserved enhancer overlaps common genetic variants associated to cardiac arrythmia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. <italic>KCNH2</italic> expression at days 15 and 21 of differentiation showed negligible effects upon genomic deletion of the control, human-only enhancer (yellow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, deletion of the neighbouring epigenomically-conserved enhancer led to clear reductions of <italic>KCHN2</italic> expression at both time-points (blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Compared to the human-only control enhancer, our results are consistent with a specific gene expression contribution of the epigenomically-conserved <italic>KCNH2</italic> enhancer during human cardiomyocyte differentiation, an observation that aligns with previous perturbations of overlapping or orthologous sequences in human <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and mouse <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">Second, we targeted an epigenomically-conserved promoter in the <italic>CPEB4</italic> locus. <italic>CPEB4</italic> codes for one of four RNA-binding proteins in the CPEB family, with reported roles in cell survival <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, hypoxia responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.

Consistent with the requirement of this epigenomically-conserved promoter for gene expression, we observed a clear downregulation of <italic>CPEB4</italic> mRNA levels at days 7 and 15 of cardiomyocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Lastly, we genetically deleted an epigenomically-conserved promoter in the <italic>PRKCE</italic> locus.

PRKCE is a member of protein kinase C family of proteins and has important roles in cardiomyocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, with the epigenomically-conserved promoter associating with the longest isoform in this locus.

Comparison of differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) between homozygous deletions and wild-type controls for each enhancer revealed a much more pronounced effect on downstream gene expression for the epigenomically-conserved enhancer at 15 days of cardiomyocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>); a difference that was similarly observed at the later time-point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>).

As expected, and consistent with the known roles of KCNH2 in cardiac repolarization, genes downregulated upon deletion of the epigenomically-conserved enhancer in this locus were associated with ontology terms for heart biological processes at both time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4D</xref>), including cardiac muscle contraction. In contrast, genes downregulated upon deletion of the epigenomically-conserved promoter in the <italic>CPEB4</italic> locus were enriched for stress pathway gene ontologies, including apoptosis and DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4E</xref>); consistent with the roles of CPEB4 as a survival protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. However, most DEGs upon <italic>CPEB4</italic> promoter deletion were upregulated, and associated with ontology terms across cellular responses such as extracellular matrix organization and cell adhesion. Lastly, genes downregulated in cardiomyocytes derived from iPSCs with a <italic>PRKCE</italic> promoter deletion were enriched for gene ontologies of cardiac development, differentiation and contraction processes. This observation is in line with the functional role of PRKCE signalling in cardiomyocytes, particularly as part of sarcomeric contraction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. However, upregulated genes upon KCNH2 enhancer or <italic>PRKCE</italic> promoter deletions tended to associate with general biological processes rather than those specific to cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4D,F</xref>), suggesting they may correspond to gene expression changes secondary to KCNH2 and PRKCE downregulation.</p><p id="P22">In sum, gene expression changes upon deletion of three epigenomically-conserved enhancer and promoter candidates in differentiated cardiomyocytes support their significant contributions to gene expression.

In this system, 72-hour treatment of wild-type cultures with ET-1 led to a significant increase in cardiomyocyte size of ~25%, in line with previous observations in stem-cell derived human cardiomyocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>.

These results suggest the epigenomically-conserved promoter in the <italic>CPEB4</italic> locus is necessary for a full hypertrophic response in human cardiomyocytes, with its deletion leading to hypertrophy in basal conditions and in the absence of ET-1 stimulation. In the same experimental system, a similar promoter deletion in the <italic>PRKCE</italic> locus did not associate to consistent differences in cellular size compared to wild-type cultures, either in basal conditions or following ET-1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>).
