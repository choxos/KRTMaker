Studies supporting these views, however, measured neural activity as a bulk quantity, and related it to blood supply following disparate events in different regions. Here we measure fluctuations in neuronal activity and blood volume associated with the same events across the mouse brain, and find that their relationship is consistent across brain regions but differs in two opposing brainwide neural populations. Functional Ultrasound Imaging (fUSI) revealed that whisking, a marker of arousal, is associated with brainwide fluctuations in blood volume. Simultaneous fUSI and Neuropixels recordings in cortex and hippocampus showed that neurons that increase vs. decrease activity with whisking have distinct hemodynamic response functions. Brainwide Neuropixels recordings revealed that these two opposing populations are present in the entire brain. When summed, their contributions predicted blood volume across brain regions better than predictions from bulk neural activity. The mouse brain thus contains two neural populations with opposite relation to brain state and distinct relationships to blood supply, which together account for brainwide fluctuations in blood volume.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The blood supply to the brain is tightly correlated with neuronal activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. This neurovascular coupling is usually described by a positive hemodynamic response function (HRF) that acts as a filter on the neural activity. Filtering the neural activity measured in a local region with the HRF provides a reasonable prediction of the blood supply in that local region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">There is debate, however, about whether neurovascular coupling is consistent across brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Weaker HRFs have been reported in ol-factory bulb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, somatosensory thalamus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, and frontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Some studies even reported negative HRFs, such as in somatosensory cortex (ipsilateral to a sensory stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>) or in striatum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Others argued that the HRFs are always positive (with decreases in blood supply stemming from decreases in firing rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>), and are consistent across brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Moreover, neurovascular coupling might differ across brain states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. For instance, in mouse somatosensory cortex the correlation between blood supply and neural activity was reported to be stronger during sensory stimulation than at rest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, and stronger in NREM sleep than during wakefulness or REM sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In macaques, moreover, neurovascular coupling was reported to be stronger when the animal rests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, changes in attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> or anticipation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> seem to affect blood supply more than local neural activity. Perhaps these factors engage vascular mechanisms that do not depend only on neuronal firing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">However, previous studies of neurovascular coupling summarized neural activity with bulk measures, which cannot distinguish the potentially different correlates of different neurons. Bulk measures of neural activity provide better predictions of blood supply than individual neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, the pathways that relate neural activity to blood supply are complex and may well differ across cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. For example, the coupling between blood supply and activity might differ in neurons vs. glia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> or in inhibitory vs. excita-tory neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Across the brain, there may be populations of neurons that have different patterns of activity and different coupling to blood supply, which would not be distinguishable in bulk measurements of neural activity.</p><p id="P6">Moreover, studies of neurovascular coupling measured neural activity in different regions in relation to different events. Studies focused on different regions, such as olfactory bulb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, somatosensory cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, or frontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, measured neural activity with respect to different events, such as the delivery of an olfactory or somatosensory stimulus, or the onset of spontaneous running. Their results, therefore, are hard to compare and to assemble into a unified view of neurovascular coupling across the brain.</p><p id="P7">To overcome these limitations, we measured brainwide blood volume and brainwide neural activity in relation to brainwide neural events. We focused on the neural events related to spontaneous behavior, because they span multiple brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, and particularly on whisking, a reliable marker of arousal in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Functional Ultrasound Imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (fUSI) revealed that whisking is associated with stereotyped, brain-wide changes in blood volume, which predict blood volume changes associated with arousal events. Simultaneous fUSI and Neuropixels recordings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> revealed that neurons that increase vs. decrease activity with whisking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> have distinct hemodynamic response functions (HRFs). Brainwide recordings of 18,791 neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> with Neuropixels probes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> revealed that these opposing populations coexist in every brain region. When the different HRFs are applied to the activity of the two populations, and the results are summed, the resulting prediction captures the brainwide fluctuations in blood volume better than the bulk local activity. These results indicate that neurovascular coupling is consistent across brain regions and levels of arousal, but is different in two brainwide neural populations with opposite relation to brain state.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P8">To measure the changes in blood volume associated with spontaneous behaviors, we used functional Ultrasound Imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (fUSI). In each session, we measured cerebral blood volume in a coronal imaging plane, simultaneously capturing its dynamics in many brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). We varied the imaging plane across sessions, so that all planes together covered the posterior half of the cerebrum (cortex, hippocampal formation, striatum, and pallidum), all of the interbrain (thalamus, hypothalamus, and zona incerta), most of the midbrain (including the substantia nigra and the superior colliculus), and part of the pons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). We aligned the imaging planes to the Allen Common Coordinate Framework Atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, assigned each voxel to a brain region, and computed the median activity across voxels within each region. Mice were head-fixed but free to run on a wheel. We monitored their behavior with infrared cameras as they spontaneously went through varying states of arousal. These fluctuations in arousal were marked by bouts of whisking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> that were often accompanied by locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>) and that correlated with fluctuations in blood volume in multiple brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Arousal events were associated with widespread and dynamic changes in blood volume. These events were characterized by whisking and loco-motion. Locomotion was always associated with whisking and was accompanied by strong, sustained increases in blood volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b, c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Whisking also occurred in the absence of locomotion, so we adopted it as a more sensitive assay of arousal. In a typical session, brief bouts of whisking led to a widespread increase in blood volume followed by a decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d, e</xref>). Longer bouts led to a similar pattern, with decreases in blood volume occurring at whisking offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Brainwide measurements of blood volume established that correlates of whisking were present in the whole brain. We repeated our fUSI measurements in 5 mice and 138 sessions (101 hours of imaging) across multiple coronal planes, and we combined the results for each brain region. Brief whisking bouts (1.3-3.5 s, without locomotion), led to an almost simultaneous increase in blood volume in the entire brain, followed by an almost simultaneous decrease around 2 s after the bout began (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>). Longer whisking bouts led to a longer brainwide increase in blood volume, followed by a similar simultaneous decrease when the bout stopped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref>). These effects were similar across brain regions, with occasional differences in amplitude and dynamics. For example, hippocampus and some regions of isocortex only showed a transient increase lasting ~2 s, followed by a decrease even while whisking continued; ventral regions such as amygdala and olfactory areas tended to activate earlier than the others at the onset of whisking bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g, h</xref>).</p><p id="P11">These brainwide fluctuations in blood volume could be reproduced by applying a biphasic filter to the whisking timecourse. We sought to capture the effect of whisking on each region’s blood volume throughout time regardless of specific whisking events. To this end, we used linear regression to obtain filters that predict that region’s blood volume from whisking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). The resulting predictions accounted for a large fraction of the variance in blood volume across states of arousal, from stillness to locomotion, and across multiple regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Thus, brainwide fluctuations in blood volume can be predicted by applying a biphasic filter to an arousal factor indexed by whisking.</p><p id="P12">We next investigated the neural basis of the whisking-related changes blood volume. We used simultaneous recordings of hundreds of neurons in visual cortex and hippocampus with Neuropixels and blood volume with fUSI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). We binned spikes to the same temporal resolution as the fUSI data (300 ms time bins) and computed the overall firing rate of the neurons, along with whisking and blood volume in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We first attempted to predict the changes in blood volume from the local bulk firing rate, and failed to capture the correlates of whisking. Following established precedent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, for each recording session, we fit a linear filter to predict blood volume from the average firing rate. As expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, the best-fitting filter provided good overall predictions of blood volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). Across sessions the best-fitting filter was monophasic and peaked 1.8 s after neural activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>), consistent with the standard HRFs that have been previously obtained from bulk neural activity in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. However, closer inspection revealed that the prediction tended to be sluggish, failing to capture the fastest dynamics of spontaneous blood volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). This limitation was particularly clear during whisking events. The bulk firing rate measured during whisking events showed an increase followed by a smaller decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f, g</xref>). This slightly biphasic response is in principle consistent with the biphasic response we observed in simultaneously recorded blood volume. However, convolution with the HRF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>) smoothed this feature out, failing to reproduce the biphasic changes in blood volume seen during whisking events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2h</xref>). Thus, a linear filter on average neural activity could not properly account for changes in blood volume during whisking events. To account for brainwide blood volume, it might be necessary to consider more than one dimension of neural activity.</p><p id="P14">Closer inspection of the neural data revealed two populations of neurons with opposite modulation by arousal. Consistent with previous measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, we found that neurons differed substantially in their relation to whisking: some neurons correlated positively with whisking and some neurons correlated negatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a, b</xref>). We refer to these two opposing populations as arousal+ and arousal– neurons. We hypothesized that considering this heterogeneity could provide a better prediction of blood volume.</p><p id="P15">The firing rates of the two opposing populations provided good estimates of the local blood volume. We designed a model where the blood volume in a region reflects not just the bulk neural activity but rather the activity of the two opponent populations of arousal+ and arousal– neurons, each acting with its own HRF. For each session, we filtered the activity of arousal+ neurons and of arousal– neurons with the best-fitting filters to obtain a prediction of blood volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). The resulting filters were positive and monophasic, but with different peak times and widths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>): the filter for arousal+ neurons peaked earlier (1.2 s after neural activity) and was narrower (1.2 s full width at half height), whereas the filter for arousal– neurons peaked later (2.1 s after neural activity) and was wider (1.8 s). Compared to the bulk prediction, this combined prediction was better able to track the observed fluctuations in blood volume, even in the absence of whisking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). The prediction from arousal+ and arousal– neurons provided a good account of the blood volume fluctuations associated with whisking events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>). At whisking onset, the activity of arousal+ neurons increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3g</xref>), while the activity of arousal– neurons decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3h</xref>). The combined prediction from these two populations captured the characteristic biphasic changes in blood volume seen during whisking events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3i</xref>). Indeed, after the onset of whisking the blood volume first increased due to the increase in activity of arousal+ neurons and later decreased due to the delayed decrease in activity of arousal– neurons. More generally, regardless of whisking events, the firing rates of the two opposing populations provided better estimates of blood volume than the bulk firing rate: their predictions had higher coherence with the measured blood volume at all frequencies, both in visual cortex (p = 0.015 across frequencies, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3j</xref>) and in hippocampus (p = 0.002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3k</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). This improvement was not restricted to periods of strong whisking: it was present even during periods of relative quiet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The changes in blood volume seen in visual cortex and hippocampus during whisking events, therefore, are best explained by the activity of two opposing populations of neurons, each with its own hemodynamic response function. The improved performance of the predictions from the two opposing populations cannot be explained by having more free parameters because the fits were performed with cross-validation (see Methods). Moreover, the improvement was specific to those two populations of neurons: it was not pre-sent when using two random populations of neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). Finally, we tested whether a biphasic HRF would provide a good account of blood volume based on average firing rate only. To do so, we computed a biphasic HRF from the difference between the HRF for arousal+ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>, top), and the HRF for arousal– neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>, bottom), with different weights. Applying these filters to the average firing rate was not sufficient to recapitulate the changes in blood volume during whisking events nor to reach similar levels of accuracy as the model from the two populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). Thus, the two populations of arousal+ and arousal– neurons provide a superior account of blood volume, that cannot be achieved from bulk firing rate alone.</p><p id="P17">To test whether a similar model applied in other brain regions, we turned to recordings with Neuropixels probes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> across the entire mouse brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. In these recordings, each brain region is covered by multiple probe insertions. We focused on the periods after the end of decision-making task sessions, when the mice rested passively (n = 324 recordings from 108 mice), and exhibited fluctuations in arousal marked by whisking. Again, we binned spikes to the same temporal resolution as the fUSI data (300 ms time bins), and we assigned neurons to brain regions using the same mapping (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Arousal+ and arousal– neurons were present throughout all brain regions. As in the simultaneous fUSI-Neuropixels measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), in the visual cortex, fluctuations in arousal drove two opposing populations of neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, increasing activity in arousal+ neurons and decreasing it in arousal– neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). Similar results were seen in the whole brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b, c</xref>): averaged across regions, about half of the neurons (47±12%, s.d. across 55 regions) correlated positively with whisking, and a smaller but substantial fraction (16±7%) correlated negatively with whisking. The relative abundance of arousal+ and arousal– neurons varied between regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). For instance, arousal-neurons were more abundant in thalamus (61±10%, s.d. across 12 thalamic regions, e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>) and arousal– neurons were more abundant in auditory cortex (Au, 27% of neurons) and secondary somatosensory cortex (SSs, 35% of neurons).</p><p id="P19">These opponent neural populations both showed monophasic responses to arousal events. In each brain region, the firing of arousal+ and arousal– neurons followed a roughly similar timecourse, with opposite signs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d, e</xref>). Their contributions thus tended to cancel out in the average firing rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>), particularly in regions where arousal– neurons were more frequent, such as hippocampus. The two populations, however, showed subtly distinct dynamics: the activity of arousal+ neurons peaked 0.11±0.02 s (s.e. across 55 regions) after whisking onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>). The activity of arousal– neurons peaked 0.78±0.26 s after whisking onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref>), significantly later than arousal+ neurons (p = 8e-6, Wilcoxon signed-rank test across regions).</p><p id="P20">The two opposing neural populations provided a better account of blood volume across the brain than the bulk neural activity. The bulk firing rate measured after whisking onset correlated significantly with the blood volume measured across regions (r = 0.44, p = 0.0008, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>), but underestimated the blood volume changes seen in certain midbrain regions and overestimated those seen in certain cortical regions. Blood volume across regions showed a stronger correlation with the relative proportion of arousal+ vs. arousal– neurons (r = 0.63, p = 3.3e-7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>), with more accurate estimates of blood volume changes for many brain regions, especially in the midbrain and cortex.</p><p id="P21">Indeed, using the firing rate of arousal+ and arousal– neurons improved the ability to predict brainwide blood volume during whisking events. To test this, we used the bulk model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) and the combined model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) to predict whisking-related blood volume throughout the brain. For the bulk prediction, we convolved the bulk firing rate obtained with the brainwide Neuropixels recordings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>) with the HRF obtained for bulk firing rate in the simultaneous Neuropixels and fUSI recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>, averaged across all measurements in visual cortex and hippocampus). We followed the same procedure to obtain combined predictions of blood volume from of arousal+ and arousal– populations for each brain region, this time applying the filters found for arousal+ and arousal– neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>) to the firing rate of these populations in each region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d, e</xref>). We scaled the contributions of arousal+ and arousal– populations based on the relative sizes of these populations in each region, and we summed them to obtain a combined prediction of whisking-related changes in brain-wide blood volume. The bulk prediction completely missed the biphasic dynamics and the delays of blood volume following whisking events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>) while the combined prediction well recapitulated these characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>). The combined prediction thus largely outperformed the bulk prediction, leading to a smaller error in most brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">By combining three datasets acquired in different mice with different techniques, we obtained high-quality predictions of fluctuations in blood volume across the mouse brain. Large-scale fUSI measurements revealed brainwide fluctuations in blood volume that could be predicted from whisking. Simultaneous fUSI and Neuropixels recordings revealed that neurons that increase vs. decrease activity with whisking have distinct, positive hemodynamic response functions (HRFs). Brainwide Neuropixels recordings revealed that these two populations are present in the whole brain. Filtering their firing rates with their HRFs and combining the results provided good accounts of brainwide changes in blood volume with arousal, outperforming the predictions from bulk firing rate. Thus, neurovascular coupling appears to reflect not the bulk firing rate, but rather the firing rates of two brainwide neural populations with opposite relation to arousal state.</p><p id="P23">This finding extends previous studies of neurovascular coupling, without contradicting them. Indeed, these studies could not have observed the two opposing populations, because they obtained a single measure of bulk neuronal activity, such as the local field potential or the overall firing of a local population.</p><p id="P24">Our results indicate that whisking is a good predictor of brainwide fluctuations in blood volume. In addition to whisking, arousal is indexed by multiple behavioral correlates such as pupil dilations and locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Here we considered whisking and locomotion, and we found that whisking could explain a substantial part of fluctuations in blood volume throughout the brain, including during times of locomotion. Since locomotion is always preceded and accompanied by strong whisking, whereas whisking can occur without locomotion, whisking is a more interesting predictor for arousal-related fluctuations than locomotion. Pupil dilations are slower but may provide otherwise a similarly good account of blood volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P25">Fluctuations in blood volume, however, were better explained by the activity and relative abundance of arousal+ and arousal– in each brain region. This relative abundance varied substantially across regions. This variation may explain why some cortical regions have been found to be positively vs. negatively correlated with locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Indeed, the abundance of arousal– neurons in auditory cortex is consistent with the high numbers of neurons suppressed by locomotion in that region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">Once the diverse abundance of the two populations is taken into account, neurovascular coupling is consistent across brain regions. Our results thus may reconcile two views of neurovascular coupling: that it is consistent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> vs. diverse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> across regions. Perhaps studies that found it to be consistent compared regions with similar fractions of arousal+ and arousal– neurons, and studies that found it to be variable compared regions with different fractions.</p><p id="P27">Our results also support the view that neurovascular coupling is consistent across brain states. Indeed, we found that the activity of the two opposing populations could predict blood volume across arousal states ranging from quiet periods — which likely included sleep — to long whisking bouts. This result contradicts previous studies that found neurovascular coupling to differ across brain states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, these studies used bulk measures of neural activity, so they could not distinguish the state-dependent contributions of arousal+ and arousal– neurons.</p><p id="P28">The ability of the two opposing populations to predict blood volume may be even higher than it appears from our analyses. Indeed, our analyses relied on three datasets obtained in different mice, laboratories, and conditions. This uncontrolled variation is likely to affect mouse behavior, making the comparison more difficult. For instance, the mice were likely quietest in the simultaneous fUSI and Neuropixels recordings, which were performed in long sessions with no task. By contrast, the brainwide Neuropixels recordings that we analyzed were briefer and performed right after the mouse performed a task.</p><p id="P29">Moreover, the relationship between neural activity and blood volume may have higher dimensionality. We have distinguished two populations of neurons, arousal+ and arousal–, based on their correlation with whisking. There may be other ways to distinguish the activity of neurons that would lead to even better predictions. These improved approaches might identify more than two subpopulations, each with their own HRF.</p><p id="P30">The relationship between the blood supply and the activity of the two opposing populations is likely to be at least partly causal. The simplest explanation is that the arousal+ and arousal– populations are each related to blood volume through their own distinct neurovascular coupling mechanisms. In this view, the relationship between activity and blood volume would be entirely causal. Alternatively, there could be an additional direct link between the factors that control the activity of those two populations and blood volume. These factors have been studied extensively in the cortex and in thalamus, and include neuromodulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> and inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. These factors may affect different populations of neurons differently. Our data do not distinguish between these explanations. They do, however, reveal that neurovascular coupling is different in two key neural populations with opposite relation to arousal.</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S5"><title>Brainwide fUSI measurements</title><p id="P31">Experiments were conducted in 5 C57/BL6 mice (3 male, 2 female), 13-34 weeks of age.

This scan consisted of average Power Doppler images for short fUSI acquisitions in slices 0.1 mm apart, covering the whole craniotomy. This served as a reference to which we aligned each individual session, as well as the histology.</p><p id="P46">We perfused each animal using a blood vessel labelling procedure and imaged the brain (see Histology), extracting signals in two color channels: green for autofluorescence and red for labelled blood vessels.

To do so, we used an affine transformation fit to minimize the distance between several manually identified matched key-points (~15-30) in both volumes. These were typically branching between big blood vessels visible in both the in-vivo, lower resolution fUSI scan, and the in-vitro, higher resolution histology volume. We visually confirmed the proper alignment between the two volumes and then transposed the Allen regions labels to our fUSI volume, so that we obtained a region label for each voxel of the scan.</p><p id="P48">To select the target regions to keep for our analyses, we first mapped the region labels to the coarser <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://int-brain-lab.github.io/iblenv/_autosummary/iblatlas.html">Beryl</ext-link> mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Some of these regions were too small to be identified with confidence with the resolution of fUSI. Thus, we set a threshold of volume for regions to be considered (~0.8 mm<sup>3</sup>). We then assigned regions smaller than this threshold to their parent region and reiterated the procedure until all regions reached the threshold. This procedure resulted in the co-existence of regions at various stages of hierarchy, for example VPM, VP and VENT. To clarify that these excluded some regions, we used the -O to indicate “other”, in VP-O and VENT-O. A full list of region names and acronyms is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>.</p><p id="P49">To account for the off-plane (AP) spatial resolution of fUSI (~0.4 mm), we then computed the mode region label of each voxel across the AP axis in a 0.4 mm range. We only assigned a region to a voxel if the mode corresponded to more than 2/3 of the values. Thus, voxels in zones of transitions between different regions were not assigned to any region.</p><p id="P50">For each recording session, we then aligned the slice to our reference anatomical scan in two steps: (a) manual assignment to the closest AP slice in the reference scan, (b) cross-correlation in space with the chosen slice of the reference scan. We then used the region labels from the aligned reference scan.</p><p id="P51">We discarded voxels with very little signal due to shadowing, for e.g. due to bone regrowth. To do so, we applied a Sobel filter to the anatomical image, which computes an approximation of the gradient of the intensity of the image, or edges. We identified shadowed areas by patches of the image (&gt; 30 voxels) with consistently low values of the Sobel filtered image. Indeed, in the brain, individual vessels create a lot of edges, so that big patches of low values only occur outside of the brain, or when vessels are hidden by bone.</p><p id="P52">Once we obtained region labels for each recorded voxel, we computed the region signal for this session using the median activity across voxels. For each recording session, we only considered regions with more than 20 voxels in the slice. Region signals were extracted for each hemisphere separately and then averaged across the two hemispheres. For further analysis, we considered all regions for which we recorded at least 10 sessions in total over all animals.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Behavior analysis and extraction of onsets</title><p id="P53">Locomotion velocity was obtained from the rotary encoder.</p><p id="P54">Whisking measurements were obtained through Facemap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Whisking was obtained by taking the first component of a SVD decomposition of motion energy over the whisker pad. This was done on either one or two cameras (corresponding to both sides of the mouse face). If the signal was available for two cameras, we used the average across both cameras. To have a comparable signal across sessions, we ensured that higher values corresponded to higher motion, and normalized the signal between 0 and 1, based on the 1<sup>st</sup> percentile and the maximum.</p><p id="P55">All behavioral metrics were binned in the same 300 ms bins as the fUSI data.</p><p id="P56">Whisking bouts were detected when the signal crossed a given threshold (0.15) and lasted until the signal reached another threshold (0.05) under the condition that the average whisking in the next 4 s remained below this threshold (this is to exclude very short interruptions in longer whisking bouts and allow better separation of whisking bouts).</p><p id="P57">Brief bouts were defined as bouts with duration between 1.3 and 3.5 s, while longer bouts lasted longer than 3.5 s.

We first aligned data to the detected onsets (or offsets) and averaged across the bouts of interest.

We then recentered by the baseline activity (0.5-2 s before whisking onset).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Predictions from whisking</title><p id="P59">To predict blood volume from whisking, we used cross-validated ridge regression. The lambda hyperparameter used for regularization was fitted through nested cross-validation. A feature matrix was constructed using lagged versions of the whisking trace, with lags ranging from -1.8 to 5.7 s (positive lags mean that whisking precedes blood volume). This was used to predict activity in each brain region, for each session. For each session, we allowed for a different non-linear scaling of whisking (the same across all regions). We ran predictions from whisking raised to the power of different values (from 0.1 to 1.2 with steps of 0.1) and selected the value providing the best prediction accuracy (averaged across regions). The median exponent across sessions was 0.4, so that this procedure gave more relative weight to small whisking events relative to the strong whisking associated for example with locomotion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Combined fUSI and Neuropixels recordings</title><p id="P60">For combined fUSI and neuronal recordings, we used our published dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> which combines Neuropixels recordings in visual cortex and hippocampus with fUSI at the same planes, in 5 C57/BL6 mice (4 male, 1 female), 9-12 weeks of age (see Ref<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> for details).

We used lags ranging from -2.1 s to 6.6 s in 0.3 s intervals, where positive lags mean that firing rate precedes blood volume. Cross-validation was done using folds of ~8 min, with nested cross-validation for the regularization hyperparameter.

Specifically, we estimated the magnitude squared coherence estimate using Welch’s method with 15 s windows and 7.5 s overlap between windows. To compare different predictions, we ran paired t-tests between the average coherence between actual and predicted blood volume (for all frequency bands below 0.7 Hz) for pairs of predictions (n = 10 sessions per region).</p><p id="P67">We also fit filters to predict blood volume from two random populations of neurons, matched in size with arousal+ and arousal– neurons, as well as from whisking (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). In addition, we verified how prediction accuracy for different predictions varied as a function of behavioral state, inferred from whisking. We cut each recording session into chunks of 10 s and computed the Pearson correlation between actual and predicted blood volume, as well as the average whisking within each chunk. We then binned chunks based on their average whisking and computed the median prediction accuracy within each bin of whisking, for each recording session. Bins were defined as the deciles of the observed distribution of these chunk average whisking values across all recording sessions. We then computed the average prediction accuracy in each bin across recording sessions, for different types of predictions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>).

For a given region, we included all neurons belonging to descendants of a region except if they had been already included in another child region. For example, VENT could contain neurons belonging to the subregions of VL, VAL, but not VP, since the latter was also a target region of interest. This procedure aimed to mimic what had been done for fUSI voxels, as well as ensuring that each neuron only featured in one target region. We excluded from further analysis regions containing less than 50 neurons for which spikes were detected during the passive periods.</p><p id="P72">Spikes of each neuron were binned in the same 300 ms bins as whisking.

For each region, we then averaged this cross-validated firing rate across all arousal+ or arousal– neurons and convolved it with their respective filters. We first rescaled the arousal+ filter by the ratio of the proportion of arousal+ neurons in this region to the average proportion of arousal+ neurons in the simultaneous fUSI-Neuropixels recordings (across hippo-campus and visual cortex). We did the same for arousal– filters and summed the contributions from both filters. For the predictions from bulk firing rate, we used the corresponding filter with the same scaling for all regions and used firing for the same half as for the other prediction. Finally, we applied a global scaling factor to each type of prediction (the same across all regions). This scaling factor was obtained by minimizing the mean squared error between the predicted and actual blood volume -1.2 to 5 s from whisking onset, for brief and long bouts, across all regions.
