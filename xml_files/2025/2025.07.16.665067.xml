Here, we establish DNAscent—a nanopore sequencing method that detects BrdU-labelled nascent DNA and infers replication dynamics—to map replication at single-molecule resolution in fission yeast. For the first time, we have identified thousands of replication forks, as well as initiation, termination and pause events, on single sequenced molecules across the whole genome. This high coverage allowed us to identify replication patterns in poorly characterised regions. In the rDNA, we detect strand-specific pausing at replication fork barriers. At the mating-type locus, we find the most frequent pause site outside the rDNA. At centromeres, we find that replication initiation predominantly occurs in the outer repeats, while termination localises to central regions and that, only in centromere 2, there is an enrichment in pauses at the centromeric tRNAs. This work establishes a powerful single-molecule method for studying replication dynamics in fission yeast and provides insights into replication across repetitive regions that constitute a significant portion of the genomes of more complex organisms.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">DNA replication is a fundamental process in all organisms by which the genome is accurately duplicated. In eukaryotes, DNA replication initiates at multiple sites—termed origins—across each chromosome. From these sites, bidirectional replication forks proceed until they terminate when meeting opposing forks. During this process, replication may pause due to obstacles such as protein barriers or DNA lesions. Perturbed forks or insufficient replication initiation events can be a source of genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Therefore, significant effort has gone into developing methods to study the sites of replication initiation and the kinetics of replication fork progression.</p><p id="P3">Much of our understanding of replication dynamics—particularly in yeasts such as budding yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>; <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) and fission yeast (<italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>; <italic>S. pombe</italic>)—has come from population-based, short-read genomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, early genomic studies identified replication origin locations via chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of origin-associated proteins or the increase in DNA copy number at active origin sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). More recently, a method termed polymerase usage sequencing (Pu-seq) identified not only replication initiation, but also termination and fork direction with high resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Pu-seq locates ribonucleotides erroneously incorporated into DNA by mutant replicative polymerases. Since polymerase ε and polymerase δ primarily synthesise the leading and lagging strands, respectively, the relative usage of these polymerases can be used to infer fork direction, and by extension, sites of initiation and termination. These methods rely on short-read sequencing and therefore cannot resolve the events occurring in complex repetitive areas such as the rDNA and centromeres. Moreover, they offer a population-level view of replication dynamics and fail to capture cell-to-cell variation.</p><p id="P4">Single-molecule and single-cell methods address the issue of cellular heterogeneity, but single-cell approaches often lack the resolution to precisely define replication events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). In fission yeast, DNA combing is the main single-molecule method that has been used to visualise major aspects of replication dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Advances in DNA combing allowed the analysis of ultra-long DNA molecules (&gt;1 Mb) and provided information on replication dynamics in complex, repetitive areas such as the rDNA, centromeres and telomeres. However, DNA combing relies on antibody-based detection of nucleotide analogues, which limits its spatial and temporal resolution and makes it challenging to map replication events precisely. Recently, an alternative single-molecule method, DNAscent, was developed to provide genome-wide, long single-molecule information on replication fork direction, initiation and termination sites, and fork pausing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). This technique was established in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), and has been successfully applied in cultured human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), and protozoan parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). DNAscent detects synthetic nucleotide analogues, such as bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), incorporated into nascent DNA strands during replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Varying BrdU incorporation levels with respect to time allowed identification of where replication initiates and terminates, fork direction and sites of fork pausing.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we established the experimental conditions to perform DNAscent in <italic>S. pombe</italic> to map replication dynamics with high coverage and with single-molecule resolution. We identify thousands of molecules with replication fork direction, initiation, termination, and pause sites across the whole genome including the rDNA, the mating-type locus and the centromeres. We observe clear clustering of replication pause events at previously reported replication fork barriers in the rDNA and the mating-type locus. At the centromeres, we identify termination zones located within the central regions, initiation sites in the pericentromeric regions and an increase in pauses only in centromere 2. Overall, we show that DNAscent is a high-throughput method to study all major replication dynamic features—initiation, termination, fork direction and fork pauses—across the whole genome in fission yeast.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Yeast strains</title><p id="P6"><italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<italic>S. pombe</italic>) strain AW2224 (<italic>h-, smt-0, leu1::leu1:Padh1-hENT1, gde1::his7:Padh1-hsvTK, cdc2-asM17, ade6-704</italic>) was used in this study.

To detect BrdU incorporation, cells are fed BrdU, harvested post-S phase, high-molecular weight genomic DNA extracted and subjected to nanopore sequencing. The resulting sequence data are basecalled, aligned to the reference genome sequence and sites of BrdU incorporation are determined using the DNAscent software (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Methods</xref>). The DNAscent software assigns a probability of BrdU substitution (grey circles; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) to each reference thymidine position across every sequencing read. Positions with a BrdU probability ≥0.5 are considered positive BrdU calls, and the fraction of BrdU incorporation is calculated in 300-thymidine windows across each sequencing read (black lines; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P32">To assess the profiles of BrdU incorporation in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we treated synchronised cells with a range of BrdU concentrations during a single S phase. None of the BrdU treatments affected cell cycle progression, as shown by flow cytometry profiles of cellular DNA content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, we observed that at the single-molecule level, BrdU incorporation was constant along the DNA and did not correlate with previously published median replication time from a cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells exhibited BrdU incorporation gradients that correlated with cell population median replication timing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). To obtain BrdU gradients in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, we added a thymidine chase 30 minutes after the BrdU treatment – a time that corresponds with mid-S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). In the same genomic location as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, we observed that the single molecules had BrdU incorporation levels resembling the median replication time. This result indicated that a thymidine chase led to BrdU decrease with respect to replication time. To further assess the relationship between BrdU incorporation and replication time, we plotted all single-molecule BrdU fractions against population level median replication times. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, BrdU incorporation decreased with later replication times at all tested concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>; top), supporting the use of BrdU levels as a replication timing proxy. These observations are consistent with previous reports from our group and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). In contrast, <italic>S. pombe</italic> exhibited no decline in BrdU incorporation with replication time unless a thymidine chase was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>; middle and bottom). Equivalent results were obtained using the newest nanopore sequencing chemistry (R10), although we observe that BrdU detection in R10 data was noisier, especially at late replication times (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). These results indicate that BrdU incorporation kinetics differ between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic>, and that in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, replication timing cannot be inferred from endogenous BrdU incorporation patterns alone. However, a thymidine chase produces BrdU gradients that correlate with replication time, indicating that single-molecule BrdU fractions can also serve as a proxy of replication time in <italic>S. pombe</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>BrdU incorporation levels indicate replication fork direction, initiation and termination sites</title><p id="P33">In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the addition of a thymidine chase in mid-S-phase resulted in high levels of BrdU incorporation followed by gradients of declining BrdU levels as replication proceeded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Positive BrdU gradients are identified as leftward-moving forks (blue arrows), whereas negative BrdU gradients are identified as rightward-moving forks (red arrows) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Diverging leftward- and rightward-moving forks indicate initiation sites (black rectangles) and converging leftward- and rightward-moving forks indicate termination sites (grey rectangles). In a dataset from <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells treated with 4 μM BrdU and 400 μM thymidine, we obtained 462,052 nascent single molecules in which we identified 370,298 forks, 65,098 initiation sites and 39,157 termination sites. As an example, we show all the single molecules with ≥1 forks in a 100-kb region from chromosome I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). BrdU densities are represented as a heatmap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> with one single molecule per row. The aligned single molecules clearly show variable levels of BrdU incorporation across this genomic locus. Most single molecule reads show a peak of high BrdU incorporation (green-yellow; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) around position 845 kb indicating early replication, in contrast to a region with low BrdU incorporation (blue; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) at around 865 kb indicating later replication. Declining levels of BrdU incorporation to the left and right indicate progressively later replication times and therefore replication fork direction. Transitions from left- to rightward forks are identified as initiation sites and right- to leftward as termination sites. Across the example locus on chromosome I, we observe alternating regions of predominantly leftward (blue arrows) and rightward (red arrows) fork direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The position of transitions from leftward to rightward fork direction are similar between single molecules, for example at ~845 kb where most molecules have diverging forks indicating an initiation site. By contrast, there is more variability between molecules in the position of converging forks (for example at ~865 kb) that indicate termination sites.</p><p id="P34">To validate the single molecule replication fork direction, and initiation and termination sites, we compared them to those identified by previous cell-population studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). To allow direct comparison with the cell population data from these studies, we calculated an ensemble of our single-molecule data. For replication fork direction, we calculated the fraction of leftward-moving forks (1 kb window, 300 bp steps) across the genome using all our single-molecule data. For initiation and termination sites, we counted the number of events in 2 kb windows. When comparing the ensemble single molecule and Pu-seq fraction of leftward replication forks, we observed a strong correlation (<italic>R</italic> = 0.82) between the datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). At the example genomic locus, we see close agreement between the ensemble fraction of leftward forks from our single-molecule data and the Pu-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). We then compared the single-molecule initiation and termination sites, to those inferred from Pu-seq data. Half of the single-molecule initiation events (33,428 out of 60,731 sites) were within 2 kb of a Pu-seq initiation site, and this intersection was highly statistically significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). Similar results were obtained when looking at the intersection of single-molecule initiation sites and other independent studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3B-D</xref>). The Pu-seq methodology determines both the location and efficiency of origins (fraction of cells in which the origin initiates DNA replication). Our dataset has a ~100x coverage of reads with ≥1 initiation site, therefore, we reasoned that the number of times an initiation was observed on single molecules would indicate the efficiency of the origin. To test this, we compared the count of single-molecule initiations with the Pu-seq efficiency measurement at each Pu-seq origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). We observe a positive correlation between the count of single-molecule initiation events and Pu-seq origin efficiency. We also found a positive correlation between the count of single-molecule termination events and frequency of Pu-seq terminations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). This is reflected in the example locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), where there is a striking similarity between the single molecule and the Pu-seq data for fraction of leftward-moving forks, and location and efficiency of initiation and termination sites. Together these findings validate that the DNAscent methodology provides single molecule information on replication fork direction and the location of initiation and termination events. In addition, ensembles of single molecules provide a measure of the frequency of replication initiation and termination across the genome.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>BrdU incorporation reveals replication pause locations in leading and lagging strands at the rDNA replication fork barrier</title><p id="P35">We have shown that BrdU incorporation levels in single DNA molecules can be used to infer replication fork directions, as well as initiation and termination sites. BrdU densities can also indicate the location of replication pauses, as previously demonstrated in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) where sudden drops in BrdU density denote replication pauses within the ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Fission yeast rDNA consists of 100–150 tandem repeats, each containing the ribosomal RNA genes, a replication origin, and a region containing four replication fork barriers (RFBs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). RFBs are located downstream of the largest ribosomal gene to arrest rightward-moving forks, thereby limiting replication in the opposite direction to transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Thus, we anticipated that we would observe a sudden drop in BrdU density indicating replication pauses at the RFB. First, we aligned our single-molecule dataset (4 μM BrdU / 400 μM thymidine) to a reference sequence of 22 rDNA repeats. Second, we used DNAscent to detect BrdU and forkSense to infer the position of replication forks, initiation and termination events. Third, paused replication forks were computationally identified from large decreases in BrdU density (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Methods</xref>), thus prioritising a low false positives rate at the expense of identifying shorter pauses that would present as a smaller decrease in BrdU density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Among the 8,165 nascent reads that aligned to rDNA, we identified 12,677 forks, 3,654 initiation sites, 2,079 termination sites, and 376 pauses. Finally, combining information about fork direction and sequenced strand, we labelled each pause site as from a leading or lagging strands.</p><p id="P36">In example single molecules, aligned to the custom rDNA sequence, we observe clear drops in BrdU density that align with RFBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, these molecules show that only a fraction of the origins of replication were active (~1 in 3), consistent with observations from DNA combing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Then, we visualised all reads containing ≥1 pause and observed that anticipated drops in BrdU density aligned to the RFB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). We also observed that most initiation sites overlapped with the previously characterised replication origin, and that rDNA units are predominantly replicated by leftward forks, thus ensuring co-directionality of transcription and replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>). Next, we collapsed the replication pause site data onto a single representative rDNA repeat. The identified sites of pausing were predominantly on rightward-moving forks and enriched at the RFB location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). We observe that the leading strand pauses are more tightly clustered and closer to the RFB than the lagging strand pauses. These results confirm that the DNAscent methodology can identify replication pause sites and reveal the strand of synthesis and fork direction, giving a more detailed and quantitative view of replication dynamics at the rDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Frequent replication pausing in the mating-type locus</title><p id="P37">The ability to detect pauses in replication within the rDNA prompted us to investigate pauses throughout the unique genome. To test this, we mapped the data to a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of our strain AW2224 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Methods</xref>). This allowed us to analyse genomic regions that differ between this strain and the reference genome, including the centromeres and mating-type locus. Across the whole unique genome, the most prominent identified replication pause site was within the mating-type locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). The mating type of <italic>S. pombe</italic> is determined by the <italic>mat1</italic> locus located at chromosome II. Flanking the <italic>mat1</italic> gene, there are two elements that control the direction of replication across the <italic>mat1</italic> locus: <italic>RTS1</italic> and <italic>MPS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The <italic>RTS1</italic> element is downstream of <italic>mat1</italic> and acts as a polar terminator of replication, terminating rightward-moving forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). The <italic>MPS1</italic> element is upstream of <italic>mat1</italic> and acts as a polar pause, stalling leftward-moving forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Thus, the <italic>mat1</italic> locus is predominantly replicated by leftward-moving forks that occasionally pause at the <italic>MPS1</italic> site. This tightly controlled replication pattern is proposed to allow the formation of an imprint (ribonucleotides and/or a nick) at the <italic>MPS1</italic> site, which can lead to mating-type switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). However, the frequency of the pausing at this site <italic>in vivo</italic> is not known.</p><p id="P38">Our single-molecule dataset allowed us to observe two distinct patterns of replication at the <italic>mat1</italic> locus: continuous replication by a leftward fork, or leftward-moving fork pauses at the <italic>MPS1</italic> site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Unperturbed fork progression was the most frequent scenario (~60 % of molecules) (data not shown). Ensemble of replication features showed a clear termination area upstream <italic>mat1</italic> which aligns with the expectation of right forks terminated at the <italic>RTS1</italic> element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).

These results indicate that the <italic>mat1</italic> locus is almost exclusively replicated by a leftward-moving fork (94%) that may pause (~40% of molecules) at the <italic>MPS1</italic> site or continue through <italic>mat1</italic>, and that most rightward-moving forks terminate at the <italic>RTS1</italic> site.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Replication dynamics across the highly repetitive centromeres</title><p id="P39">The high levels of repetitive sequence across <italic>S. pombe</italic> centromeres have precluded comprehensive analysis of the replication dynamics by previous short-read based genomic studies. Each of the three centromeres is comprised of a central core flanked by inner (<italic>imr</italic>) and outer (<italic>dg</italic> and <italic>dh</italic>) repeats containing tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). The inner repeats are unique for each centromere, but the outer repeat sequences are shared among centromeres and are heterochromatic. The central core is the site of kinetochore assembly; the sequence of centromere 2 central core (<italic>cnt2</italic>) is unique, while those of centromeres 1 and 3 (<italic>cnt1</italic> and <italic>cnt3</italic>) are highly similar. Origins of replication have been found in the repeats of centromere 2 but not within the central core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), and it has been proposed that the centromeric tRNAs act as barriers to DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Therefore, we sought to use the single-molecule replication dynamics dataset to comprehensively analyse the landscape of replication across all three <italic>S. pombe</italic> centromeres.</p><p id="P40">After careful examination of published <italic>S. pombe</italic> genomes sequences we determined that the centromeric sequences were either incomplete or showed significant structural differences compared to our data (not shown). Therefore, we used our <italic>de novo</italic> genome assembly and annotated the centromeric regions for our strain (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Methods</xref>). Using this assembly as a reference for DNAscent and forkSense analyses, we identified 4,748 forks, 1,116 initiations, 729 terminations, and 285 pauses intersecting with the three centromeres. As an example, we show a single molecule that aligned to centromere 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Across centromere 1, most initiation sites were located outside the central core, particularly in the first <italic>dh</italic> repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Termination sites were associated with the inner repeat downstream of the central core, and replication pauses were distributed throughout the centromere. For centromere 2, initiation sites were found throughout the centromere, especially in the outer repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). A distinct enrichment in termination sites was observed across the central core, and notably, replication pauses were most frequent in proximity to the tRNAs within the outer repeat sequences. Centromere 3 DNA replication resembled centromere 1, with clustered initiation sites in the outer repeats and termination sites both in the central domain and in the repeats, but with no clear enrichment of pauses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). These findings indicate that all centromeres have replication origins outside the central core, termination events within the central region, and that centromere 2 may be unique in showing replication pausing close to tRNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S25" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P41">In this study, we demonstrated that direct nanopore sequencing and detection of the nucleotide analogue BrdU can determine replication dynamics across the <italic>S. pombe</italic> genome. This methodology, which we named DNAscent, captures all major features of DNA replication—initiation, fork progression, termination, and pausing—on single molecules. Additionally, it has the advantage of reporting the strand of synthesis which allows pauses on leading and lagging strands to be distinguished. Moreover, nanopore sequencing enabled &gt;200× coverage of long (&gt;30 kb, up to ~120 kb) nascent molecules genome-wide in a single MinION run. Such high coverage facilitates detection of rare events that are challenging to resolve with population-level methods, and also makes it possible to detect replication dynamics in repetitive sequences that cannot be studied with short-read sequencing methods. To validate our findings, we compared them against several independent published datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Initiation sites aligned with those identified in prior studies, with higher counts correlating with more efficient initiation sites. Fork direction and termination sites also correlated with published Pu-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Finally, most frequent pauses in the rDNA and the rest of the genome correlated with well-characterised replication fork barriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Altogether, this approach provides a detailed view of replication dynamics across the whole genome that complements and extends previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>).</p><p id="P42">To map replication dynamics, we measured changes in BrdU concentration with respect to time. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, endogenous mechanisms lead to decreases in BrdU levels over time, whereas in <italic>S. pombe</italic> BrdU levels were constant throughout S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, in this regard <italic>S. pombe</italic> is like other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) and suggests different mechanisms of dNTPs pool regulation in budding yeast compared to other eukaryotes. Although dTTP levels have been reported to rise in fission yeast during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), the magnitude of this increase is notably less than in budding yeast. This may reflect species-specific regulation of ribonucleotide reductase, the enzyme responsible for deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Nonetheless, we demonstrate that in fission yeast a thymidine chase can be used to experimentally reduce BrdU levels with respect to time. Similar approaches might be used for other organisms that, like fission yeast, do not naturally show BrdU gradients.</p><p id="P43">The repetitive rDNA locus, comprising 100–150 tandem 10.9 kb units, poses particular challenges for replication analysis. Our long-read sequencing approach allowed us to resolve replication patterns across multiple contiguous rDNA repeats, revealing two primary modes: active initiation within the rDNA repeat (~1 active origin in 3 rDNA repeats), and passive replication by forks entering from upstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Replication fork barriers shaped these patterns, and we observed a concentration of replication pausing events near a region with four replication fork barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Notably, lagging-strand pauses showed greater positional variability than those on the leading strand, consistent with the discontinuous synthesis of Okazaki fragments. Leading-strand pauses, by contrast, often occurred at four distinct positions that likely correspond to the four replication barriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P44">A <italic>de novo</italic> assembly allowed us to look at single-molecule replication dynamics in under studied areas, such as the mating-type locus and the centromeres. The mating-type locus is comprised of a heterochromatic silenced region with the <italic>mat2</italic> and <italic>mat3</italic> genes, and an actively transcribed region with <italic>mat1</italic> flanked by a replication termination site (<italic>RTS1</italic>) and a replication pause site (<italic>MPS1</italic>). We observed replication fork pausing at the <italic>MPS1</italic> site, leading to leftward replication and a downstream shift in termination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). While this behaviour aligns with previous models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), it is now directly visualised at the single-molecule level for the first time and it allowed us to estimate that ~40% of the cells pause in this location. In all centromeres, we found replication initiation sites within the outer centromeric repeats, whereas the central region functions as a termination zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). These findings are consistent with models proposing that replication dynamics are spatially organised to preserve centromere function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). We also observed a modest enrichment of replication pausing at tRNA genes within centromere 2. This includes the tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> gene in the <italic>imr2</italic> repeat, previously identified as a chromatin barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first direct observation of increased fork pausing at this locus, linking replication dynamics to known chromatin features in centromeric regions.</p><p id="P45">We also identified parallels between the organisation of the mating-type locus and centromeres. The <italic>mat2</italic> and <italic>mat3</italic> region shares heterochromatic features with the outer centromeric repeats, while <italic>mat1</italic>, like the centromere central cores, is euchromatic and associated with late replication. These similarities suggest a conserved strategy in which replication timing and pausing contribute to local chromatin structure. Fork pausing at the <italic>MPS1</italic> site may facilitate lagging-strand processes such as primer placement or chromatin modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). A comparable mechanism has been proposed for centromere 2, where pausing near flanking tRNA genes appears to protect the central core from inappropriate histone deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Interestingly, such pausing was absent at centromeres 1 and 3, indicating a different type of regulation.</p><p id="P46">In the future, DNAscent, alongside other nanopore-based methods such as FORK-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>), offer new opportunities for studying replication at single-molecule resolution. In particular, the ability to calculate fork velocity across different chromatin states will allow testing of whether replication is slowed in heterochromatin. Fission yeast offers a powerful model for this, given its compact genome and presence of mammalian-like heterochromatin, which is absent in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Furthermore, the capacity to track multiple molecular signals—including DNA modifications like methylation—on the same single molecule paves the way for integrated analyses of epigenetic and replication dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>).

fission and budding yeast.</title><p>A) Overview of the methodology for detection of BrdU and inference of DNA replication dynamics on single molecules. Cells are grown in the presence of the nucleoside analogue BrdU, which is incorporated into DNA in place of canonical thymidine. Then, DNA is extracted and nanopore sequenced. The resulting reads are analysed with a model that detects BrdU (DNAscent; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Methods</xref>). The density of BrdU along the sequenced DNA molecules is indicative of the kinetics of DNA replication if the BrdU densities decrease as replication proceeds. Peaks indicate replication initiation events, valleys indicate termination sites, positive gradients correspond to leftward replication forks, negative gradients to rightward forks, and sudden drops mark replication fork pause sites. B) <italic>S. pombe</italic> cell cycle synchronised cultures were grown in media with BrdU and harvested post S-phase at the indicated times. High-molecular weight DNA was then extracted, nanopore sequenced, and analysed. As an example, we show the BrdU detected on a single molecule from a culture treated with 2 μM BrdU and the corresponding population level median replication time from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). In the BrdU plot, the grey dots indicate the probability of BrdU at each thymidine and the black line indicates the fraction of BrdU in 300 thymidine windows. In the replication time plot, time is shown increasing down the y-axis. In both plots the x-axis indicates the genomic position on chromosome III. C) Similarly to <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells were grown in media with BrdU and harvested post S-phase at the indicated times. High-molecular weight DNA was then extracted, nanopore sequenced, and analysed. As an example, we show the BrdU detected in a single molecule from a culture treated with 30 μM BrdU and the corresponding population level median replication time from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) plotted as in panel B. D) Cell cycle synchronised <italic>S. pombe</italic> were grown in the presence of 4 μM BrdU with a 400 μM thymidine 30 minutes after release. As an example, we show the BrdU detected on a single molecule and the corresponding population level median replication time plotted as in panel B. E) Fraction of BrdU incorporated over time in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells treated with a range of BrdU and thymidine concentrations. For each single molecule, the fraction of BrdU incorporated in every 1 kb window was determined and plotted in 5 min bins of population level median replication time from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic>, respectively. The dotted black line indicates that only molecules with a BrdU fraction ≥0.05 are plotted. The black diamonds indicate the median BrdU fraction for each replication time interval.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207366-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>BrdU incorporation levels reveal replication fork direction, location and efficiency of initiation sites and location of termination sites.</title><p>Single molecules were aligned to the reference genome ASM294v2. A) Example of a nascent single molecule read with inferred replication dynamics.

The count of single-molecule initiation site midpoints within +/- 1kb from a Pu-seq origin were grouped by Pu-seq efficiency. Only DNAscent initiation counts ≤60 are shown.

Only DNAscent termination counts ≤30 are shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207366-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>DNA replication dynamics at the <italic>S. pombe</italic> rDNA.</title><p>Single molecules were aligned to a custom rDNA array containing 22 rDNA repeats.
