However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying eIF2A’s function remains poorly understood. Here, we exploit a TurboID-based proximity labeling combined with mass spectrometry to systematically map the interactome of eIF2A during homeostasis and stress. Combining polysome gradients with TurboID, we zoom into the interactions of eIF2A with the 40S small ribosomal subunit and map the eIF2A binding site close to the mRNA entry channel. We identify a network of interactors that link eIF2A to ribosome-associated quality control, including its strong interaction with G3BP1-USP10 complexes as well as RPS2 and RPS3. In the absence of eIF2A, RPS2 and RPS3 ubiquitination is diminished specifically upon ribosome stalling. 40S-specific footprinting in <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> cells shows minimal changes in 5´UTR occupancy, consistent with a limited role for eIF2A in translation initiation. Using dynamic SILAC mass spectrometry, we characterize the novel function of eIF2A in ribosome-associated quality control and show that eIF2A antagonizes USP10-dependent rescue of 40S ribosomes, resulting in altered turnover of 40S subunits upon cellular stress. Collectively, our study identifies a previously unknown link between eIF2A and ribosome-associated quality control, implies that eIF2A promotes translation fidelity by tuning 40S ribosome rescue under stress and warrants further investigations into the role of ribosome-associated quality control in tumorigenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Gene expression regulation is fundamental for maintaining cellular homeostasis and its deregulation is closely linked to the pathogenesis of various diseases including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Within the gene expression cascade, mRNA translation enables rapid modulation of protein levels in response to a broad spectrum of intrinsic and extrinsic signals. This complex, multi-step process encompasses initiation, elongation, termination, and ribosome recycling, with initiation generally considered the rate-limiting step in protein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The canonical translation initiation cascade involves the assembly of the ternary complex (TC) consisting of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), guanosine-5´-triphosphate (GTP) and the initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>), which delivers the initiator tRNA to the ribosomal P-site. Subsequently, the 43S preinitiation complex (PIC), comprising the 40S ribosomal subunit, the TC and additional initiation factors, is formed and recruited to the 5´end of the mRNA with the 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap binding complex eIF4F, forming the 48S initiation complex that scans the 5´untranslated region (UTR) to locate the start codon. Upon recognition of the start codon, GTP is hydrolyzed, followed by releasing initiation factors and joining of the 60S large ribosomal subunit to form the functional 80S ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P3">A central mechanism in the control of translation initiation involves the inhibition of eIF2 by the integrated stress response (ISR). Cellular stressors such as amino acid starvation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or oxidative stress activate the ISR, leading to the phosphorylation of serine 51 on the alpha subunit of eIF2 (eIF2α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Phosphorylation decreases the availability of active eIF2 and results in the repression of global translation. Nevertheless, certain stress response genes bypass global translational inhibition and remain translated, indicating the existence of alternative translation initiation mechanisms that are active under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Several alternative initiation factors, including eIF2D, MCTS-1/DENR, eIF5B and eIF2A, have been reported to interact with the 40S ribosome and facilitate eIF2-independent recruitment of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> for transcript-specific translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). eIF2D and MCTS-1/DENR have been shown to bind initiator tRNA and 40S ribosomes with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). However, subsequent studies indicated that their primary role is in recycling empty tRNAs from 40S subunits stalled at termination codons, a mechanism likely central to their ability to modulate re-initiation downstream of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). eIF5B promotes 60S ribosomal subunit joining and has similarly been reported to deliver initiator tRNA to the ribosome under stress conditions, particularly in the context of up-stream open reading frames (uORFs) and internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Together, these observations point to broader functions for these noncanonical initiation factors beyond a direct role in translation initiation.</p><p id="P5">The alternative initiation factor eIF2A was initially identified in the 1970s and considered the functional analogue of prokaryotic IF2, but subsequent studies reassigned this role to the canonical initiation factor eIF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Unlike the heterotrimeric eIF2, eIF2A is a 65 kDa monomeric protein reported to act as a GTP-independent but codon-dependent Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> carrier for specific transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). While eIF2A is not essential for global translation initiation, it has been implicated in various aspects of alternative translation initiation, including IRES-dependent translation, uORF initiation, re-initiation following uORF translation, 40S sequestering, ribosomal frameshifting and initiation from near-cognate start sites, with sometimes contradictory findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Knockout models in <italic>S. cerevisiae, C. elegans</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> are viable, indicating that eIF2A is not essential for cellular survival. However, its synthetic genetic interactions with eIF5B and eIF4E in yeast, with double deletions displaying severe slow growth phenotypes, suggest partial redundancy with these initiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Furthermore, eIF2A has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases. eIF2A knockout mice develop a metabolic syndrome characterized by fatty liver disease, obesity and insulin resistance, display reduced numbers of immune cells and have a shortened lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Moreover, eIF2A has been associated with neurological diseases, such as myotonic dystrophy 2, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), where eIF2A contributes to repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Additionally, multiple lines of evidence implicate eIF2A in different aspects of tumorigenesis. In a squamous cell carcinoma allograft model, eIF2A was required for early stages of tumor formation, despite not affecting cellular proliferation or global translation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), indicating a potential context-specific function in early oncogenic stress responses. Clinically, increased eIF2A levels correlate with shorter overall survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). eIF2A has also been implicated in promoting cell survival upon chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), facilitating cellular adaptation through the integrated stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) and supporting c-Src translation and cancer cell proliferation under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Despite its involvement in the pathogenesis of various diseases, the precise molecular function of eIF2A remains unclear. Although eIF2A has been implicated in promoting non-AUG initiation under specific conditions, such as binding immunoglobulin protein (<italic>BiP</italic>) mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) in stress or the translation of N-terminally extended <italic>PTEN</italic> isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>), recent ribosome profiling in eIF2A knockouts in yeast and human HeLa cells revealed minimal impact on global translation or uORF-mediated translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). Altogether, these observations raise the possibility that eIF2A’s role may extend beyond a direct involvement in translation initiation, prompting us to systematically map its interactome and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p><p id="P8">Here, we employed TurboID-based proximity labeling coupled with mass spectrometry to define the interactome of eIF2A under homeostasis and stress. We identify a network associated with ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), including interaction with G3BP1-USP10 complexes and the 40S proteins RPS2 and RPS3. Loss of eIF2A diminishes RPS3 ubiquitination upon ribosome stalling and alters 40S turnover under stress, suggesting a surprising functional link between eIF2A and the rescue of 40S ribosomes during stress.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>TurboID-based proximity labeling to map the interactome of eIF2A</title><p id="P9">To identify eIF2A’s interaction partners and obtain insights into its role in translation, we employed a TurboID-based proximity labeling strategy combined with label-free mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). First, we generated N-terminal and C-terminal TurboID-fusion constructs for eIF2A (TurboID::eIF2A and eIF2A::TurboID), along with 2 control constructs (tGFP::TurboID and cytosolic TurboID) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Using low-titer lentiviral transduction, we introduced these TurboID constructs into <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>; <italic>Tgfbr2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>; <italic>Eif2a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> cells from a previously established allograft squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) model that depends on eIF2A for rapid tumor formation in <italic>Nude</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). We then selected stable lines expressing our TurboID constructs at levels comparable to endogenous eIF2A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). The N-terminal TurboID::eIF2A construct partly rescued the subtle ribosome stoichiometry defects upon loss of eIF2A in polysome gradients, suggesting that the fusion constructs are functional (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Next, we optimized biotinylation conditions in SCC cells expressing TurboID fusion constructs and determined that a minimum of 30 minutes of biotin incubation was necessary for robust proximity biotinylation, as confirmed by western blot analysis with streptavidin-HRP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C-E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>eIF2A interacts with distinct groups of translational regulators</title><p id="P10">We carried out TurboID-based proximity labeling in SCC cells expressing either TurboID::eIF2A or eIF2A::TurboID fusion proteins, with tGFP::TurboID and cytosolic TurboID-expressing cells as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In parallel, we also treated cells with sodium arsenite (NaAsO<sub>2</sub>) prior to biotin supplementation to induce the integrated stress response, resulting in phosphorylation of eIF2α and inhibition of canonical translation with reduced polysome fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-B</xref>). We conducted 5 biological replicates of proximity labeling in unstressed and sodium arsenite-stress conditions for all 4 cell lines. After harvesting and purification of biotinylated proteins, samples were prepared for label-free mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for protein identification. To identify eIF2A-specific interactors, we used MaxQuant and SAINTexpress, which calculates the probability of baitprey interactions compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) and heatmaps revealed that eIF2A-expressing cells were distinct from the TurboID controls in both unstressed and stress conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3, S4A-B</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Using a Bayesian false discovery rate (BFDR) &lt; 0.2, we identified 33 proteins as eIF2A interactors. 23 proteins specifically interacted with the N-terminal TurboID::eIF2A fusion protein, while 10 proteins were identified with both N-terminal and C-terminal constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-G</xref>). Notably, 14 out of 33 proteins overlapped between stress and unstressed conditions, with only three interactors being stress-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Interestingly, we did not detect any C-terminus-specific interactors, suggesting that the N terminus of eIF2A is primarily responsible for protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A</xref>). This notion is supported by structural insights as eIF2A’s N-terminal region contains an unconventional 9-bladed β-propeller fold implicated in protein and RNA binding, while the C terminus is predicted to be intrinsically disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>).</p><p id="P12">As expected, Gene Ontology analysis revealed that eIF2A interactors are enriched in translational regulation, along with other biological processes such as stress granule assembly, RNA catabolic processes and ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>). Notably, STRING-db (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>) analysis suggested that some of the eIF2A interactors form protein complexes linked to stress granule assembly and ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), such as the G3BP1, G3BP2, USP10 and CAPRIN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A-C</xref>), raising the possibility of a broader function of eIF2A within these complexes.</p><p id="P13">Using a stringent double cutoff of BFDR &lt; 0.1 and SaintScore &gt; 0.7, we identified a total of 17 high-confidence interactors, 10 of which were specific to the N-terminus. G3BP1, CAPRIN1 and USP10 were among the strongest interactors of eIF2A, irrespective of stress. G3BP1, CAPRIN1 and USP10 are key stress granule nucleating proteins responsible for the formation of these membrane-less organelles during stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). In addition, G3BP1 and USP10 are part of the deubiquitinase complex to rescue 40S ribosomes stalled in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Furthermore, eIF2A strongly interacted with SERBP1, a protein known to play a role in maintaining ribosome dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>) and previously shown to interact with eIF2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Among the strong interactors, we also identified the two ubiquitin-associated proteins UBAP2 and UBAP2L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D-H</xref>). UBAP2 can trigger phase separation, as shown in the context of purinosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). UBAP2 and UBAP2L may also regulate ubiquitination and degradation of cellular complexes such as RNA polymerase II following UV-radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). UBAP2L, on the other hand, binds to G3BP1 in stress granule assembly and fusion of UBAP2L to RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas9 can strongly enhance global translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). Furthermore, another eIF2A interactor, PYM1, binds 40S ribosomes as well as exon-junction complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>). Finally, eIF2A interacted with several proteins associated with cancer-related processes such as MTDH, SPATS2 and RRBP1. MTDH (metadherin) has been widely implicated in cancer progression and acts as an RNA-binding protein to confer survival under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). SPATS2 (spermatogenesis-associated serine rich 2), another RNA-binding protein, has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>), whereas RRBP1, an ER-membrane protein that mediates mRNA localization and modulates ER stress, is associated with increased aggressiveness across several tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To confirm the TurboID-based proximity labeling interactions, we used orthogonal methods and performed co-immunopurification of endogenous eIF2A with G3BP1 or SERBP1 in SCC cells. To rule out cell-type-specific effects, we additionally validated our findings in HEK 293T cells throughout this study. eIF2A interacted with G3BP1 and SERBP1 in wild-type cells under both basal and stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Given that G3BP1 is a key protein involved in stress granule formation, we further investigated the cellular localization of eIF2A under stress. eIF2A did not affect stress granules formation, as <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> cells retained the ability to form G3BP1 foci under stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>). We observed partial co-localization of endogenous eIF2A with G3BP1 in unstressed cells; however, although eIF2A was present in stress granules upon stress, its signal did not specifically enrich in stress granules but also remained cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6A-B</xref>). Furthermore, eIF2A did not exclusively localize to stress granules even after prolonged stress exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Together, these findings validate the eIF2A interactions identified in our TurboID experiments and suggest that eIF2A may contribute to translational regulation beyond its assumed role in translation initiation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Selective 40S ribosomal proximity labeling reveals interaction with RQC factors</title><p id="P16">Several studies have reported interactions between eIF2A and the 40S ribosomal subunit, including evidence from <italic>in vitro</italic> translation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Thus, we were surprised that we did not detect any ribosomal proteins or initiation factors as interactors of eIF2A in our proximity biotinylation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D-H</xref>). We surmised that the discrepancy might reflect the TurboID approach’s reduced sensitivity to capture transient interactions. Additionally, because TurboID preferentially labels proteins in close proximity, eIF2A might associate indirectly with the 40S ribosome within larger complexes, potentially reducing labeling efficiency due to longer spatial distances. Consistent with the possibility of transient 40S interactions, eIF2A predominantly localized to the free ribonucleoprotein (RNP) fraction in polysome gradients in SCC cells, with lower association to the 40S fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This implies that interactions identified by our TurboID approach may primarily originate from the free RNP complexes, potentially missing more transient associations with the 40S ribosome.</p><p id="P17">To investigate potential eIF2A interactions with the 40S ribosome, we performed selective 40S-TurboID proximity labeling combined with label-free mass spectrometry in our TurboID::eIF2A and tGFP::TurboID-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Following biotinylation, we isolated 40S and 80S (both monosomes and polysomes) ribosomal fractions using sucrose density gradient separation, enabling the identification of eIF2A-associated interactors with the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C-H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4C-E</xref>).</p><p id="P18">In the 80S-TurboID proximity labeling, SERBP1 emerged as the single significant interactor in both unstressed and stress conditions, underscoring a robust association with this dormant ribosome factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G-H</xref>). In contrast, assessing the interactions in the 40S fraction, we identified a total of 40 eIF2A interactors (BFDR &lt; 0.1) in unstressed and stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C, 3E-F</xref>). Of those, 33 were among the strong interactors (SAINTScore &gt; 0.7). First, as in the classic TurboID approach, we observed a strong interaction with G3BP1, CAPRIN1 and SERBP1. Notably, with the 40S-TurboID approach, we also identified 48S ribosome-specific eIF2A interactions. These included RPS2, RPS3, RPS10, RPS20 and RPSA, as well as the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 subunits eIF3A, eIF3E, and eIF3G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C, 3E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4D</xref>). We selected RPS3 for further validation using orthogonal assays and confirmed its robust association with eIF2A by co-immunopurification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>).</p><p id="P19">These results were interesting for several reasons. First, RPS2, RPS3, RPS10, RPS20, as well as initiation factors eIF3A, eIF3E, and eIF3G, are all located close to the mRNA entry channel of the 40S ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J-K</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>). Thus, our data imply that the N terminus of eIF2A may interact with the 40S ribosome close to the mRNA entry channel. This notion is consistent with recent enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) data showing that eIF2A robustly interacts with regions of the 18S rRNA between helices 21es6B and 21es6C, situated near the mRNA entry channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Second, RPS2, RPS3, RPS10 and RPS20 are well-established targets of regulatory ubiquitination during the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway following ribosome stalling and collision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>), prompting us to consider whether eIF2A participates in RQC. Of note, in co-immunopurification experiments, we identified a ubiquitinated form of RPS3 under stress, indicating activation of the RQC pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>). Interestingly, stress-induced RPS3 ubiquitination was markedly reduced in <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> cells compared to parental controls (~85% reduction in Ub-RPS3:RPS3 ratio), suggesting a possible defect in the RQC pathway upon stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>, input lane). Third, two of the key eIF2A interactors, G3BP1 and USP10, are required for the deubiquitination of RPS2, RPS3 and RPS10 to rescue ubiquitinated 40S subunits stalled in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Given that these observations hinted at a role beyond translation initiation, we first set out to formally exclude a contribution of eIF2A to initiation in our system. Recent ribosome profiling experiments in yeast and human cells supported the notion that eIF2A plays only a minor role in translation initiation, with relatively few transcripts showing altered translation profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). To further assess whether eIF2A contributes to scanning and translation initiation in our system, we performed 40S-specific ribosome profiling using translation complex profiling (TCP-seq) in parental and <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> SCC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>). The 40S metagene profiles of parental and <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> SCC cells were largely indistinguishable in unstressed and stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-B</xref>). Furthermore, differential 40S footprint analysis in the 5´UTR revealed only a small number of transcripts with differential reads in the 5´UTR, excluding the arguably best-studied uORF-regulated gene <italic>Atf4</italic>, which showed no significant changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C-D</xref>). Moreover, only 2 transcripts showed differential footprints in the 5´UTR when comparing stress versus unstressed conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Of note, proteomics analysis in <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> SCC cells revealed also only a modest number of differentially expressed proteins in homeostasis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In summary, these data support the view that eIF2A plays a minor role in translation initiation but may instead be involved in the RQC pathway, potentially regulating the deubiquitination of stalled 40S ribosomes through its association with G3BP1-USP10 complexes.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>eIF2A impacts ribosome-associated quality control during stress</title><p id="P22">To assess whether eIF2A is involved in the RQC pathway, we performed collision and stalling assays by treating cells with either sodium arsenite or anisomycin. Anisomycin induces ribosome collisions at intermediate doses and ribosome stalling at higher doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>). Since the RQC pathway has been extensively studied in HEK 293T cells, we included both SCCs and HEK 293T cells in our experiments to validate these observations across cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7F</xref>). Following stress, we monitored RPS3 ubiquitination by western blotting as a marker of RQC activation. As expected, RPS3 was ubiquitinated in parental cells in response to both intermediate and high doses of anisomycin, as well as upon sodium arsenite treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Notably, <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> cells showed a pronounced reduction in RPS3 ubiquitination across all stress conditions compared to parental cells, as quantified from three independent replicates in both SCC and HEK 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7A-E</xref>). This result aligned with the reduced RPS3 ubiquitination observed in our co-immunopurification blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>). The reduction was most prominent following high-dose anisomycin treatment, with HEK 293T <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> cells showing virtually no increase in RPS3 ubiquitination upon stalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-B</xref>), indicating that eIF2A may specifically impact RPS3 ubiquitination upon ribosome stalling rather than following ribosome collision. Furthermore, employing sucrose density gradient fractionation in high-dose anisomycin and arsenite-treated cells showed that the ubiquitinated RPS3 is mainly found in the 40S fraction, with little RPS3 ubiquitination in the polysome fractions. As expected, <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> cells showed a marked reduction of ubiquitinated RPS3 specifically in the 40S fraction upon ribosome stalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Moreover, we observed a similar reduction in RPS2 ubiquitination in <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> cells, which was also most pronounced upon high-dose anisomycin-dependent ribosome stalling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8A-B</xref>). Our findings therefore pointed to a model in which eIF2A interacts with G3BP1–USP10 complexes to either promote the ubiquitination of RPS2 and RPS3 or antagonize their deubiquitination by USP10.</p><p id="P23">We therefore sought to systematically investigate the potential involvement of eIF2A in the different arms of the RQC pathway. First, we assessed ZNF598-dependent ribosome collision sensing, one of eIF2A’s low-confidence interactors (BFDR &lt; 0.2 and SAINTScore &lt; 0.7), which detects ribosome collisions and triggers the downstream RQC response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>). We employed collision-inducing luciferase reporters, which previously led to rapid transcript degradation in wild-type but not in <italic>ZNF598 knockout</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). However, in contrast to the loss of ZNF598, <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> HEK 293T cells failed to increase the expression of the collision-inducing luciferase reporter, suggesting that eIF2A functions in the RQC pathway through a mechanism distinct from ZNF598-mediated collision sensing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8C</xref>). This observation was consistent with our finding that eIF2A may primarily influence RQC in response to ribosome stalling rather than collision. Second, we focused on RNF10, which ubiquitinates RPS2 and RPS3 upon stalling of elongating ribosomes or scanning 40S ribosomes in the context of initiation RQC (iRQC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>). Since the mechanism of RNF10 recruitment to the 40S ribosome remains unknown, we asked whether eIF2A could mediate its recruitment to stalled ribosomes. To test this hypothesis, we used a doxycycline-inducible FLAG-HA tagged RNF10 overexpression construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>). As expected, overexpression of RNF10 in HEK 293T cells increased ubiquitinated RPS3 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>). However, we observed no apparent difference between parental and <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> cells, suggesting that eIF2A acts either downstream or in parallel of RNF10-mediated RPS3 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8D</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Third, we focused on the two key eIF2A interactors, G3BP1 and USP10, which act downstream of RNF10-dependent 40S subunit ubiquitination. While G3BP1 serves as a scaffold, USP10 acts as the deubiquitinase for RPS2 and RPS3 to rescue stalled 40S subunits from degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>). Given the close interaction of eIF2A with USP10, we considered two possible scenarios in which eIF2A either directly or indirectly antagonizes USP10 function. In the first scenario, eIF2A acts directly on USP10 to antagonize RPS3 deubiquitination upon stalling, in which case double <italic>USP10; eIF2A knockout</italic> cells would not reduce the <italic>USP10 knockout</italic> phenotype (as its function would depend on USP10). Or eIF2A indirectly antagonizes USP10-dependent RPS3 deubiquitination, in which case double <italic>USP10; eIF2A knockout</italic> cells should show reduced RPS3 ubiquitination compared to USP10 mutants (similar to RNF10; USP10 double mutants showing strongly reduced RPS3 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>)). We therefore generated CRISPR-mediated <italic>Usp10; eIF2A double knockout</italic> SCC cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8E-F</xref>). While the loss of USP10 resulted - as expected - in increased RPS3 ubiquitination, we observed no obvious reduction between parental and <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8E</xref>). Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>), sodium arsenite reduced RPS3 ubiquitination in <italic>Usp10 knockout</italic> cells as well as in <italic>Usp10; eIF2A double knockout</italic> SCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8E</xref>). These findings support a working model wherein eIF2A may directly oppose USP10-mediated deubiquitination of RPS3.</p><p id="P25">Fourth, we tested a potential preferential involvement of eIF2A in iRQC. <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> cells displayed, comparable to anisomycin treatment, a 50-70% reduction in ubiquitinated RPS3 following the translation initiation inhibitor harringtonine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9A-B</xref>), suggesting that eIF2A also impacts stalled ribosomes during iRQC. Finally, to confirm eIF2A-dependent changes in RPS3 ubiquitination upon ribosome stalling, we stably expressed eIF2A by lentiviral transduction of a V5-tagged eIF2A construct and monitored RPS3 ubiquitination in unstressed and anisomycin-treated conditions. As expected, RPS3 ubiquitination upon anisomycin was reduced in <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> HEK 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Interestingly, rescuing eIF2A expression in unstressed <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> cells was already sufficient to increase RPS3 ubiquitination, suggesting that eIF2A re-expression may be sufficient to block USP10-mediated deubiquitination of low levels of physiological ribosome stalling events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Furthermore, upon anisomycin treatment, eIF2A rescue showed clearly increased RPS3 ubiquitination compared to parental or <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Collectively, this systematic investigation, together with our TurboID data, suggest a working model wherein eIF2A may closely interact with G3BP1-USP10 complexes to antagonize USP10-dependent RPS3 deubiquitination upon ribosome stalling.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>eIF2A facilitates faster ribosomal protein turnover</title><p id="P26">The balance between RNF10 and USP10 during ribosome stalling plays a critical role in maintaining translation dynamics.

However, in homeostasis, the excess of USP10 over RNF10 favors the deubiquitination and rescue of 40S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>), preventing energetically costly degradation of ribosomal subunits. <italic>USP10 knockout</italic> or RNF10 overexpressing cells enhance 40S ribosomal degradation and turnover rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>). Thus, our working model would predict that <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> cells shift the balance toward slower turnover of 40S subunits upon stalling.</p><p id="P27">To systematically examine whether eIF2A impacts ribosomal protein turnover rates, we performed dynamic SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture) mass spectrometry in SCC and HEK 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>). Parental and <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> cells were grown in light isotope-labeled media. We then switched to heavy isotope-labeled media along with low-dose sodium arsenite stress in a time course over 48 hours, allowing us to track protein turnover of newly synthesized (heavy isotope labeled) compared to degraded (light isotope labeled) proteins by LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>). We found that <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> cells did not majorly alter global protein turnover, as highlighted by comparable heavy:light ratios at the 24-hour time point or even slightly increased turnover at earlier time intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B, 6E</xref>). In contrast, within the cohort of 40S ribosomal proteins, <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> SCCs showed strongly reduced heavy:light ratios compared to parental cells, suggesting a reduced protein turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C, 6F</xref>). This effect was specific to 40S ribosomal proteins, with no significant changes observed in other related protein groups, such as eukaryotic initiation factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D, 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S10A-C</xref>). We confirmed these findings using median normalization across both dynamic SILAC replicates and similarly observed significantly reduced 40S turnover rates when combining the two dynamic SILAC datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6H</xref>). In agreement with these observations, the 40S ribosomal protein half-lives were significantly increased in <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> SCCs, further supporting reduced protein turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6I</xref>).</p><p id="P28">To extend our findings, we performed similar dynamic SILAC experiments in HEK 293T cells. An advantage of using HEK 293T was that it enables a steady-state condition upon medium switch from light to heavy, which was not achievable in SCC cells due to differing medium requirements (hence, no unstressed condition could be achieved in SCC). We therefore applied unstressed and low-dose sodium arsenite conditions over a 24-hour time course. In agreement with the SCC data, although HEK 293T protein turnover showed higher variance, 40S ribosomal turnover was also reduced in <italic>eIF2A knockout</italic> cells in stress but not in homeostasis, indicating that eIF2A specifically impacts 40S turnover in stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S10D-E</xref>). Collectively, these findings in SCC and HEK 293T cells suggest that eIF2A specifically facilitates 40S subunit turnover under stress.</p><p id="P29">Finally, given that higher eIF2A transcript levels were associated with shorter overall survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), we investigated whether ubiquitination of small ribosomal proteins in the context of RQC was generally altered in cancer patients. Among the available proteogenomic cancer datasets, only the one in lung squamous cell carcinoma included data on the ubiquitylproteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>). Comparing specifically the ubiquitylproteome of tumor and healthy tissues, we found that RPS2, RPS3 and RPS10 but not RPS20 showed significantly higher overall ubiquitination levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). Given that lysine 214 (K214) on RPS3 is the crucial residue of monoubiquitination during RQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>), we next examined site-specific changes. Interestingly, while the majority of residues showed no difference, ubiquitination at RPS3 K214 was markedly increased in cancer samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Furthermore, increased RNF10 levels, which may enhance the capacity to flag stalled ribosomes similar to eIF2A, correlated with shorter overall survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). These findings hint at a potentially broader involvement of RQC-dependent 40S turnover in the context of cancer progression and warrant further exploration of the role of ribosome-associated quality control in tumorigenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P30">Although discovered over five decades ago and implicated in various alternative initiation mechanisms and diseases, the molecular function of eIF2A has remained unclear. Here, we employed an unbiased TurboID-based proximity biotinylation strategy to map the interactome of eIF2A in homeostasis and stress. We identify a surprising functional association between the alternative initiation factor eIF2A and 40S subunit turnover in the context of ribosome-associated quality control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Protein production is one of the most energetically expensive processes in the cell. Eukaryotic cells have developed surveillance mechanisms that recognize and resolve ribosomes stalled on defective mRNAs, thereby maintaining translation fidelity. While collided ribosomes are marked by ZNF598, the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF10 initiates site-specific monoubiquitination of RPS2 and RPS3 upon stalling to flag 40S subunits for programmed degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>). G3BP1-USP10 complexes can rescue 40S ribosomes from degradation in homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>). Our findings suggest a working model wherein eIF2A interacts with G3BP1-USP10 complexes to counteract the deubiquitination and rescue of 40S subunits from otherwise programmed degradation.</p><p id="P32">Several lines of experimental evidence support a direct functional link between eIF2A and G3BP1-USP10 complexes in RQC. First, G3BP1 and USP10 consistently emerged as key interactors of eIF2A throughout our TurboID experiments. Second, zooming into the interaction with the 40S subunit, eIF2A interacted with the 40S proteins near the mRNA entry channel, including proximity to RPS2 and RPS3. Of note, eIF2A is a structural homolog of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF3B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C</xref>), raising the possibility that eIF2A could replace eIF3B once it dissociates from 80S following translation initiation and early elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>). Third, loss of eIF2A resulted in reduced RPS3 ubiquitination upon ribosome stalling in both SCC and HEK 293T cells. Fourth, USP10 was required for the reduction in RPS3 monoubiquitination in <italic>eIF2A knockouts</italic> during stalling. Finally, loss of eIF2A resulted in markedly reduced 40S subunit turnover under stress in both SCC and HEK 293T cells. Collectively, our data support a model wherein eIF2A binds G3BP1-USP10 complexes to regulate RPS2 and RPS3 deubiquitination in response to ribosome stalling, effectively shifting the balance of the RQC pathway toward 40S subunit degradation. Our model is consistent with recent eCLIP data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), which revealed that eIF2A predominantly binds coding sequences rather than 5´UTRs, in line with a role in RQC and subunit turnover rather than canonical initiation.</p><p id="P33">We can currently only speculate about the functional advantage of such a system. However, the capacity to regulate 40S deubiquitination and rescue may confer multiple potential benefits under specific cellular conditions. In homeostasis, the excess of USP10 relative to RNF10 ensures that deubiquitination is favored over degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>), which may avoid energetically costly subunit degradation. Although ribosome repair remains poorly studied, USP10 inhibition by eIF2A may provide cells with additional time to complete repair processes on RNA and ribosomes, particularly under cellular stress conditions. In this scenario, inhibition of eIF2A may result in the translation of aberrant mRNAs and the accumulation of faulty 40S ribosomes. In the context of iRQC, eIF2A may also act to delay re-initiation, potentially providing time for ternary complex acquisition, which is a process that could be particularly relevant under stress conditions marked by elevated levels of phosphorylated eIF2α. In this setting, as stalled preinitiation complexes are thought to eventually transition into elongating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>), loss of eIF2A may lead to premature or aberrant re-initiation events.</p><p id="P34">Recent ribosome profiling experiments in yeast and human HeLa cells indicated that eIF2A has minimal impact on global translation, with only a few transcripts showing differential translation in homeostasis or following stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). Consistently, despite eIF2A’s critical role in early stages of tumor formation, its loss had minimal effects on translation in SCC cells in homeostasis <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Our current selective 40S profiling data reinforce the notion that eIF2A is not a major player in translation initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Given the identified link to 40S ribosome rescue in the context of RQC, it is perhaps not surprising that eIF2A depletion does not broadly alter the translational landscapes, as alterations in 40S turnover may not preferentially affect specific transcripts but rather contribute to global ribosome homeostasis. These downstream effects may only become apparent under conditions of chronic or low-level stress as opposed to short-term stress. Of note, pronounced eIF2A-dependent gene expression changes were observed in long-term pulsed SILAC under mild stress conditions, revealing over 350 differentially synthesized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>).</p><p id="P35">Interestingly, elevated levels of both RNF10 and eIF2A are associated with shorter overall survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>).

These findings suggest heightened ribosome stalling or collision events in cancer and raise the possibility that RNF10-mediated 40S flagging, coupled with eIF2A-dependent inhibition of rapid 40S rescue, may provide a selective advantage to tumor cells.

All liquid was thoroughly removed and cells were lysed in 500 μl lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH=7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% NP40, 35 μM cycloheximide, 1% TritonX-100). Lysates were incubated on ice for 5 minutes, spun down 5 minutes at 20,000 x g at 4 °C and supernatants were collected. 300 μl of the lysates were treated with 4 μl RNase I for 20 minutes at room temperature and subsequently run over a 10-50% sucrose gradient. Fractions corresponding to the 40S ribosomal subunit were collected and pooled to obtain an approx. volume of 500 μl sample. Samples were treated with 55 μl crosslink removal solution (10% SDS, 100 mM EDTA pH=8, 50 mM DTT) and 600 μl Acid-Phenol-Chloroform for 45 minutes at 65°C vigorously shaking. Afterwards, samples were cooled down on ice and spun down 5 minutes at 20,000 x g at 4°C. The upper aqueous phase was collected, mixed with 3 volumes of Trizol LS and 4 vol 100% ethanol and 40S footprints were isolated using the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Kit.</p><p id="P77">80S Ribosome profiling: Cells were briefly washed with ice cold wash buffer (35 μM cycloheximide in 1x PBS), all liquid was thoroughly removed and samples flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were lysed in 500 μl lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH=7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% NP40, 35 μM cycloheximide, 1% TritonX-100, 2 U/μl TurboDNase). Lysates were incubated on ice for 5 minutes, spun down 5 minutes at 20,000 x g at 4 °C and supernatants were collected. 150 μl of the lysates were treated with 2 μl RNase I for 45 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 4 μl SUPERase Inhibitor and placing the samples on ice. 80S footprints were subsequently isolated using Illustra MicroSpin S-400 HR columns, mixed with 3 volumes of Trizol LS and 4 vol 100% ethanol and purified using the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Kit.</p><p id="P78">40S and 80S Ribo-seq libraries were prepared largely following the protocol by McGlincy &amp; Ingolia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>). Briefly, ribosome footprints were excised and extracted from a 15% TBE-Urea gel; 80S: size range 20-35 nts; 40S: size range 20-80 nts. Samples were subjected to an end-healing reaction for 1 hour at 37 °C and linkers ligated for 3 hours at 22 °C (for details see McGlincy &amp; Ingolia (2017)). Ribosomal RNA was depleted using custom biotinylated rRNA depletion oligos and MyOne Streptavidin dynabeads. Reverse transcription was performed using SuperScript IV. cDNA was excised and extracted from a 15% TBE-Urea gel and circularized using CircLigase II for 1 hour at 60 °C. cDNA was amplified using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase using an individual index per sample and purified over an 8% TBE gel (for details see McGlincy &amp; Ingolia (2017)).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS205881-suppement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d44aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S35"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Aitor Garzia, Cindy Meyer and the Tuschl lab for discussions and sharing reagents, Tess Branon and the Ting lab for discussing the TurboID experimental design, Sendoel lab members for critical input on the manuscript, Witold Wolski, Antje Dittmann, Tobias Kockmann and the FGCZ for proteomics sample processing and data analysis, Catharine Aquino and the FGCZ for sequencing.

L fraction for each protein was calculated from H/L ratios using the formula L/(H+L) = 1/(1+H/L). The resulting L fraction values were then fitted to an exponential decay function L/(H+L) = exp(-kt), where k is the rate constant and t is time. Curve fitting was performed using the curve_fit function from the scipy Python library, requiring a minimum of three time points with complete data for each protein. Finally, protein half-lives were determined as ln(2)/k. <bold>(J)</bold> Boxplots showing the median-normalized and combined H/L ratio of unstressed and low-dose arsenite (5 <italic>μ</italic>M) stressed HEK 293T over a time course of 24 hours.
