Plant-pathogen interactions are influenced by this rhythmic cycle and a functioning circadian clock is essential for eQective resistance to pathogens. In this study we investigate the relationship between PAMP-triggered immune signalling and the circadian clock in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. We found that early PAMP-triggered immune responses including flg22-induced <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels and the flg22-induced ROS burst are enhanced at subjective dusk rather than subjective dawn. Overexpression of clock gene <italic>TOC1</italic> supressed these defence responses to flg22 and resulted in increased susceptibility to <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>. Additionally, treatment with flg22 and elf18 altered the rhythmicity of <italic>CCA1</italic> and <italic>TOC1</italic>. These results contribute to the currently small amount of research investigating the interactions between the circadian clock and PAMP-triggered immunity. Importantly, we establish the detrimental eQect of <italic>TOC1</italic> overexpression on PAMP-triggered defence responses. Further investigation into how clock components regulate early immune responses is essential for improving our understanding of plant health.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Plants, like most eukaryotic organisms on earth, are subject to the roughly 24- hour cycle of day and night. The rhythmic environmental changes caused by this cycle can drastically alter many plant processes. Prediction of environmental changes, due to their rhythmic nature, allows organisms to prepare physiologically or behaviourally to benefit their survival. The circadian clock is an internal timekeeping mechanism that has developed to synchronise organisms with the rhythmic changes in their surroundings caused by the day-night cycle. Environmental cues, such as light or temperature feed into the circadian clock, entraining it to the environment. The clock, in turn, regulates outputs such as gene expression, metabolism, physiology and behavioural processes in roughly 24-hour rhythms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the circadian clock consists of multiple interconnected transcriptional-translational feedback loops, in which circadian components activate or repress each other’s activity in a cyclical manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The central loop of the clock consists of the dawn expressed MYB-related transcription factors <italic>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY)</italic> and the evening expressed <italic>TIMING OF CAB2 EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1</italic>). <italic>CCA1</italic> and <italic>LHY</italic> act as transcriptional repressors of <italic>TOC1</italic> and of other central clock genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. <italic>TOC1</italic> also acts as a general transcriptional repressor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Expanding upon the central loop, <italic>PSEUDO-REPONSE REGULATORs (PRRs) 9, 7</italic> and <italic>5</italic> are expressed sequentially throughout the day followed by <italic>TOC1</italic> (also referred to as <italic>PRR1</italic>).

Also peaking in expression later in the day, is the Evening Complex (EC) consisting of <italic>EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3), ELF4</italic> and <italic>LUX</italic>. The EC acts as a transcriptional repressor of <italic>PRRs</italic> and <italic>LUX</italic> while being repressed by <italic>TOC1</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.

Prediction of environmental changes and potential dangers is essential if plants are to maximise the eQicient use of their limited resources. One important system that the clock coordinates is plant innate immunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Plants have evolved a two-layer innate immune system to detect and defend against pathogen attacks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The first layer of the immune system is triggered upon recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) leading to PAMP triggered immunity (PTI). PAMPs are usually highly conserved components found across whole classes of pathogens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Pathogen recognition receptors at the plasma membrane such as FLS2 detect PAMPs such as flagellin from pathogens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Upon detecting flagellin, FLS2 forms a receptor complex with BRASSINOSTERIOD INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1), resulting in the phosphorylation of both FLS2 and BAK1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. This triggers the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) which drive the expression of <italic>WRKY</italic> transcription factors and early defence genes such as <italic>FLG22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 1 (FRK1)</italic> within the nucleus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Alongside this pathway, the plant cell responds to PAMP detection with an influx of calcium ions, stomatal closure, callose deposition and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Together, these responses lead to resistance to the detected pathogen.</p><p id="P6">Current research has demonstrated significant circadian regulation of PTI signalling pathway components. In an analysis of publicly available microarray datasets, Bhardwaj et al. (2011) found that pathogen recognition receptor genes <italic>FLS2</italic> and <italic>EFR1</italic> alongside some <italic>MAPK</italic> genes displayed circadian expression patterns under basal conditions. Korneli et al. (2014) found that PAMP-induced expression of <italic>FRK1</italic> was higher at subjective dawn than subjective dusk. Furthermore, Korneli et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> found that PTI-induced production of ROS was higher in the subjective morning versus the subjective evening suggesting circadian control of this process. Basal ROS production and the transcriptional regulation of ROS genes has been shown to be regulated by the circadian clock, with <italic>CCA1</italic> indicated to be key to this relationship <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Research has also described reciprocal alteration of circadian rhythms by PTI signalling.

We aimed to investigate the role of core clock genes <italic>CCA1</italic> and <italic>TOC1</italic> in early immune responses, including PAMP-triggered <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels and the PAMP-tiggered ROS burst. Additionally, we were interested in how this translated to overall susceptibility to infection with <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>.

Following detection of flg22 by pathogen recognition receptor <italic>FLS2</italic>, a cascade of responses results in transcriptional reprogramming for a defence response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Bhardwaj et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> found that <italic>FLS2, EFR</italic>, some MAPK genes and some WRKY transcription factor genes involved in this cascade were rhythmically expressed. To examine the PAMP-induced immune pathway further, we investigated whether the transcript levels of PAMP-induced defence gene <italic>FRK1</italic> exhibited any rhythms. In a single repeat experiment, we measured <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels in wild type plants by sampling every 2 hours for two days. Basal <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels exhibited visual rhythmicity, with peak transcript levels occurring during the subjective day (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). This suggests potential circadian regulation of basal <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels. In a tandem experiment, we treated plants with 1 μM flg22 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>) or 1 μM elf18 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1b</xref>) at 2-hour intervals. We found that flg22-induced <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels were also visually rhythmic, however, peak transcript levels occurred during the subjective night. We did not observe rhythmic elf18-induced <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels. Rhythmicity analysis of the mean <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript level for each treatment was assessed using the eJTK algorithm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. This analysis revealed that flg22-induced <italic>FKR1</italic> transcript levels are significantly rhythmic (p= 0.02, eJTK_cycle). However, mock and elf18-induced <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels are not significantly rhythmic. These results indicate that the circadian clock may gate flg22-induced <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels, with responsiveness peaking in the subjective evening and during the subject night. However, more repeats would need to be carried out to confirm rhythmicity or lack thereof in elicitor-induced <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels.</p><p id="P10">To further investigate potential clock regulation of the flg22-induced immune pathway, we compared flg22-induced <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels at subjective dawn versus dusk in wild type (<italic>Col-0</italic>), arrhythmic <italic>CCA1ox</italic> plants, arrhythmic <italic>TOC1ox</italic> plants, short period <italic>cca1lhy</italic> mutants and short period <italic>toc1-101</italic> mutants. As expected, wild type plants displayed higher flg22-induced <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels at subjective dusk versus dawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Higher flg22-induced <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels at subjective dusk were not consistently observed in either <italic>CCA1ox</italic> or <italic>cca1lhy</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This suggests that alteration of clock gene rhythms through <italic>CCA1</italic> aQects the temporal diQerence in flg22-induced <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels. Interestingly, <italic>TOC1ox</italic> plants displayed significantly reduced <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels at both dawn and dusk after flg22 treatment compared to <italic>Col-0. toc1-101</italic> plants did not show consistently higher flg22-induced <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels at subjective dusk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Additionally, <italic>toc-101</italic> plants displayed inconsistent flg22-inuded <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels compared to <italic>Col</italic>-0, especially at subjective dusk. This disruption could be due to the short period phenotype of <italic>toc1-101</italic> mutants. The low flg22-induced <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels in <italic>TOC1ox</italic> suggests that the overexpression of <italic>TOC1</italic> supresses this response of PTI. Further investigation of the flg22-induced defence pathway found that <italic>TOC1ox</italic> plants displayed very little change in transcript levels of <italic>FLS2</italic> after treatment with flg22. <italic>Col-0</italic> and <italic>CCA1ox</italic> plants exhibited significantly increased transcript levels of <italic>FLS2</italic> after flg22 treatment, with <italic>CCA1</italic> displaying significantly higher flg22-induced <italic>FLS2</italic> transcript levels compared to <italic>Col-0</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).

We measured the ROS burst after treatment with flg22 in <italic>Col-0, CCA1ox, cca1lhy, TOC1ox</italic> and <italic>toc1-101</italic> plants at subjective dawn and dusk. We found that the magnitude of the ROS burst was larger at subjective dusk versus dawn in <italic>Col-0</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a, d</xref>).

In a similar experiment, we found that the transcript levels of flg22 pathogen recognition receptor <italic>FLS2</italic> were significantly elevated following flg22 treatment in <italic>Col-0</italic> and <italic>CCA1ox</italic> plants but not in <italic>TOC1ox</italic> plants. <italic>toc1-101</italic> plants did not exhibit consistently higher flg22-induced <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels at subjective dusk. This disruption, like the disruption observed in <italic>cca1lhy</italic> mutants, could be due to the short period exhibited by these mutants. Furthermore, the <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels after flg22 treatment in <italic>toc1-101</italic> plants were not hugely diQerent to <italic>Col-0</italic>. Additionally, ChIP-Seq data indicates that TOC1 does not directly bind <italic>FLS2</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Together, this suggests that <italic>TOC1</italic> is not directly responsible for the suppression of <italic>FRK1</italic> and <italic>FLS2</italic> in response to flg22 treatment, but rather its overexpression has regulatory eQects on some other component that controls the expression of these PTI genes. Additionally, levels of flg22-induced <italic>FLS2</italic> transcript in <italic>CCA1</italic> were consistently higher than those observed in <italic>Col-0</italic>. This could suggest that the overexpression of <italic>CCA1</italic> promotes flg22-induced responses, however this was not a result we observed in the rest of our data.</p><p id="P21">In addition to circadian regulation of early defence genes, we demonstrate circadian regulation of the ROS burst in response to flg22 treatment. Wild type (<italic>Col-0</italic>) plants produced a larger ROS burst when challenged with flg22 at subjective dusk compared to subjective dawn. This distinct diQerence in response was observed in <italic>cca1lhy</italic> mutants but not in <italic>CCA1ox</italic> plants. Interestingly, we did not observe any flg22-induced ROS burst in <italic>TOC1ox</italic> plants at either dawn or dusk. These results again indicate that the flg22-induced early immune response is stronger at subjective dusk than subjective dawn. It appears that only arrhythmicity of the clock through overexpression of <italic>CCA1</italic> and not loss of <italic>CCA1</italic> disrupts the diQerence in the response of the ROS burst between subjective dawn and dusk. Lai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> found that <italic>CCA1ox</italic> plants had lower basal ROS levels and attenuated induction of ROS genes in response to oxidative stress. This suppression of overall ROS activity by the overexpression of <italic>CCA1</italic> could be causing the loss of the larger ROS burst at dusk that we observe in wild type (<italic>Col-0</italic>). The complete lack of a ROS burst response to flg22 in <italic>TOC1ox</italic> plants suggests that overexpression of <italic>TOC1</italic> also supresses this early defence response. As <italic>toc1-101</italic> does not appear to diQer from wild type in phenotype, this suggests again that it is not direct suppression by <italic>TOC1</italic> but indirect suppression through another element of the clock that <italic>TOC1</italic> negatively regulates. Korneli et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> also found circadian control of the flg22 induced ROS burst, however they reported that ROS production was higher in plants challenged in the subjective morning versus subjective evening. This result diQers to ours, possibly due to significant diQerences in methodology: they cut leaf disks only 6 hours before treatment. Research has shown that damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) may induce increased levels of ROS production for up to 6 hours after damage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. To avoid this problem, we cut leaf disks 24 hours before treatment. Korneli et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> furthermore found that arrhythmicity of the clock abolished the distinct diQerence in levels of ROS production between morning and evening through analysis of <italic>lux</italic> plants which display reduced rhythmicity of clock genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. <italic>LUX</italic> is a member of the evening complex (EC), which is negatively regulated by <italic>TOC1</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, it may be worth investigating other elements of the EC as candidates for regulation of the flg22-induced ROS burst and other flg22-induced PTI responses, as they are regulated by <italic>TOC1</italic>. Alongside Lai et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, other research has also shown circadian clock involvement in oxidative stress tolerance and ROS production <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, suggesting an extensive involvement of the clock in ROS homeostasis. Overall, our results continue to indicate that the clock enhances elements of the PTI response to flg22 at subjective dusk/night and that the overexpression of <italic>TOC1</italic> has hugely detrimental eQects on flg22-induced early defence responses.</p><p id="P22">PTI pathways involve rapid responses, some of which we have investigated in this study; the peak of the ROS burst occurs within 10 minutes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and increased transcript levels of early immune genes can be detected within 1 hour <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. These are specific responses to PAMP detection that function together to defend the plant against infection. To determine the cumulative eQects of clock interference with these processes, it is useful to observe later immune responses such as susceptibility to infection. However, the later actions of PTI are more diQicult to investigate, as the pathogen attempts to facilitate infection by injecting eQectors which aQect host susceptibility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. By infecting plants with the <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 <italic>hrcC</italic> mutant and <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 wild type we are able to observe how the clock interacts with PTI during virulent infection with and without manipulation by eQectors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. We observed no diQerence in infection levels between subjective dawn and dusk for <italic>Col-0, CCA1ox</italic> or <italic>TOC1ox</italic> plants infected with <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 <italic>hrcC</italic>, suggesting that there is not clock gating of PAMP triggered resistance at these times. <italic>Col-0</italic> showed increased susceptibility to infection with <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 at subjective dusk compared to dawn. <italic>TOC1ox</italic> plants did not shown any diQerence in infection level between subjective dawn and dusk and were significantly more susceptible to both <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 <italic>hrcC</italic> and <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 compared to <italic>Col-0. CCA1ox</italic> plants displayed inconsistent temporal diQerences in susceptibility to <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000. Bhardwaj et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> similarly found that <italic>Col-0</italic> was most resistant to infection with <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 in the subjective morning and most susceptible during the subjective night. In <italic>CCA1ox</italic> plants and <italic>elf3-1</italic> mutants, both of which are arrhythmic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>, they found that there was no diQerence in susceptibility between subjective morning and night. This suggests that clock arrhythmicity disrupts the increased resistance observed in the subjective morning. Our observations of <italic>CCA1ox</italic> plants were inconsistent, with two repeats displaying temporal diQerences in susceptibility similar to <italic>Col-0</italic> and a final experiment showing no temporal diQerence. There are some diQerences in experimental set up that could have contributed to this discrepancy: Bhardwaj et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> grew plants under 16/8 light/dark conditions and thus had diQerent sample times. Neither our study nor theirs investigates infection levels in <italic>CCA1ox</italic> at multiple regular time points over 24-48 hours. We suggest that levels of <italic>CCA1</italic> are not consistent or regulated in the <italic>CCA1ox</italic> plants and therefore create an inconsistent result between experiments. Therefore, we cannot conclude that resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 in <italic>CCA1ox</italic> is rhythmic or not rhythmic, only that it displays inconsistent temporal diQerences in susceptibility in our study and does not display these diQerences in the study by Bhardwaj et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. On the other hand, our results consistently show the clock does not enhance overall resistance to <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 at subjective dusk, while we do observe increased flg22-induced <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels and a stronger flg22-induced ROS burst at that time. Rather, <italic>Col-0</italic> plants appear to be more susceptible to infection at subjective dusk. In a previous study, we found that <italic>CCA1</italic> expression was essential for SA-induced resistance to <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>manculicola</italic>, suggesting that <italic>CCA1</italic> may be more significantly involved in later SA-induced immunity than PTI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Significantly, <italic>TOC1</italic> overexpression has negative consequences for PTI, with <italic>TOC1ox</italic> plants displaying increased susceptibility to <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 at subjective dawn and increased susceptibility to the <italic>hrcC</italic> mutant at both subjective dawn and dusk. It appears that the overexpression of <italic>TOC1</italic> must disrupt the regulation of multiple components that are essential for PTI. It has been shown that <italic>CCA1</italic> confers heterosis for bacterial defence in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> hybrids (<italic>Col-0</italic> x <italic>Sei-0</italic>) without costs to growth vigour. This suggests that <italic>CCA1</italic> is potentially a positive regulator of immunity, however, it is likely not that simple as this study and our previous study show that immunity to bacterial infection is not improved in plants overexpressing <italic>CCA1</italic> or worsened in plants missing <italic>CCA1</italic> (<italic>cca1lhy</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Similarly, we are not suggesting that <italic>TOC1</italic> is a direct negative regulator of immunity, but that it must be involved in the regulation of an intermediary component and, only when overexpressed, has hugely detrimental eQects on the modulation of PTI immune responses.</p><p id="P23">In the final section of this study, we investigated the eQect of PTI signalling on clock gene rhythms. We found that both flg22 and elf18 induced period shortening of both <italic>CCA1</italic> and <italic>TOC1</italic> rhythms, complementing previous research by <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> that showed flg22-induced period shortening of <italic>CCA1</italic> rhythms. In addition to this, we found that the flg22-induced period shortening was dose dependent, but elf18-induced period shortening was not. These results, combined with the rhythmicity in flg22-induced <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript and lack of rhythmicity in elf18-induced <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels, suggest that there may be a more significant link between the circadian clock and the flg22 recognition pathway compared to the elf18 recognition pathway. We also showed that the elicitor induced period shortening was dependent on the expression of the corresponding pathogen recognition receptor (<italic>FLS2</italic> for flg22 and <italic>EFR</italic> for el18), indicating that without detection at the membrane, these elicitors do not aQect the clock. Together, these results demonstrate that plants might use perception of flg22 levels to modulate the clock according to the magnitude of the detected threat. Similar research investigating the eQect of immune hormone salicylic acid (SA) on the clock has also shown period shortening of clock gene rhythms following SA treatment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. This indicates that various immune signalling pathways may use the circadian clock in a similar way to regulate other cellular processes in order to promote an eQicient defence response.</p><p id="P24">Overall, the work in this study indicates that the circadian clock gates individual flg22-induced early immune responses, resulting in a more severe response to threat in the subjective evening and night versus subjective morning. However, overall susceptibility to infection is increased at subjective dusk compared to dawn. Consistent through all our results, <italic>TOC1</italic> overexpression has a profound eQect on PTI processes. In all cases in this study, overexpression of <italic>TOC1</italic> has resulted in suppression of the PAMP-triggered defence responses observed in wild type plants and increased susceptibility to infection. As no significant response was observed in <italic>toc1-101</italic> mutants, these results indicate that the overexpression of <italic>TOC1</italic> disrupts the activity of other factors controlling immunity that remain rhythmic in the <italic>toc1-101</italic> mutant. To determine the intermediate components, it could be useful to investigate the involvement of clock genes regulated by <italic>TOC1</italic> such as members of the evening complex. We also demonstrate reciprocal regulation of the circadian clock by the PAMP-triggered immune signalling. The findings presented in this study greatly further our understanding of the interplay between the circadian clock and early immune responses. Continued study of how <italic>TOC1</italic> overexpression supresses PAMP-triggered immune responses could aid in uncovering the mechanisms underpinning the regulation of PTI in plants.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p id="P25"><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis)</italic> seeds were sterilised for 5 minutes in 70% ethanol followed by 5 minutes in 20% bleach (0.25% sodium hypochlorite, Cleanline) and washed 3 times in ddH2O.
