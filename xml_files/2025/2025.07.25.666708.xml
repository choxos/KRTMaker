Despite their prevalence, the skin cancer microenvironment remains poorly characterized, both in the outer skin layer where the cancer originates and at the deeper junctional and dermal layers into which it progresses. To address this, we integrated 12 complementary spatial single-cell technologies to construct orthogonally-validated cell signatures, spatial maps, and interactomes for cSCC, BCC, and melanoma. We comprehensively compared and integrated these spatial methods and provided practical guidelines on experimental design. Integrating four spatial transcriptomics platforms, we found keratinocyte cancer signatures, including six consistently validated gene markers. Spatial integration of transcriptomics, proteomics, and glycomics uncovered cancer communities enriched in melanocyte–fibroblast–T-cell colocalization with altered tyrosine and pyrimidine metabolism. Ligand-receptor analysis across &gt;700 cell-type combinations and &gt;1.5 million interactions highlighted key roles for CD44, integrins, and collagens, with CD44-FGF2 emerging as a potential therapeutic target. We consistently found differential interactions of melanocytes with fibroblasts and T-cells. We validated these interactions using Opal Polaris, RNAScope, and Proximal Ligation Assay. To integrate population-scale data, genetic association mapping in &gt;500,000 individuals suggested SNPs enriched for spatial domains containing melanocytes, dysplastic keratinocytes, and fibroblasts, shedding light on functional mechanisms linking genetic heritability to cells within cancer tissue. This publicly available multiomics resource offers insights into the initiation and progression of the most lethal skin cancer (melanoma) and the most common forms (cSCC and BCC) and can be explored interactively at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://skincanceratlas.com">https://skincanceratlas.com</ext-link>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Background</title><p id="P3">Although skin cancer is the most common neoplasm, its major subtypes, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma, are rarely compared at the cellular and molecular level, limiting our understanding of their shared and distinct features. The keratinocyte cancers basal cell carcinoma (BCC; ~75-80%) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC; ~20%), are the most prevalent malignancies. Though they have low mortality rates, their high incidence results in substantial public health burdens, with ~3.5 million cases treated annually in the U.S. at a cost of ~$4.8 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Rogers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Guy et al., 2015</xref>). About a third of skin cancer-related deaths in Australia are due to keratinocyte cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Czarnecki, 2024</xref>). In contrast, melanomas account for less than 10% of diagnosed skin cancers but exhibit a markedly higher case fatality rate, constituting the majority of all skin cancer-related deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Siegel et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P4">All three major skin cancer types originate in the epidermis, with BCC and cSCC arising from keratinocytes (KCs) and melanoma from melanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>). Although foundational single-cell atlases have characterised the cellular composition of BCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Guerrero-Juarez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Yerly et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Huang et al., 2023</xref>; Ganier et al. 2024), cSCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Ji et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Yan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">Zou et al., 2023</xref>) and melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Tirosh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Jerby-Arnon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Karras et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Pozniak et al., 2024</xref>) individually, a comprehensive comparison of their single-cell architecture within the tumour microenvironment has yet to be undertaken. For instance, despite common environmental risk factors such as solar UV exposure, and the many overlapping genetic and anatomical attributes, outstanding questions remain about which factors determine the initiation and progression of skin cancer and why most cSCCs and BCCs are less invasive than melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Landi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Seviiri et al., 2022</xref>). Available single-cell datasets for melanoma were produced by early iterations of single cell sequencing technologies capturing fewer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Tirosh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). These studies mostly described acral melanoma, uveal melanoma, or <italic>in vitro</italic> melanoma cell lines (as reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Lim and Rigos, 2024</xref>). There are no single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets available for melanoma that have representative cell types spanning from benign to melanocytic lesions and invasive melanoma. Although prior scRNASeq studies have included matched healthy and tumour skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Ji et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Yan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">Zou et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Huang et al. 2023</xref>), and compared BCC and SCC signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Yost et al. 2019</xref>), to our knowledge, no single cell sequencing data is available for matched healthy skin, cSCC, and BCC lesions from the same individuals, an approach that enables direct within-patient comparison across disease states. Spatial data for skin cancer at single cell resolution with whole transcriptome coverage, or with multimodal measurements of RNA, proteins and metabolites is not available.</p><p id="P5">To understand differences in cancer initiation and progression between the three cancer types, comprehensive investigation of the skin tissue microenvironment, the cancer cells and their dynamic interactions with immune and stromal cells is needed. One common assumption posits that the differential initiation of one type of skin cancer over another is a stochastic process driven by the random acquisition of UV-induced mutations in susceptible genes in key cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Owens et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Ratushny et al., 2012</xref>). However, healthy skin also carries a high mutational burden, suggesting that DNA mutation alone does not explain the heterogeneity in the initiation of the three cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Martincorena et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Sini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Lichtenberger et al., 2021</xref>). A determining factor for cancer initiation and progression other than intrinsic DNA mutations is the tumour microenvironment. cSCC and BCC both derive from long-term epidermal residents, such as a subset of basal KCs at the epidermal-dermal junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Owens et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Ratushny et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Lichtenberger et al., 2021</xref>). In melanoma, there are multiple paths through which melanocytes develop into melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Shain and Bastian, 2016</xref>). The combination of genetic association studies with the investigation of tumour microenvironment could result in insights on cellular intrinsic and tissue environment drivers of skin cancer types.</p><p id="P6">Skin cancers also differ significantly in metastatic potential. Studying cancer progression requires investigation at single cell and spatial context.

For melanoma patients, a common treatment regimen includes targeted therapies (e.g. BRAF- and MEK-inhibitors) and immunotherapies (e.g. anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1). However, only 30-50% of advanced-stage melanoma patients respond to immunotherapies (Sharma et al., 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">George et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Herrscher et al., 2020</xref>), and these treatments can cause severe immune-related adverse events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Fink et al., 2021</xref>).

Similarly, only approximately 50% of advanced-stage cSCC patients respond to immunotherapy treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">García-Sancha et al., 2021</xref>). To better harness the potential of immunotherapies for melanomas and other skin cancers, it is necessary to identify new ligand-receptor (LR) targets as actionable (e.g. combinational therapies with PD-1/PD-L1).

We therefore next investigated the molecular signatures of the melanoma community across multiple analytes (i.e. RNA, protein and metabolites) in spatial context, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5f-h</xref>). First, we performed joint pathway analysis of genes/proteins with metabolites using MetaboAnalyst, providing three lines of evidence that Tyrosine metabolism was enriched (supported by 3 genes and 24 compounds in KEGG pathways), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5h</xref>). Tyrosine is a critical precursor for melanin production in melanocytes and dysregulation in this pathway can contribute to melanoma development or progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Najem et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, we found Pyrimidine metabolism upregulated in the melanoma community.

Based on spatial gene expression in a neighbourhood of a focal spot/cell, GSS (gene specificity scores) for those genes highly expressed in specific spatial location was calculated. SNPs were mapped to genes in these GSS based on distance to transcription start sites. Considering each spot/cell tagged with a set of SNPs next to GSS genes, the proportion of trait heritability captured by these SNPs (and thus by spot/cell) relative to baseline SNPs was computed based on stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression. Significance of association for a spatial region or a cell type was computed by aggregating P values of spots/cells within that region.</p><p id="P43">From Visium data, we found that spatial regions enriched with genetic association for BCC, cSCC and melanoma were localised to the epidermis.

Cauchy aggregated significance for cell types show that top association for melanoma included melanocytes and KC differentiating. Fibroblast consistently displayed a strong association signal across melanoma and cSCC and BCC samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8b</xref>). This was consistent with the spatial cell-cell interaction analysis, which suggested the important roles of fibroblast in interactions with melanocytes, keratinocytes and immune cells. Cell types most associated with cSCC and BCC cancer are KC dysplastic (more for cSCC), KC hair (more enriched for BCC), and KC cornified (similar level to BCC and cSCC, and much more than melanoma), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8b</xref>). Furthermore, we also mapped genetic association signals to single cell resolution CosMX data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8c</xref>).

Our work here reports a comprehensive guideline for other spatial multiomics studies, beyond skin cancer, to assess benefits and limitations for each tool and design a strategy to select suitable tools and combine analyses to cross-validate and gain more biological information than is attainable through any single technology. For example, the large number of genes per cell and the complete RNA extraction from the intact cells/nuclei in scRNA allows for fine-grained classification of cell types. However, the spatial neighbourhood information is lost in scRNAseq, leading to omission of the geographic cell communities within the tissue microenvironment. Further, the scRNAseq-based inference of cell-cell interaction is less accurate due to the lack of neighbourhood constraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Pham et al., 2023</xref>). Although not at single-cell resolution, Visium data enable the inference of all ligand and receptor genes taking into account spatial neighbourhood context. However, as single cell resolution information is not in Visium data, the inference of cell-type specific interactions is limited. This limitation may be partially addressed via cell-type deconvolution, or completely addressed by single-cell panel based platforms, which lack coverage. Regarding proteomics, either scRNAseq or spatial transcriptomics are limited in mapping traditional immune subtypes such as distinguishing CD8 T cells and CD4 T cells, which can be measured by methods such as CODEX and Vectra Polaris. Both scRNAseq, spatial transcriptomics, and CODEX, on the other hand, do not measure metabolites, an important modality that needs methods such as spatial metabolomics to profile.</p><p id="P48">Harnessing the complementary information discussed above, we devised spatial integrative analysis for 1) cell type annotation, 2) differential expression analysis, 3) ligand-receptor based interactions, 4) community/neighbourhood composition and interaction analysis, 5) multimodal validation of cell-cell interactions, and 6) mapping of genetic association signals to spatially defined regions. We discuss below how these analysis was implemented for the skin cancer context, with the intention that the approach can be related to other biological systems.</p><p id="P49">For cell-cell interaction analysis, we integrated scRNAseq and Visium to map ligand-receptor based interactions at transcriptome-wide level.

The interaction results extended beyond LR pairs, providing information about cell type pairs that are interacting. In this way, we could compare pairs of cells that interacted stronger or weaker in each cancer type or in cancer compared to non-cancer samples.

Indeed, in melanoma, it is clear that cellular interaction with the stroma is one of the key factors driving cancer initiation and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). During embryonic development, melanocytes migrate from the neural crest to the basal layer of the epidermis (Rawles et al., 1974), where their morphology, growth and development are largely regulated by surrounding KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hirobe et al., 2005</xref>). In fully developed skin under normal conditions, melanocyte-KC interactions persist, resulting in pigmentation that protects against UV radiation. However, under pathological conditions, dysplastic melanocytes shed interactions with regulatory KCs, resulting in uncontrolled proliferation and gain of stem cell self-renewal capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Haass et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, a deeper understanding of interactions between cell types in both melanoma and NMSC will be necessary to develop a more comprehensive paradigm of skin cancer treatment.</p><p id="P51">For cell type annotation, our integrative analysis provided confidence for multi-level cell type classification. Through integrative multi-omics analysis, we hierarchically defined 11 major cell types and 30 fine-grained cell (sub-)types across the three studied skin cancers. These cell types were first identified using scRNASeq data. We extensively validated the classification of less-abundant cell types using spatial proteomics data from GeoMx and Polaris platforms. Moreover, annotation from scRNAseq data was cross-validated by mapping them to known anatomical organisation of the skin. The presence of rarer cell types at level 2 and level 3 annotation were validated with GeoMX protein data. Importantly, we also validated the cell types through independent spatial mapping with Visium and CosMx. While the separation of certain clusters (e.g. KC populations) from our scRNASeq atlas is not apparent in UMAP space, these cell types were clearly and distinctly resolved when mapped to their spatial location in skin from the same patients captured by both Visium and CosMx, for example the three layers of KC basal, KC differentiating and KC cornified. This strongly suggests that the annotation of these distinct KC subtypes was accurate, demonstrating the power of using complementary single-cell and spatial data to validate cell subtypes. This spatial mapping also defined visible micro-structures of the skin, like hair follicles and sebaceous glands, and more importantly mapped the single-cell resolution heterogeneity within each of these structures. With our CosMx single-cell mapping, we were also able to perform spatial community analysis, which revealed the increased cellular heterogeneity in melanoma compared to cSCC and BCC. To our knowledge, this quantitative difference has not been reported previously. We observed a higher proportion of Differentiating KCs in cSCC than in the two other cancer types across biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gandarillas et al., 2014</xref>), consistent with the defining feature of KC hyperplasia in cSCC. Additionally, we found increased cornification in cSCC compared to healthy tissue, again corroborating the high cell turnover and hyperkeratosis observed in cSCC. Further validation is required to test these data-driven hypotheses.</p><p id="P52">For DE analysis, our multiomics approach strengthens the most common type of analysis that could be integrated using most modalities/platforms. Here we combined cell-type specific DE analysis results from scRNAseq data with that of CosMX, Xenium and Visium data. Important markers for KC cancer and melanomas that were found consistently changed across platforms will be highly-confident candidates for further experimental perturbation studies. These include SOX2, LAMP3, CXCL10, CCL5, and UBE2C. Differences in LR interactions may also explain why one form of skin cancer may arise over another type. For example, PTCH1 (Patched1) is defective in 70-85% of BCC, but not in cSCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Boukamp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bonilla et al., 2016</xref>). The absence of ligands for the PTCH1 membrane receptor in BCC leads to tumour formation under the control of the transcriptional factor GLI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Boukamp et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, loss of PTCH1 signalling may predispose a cell towards initiating BCC over cSCC. Improved insights into the molecular crosstalk between cell types would help elucidate the molecular events underlying the initiation of one cancer type over another.</p><p id="P53">Our atlas also enables comparison of inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity across patients. In BCC-cSCC, comparing 11 healthy and cancer samples with scRNASeq, we found an enrichment of the immune response with CD4 and CD8 T cells, M1 and M2 macrophages, NK and classical cDC cells consistently higher in cancer samples across all five patients. At the gene level, we observed a global upregulation in cancer cells of genes related to progression and invasion like <italic>S100A7</italic> and <italic>KRT6B</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Chang <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) in our scRNASeq data. When accounting for interpatient heterogeneity, we found 39 genes that were upregulated across the entire cSCC dataset, including genes associated with immune processes such as antigen presentation, interferon-gamma response, viral response and cell killing. Comparisons between cancer and healthy regions of each sample identified a consistent shift towards fibroblast-based signalling in cancer. While the critical roles of fibroblasts in regulating skin cancer initiation and progression are well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Flach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ayuso et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kim et al., 2013</xref>), a comprehensive map of fibroblast interactions specific to partner cell types and spatial locations, as shown in this study, is still lacking.</p><p id="P54">Spatial cell community analyses provide new understanding of spatial patterns associated with cancer biology. Here we devised an approach to find a robust community by integrating three platforms, CosMX, Xenium and Visium. We were able to map a melanoma community across CODEX, Xenium and Glycomics modalities and perform, for the first time, joint analysis of spatial omics data for this community, showing the multimodal evidence for the upregulation of tyrosine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways. The community-based colocalization analysis added more evidence for the interaction of melanoma/melanocytes with regulatory T cells and fibroblast. The ligand-receptor based analysis of the melanocyte-enriched community suggested much more active interaction in melanoma samples compared to in BCC, specifically with strong interactions involving collagen with CD44 and Integrins. Inflammatory and Mesenchymal fibroblast cells and T cells create a protumorigenic microenvironment that may be associated with survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Schütz et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P55">Multimodal validation of ligand-receptor interactions provided strong evidence for the LR pairs and cell types involved in the interactions at RNA and protein level at local or nano-scale distance. Our first line of cross-validation for cellular interactions was via finding consistent interactions between platforms, where the broad discovery of interactions using scRNAseq and Visium can be visualised at a single cell resolution proving the colocalisation of ligand and receptor signals between two cells in the Xenium and CosMX. The validation at RNA level was then strengthened with targeted hybridization using RNAscope technology with signal amplification chemistry, allowing us to visualise at high sensitivity the co-expression of IL34-CSF1R. While transcriptomics data allows for screening many more ligand-receptor interactions than can be achieved through proteomics, the RNA-based approaches remain as an inference test, but not a direct proof of protein-protein interactions. Beyond the RNA modality, we extended the validation to protein level, with Opal TSA chemistry that allows for highly sensitive detection of protein expression. The Opal system enabled us to validate ligand-receptor with established antibodies such as PD1-PDL1. However, the colocalisation with the Opal Polaris approach lacks the resolution to find exact interactions. We, therefore, used PLA assay to detect interactions within 20 nm distance, specifically mapping the interactions to the cell membrane.</p><p id="P56">Our final integration type in this work involved the mapping of genetics association signals to spatial cell types and tissue domains. This approach integrates population-scale information to relatively small, but deeply-profiled, functional datasets using spatial multiomics platforms. With this new approach, we successfully mapped significant SNPs to gene expression within tissues and computed cumulative association signals for a spot, a spatial domain or a cell type. We showed the genetic association of melanocytes for the melanoma trait and of KC dysplastic and KC cornified for cSCC and BCC. This analysis demonstrates that while each of the skin cancers arises from a specific type of cell, their shared and independent risk genes and SNPs act across a range of skin cells. The result suggests that one may need to consider that at least some risk loci may be mediated by cis-regulation in keratinocytes, which are involved in tightly controlling melanocyte proliferation and invasion. The analysis also provided statistical evidence on the roles of genetics association in ligand-receptor interaction, such as the <italic>IL34-CSF1R</italic> pair.</p><p id="P57">Together, by using a spatial multi-omics approach with 12 independent technologies, our study represents the first comprehensive comparison of spatial cellular signatures across the three skin major cancer types, BCC, cSCC and melanoma. Although the number of samples is small (total 24 patients), the cross-validation by independent experimental platforms provides high-confidence results for the individual measured. Some of these results add consistent evidence to the existing literature, while new findings from the cohort studied here would require future validation to external cohorts. Nevertheless, our integrative analysis with population genetics studies of &gt;300,000 individuals suggest consistent patterns and indicate highly generalizable results.</p><p id="P58">We identified both shared and distinct cellular and gene signatures for each of the three skin cancer types, suggesting important cell-type specific pathways underlying differences in the initiation and progression of these cancer types. The interacting cell types and LR pairs identified here represent promising therapeutic targets for skin cancer treatment, including immunotherapies. The highly integrated spatial multi omics dataset is available through our skin cancer website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://skincanceratlas.com/">https://skincanceratlas.com/</ext-link>), which is accessible to the broader research community for visualisation and analysis without requiring coding. The data would be useful in multiple scenarios, for example, to provide new insights into the roles of pathways where DNA mutations have been reported, but little is known about how these mutations manifest at single cell and spatial levels, including canonical markers such as MAPK activation in Melanoma, Hedgehog signalling in BCC, and NOTCH/p53 signalling in cSCC.</p></sec><sec id="S27" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S28"><title>Patient material and ethics</title><p id="P59">All samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) were collected with informed patient consent and approved for research use under ethics approval numbers 2018000165 and 2017000318 by the University of Queensland’s Human Research Ethics Committees and 11QPAH477 by the Metro South Human Research Ethics Committee.

Patients presented at the Princess Alexandra Hospital Dermatology Department between October 2018 and February 2020. Among these patients, three patients (B18, E15, F21) were diagnosed with both cSCC and BCC and biopsies of both cancer types were collected. Five patients (B18, P30, P13, P04, R01) kindly consented to participate in the collection of 4 mm punch biopsy samples of non-sun exposed non-cancer skin for paired scRNA sequencing experiments. Lesion identity was confirmed by pathological inspection. Portions of each sample from these patients were also preserved with 10% formalin as described for FFPE samples above. To process fresh samples for scRNA sequencing, briefly, fresh-shaved biopsies were collected in DMEM for immediate tissue dissociation. Tissue was incubated in 10 mg/mL Dispase II (cat.

We make use of CopyKAT’s ability to predict ‘Aneuploid’ cells and InferCNV’s de-noising and QC filtering approach to retain only the cells that are likely to be ‘Aneuploid’. Candidate KC cancer cells passed the first round of filtering if they were predicted to be aneuploid by both tools. Next, genes differentially expressed between KC cells from cancer and healthy biopsies were identified using either edgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) or Scanpy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">Wolf et al., 2018</xref>) and used to calculate an “cSCC score” using a custom python script equivalent to Seurat’s AddModuleScore function. Cells receiving a cSCC score in the ≥95th percentile of all scores for both methods passed the second round of filtering. Therefore, KC cancer cells were those found to be both abnormal in ploidy and enriched for genes associated with cancer biopsies. Melanoma cells were annotated in a similar way, with the module score calculated using DE genes between the malignant melanoma sample and the benign ones in the similar manner and with an ≥80th percentile threshold used for the second step of filtering based on the observed module score distribution and the number of cells.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Visium data analysis</title><p id="P65">Data generation, processing and integration, plus cell type deconvolution and CCI analysis were performed described in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>.

Integrated Visium Seurat objects for each cancer type in turn were used to perform differential gene expression analysis using Seurat’s FindMarkers function (Wilcoxon test with parameters min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25, adjusted p-value threshold ≤0.05) to compare gene expression between positive and negative spots.

We first analysed CCI within individual FOVs. We used our SCTP method in stLearn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Pham et al., 2023</xref>) for CCI prediction, because this tool incorporates information about LR pairs, cell types, and physical distances, thus maximising data usage and providing spatially-meaningful (and therefore more biologically-meaningful) results. Briefly, for a given cell, SCTP defines a neighbourhood as the set of cells within a predefined spatial distance of that cell. For each LR pair and each cell in an FOV in turn, LRscores are calculated as the sum of the mean ligand expression and the mean receptor expression across a given cells’ neighbourhood. The LRscore is further corrected by neighbourhood cell type diversity, which is known to positively correlate with the likelihood of CCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Rieckmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Hou et al., 2020</xref>). stLearn uses a permutation test to determine the null distribution of LR scores for hypothesis testing. It defines significant cells and LR pairs. We performed cell type-specific CCI analysis to examine significant LR interactions between pairs of cell types, using the outputs from the cell level analysis described above. Briefly, SCTP generates a CCILR matrix by counting the number of cells with significant LRscore signalling from one cell type to another for a given LR pair. Like the cell level analysis, SCTP uses a permutation analysis to test whether these counts are significantly different from random.</p><p id="P67">To quantify the spatial heterogeneity of each FOV, we first constructed cell-cell neighbourhood networks by applying Delaunay triangulation to cell spatial coordinates, resulting in one network per FOV. Next, we applied Rao’s quadratic entropy to each cell in each network to measure the cell type heterogeneity. We elected to use Rao’s quadratic entropy scoring for this purpose because it can consider both the probability of two neighbouring cells (i.e. two cells sharing an edge) being different cell types, and the spatial distance between each member of the neighbouring pair. As the natural entropy score is often used as a measure for connected graphs, we fed the customised Delaunay cell neighbourhood network through the ATHENA local quadratic scores function (Martinelli et al., 2002). For cross-cancer type comparison, we aggregated the entropy scores of cells from the same FOVs and grouped the FOVs by cancer subtype. The entropy score was calculated as a product of the spatial distance of cells and the cell type probability; these remain as constant units across FOVs, so normalisation is not required. We performed pairwise comparison of the distribution of entropy scores from each cancer subtype using a Wilcoxon rank sum test.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Xenium data analysis</title><p id="P68">Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks were sectioned at a thickness of 5 μm and mounted onto Xenium slides, in accordance with the FFPE Tissue Preparation Guide (10x Genomics, CG000578, Rev B).

Our PLA results clearly showed the specific signals on the cell membrane in the positive control (E-cadherin and b-Catenin) and no signal in the negative control (CD31-AQP1), (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S23</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S40"><title>Integrating spatial transcriptomics with GWAS data</title><p id="P78">We used the summary statistics from a cSCC GWAS study of 10557 controls and 537850 controls and for BCC GWAS with 36479 cases and 540185 controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Seviiri et al., 2022</xref>) and Melanoma GWAS with 30,143 clinically-confirmed melanoma cases and 81,405 controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Landi et al., 2020</xref>). We applied gsMAP method to map genetic signals to spatial gene expression in the three skin cancer datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Song et al., 2024</xref>). First, tissue domains were determined by finding similar spots/cells using a graph attention autoencoder network which generated latent representations, which in turn were used to find pairwise cosine similarity between spots/cells. Next, gene specificity scores (GSS) for each spot were computed by aggregating information between similar spots/cells (domain), and rank enrichment information for top abundant genes from its homogeneous spots. The expression specificity of a gene within a focal spot was assessed by calculating the geometric mean of its expression rank across the tissue region (microdomain identified by graph attention, or cell type) of the focal spot, divided by the geometric mean of its expression rank across all spots in the ST data. Genes with a ratio higher than 1 and expressed in more spots/cells in the region/cell-type than in overall sample(s) were considered specific for the region or cell type. A high GSS score for a gene suggests that the gene was higher/enriched for the region/cell-type than most other genes in that region/cell-type.</p><p id="P79">Based on proximity to the nearest transcription start sites, GWAS SNP are assigned to GSS genes for each focal spot/cell. Given the set of assigned SNPs to each spot/cell, the SNP effects in the GWAS summary statistics for BCC, cSCC, and cutaneous melanoma and LD scores (from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3) were used for LD score regression analysis. Given the total set of SNPs assigned to a spot/cell, the SNP-level trait heritability (Chi-square association with the skin cancer trait of a SNP from the summary statistics) is partitioned into the SNP effect of a focal spot or cell and the effect of the SNP given the baseline SNPs that are not assigned to GSS genes. The enrichment p-value is calculated based on the partitioned regression coefficient, using one-sided Z-test for bigger than 0. To compute p-value for the association of a spatial region or a cell type across the whole sample, we aggregated P values of individual spots/cells within the spatial regions (or cell types) using Cauchy combination.</p></sec><sec id="S41"><title>skInteractive database</title><p id="P80">We built the skInteractive database in the form of a visualisation dashboard with a Shiny v1.7.2 application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Sievert et al., 2020</xref>). The database has two main sections, the Atlas, which shows cell types and clustering results, and the Gene Explorer, which allows the user to browse gene expression and/or LR interaction scores for the different datasets and modalities. The Atlas dashboard was constructed using Javascript (NuxtJS framework). We converted all plots to geo map components in Apache Echarts v5.3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Li et al., 2018</xref>) that provided interactive features to work with the plots. For the Gene Explorer Shiny app, we implemented multiple tabs themes and used Seurat v4.1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hao et al., 2021</xref>) to generate plots from the different data sets stored in SeuratObjects. The Shiny application included Visium (gene expression and LR scores), CosMx (gene expression) and scRNAseq data (gene expression). skInteractive Database will be ported to AWS cloud.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemetary Figures and Methods</label><media xlink:href="EMS207619-supplement-Supplemetary_Figures_and_Methods.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d51aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S42"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work has been supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC DECRA grant DE190100116 to Q.N), National Health &amp; Medical Research Council (NHMRC Project Grant 2001514 to Q.N), NHMRC Investigator Grant (GNT2008928 to Q.N).
