Moreover, scRNAseq analyses revealed that the expression of several transcription factors with critical roles in interneuron development was altered in mutant interneurons and their progenitors.

These core symptoms are associated with several comorbidities that may contribute to the high variability of ASD symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Post-mortem studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> support a long-standing hypothesis that links ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) with an imbalance between excitation and inhibition (E/I imbalance)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, whereby interneurons regulate cortical circuitry through their inhibitory effects. While research into NDDs has mostly focused on altered neuronal connectivity and circuitry, there is increasing evidence that NDD symptoms can originate from brain malformations occurring in the second trimester of foetal development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In this period, neural stem cells generate excitatory glutamatergic projection neurons and inhibitory GABAergic interneurons in the dorsal and ventral telencephalon, respectively. Interneurons, in particular, form an enormous variety of cell types that is critical for the proper functioning of cortical circuitry. The specification of this interneuron diversity is under the control of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling and a cascade of transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. After their birth, projection neurons migrate radially out of the germinal zones to form the cortical layers in an inside-out manner, while interneurons undergo complex tangential migrations from the ventral telencephalon to their target area in the cortex where they mature and integrate into cortical circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Primary cilia are cellular antennas present on most cells including neural progenitors and many neurons and act as signalling hubs in development and tissue homeostasis. Defects in the function and/or structure of primary cilia underlie a group of syndromes commonly referred to as ciliopathies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> that are characterized by pleiotropic clinical features. Many ciliopathy patients display severe neurological symptoms, most commonly ID and ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In turn, a cell-based high-throughput screen indicated that diverse neuropsychiatric risk genes converge on primary cilia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. This idea is further corroborated by recent findings that several monogenetic neurodevelopmental syndromes, including Fragile X and Rett syndromes, result in altered ciliary structure and signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, but the mechanisms how ciliary impairments contribute to NDD pathogenesis remain largely unexplored.</p><p id="P5">To date, the most compelling evidence for ciliary roles in ASD aetiology stems from the identification of autism specific mutations in several ciliary genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. One of these genes, <italic>CEP41</italic>, encodes a centrosomal protein located at the basal body and in the ciliary axoneme. It is essential for the transport of Tubulin Tyrosine Ligase Like 6 (TTLL6) into the cilium and hence tubulin polyglutamylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Homozygous <italic>CEP41</italic> null mutations cause Joubert Syndrome (JS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> associated with intellectual disabilities (ID) and ASD in 40% of JS patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In addition, heterozygous <italic>CEP41</italic> missense mutations have been identified in familial and sporadic forms of ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> but the effects of these mutations on mammalian brain development have not been explored. Here, we report our findings on human cortical organoids carrying the <italic>CEP41</italic> R242H ASD mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. This mutation did not interfere with CEP41’s ciliary localisation but cilia were shorter and had lower levels of tubulin polyglutamylation indicative of altered cilia stability and signalling. Moreover, scRNA-seq analyses revealed that the <italic>CEP41</italic> mutation caused decreased cortical progenitor proliferation and an augmented formation of upper layer cortical neurons. In interneurons and their progenitors, the altered expression of several key transcription factors in interneuron development coincided with changes in interneuron differentiation. Taken together, these results indicate that the combined effects of the ASD-linked <italic>CEP41</italic> mutation on the development of projection neurons and interneurons may contribute to ASD pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P6">Feeder-free iPSCs were continuously maintained in StemMACS™ iPS-Brew XF medium containing supplements (Miltenyi Biotec, #130-104-368) and 1x Antibiotic-Antimycotic (GIBCO, #15240062) on CellAdhere™ Laminin-521 (STEMCELL Technologies UK Ltd; #77003) coated 6-well plates.

To ensure the absence of unknown <italic>CEP41</italic> mutations, the targeted exon and flanking sequences were sequenced prior to gene editing using oligonucleotides CEP_E9_F and CEP_E9_R (Supplementary Table 1). The gRNA was designed using an online CRISPR design tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.mit.edu">http://crispr.mit.edu</ext-link>) and was cloned into the pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) plasmid (Addgene: #48139). To test gRNA efficiency a T7 endonuclease assay was performed. Nas2 iPSC cells were cultured up to 70-80% confluency and lifted with Accutase enzyme (Invitrogen, #00-4555-56). gRNA constructs together with pmaxGFP™ plasmid were transfected using a P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector Kit (Lonza, V4XP-3012) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were harvested 48 hours post-transfection and genomic DNA was extracted using the QuickExtract™ DNA Extraction solution (LGC Biosearch Technologies, QE09050)). Genomic targeting efficiency for the gRNA was determined through annealing and digestion with T7 Endonuclease I (NEB: #M0302) of a PCR product flanking the <italic>CEP41</italic> R242H target site. gRNA 5’-GACCTCCGGAAAGCATGAAG-3’ was determined as optimal for use in gene-editing. iPSCs at 70-80% confluence were dissociated into single cells with Accutase and 8x10<sup>5</sup> cells were electroporated with 5 μg Cas9-CEP41_sgRNA plasmid, 1.8 μg pmaxGFP™ vector (Lonza kit) and 100 pmol 178nt Ultramer, a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide donor template (ssODN) (PAGE-purified; Integrated DNA Technologies) (Supplementary Table 1), using the P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector™ X Kit (Lonza), (program CA-137) on a Lonza 4D-Nucleofector™ X Unit (Lonza) according to manufacturer’s guidelines. Transfected cells were resuspended in pre-warmed StemMACS™ iPS-Brew XF including supplements and 10 μM ROCK-inhibitor (Y-27632, Stemcell Technologies) and seeded into two wells of a Laminin-521 coated 6-well plate. Selection with 1 μg/ml puromycin (InvivoGen, #ant-pr-1) was commenced 24 hours post-nucleofection and continued for 24 hours. Cells were grown to confluence and passaged at low density (5x10<sup>3</sup>), as single cells onto Laminin-521 coated 10 cm dishes in StemMACS™ iPS-Brew XF medium with 10 μM Y27632. After 4-6 days single-cell derived colonies were isolated and transferred to a Laminin-521 coated 96-well plate. Duplicate plates were made for maintenance and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) screening. When cells for genotyping reached confluence, crude genomic DNA lysates were prepared by adding 25μl QuickExtract™ DNA Extraction solution and incubated at 65°C for 15 minutes, followed by 2 minutes at 98°C. Amplicons flanking the targeting site were amplified using GoTaq G2 polymerase (Promega) with the CEP_E9_F and CEP_E9_R primers (Supplementary Table 1). PCR protocol: 95°C for 2 minutes; 35 cycles of 95°C for 40 seconds, 57°C for 40 seconds, 72°C for 50 seconds; and a final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes. PCR products were digested with Bsp 1286I (New England Biolabs) and run on a 2.5% TAE agarose gel. Clones identified as carrying a Bsp 1286I restriction site were evaluated for introduction of the R242H mutation through Sanger sequencing (Source Bioscience). The top 5 candidates for off-target effects identified with an online tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.mit.edu">http://crispr.mit.edu</ext-link>) were sequenced using oligonucleotides as summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

Accounting for clonal heterogeneity, we pooled 3 organoids from 3 control and 3 homozygous mutant lines. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and unbiased clustering of 42,776 cells revealed seven clusters of telencephalic cell populations: RGCs (RG1-5), basal intermediate progenitors (bIP1-2), excitatory neurons (EN1-3), ventral telencephalic progenitors (VP1-2), interneurons (IN1-3), Cajal Retzius cells (CR) and cortical hem/choroid plexus (HemCP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). These clusters expressed known marker genes and the presence of corresponding cells in the organoids was confirmed by immunofluorescence stainings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-J</xref>).

Determining the ratio between progenitor cell types and excitatory neurons we found an increased proportion of progenitors in mutant organoids driven by an increase in the number of RGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The RG cluster consisted of five subpopulations from which the RG1 and RG4 populations were predominately augmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). As the RG subpopulation mainly differed in the expression of cell cycle markers such as KI67 and PCNA, we assigned the cell cycle state to all individual RGCs and found that the fraction of cells in G2/M was increased at the expense of S phase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Indeed, acute BrdU labelling for 4 hours revealed a decline in the proportion of SOX2+ progenitors in S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-I</xref>). Interestingly, while there were only a few gene expression changes in mutant RGCs (Supplementary Table 2-5), the RG2-4 populations presented with a significant ca. 1.3fold up-regulation of <italic>HES5</italic> which plays a role in maintaining the proliferative state of multipotent cortical progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, consistent with the increased proportion of RGCs. Investigating the proportion of the three excitatory neuron population revealed a strong increase in the EN1 population at the expense of EN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J</xref>). Moreover, RNA velocity analysis showed that EN1 neurons likely represent newly born neurons whereas EN2 are more differentiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2K, L</xref>). This idea is also supported by remnant expression of <italic>EOMES</italic> and low <italic>NEUROD6</italic> mRNA levels in EN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).

Unbiased clustering led to the identification of apical and outer RGC (aRG and oRG) and several excitatory neuron clusters that were assigned as deep (EN(DL); EN(LIV-V); EN(mix)) and upper layer cortical neurons (EN(UL1-3)) based on marker gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-C</xref>). Organoids also contained a group of ventral progenitors (VP) and two interneuron populations (IN1-2). All these clusters contained cells from each the three control and mutant lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). In contrast to the earlier stage, the proportion of excitatory neurons to dorsal progenitors was increased in D94 mutant organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Within the progenitor populations, mutant organoids showed an increased proportion of oRGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>), a progenitor subtype predominantly generating late born upper-layer neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.

We first employed the single cell data sets to examine whether the proportion of ventral telencephalic cell types was altered as for the dorsal lineage. In D38 organoids, there was no change in the proportions between the two progenitor cell types, but a slight increase in interneurons relative to progenitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). Within the interneuron populations, IN1 and IN3 were increased at the expense of IN2. In contrast, there was a remarkable decline in the numbers of ventral cell types in D94 organoids with ventral progenitor and interneuron cell clusters largely consisting of control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). Nevertheless, the proportion of progenitors and interneurons was not affected while IN1_D94 interneurons were significantly underrepresented within the interneuron population. These findings suggest that the <italic>CEP41</italic><sup>R242H/R242H</sup> mutation affects the differentiation and survival of cortical interneurons.

This integration revealed that the IN1 cell cluster largely consisted of lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) derived striatal interneurons. IN2 and IN1_D94 cells mainly co-localized with interneurons derived from the caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) but IN2 also made a significant contribution to medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) interneurons. Finally, IN3 and IN2_D94 cells formed a separate cluster but contributed to all three combined GE clusters. These patterns were confirmed by the expression of markers specific for each of the ganglionic eminences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>).</p><p id="P27">We next sought to determine whether changes in cell proportions coincided with altered gene expression in each of the ventral telencephalic cell populations. Investigating patterns of gene expression changes in top genes, we noted a larger number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in D38 ventral cell clusters than in dorsal RGCs and excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, Supplementary Table 2-5). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that up-regulated genes in VP1/2 and IN1-3 cell clusters of D38 organoids were primarily involved in protein formation and maturation (GO:BP terms: “protein targeting to ER”, “SRP dependent co-translational targeting to membranes”, “ribosome biogenesis”) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). In fact, most of the up-regulated genes in the IN3 cluster encode proteins of the small and large ribosomal subunits. The role of down-regulated genes varied more between the different cell groups. These genes were associated with splicing in VP1 progenitors, whereas genes involved in NADH generation and glycolysis (<italic>ENO1/2, PKG1</italic>) were found to be differentially expressed in the VP2 cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>CEP41</italic><sup>R242H/R242H</sup> mutation affected processes involved in neuronal differentiation in all three populations of interneurons, emphasized by GO:BP terms such as “axonogenesis”, “neuron migration”, “GABAergic interneuron differentiation” and “postsynaptic cytoskeleton organization” suggesting a delay in neuronal differentiation. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) also indicated an increase in Myc target gene expression, but a reduction in glycolysis, hypoxia and mTORC1 signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p><p id="P28">In addition to these altered processes, we noted that the expression of several key regulators of interneuron development were affected by the <italic>CEP41</italic><sup>R242H/R242H</sup> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>).

Since all down-regulated DEGs encoded ribosomal proteins, their GO terms described ribosomal activity. These findings suggest a premature expression of neuronal genes and down-regulation of ribosomal genes unlike the earlier stage.

At D94, there were overlaps in all three gene score categories mainly with genes differentially expressed in the VP cluster.

Accordingly, expression levels of the anterograde transport component IFT88 were not only reduced in the axoneme, but IFT88 expression was also absent from the ciliary tip of <italic>CEP41</italic> homozygous mutant cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F-L</xref>). In contrast, ciliary expression and localisation of the retrograde transport component IFT144 was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6M-S</xref>). Finally, we noted that the expression of the gene encoding Phospolipase γ2 (PLCγ2) that acts downstream of PDGF signalling to induce deciliation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> was reduced in most D38 scRNA-seq cell clusters (Supplementary Tables 2 and 4). Taken together, these findings suggests that the R242H mutation affects cilia stability and might thereby reduce the signalling capacity of the cilium.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P35">This study introduces a framework to explore the molecular and cellular foundations of primary cilia and their involvement in the aetiology of ASD within a human context. Utilizing cortical and ventral telencephalic organoid models, our research showed that a <italic>CEP41</italic> ASD mutation impairs the development of both excitatory neurons as well as inhibitory interneurons. A delay in early neuronal differentiation led to an increased proportion of upper layer cortical neurons. Interneurons and their progenitors showed gene expression alterations, particularly affecting key developmental regulators and ASD candidate genes. These results indicate that the <italic>CEP41</italic> mutation might disrupt the E/I balance and thereby contribute to ASD pathogenesis.</p><sec id="S21"><title>Effects of the <italic>CEP41</italic> mutation on cilia structure and signalling</title><p id="P36">Increasing evidence implicate altered corticogenesis during the second and third trimester of foetal development as a major pathomechanism in a large proportion of ASD subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. During this period, cell-cell signalling plays a dominant role and, indeed, recent studies highlighted an emerging role for primary cilia in the aetiology of NDDs and ASD in particular. Many ciliopathy patients presenting neurological symptoms are also diagnosed with ID and ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> while mutations in several high confidence ASD candidate genes also impact on cilia structure and/or signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Interestingly, defective Shh signalling and dendritic arborisation were rescued by reinstating cilia in primary cultures of mouse cortical neurons mutant for <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> but in all other cases it remains to be seen whether these ciliary defects contribute to pathogenesis. Finally, mutations in various ciliary genes have been identified in ASD individuals, impacting ciliary gene transcription (<italic>RFX3/4/7</italic>), ciliogenesis (<italic>FAM92B, OFD1, PCM1</italic>), the transition zone (<italic>AHI1, CEP290</italic>), ciliary transport via the BBSome (<italic>BBS4</italic>) and the axonemal protein CEP41. Taken together, these findings suggest that ciliary dysfunctions contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders in general and ASD in particular. However, our insights into roles of cilia in neural development in health and disease are mainly derived from animal or cell culture models, but differences in brain development between human and non-human mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup> make extrapolating these results to human disorders difficult. Addressing this knowledge gap and given the proposed role of an E/I imbalance, we made use of human cortical and ventral telencephalic organoids to investigate the effects of an ASD mutation in a ciliary gene on excitatory and inhibitory neuron development. Amongst the ASD mutant ciliary genes, <italic>CEP41</italic> stood out with over 20 familial and sporadic ASD cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The affected individuals carry missense mutations that mainly cluster in the rhodamine domain. Based on structure predictions and analysis of zebrafish neurogenesis, we chose to investigate the R242H mutation, noted for its deleterious effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. While ASD subjects carry a heterozygous mutation, our study primarily used homozygous mutant organoids as a proof of principle, with key findings replicated in heterozygous mutant organoids. This mutation did not affect the stability of the CEP41 protein nor its localisation at the basal body and the axoneme. Although centrosomal proteins can serve multiple functions in the cilium and during mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>, CEP41 protein did not localize to the mitotic spindle nor was spindle orientation affected in mutant RGCs, suggesting that altered organoid development is due to impaired ciliary signalling. Previous experiments in fibroblasts derived from JS subjects showed that <italic>CEP41</italic> is essential for transporting TTLL6 into the cilium for tubulin polyglutamylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>, while <italic>Cep41</italic> knock-down in cultured murine cells resulted in tubulin hypoglutamylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. This posttranslational modification controls SHH signalling as well as ciliary stability and length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>, a modifier of the cilia’s ability to sense and transduce extracellular signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we observed reduced levels of tubulin glutamylation in <italic>CEP41</italic><sup>R242H</sup> heterozygous as well as homozygous mutant RGCs suggesting a potential hypomorph or dominant negative effect. Cilia were also shorter with reduced expression of IFT88 but not IFT144 along the axoneme and at the ciliary tip. Altered IFT transport was recently identified as a consequence of tubulin hypoglutamylation and led to reduced activation of Shh signalling, probably due to a prolonged entry of Smo and Gli3 into the cilium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. <italic>Cep41</italic> knock-down in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts also impaired ciliary tip localisation of Gli2 and Gli3 upon activation of Shh signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. These findings help to explain the tendency for reduced SHH signalling in ventral telencephalic <italic>CEP41</italic><sup>R242H/R242H</sup> mutant organoids. Finally, <italic>Cep41</italic> was implicated in ciliary disassembly via AURKA activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. This control mechanism might act in combination with the reduced expression of PLCγ2 which is crucial for inducing deciliation upon activated PDGF signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. Thus, the combined roles of CEP41 on ciliary stability and disassembly suggest that the <italic>CEP41</italic> ASD mutation might result in cilia with compromised stability and signalling capacity.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Altered development of excitatory projection neurons and inhibitory interneurons and its relevance to ASD</title><p id="P37">Our study elucidates several potential mechanisms by which the <italic>CEP41</italic> mutation could contribute to the development of autism at the cellular level. A prevailing hypothesis postulates that an imbalance between excitation and inhibition plays a critical role in NDD aetiology. Although research on NDDs has primarily concentrated on changes in neuronal connectivity and circuitry, growing evidence also implicate defects occurring during foetal development of projection neurons and interneurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Interestingly, <italic>CEP41</italic> mutant organoids show alterations in developing excitatory and inhibitory cell lineages. Although gene expression changes were minimal in dorsal cell types, progenitor proliferation and differentiation appeared disrupted. An increased proportion of progenitors suggested delayed neuron formation in early organoids resulting in an increased proportion of oRGs and upper layer neurons at later stages. Differential gene expression identified increased <italic>PTN</italic> expression as a potential cause for the overproduction. <italic>PTN</italic> encodes a secreted, extracellular matrix associated growth factor linked to controlling oRG proliferative behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> and stimulates the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in glioblastoma cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup> which has been associated with the rapid migratory bursts preceding oRG cell division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. The elevated proliferation and overproduction of cortical neurons align with reports of excess cortical neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>, increased brain weights<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup> and early brain overgrowth in ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>. In mice, excess prenatal neurogenesis similarly caused an overabundance of upper-layer cortical neurons, an imbalance of excitation and inhibition, altered neural functioning, and ASD-like behaviours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P38">Our study also highlights significant disruptions in cortical interneuron development. Unlike the excitatory dorsal cell lineage, ventral telencephalic cell populations displayed notable gene expression changes. Key among these are the <italic>NR2F1/2</italic> genes, known to control cortical arealisation and excitatory neuron as well as interneuron differentiation in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup>. These were differentially expressed in all ventral telencephalic populations, with recent genomic analyses revealed <italic>NR2F1</italic> mutations in ASD patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref></sup>. Modelling one of these mutations in human cortical organoids led to increased interneuron formation due to elevated SHH signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. Moreover, the same mutation caused an E/I imbalance and behavioural ASD-like deficits in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>, further underscoring <italic>NR2F1</italic>’s critical role.</p><p id="P39">In addition, the mRNA levels of several other key transcriptional regulators of interneuron development, including <italic>ARX, DLX2, GSX2, LHX6</italic> and <italic>SOX6</italic>, were altered. Although these changes were generally milder and confined to a subset of ventral telencephalic populations, they may have implications for ASD aetiology. The expression of <italic>Dlx1/2</italic> and <italic>Dlx5/6</italic> is controlled by internal enhancers. Their deletion caused a twofold reduction in <italic>Dlx</italic> gene expression, leading to behavioural abnormalities in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, mutations were also unveiled in the <italic>DLX5/6</italic> internal enhancer in individuals with autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref></sup>. Moreover, <italic>Dlx</italic> genes form a transcriptional circuitry with other transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>, many of which were differentially expressed in mutant organoids. For example, <italic>DLX1/2</italic> directly controls the expression of the aristaless-related homeobox gene <italic>ARX</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref></sup>, a gene linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref></sup>. Finally, differentially expressed genes were significantly overrepresented in the SFARI ASD database. This overlap combined with GO/gene network analyses showing a potential disruption of early neuron formation, differentiation and synapse development underscores the impact of the <italic>CEP41</italic> mutation on interneuron development in our organoid model.</p><p id="P40">Additionally, there was a marked up-regulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, particularly in the IN3 population in D38 organoids, which exhibited an altered expression of 40 out of 85 ribosomal proteins. Altered synaptic protein translation has been highly implicated in ASD aetiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref></sup>. While it remains to be elucidated whether synaptic ribosome composition and function are altered in <italic>CEP41</italic> mutant interneurons, other translation-based mechanisms may influence interneuron differentiation. During development, ribosome biogenesis and global protein synthesis rates are not uniform but tightly and dynamically regulated by Myc dependent transcription of genes encoding ribosomal proteins and by mTORC1 signalling, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">104</xref></sup>. Global protein synthesis rates are consistently lower in stem cells including neural stem cells, increase during early differentiation and are reduced again in later differentiation. In turn, ribosome biogenesis is selectively high in stem cells, drops at early differentiation stages and rises again at later differentiation. An up-regulation of myc target genes and a down-regulation of mTORC1 signalling in IN3 interneurons, as revealed by GSEA, therefore suggests that these cells might be an immature, plastic state which is consistent with the IN3 contribution to CGE, LGE and MGE interneurons. Taken together with the strong overlap of IN3 DEGs and the SFARI list, this finding suggests that the <italic>CEP41</italic> ASD mutation might affect interneuron differentiation at an early developmental stage. In addition, altered ribosomal protein expression can also affect ribosome heterogeneity, an important developmental regulator. Translational control was also found to modify cell signalling and the SHH pathway in particular. The <italic>Ptch1</italic> 5’ untranslated region contains an eIF3c binding site and several upstream open reading frames (ORFs) competing with the main ORF for ribosomes. These elements positively and negatively regulate Ptch1 protein translation, respectively, during limb and neural tube patterning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">105</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">106</xref></sup>, raising the intriguing possibility that changes in ribosomal protein expression might influence SHH signalling and thereby differentiation of <italic>CEP41</italic> mutant interneurons.</p><p id="P41">These interneuron lineage specific gene expression changes may contribute to ASD behaviours in the <italic>CEP41</italic> patients and are consistent with observations on the role of interneurons in ASD. Interneurons modulate neural circuits, generate cortical oscillations and maintain the E/I balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>, all of which can be disrupted by changes in interneuron numbers or inhibitory synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">107</xref></sup>. In turn, perturbing high-confidence ASD-risk genes in human cortical organoids and in mouse telencephalic interneurons increased the proportion of ventral cells and led to repetitive and restricted behaviours, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">108</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">111</xref></sup>. Taken together with the altered proportions of excitatory neurons, these findings suggest that the <italic>CEP41</italic><sup>R242H/R242H</sup> mutation induces an E/I imbalance, a hypothesis that warrants further investigations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS207119-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d23aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Drs Thomas Becker, Calvin Chan, John Mason and David Price for critical comments on the manuscript and Dr Tilo Kunath for sharing the NAS2 line.
