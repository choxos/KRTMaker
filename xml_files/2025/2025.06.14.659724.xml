The Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is commonly targeted by pathogens. Effectors from devastating plant pathogen <italic>Phytophthora</italic> hijack the PP2A core enzyme in plant hosts, altering the host phosphoproteome. In this study, we present a series of cryo-electron microscopy structures of the <italic>Phytophthora</italic> effector PSR2 in complex with the host PP2A core enzyme to form a functional holoenzyme. The PSR2-PP2A complex adopts a unique hexameric architecture, driven by PSR2-mediated dimerization of two heterotrimers. This hexamer exhibits greater stability and features a more exposed catalytic pocket compared to the canonical trimeric form of PP2A, likely enhancing its virulence activity. Mutational analyses underscore the importance of this hexameric structure for PSR2’s virulence function. These findings provide mechanistic insights into pathogen-mediated manipulation of a key host phosphatase and offer targets for developing disease resistance strategies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Hosts and pathogens are engaged in a constant co-evolutionary arms race<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. While plant and animal hosts have evolved sophisticated defense networks to prevent infection by potential pathogens, pathogens employ virulence proteins to undermine host immunity and cellular processes to drive disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of pathogen virulence functions is instrumental in establishing fundamental principles in pathogenesis and developing resistance strategies.</p><p id="P3">Protein phosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism in cellular function. The evolutionarily conserved Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is responsible for the majority of dephosphorylation activity occurs on Serine and Threonine residues, thus playing a critical housekeeping role in regulating numerous cellular processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Therefore, dysregulation of PP2A has been found to associate with various diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. PP2A functions as a heterotrimeric holoenzyme composed of a scaffold subunit (A), a catalytic subunit (C) and a regulatory subunit (B). The A and C subunits form the core enzyme, while the B subunit defines substrate specificity, determining which cellular targets are dephosphorylated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Consistent with its important functions, PP2A is a common target for pathogenic manipulation in both plant and animal hosts. For instance, the DNA tumor virus SV40 disrupts human PP2A function through a small antigen, which binds to the PP2A core enzyme, leading to cellular transformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Proteins encoded by human papillomaviruses (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are also known to associate with the PP2A core enzyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Similar to animal pathogens, plant pathogens also target host PP2A to promote infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In particular, several virulence proteins produced by the devastating <italic>Phytophthora</italic> pathogens have recently been shown to hijack the plant PP2A core enzyme, enhancing infection by altering host phosphoproteome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5"><italic>Phytophthora</italic> species, such as the Irish potato famine pathogen <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic>, are filamentous eukaryotic pathogens that pose significant threats to global plant health and food security<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Each <italic>Phytophthora</italic> genome encodes hundreds of virulence proteins called effectors, which possess diverse host-manipulating activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. A large family of <italic>Phytophthora</italic> effectors are comprised of tandem repeats of the (L)WY motif, named by conserved residues including multiple leucine (L), one tryptophan (W), and one tyrosine (Y)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. The W-Y interaction stabilizes a nearly identical α-helical bundle formed by each (L)WY unit, whereas the leucine residues facilitate stable concatenations through a conserved mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. The best-studied (L)WY effector is the <italic>Phytophthora</italic> suppressors of RNA silencing 2 (PSR2), which contains one N-terminal WY unit (named WY1) followed by six LWY motifs (named LWY2 – LWY7). This architecture was named WY1-(LWY)<sub>6</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> Importantly, the WY1-(LWY)<sub>n</sub> arrangement is prevalent in <italic>Phytophthora</italic> species, indicating a role in driving effector evolution. Despite the structural conservation, the (L)WY units are variable in sequences, potentially mediating interactions with different host targets inside the plant cells during infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">We recently found that 13 WY1-(LWY)<sub>n</sub> effectors, including PSR2, share a functional module that is based on a specific (L)WY-LWY combination that mediates direct interaction with the A subunit of plant PP2A. These effectors efficiently recruit the host PP2A core enzyme and manipulate the host phosphoproteome as a key virulence mechanism in <italic>Phytophthora</italic> pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. By characterizing the crystal structure of PSR2 in complex with a plant PP2A A subunit, we discovered that the PP2A-interacting module clamps onto an N-terminal region of the PP2A A subunit, a region implicated in the interactions with PP2A B subunits in human holoenzymes. Therefore, these PP2A-interacting <italic>Phytophthora</italic> effectors may recruit the PP2A core enzyme as innovative PP2A B subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. However, the molecular details of the putative effector-PP2A holoenzymes was unknown.</p><p id="P7">Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the PSR2-PP2A holoenzyme complex. We found that the PSR2-PP2A holoenzyme forms a unique hexameric architecture, unlike the canonical hetertrimeric structure of known PP2A holoenzymes. Detailed structural and functional analyses suggest that the hexamerization enables the formation of a more robust holoenzyme, thus enhancing the virulent activity of PSR2. This study provides a deeper understanding of how pathogens manipulate their hosts. As key susceptibility factor across the kingdom, this finding offers new avenues to improve disease resistance through precise engineering of PP2A.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>PSR2-PDF1-Cα holoenzyme forms a hexamer</title><p id="P8">To understand how PSR2 hijacks the PP2A core enzyme, we determined the structure of the PSR2-PP2A holoenzyme. <italic>A. thaliana</italic> encodes three PP2A A subunits (PDF1, PDF2 and RCN1) and five C subunits (PP2A-1-PP2A-5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Since all three A subunits directly interact with PSR2, we selected PDF1 for structural studies. However, none of the five C subunits produced soluble proteins using various expression systems. Therefore, we used the human PP2A C subunit (Cα), which shares a high degree of sequence similarity with its <italic>A. thaliana</italic> counterparts to form a core enzyme with PDF1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.

The sequence and structural similarities between the plant and host PP2A C subunits suggest that the PSR2-PDF1-Cα complex likely mimics the native PSR2-PP2A holoenzyme in plant cells.</p><p id="P9">We assembled the PSR2-PDF1-Cα holoenzyme by incubating purified PDF1 and Cα to form the core enzyme, followed by the addition of purified PSR2. The complex was purified via gel filtration chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.1b</xref>). We determined the cryo-EM structure of the PSR2-PDF1-Cα complex at an overall resolution of 3.38 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.2a-2c</xref> and Table 1). Interestingly, we found that the PSR2-PDF1-Cα complex forms a hexameric structure, containing two copies of each protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Local resolution distribution revealed that the N-terminus of both PDF1 and PSR2 are flexible, as indicated by lower resolutions in these regions. In contrast, the C-termini of PDF1 and PSR2 exhibited higher stability and better electronic density, allowing for generating detailed atomic models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.2d</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The PSR2-PDF1-Cα hexamer is composed of two heterotrimers. Each PSR2 molecule binds to a PP2A core enzyme made up of one PDF1 and one Cα, forming a trimer. These trimers further dimerize to form a hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs.1a and 1b</xref>). Unlike the known human PP2A holoenzymes, which are all single A-B-C heterotrimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.3a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. the PSR2-PDF1-Cα complex features two A-C core enzymes and two PSR2 effectors. The two rod-like PSR2 molecules intersect, forming a cross.

This assembly resembles that of PP2A holoenzymes studied in human (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.3a</xref>), wherein the C-terminal region of the A subunit interacts with Cα, forming a compact elliptical structure, and the N-terminal region interacts with B subunits. This similarity in structural configuration suggests that PSR2 functions as a molecular mimicry of PP2A B subunits and hijacks the PP2A core enzyme by substituting endogenous B subunits.</p><p id="P12">The LWY<sub>2</sub>-LWY<sub>3</sub> units of PSR2 anchor at the N-terminus of PDF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2b</xref>), similar to what was found in the crystal structure of PSR2-PDF1 complex using the N-terminal 390 aa fragment of PDF1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In addition, in the PSR2-PDF1-Cα complex, we found that PSR2 also binds to Cα through the LWY<sub>4</sub>-LWY<sub>5</sub> units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs.2a and 2c</xref>). The LWY4-LWY5 region of PSR2 is positioned on Cα, with the third α-helix of LWY<sub>5</sub> (α3) forming the core interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2c</xref>). In this interaction, the side chain of residue K439 forms hydrogen bonds with residues N139 and N141 in Cα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d</xref>). Additionally, residues D443, K447, and T450 in α3 form hydrogen bonds with the Cα residues Y130 and Q125, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d</xref>). Furthermore, N398, E400, and N402 located between LWY4 and LWY5 further contribute to the interaction of PSR2 with Cα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2e</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The interaction of PSR2 and the PP2A catalytic subunit Cα is in contrast with the known human PP2A holoenzymes in which the B subunits had minimal or no interactions with Cα (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.3a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.We then evaluated the potential contribution of PSR2-Cα interaction to the assembly of the PSR2-PP2A complex. For this purpose, we mutated specific residues in LWY5 involved in the PSR2-Cα interaction in our structural model and assessed the mutants for PSR2-PDF1-Cα complex formation. Pull-down assays indicated that mutations of PSR2 potentially disrupting the interaction with Cα in the hexamer did not significantly hinder the complex assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2f</xref>). Furthermore, the quadruple mutant PSR2<sup>K439A/D443A/K447A/T450A</sup> was co-precipitated with PP2A A subunits when expressed in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>, and the protein complex exhibited phosphatase activity in a level that was comparable to that of wildtype PSR2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.3c and 3d</xref>). These results suggest that the observed interactions of PSR2 with Cα through LWY4-LWY5 in the PSR2-PDF1-Cα complex is not essential for PSR2 to recruit PP2A core enzyme. This is consistent with the previous observation that PSR2-PP2A A interaction mediated by LWY2-LWY3 play a pivotal role in effector function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, the interaction between PSR2 and Cα may facilitate the assembly and/or enhance the stability of the PSR2-PP2A complex during pathogen infection although this more subtle effect may not be detectable using purified or over-expressed proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>LWY<sub>7</sub>-Cα interactions drive PSR2-PP2A hexamer formation</title><p id="P14">In the PSR2-PDF1-Cα hexamer, the LWY<sub>7</sub> unit at the C-terminus of PSR2 in one heterotrimer interacts with the Cα of the opposite trimer (hereafter Cα’), potentially facilitating the dimerization of two trimers to form a hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3a</xref>). In this interaction interface, the fourth helix of LWY7 forms numerous hydrogen bonds and charged interactions with Cα’ (Figs.3b and 3c).

These results further confirm that the hexameric complex is more stable than its trimeric counterpart, and the interaction between the two trimers likely stabilizes the overall hexameric assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Dimerization of PSR2-PP2A heterotrimers opens the catalytic pocket</title><p id="P23">To evaluate the functional implications of hexamerization, we compared the trimeric and hexameric structures, focusing on the accessibility of the catalytic pocket in Cα. In the trimeric states, the C-terminal region of PSR2 exhibits significant flexibility, with the LWY4-LWY5 region dynamically sliding toward Cα (Video S3). This movement causes the catalytic pocket to be fully covered in Trimer-S1 and partially covered in Trimer-S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs.5a and 5b</xref>).</p><p id="P24">In contrast, in the hexameric state, interactions between LWY7 of PSR2 and Cα’ from the opposite trimer stabilize PSR2 and keep it away from the catalytic pocket, leaving the pocket completely open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs.5a and 5b</xref>). These results suggest that in the trimeric states, PSR2 may restrict substrate access to the catalytic pocket, while dimerization in the hexamer enhances catalytic pocket accessibility via opening the catalytic pockets, potentially improving the efficiency of substrate entry.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Substrate bound in the catalytic pocket of Cα subunit</title><p id="P25">To further confirm that the PSR2-PDF1-Cα hexamer has open catalytic pockets, we incubated a synthetic phosphopeptide (RRA(pT)VA) with the PSR2-PDF1-Cα complex as a substrate.

The complex retained the hexameric arrangement, with the catalytic pockets of Cα and Cα’ containing clear extra electron density, enabling the unambiguous docking of one phosphopeptide molecule into each pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs.5c and 5d</xref>). The phosphopeptide is positioned in the cleft of Cα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5e</xref>), with its phosphate group being located adjacent to the catalytic residue H118 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, mimicking the substrate-binding state.

In this structure, the LWY4-LWY5 region of PSR2 remained distant from the Cα catalytic pocket, maintaining the open conformation of the catalytic pockets, as seen in the substrate-free hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.7c</xref>). In contrast, in the trimeric forms, the LWY4-LWY5 region of PSR2 either completely or partially covered the Cα catalytic pocket (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs.7d and 7e</xref>). These findings suggest that hexamerization of the PSR2-PP2A complex promotes the opening of the catalytic pocket, whereas the trimeric state may hinder substrate entry into the catalytic pocket.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Hexamerization of PSR2-PP2A holoenzyme is important for PSR2 virulence activity</title><p id="P27">To examine the functional significance of the hexameric form of the PSR2-PP2A holoenzyme, we generated transgenic <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants expressing either PSR2 or PSR2<sup>Q640A/K646A/E647A</sup>.

The most common host targets are proteins, and the protein-protein interactions with specific host target are critical for the virulence activity of the effectors. However, molecular details of the structure-function relationship of effector-target complexes are rarely understood.</p><p id="P29">In this study, we described an effector-target complex, which represents a unique structure of PP2A holoenzyme. The protein phosphatase PP2A functions as a holoenzyme with three different subunits. The core enzyme is highly conserved across the biological kingdoms. Importantly, PP2A core enzyme is commonly targeted by oncogenic viruses in animals, bacterial and <italic>Phytophthora</italic> pathogens in plants, demonstrating its importance in pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In particular, PP2A core enzyme can be hijacked by <italic>Phytophthora</italic> effectors, potentially serve as functional mimics of the substrate-binding subunit in the holoenzyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Here, we solved in the Cryo-EM structure of one of such <italic>Phytophthora</italic> effectors, PSR2, in complex with PP2A core enzyme consisting of a plant A subunit and a human C subunit. This complex forms a novel structure that differs from the known PP2A holoenzymes. Although PSR2 interacts with the A and C subunits of the PP2A core enzyme similarly to endogenous B subunits, its interaction with the C subunit of the opposite core enzyme through a C-terminal region of PSR2 enables the formation of a hexameric holoenzyme. This hexameric assembly not only increases the stability of the PSR2-PP2A complex but also opens the catalytic pocket within the C subunit, potentially facilitating substrate entry and enhancing the virulence function of PSR2. This is consistent with a role of PSR2 that can efficiently hijack the core enzyme from the host.</p><p id="P30">PSR2 and other PP2A core enzyme-interacting <italic>Phytophthora</italic> effectors are composed of (L)WY tandem repeats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. The (L)WY units are structurally conserved but functionally variable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Distinct (L)WY unit or unit combinations can mediate specific interactions with host targets, thus serving as functional modules. Combining different modules is a promising mechanism to promote functional diversification in an effector repertoire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The effectors that hijack the host PP2A core enzyme share the same N-terminal (L)WY-LWY module that mediates interaction with the PP2A A subunit but their C-terminal (L)WY units are variable. We show that the C-terminal LWY7 of PSR2 is critical for forming the hexameric assembly of PSR2-PP2A holoenzyme. A similar LWY unit is absent from most of the other PP2A-interacting effectors. An interesting hypothesis is that the LWY7 was introduced to PSR2 through shuffling of (L)WY unit(s), enhancing its association with the host PP2A core enzyme and thus virulence activity.</p><p id="P31">In summary, our integrative structural and functional analysis of a pathogen effector in a complex with its host target advances a fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying microbial pathogenesis. The knowledge of effector-PP2A holoenzymes has broad implications given the important role of PP2A as a hub that is commonly targeted by various pathogens of human and plants. The molecular details at the effector-PP2A interaction interface offers opportunities to develop novel management strategies of the devastating <italic>Phytophthora</italic> diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Method details</title><sec id="S12"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p id="P32"><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> used for generating transgenic plants and <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> plants were grown in a growth room at 22°C with a 16/8h light/dark regime.
