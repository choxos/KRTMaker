Central to their energy metabolism is a membrane-bound, sodium-translocating methyltransferase complex: the N<sup>5</sup>-tetrahydromethanopterin:CoM-S-methyltransferase (Mtr complex), which catalyzes the methyl transfer between two methanogen specific cofactors. This exergonic methyl transfer step is coupled with a vectorial sodium ion transport from the cytoplasm to the cell exterior and is the only energy conserving step in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Here, we present a 2.1 Å single-particle cryo-EM structure of the full Mtr complex from <italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic>. Our structural model encompasses the entire complex, reveals the arrangement of archaeal phospholipids, the architecture of the sodium ion binding site, and the structure and interactions of all catalytic subunits. Most strikingly, we discover and characterize MtrI, a previously unannotated small open reading frame (small ORF), encoded protein (&lt;100 aa) conserved across the order of Methanosarcinales. MtrI binds to the cytoplasmic domain of MtrA in response to oxygen exposure, suggesting a role in oxygen stress response and protection. By binding on top of the sodium channel and anchoring to the cobamide cofactor in MtrA’s cytoplasmic domain, MtrI might prevent sodium leakage and inhibit MtrA-CoM turnover. These findings offer new insights into methanogen energy conservation and uncover a potential adaptive response to oxygen exposure, expanding our understanding of methanogen survival strategies under oxidative stress.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Methanogenic archaea are widespread in different environments with high abundancies growing under strictly anaerobic conditions and are crucial for the last step in anaerobic degradation of organic matter. They represent the only organisms to produce methane as a catabolic end product of their energy metabolism. Consequently, they produce approximately one gigaton of this climate relevant gas (greenhouse gas) per year (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Thauer, 1998</xref>). There are several, phylogenetically not related pathways of methanogenesis using different substrates: e.g., hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub>), acetoclastic methanogenesis (acetate) and methylotrophic methanogenesis (e.g. methylamines and methanol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Deppenmeier <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kurth, Op den Camp and Welte, 2020</xref>). A pivotal step in all methanogenic routes is catalyzed by the membrane-bound N<sup>5</sup>-methyltetrahydromethanopterin:coenzyme M methyltransferase complex (Mtr), which mediates the exergonic transfer of a methyl group from methyl-tetrahydromethanopterin (methyl-H<sub>4</sub>MPT) or methyl-tetrahydrosarcinapterin (H<sub>4</sub>SPT in some species) to HS-CoM (ΔG°’ = -30 kJ/mol), coupled to sodium ion translocation across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Müller, Blaut and Gottschalk, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Gärtner <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Weiss, Gärtner and Thauer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Lienard <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). This sodium-motive force drives chemiosmotic energy conservation and ATP synthesis via a Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent ATP synthase, forming the basis of what is often referred to as sodium-based bioenergetics in methanogenic archaea. In methylotrophic methanogens that disproportionate methanol into methane and CO<sub>2</sub>, this reaction is reversed: the sodium ion gradient is used to drive the endergonic methyl transfer from methyl-CoM back to H<sub>4</sub>MPT. Similarly, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) oxidize methane to CO<sub>2</sub> operate the methanogenetic pathway and thus the Mtr enzyme entirely in reverse.</p><p id="P3">Mtr complexes in methanoarchaea have been studied by biochemical and genetic approaches for more than thirty years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gottschalk and Thauer, 2001</xref>). It has been known for a long time, that Mtr complexes consist of eight subunits (MtrABCDEFGH), of which the corresponding genes are organized in an operon, which is constitutively expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Harms <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>). The full Mtr complex was found to have an apparent molecular mass of about 650 kDa, concluding a heterotrimeric complex (MtrABCDEFGH)<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Upadhyay <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). This heterotrimeric complex consists of the cytosolic catalytical domains and a large membrane portion including the sodium channel. Thereby, MtrC, D and E are the largest integral membrane subunits, MtrA, B, F and G contain membrane anchors and MtrH is the soluble component in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gottschalk and Thauer, 2001</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Structural data on Mtr are currently limited to a partial cryo-EM reconstruction of the membrane subunits and an X-ray structure of the MtrA shuttle domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aziz <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Wagner, Ermler and Shima, 2016</xref>), excluding the cytoplasmic MtrH and full-length MtrA components. While incomplete, these structures provide key insights—most notably the identification of a sodium-binding site in the MtrE subunit involving the conserved Asp187, previously implicated in sodium ion transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gottschalk and Thauer, 2001</xref>). A second putative Na<sup>+</sup> binding site and a coenzyme M (CoM) molecule were tentatively assigned within the central MtrC cavity, though these remain to be functionally validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aziz <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). Additionally, the crystal structure of MtrA revealed a unique corrinoid-binding mode, distinct from known B12-binding proteins, utilizing a Rossmann-fold domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Wagner, Ermler and Shima, 2016</xref>). However, the absence of a full complex structure in a catalytically competent state continues to limit mechanistic understanding of sodium-coupled methyl transfer.</p><p id="P5">While much focus has been on mechanistic studies to elucidate the mechanism of sodium translocation, relatively little attention has been paid to the regulation and integration of Mtr within the broader cellular context. In particular, the mechanisms governing Mtr regulation, as well as its potential modulation in response to environmental cues, are poorly understood.</p><p id="P6">Recent advances in ribosome profiling and quantitative proteomics have revealed an additional regulatory layer in prokaryotes, mediated by small proteins encoded by small open reading frames (sORFs). Defined as polypeptides typically shorter than 100 amino acids, these proteins are frequently omitted from genome annotations due to size thresholds, yet have emerged as widespread and functionally diverse regulators across bacteria and archaea. Expression profiling showed that many small proteins accumulate under specific growth conditions or are induced by stress arguing for a role in regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Burton, Zeinert and Storz, 2024</xref>). However, information regarding a specific physiological role of verified small proteins is frequently lacking for the majority of confirmed small proteins. For <italic>M. mazei,</italic> we recently reported on 314 previously non-annotated small ORF encoded small proteins, several of them regulated in response to nitrogen stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Tufail <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). Although their precise roles remain to be established, the observed condition-dependent expression patterns raise the possibility that some may modulate key metabolic processes, including Mtr complex function or responses to environmental stressors.</p><p id="P7">In this study, we present the single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the complete Mtr complex from <italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic>, obtained at a resolution of 2.1 Å in C<sub>1</sub>. Our results detail the overall architecture of the complex, including tightly bound archaeal phospholipids and interaction of the MtrH methyltransferase subunits. Further, we identify the binding of a small protein, termed MtrI, to the cytoplasmic domain of MtrA, a previously unknown interactor conserved within the order Methanosarcinales. This binding is redox-dependent and occurs in response to cellular oxygen exposure, suggesting a potential role for MtrI in a protective mechanism against oxygen, supporting the adaptation of Methanosarcinales to microoxic environments in their natural habitats.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The Mtr complex forms a distinct cloverleaf-shaped architecture</title><p id="P8">To achieve gentle purification of the entire Mtr complex of <italic>M. mazei</italic>, a plasmid-borne variant of MtrE carrying a C-terminal TwinStrep-tag (TS-tag) was introduced into wild-type <italic>M. mazei</italic>, facilitating one-step affinity purification. This was achieved by employing an optimized version of the Methanosarcina shuttle plasmid harboring the tagged MtrE subunit under the robust constitutive McrB promoter.</p><p id="P9">Membrane fractions obtained from methanol-grown cells harvested during the exponential phase were solubilised using either n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM) or lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG). Following solubilization, Strep-Tactin affinity purification of the tagged MtrE successfully yielded a homogenous sample of the complete MtrA-H complex. The integrity and purity of the purified complex were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, western blotting, size-exclusion chromatography, mass photometry, and tandem mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1, a-e</xref>). Mass photometry determined the molecular mass to be approximately 763 kDa, indicative of the full trimeric complex embedded within a detergent micelle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supp. Fig. 1, c</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To unveil the molecular architecture of the Mtr complex, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) single-particle analysis was performed on the LMNG-solubilised sample. This analysis yielded an asymmetric reconstruction of the entire complex at a nominal resolution of 2.1 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2, Supp. Data Table 1</xref>). The Mtr core complex consists of a trimer of a hetero-nonameric protomers, each composed of three multi-spanning subunits (MtrCDE), four single-spanning subunits (MtrABFG), and a dimeric cytoplasmic methyltransferase MtrH. The trimerization interface is formed by the single-spanning subunits MtrABFG, creating a dodecameric core. Notably, these subunits possess an unusual length, extending twice the thickness of the membrane, forming a central stalk that protrudes towards the cytoplasm. This stalk interacts with three pseudo-symmetric heterotrimers formed by the multi-spanning subunits (MtrCDE), resulting in a three-fold symmetric, cloverleaf-shaped architecture.</p><p id="P11">One of the stalk subunits, MtrA, features a cytoplasmic corrinoid-binding domain, MtrA<sub>cyt</sub>, connected via a long, flexible linker. This domain harbours the 5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide cofactor (Factor III), that serves as mobile carrier element in the methyltransferase reaction. Our cryo-EM analysis revealed that only a subset of particles exhibited a well-resolved MtrA<sub>cyt</sub> domain bound to a single MtrCDE subcomplex, resulting in an overall asymmetry of the complex. Furthermore, regions encompassing MtrH and MtrA<sub>cyt</sub> are highly flexible, llimiting the local resolution. To improve resolution in these flexible regions, we performed masked 3D-classification, 3D variability analysis and local refinements, yielding focused maps with resolutions of 2.5 Å for MtrAcyt and 3.2 Å for MtrH. Combining these maps enabled the generation of a composite map encompassing the full complex, which in turn allowed us to obtain a complete atomic model of the asymmetric Mtr complex.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The central stalk forms a tight hydrophobic seal that prevents ion leakage</title><p id="P12">The cytoplasmic section of the stalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 A(i), B(i)</xref>), features three straight helices from chain MtrA at its core, spanning residues A:177–210. Surrounding these, the helices from chains F, B, and G are arranged in a clockwise orientation (viewed from the membrane towards the cytosol) relative to chain A, aligning almost parallel to it. Hydrophobic interactions mediate this organization, resulting in a tetrameric assembly (ABFG) on each side of the trimeric core, forming a trimer of tetramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). This arrangement creates a vestibule connected to the cytoplasmic solvent, as indicated by resolved water molecules in our structure. This vestibule is closed at the border to the membrane plane by three phenylalanines (Phe210) from MtrA. In the membrane plane, the three MtrA helices bend outwards and are replaced as the core of the stalk by the MtrG helices (G44-G66), which form a three-helix bundle along the threefold axis. This bundle, characterised by conserved hydrophobic residues across methanogenic species, together with Phe210 from MtrA, acts as a tight hydrophobic seal that prevents ion leakage during conformational changes within the Mtr complex. Notably, helix B is discontinuous, featuring a cytosol-protruding loop spanning residues Pro56 to Thr70, which interacts directly with the membrane-spanning subunit MtrE. Additionally, helices F and B wrap around and cross each other between residues MtrF:42–53 and MtrB:71–80, causing a pronounced tilt of MtrF away from the threefold axis. This disruption breaks local tetrameric arrangement within the transmembrane region. Within the resulting gap, a minimum of five well-defined archaeal ether lipids are bound per trimer. The density quality allowed us to model a total of 15 lipids, though additional lipids may be present. These lipids are deeply embedded in the complex, acting as integral non-protein structural components of the Mtr complex, bridging and stabilising interactions between membrane-spanning subunits. Guided by our well-resolved cryo-EM map, the surrounding local environments, and considering the most abundant lipid species in <italic>Methanosarcina</italic> (Sprott <italic>et al</italic>., 1994), we modelled these embedded lipids as either archaeol or 2-hydroxy-archaeol (2,3-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol) bearing the polar headgroups phosphatidylethanolamine and monophosphate or phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The dimeric methyltransferase MtrH</title><p id="P13">Like other related methyltransferase systems, MtrH exists as a homodimer of two MtrH monomers, each adopting a triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel fold. The structure reveals that three MtrH dimers are bound, resulting in a total of six MtrH copies within in the complex. Similarly to its closest known structural relative MtgA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Badmann and Groll, 2020</xref>) the TIM-barrel is formed by eight parallel ß-strands in its center, enclosed and connected by helices. The MtrH monomers dimerise via their C-terminal helices. The resulting MtrH dimer associates with the end of a three-stranded β-sheet formed by the N-terminal region of MtrB (residues 1–23; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). This ensures that MtrH consistently binds with the same orientation, positioning the TIM-barrel of the membrane-proximal MtrH (MtrH<sub>p</sub>) to be opened in a clockwise way, as viewed from the membrane towards the cytosol. Such an orientation facilitates binding of the cytoplasmic domain of the methyl-group carrying MtrA. As the active sites of the MtrH dimer face in opposite directions, with only one oriented toward MtrA, it suggests that only the membrane-proximal MtrH<sub>p</sub> is functionally relevant.</p><p id="P14">The interaction between the strands of MtrB and MtrH is mainly mediated by small hydrophobic residues that form a shape complementary to the hydrophobic binding pocket between the MtrH-dimerisation interface. In addition, it is stabilized via saltbridges between Arg5<sub>MtrB</sub> and Asp5<sub>MtrH</sub> as well as Glu9<sub>MtrB</sub> and Arg211<sub>MtrH</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig3C, D</xref>). This rather weak interface also explains the often occurring loss of the methyltransferase in native purification procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Upadhyay <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To better understand Tetrahydrosarcinapterin (H<sub>4</sub>SPT) binding by MtrH, we superposed our MtrH structure with the structure of the homologous methyltransferase MtgA in complex with Methyltetrahydrofolate (mH<sub>4</sub>F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Badmann and Groll, 2020</xref>, PDB: 6SJN). Although the ligand is not present in the structure, the superposition reveals a highly conserved arrangement of residues within the pterin-binding site, suggesting a conserved mode of pterin-moiety recognition. Residues Asp103, Asn129, Asp196, and Asn230 in MtrH are conserved and correspond to key residues in MtgA, suggesting they play identical roles in both methyltransferases. Additionally, Thr32, Gln75, and His229, which also line the pterin-binding site, are not strictly conserved but preserve properties of their counterparts in MtgA and are therefore likely to fulfill analogous functions. This conservation of the binding environment enabled us to model H<sub>4</sub>SPT into the substrate binding-pocket of MtrH by superposing the mH4F ligand from MtgA. Further, comparative sequence analysis across methanogenic archaea identified an additional conserved feature: a positively charged patch formed by residues Arg239, Lys242, Lys243 at the exit site of the enzymatic cavity. This conserved patch suggests a potential additional binding interface accommodating the polar and negatively charged ribosyl and gamma/alpha-glutamyl tail of H4MPT/SPT. However, confirmation of the exact substrate-binding mode will require an experimental substrate-bound structure of MtrH.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The CED Trimer and the sodium ion binding site</title><p id="P16">Three integral membrane MtrCDE trimers are attached symmetrically around the central MtrABFG stalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The MtrCDE trimer interacts with all components of the central stalk, except for the trimeric core-forming MtrG, and are stabilized by five lipids. Within the MtrCDE trimer only MtrE directly interacts with the stalk subunits, while MtrC and MtrD are positioned on the exterior of the protein complex. Notably, transmembrane helices TM7 and TM8 of MtrD interact specifically with 2-hydroxy-archaeolphosphatidylinositol and archaeolphosphatidylethanolamine lipids.</p><p id="P17">MtrC, MtrD, and MtrE are each composed of six transmembrane helices organized into a pseudo-twofold symmetrical helical bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). This internal symmetry allows TM1-3 to structurally superimpose onto TM4-6. Structural comparisons using DALI reveal that these proteins possess a rare fold with no close structural analogs among other membrane proteins. However, modest similarities exist: MtrE shows resemblance to the heme transporter HmuUV, the vitamin B12 import system permease protein BtuC, and, intriguingly, the sodium-translocating RnfE. Despite low sequence identity, the resemblance to RnfE raises the possibility that this fold may have evolved to mediate sodium translocation under energy-limited conditions.</p><p id="P18">Interestingly, despite the shared overall architecture of MtrC, MtrD and MtrE, the sequence identity between these proteins is relatively low (MtrC–MtrE: 21.36%; MtrD–MtrE: 21.43%; MtrC–MtrD: 25%). This indicates these subunits likely descended from a common ancestor but diverged along distinct evolutionary paths, leading to specialized functions within the complex.</p><p id="P19">Previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gottschalk and Thauer, 2001</xref>), sequence conservation analysis and the hallmark feature of high charge suggested that a signature loop in MtrE was a cytoplasmic loop containing a zinc-binding area. Contrary to this, our structural analysis reveals that this region in MtrE is actually a membrane-embedded element with a loop-helix-loop structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). The previously proposed highly conserved zinc-binding residues Asp25, Asp29, and Glu60, along with the suggested sodium ionbinding site residues Asp183 and Ser28, are in close proximity, forming a hydrophilic, charged pocket within MtrE. This pocket likely forms the sodium ion binding site of the Mtr complex. Our structure shows density consistent with a sodium ion octahedrally coordinated by conserved residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). This finding is in agreement with a previously reported Mtr structure from <italic>Methanothermobacter marburgensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aziz <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>, PDB: 8Q3V), highlighting the conservation of this binding sites in all methanogens.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The small protein MtrI bridges MtrAcyt and the MtrCDE subcomplex</title><p id="P20">Unexpectedly, in our structure, the corrinoid-binding domain of MtrA does not directly interact with the integral membrane MtrCDE subcomplex. Instead, our cryo-EM map indicates that this interaction is bridged by a previously unidentified small helical protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). We employed ModelAngelo (v.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Jamali <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>) to automatically build a model without a sequence input. Using BLASTP with the output-sequence from ModelAngelo, the helical protein was identified as MM_2401, a small protein consisting of only 68 amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3d</xref>). The respective gene is not part of the highly conserved <italic>mtr</italic> operon but represents a stand-alone gene and has so far evaded detection and attention. We named this protein MtrI.</p><p id="P21">MtrI consists of four helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3e</xref>) that are lying atop the cavity of the MtrCDE subcomplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E, F</xref>) stabilized by a series of charged and aromatic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>): Asp38 interacts with Arg118 of MtrE, Phe42 forms aromatic interactions with Tyr66 of MtrC, Arg49 binds Lys224 of MtrD via a bridging water and Asp59 interacts with Thr240 of MtrD. Crucially, the C-terminal residues of MtrI penetrate into the vestibule formed by the three MtrCDE subunits, where it is anchored by an interaction between the C-terminal Glu67 of MtrI and Arg112 of MtrE. This arrangement effectively blocks the central cavity of MtrCDE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Within the other two MtrCDE subcomplexes of the Mtr, we do not observe any MtrI. A stronger density next to Arg112 could be explained in accordance with another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aziz <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>) by a mixture of two partially occupied CoM sites. The presence of MtrI in the cavity, along with its interaction with Arg112, therefore likely occludes the CoM binding site and blocks the sodium channel.</p><p id="P22">Superimposing MtrCDE not containing MtrI with the site of the trimer showing the MtrCDE–MtrI complex reveals no major structural differences. One notable exception is a slight rearrangement of the cytosolic loop in MtrC (residues 65–71), which includes Tyr66, to accommodate MtrI binding.

As noted earlier, MtrA exhibits a distinctive binding mode of the corrinoid cofactor Factor III (FIII), setting it apart from other enzymatic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Wagner, Ermler and Shima, 2016</xref>). A key feature of the interaction between MtrA and MtrI is the direct coordination of the cobalt atom of FIII by Cys40 of MtrI, which serves as the upper axial ligand (2.67 Å) and His85 of MtrA, which acts as the lower axial ligand (2.68 Å). Additional contacts are formed between Tyr44 and Trp34 of MtrI and the porphyrin ring of FIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). These interactions are further stabilized by a network of polar contacts involving Lys20, Asp23 and Arg27 of MtrI and the MtrA residues Tyr113 and Glu115 of the characteristic unstructured insertion domain of MtrA (residues 98-120), as well as Glu60.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>MtrI binding is redox dependent and is triggered by oxygen exposure</title><p id="P26">The unexpected presence of MtrI in our cryo-EM structure prompted us to investigate the significance of its binding on the function of the Mtr complex. If MtrI were essential for the core function of the Mtr complex and directly involved in sodium-translocation, one might expect it to be universally conserved across all methanogens. However, BLAST analysis revealed that MtrI is uniquely present in the order Methanosarcinales.</p><p id="P27">When comparing Methanosarcinales with other methanogenic orders, two major differences stand out: (i) Methanosarcinales can grow on additional substrates, facilitated by the presence of methanophenazines and additional energy-conserving systems that directly affect Mtr function, which e.g. is reversed during methylotrophic growth (methanol, methylamines), and (ii) Methanosarcinales often inhabit oxygen-rich environments. To assess whether MtrI plays a function in mediating one of these physiological traits we grew <italic>M. Mazei</italic> containing the MtrE-TS plasmid on either methanol or H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> and subsequently purified Mtr from these cultures under both aerobic or strictly anaerobic conditions.</p><p id="P28">To quantify MtrI abundance we performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of tryptic peptides derived from purified Mtr. Protein intensities and IBAQ values were calculated using MaxQuant (v.2.6.5.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>) and the MtrI:MtrA iBAQ ratio was used as a semi-quantitative metric to determine MtrI levels. For both growth conditions, H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> and methanol, aerobic purification of the Mtr complex consistently yielded similar levels of MtrI, which remained within the same order of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C, D</xref>). These aerobically purified samples appeared pink, indicating an oxidized Co(III) state. In contrast, Mtr samples purified under strictly anoxic conditions -yielding a brown-coloured sample that indicates a reduced Co(II) or Co(I) state -exhibited markedly lower levels of MtrI across both growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C,D</xref>). These findings suggest that MtrI association requires the oxidized Co(III) state of the corrinoid cofactor. Thus, MtrI binding to the Mtr complex appears to be redox-dependent and may be triggered within the cell upon exposure to oxygen.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">This study presents the first structural evidence of a small protein associated with a core bioenergetic complex in Methanoarchaea. This highlights the regulatory potential of small proteins, a class of the proteome that has been historically overlooked due to methodological constraints. Furthermore, our findings substantially advance the mechanistic understanding of the Mtr complex by providing a highly resolved cryo-EM structure in which all subunits are visible, offering new insights into its assembly and organisation. In contrast to previous suggestions of partial binding, our results reveal full occupancy of an MtrH dimer in the stalk region, which clarifies the dimer’s role in the architecture of the complex. This complete structure has also identified a single sodium-binding site, critical for understanding how sodium ion pumping is integrated with methyl transfer reactions in the energy conservation processes of methanogens. Additionally, the structure implicates two possible regions were MtrA may transiently bind -one at the membrane-proximal MtrH<sub>p</sub> TIM-barrel and another at the cavity formed by the MtrCDE trimer, where a potential CoM binding site has been proposed. Such a movement of MtrA could play a role in coupling the methyl transfer reaction with sodium ion pumping through conformational changes. However, despite these advancements, several critical gaps remain in our understanding of how these processes are fully coupled. To resolve this, further structural studies are needed under active turnover conditions.</p><p id="P30">A particularly exciting discovery was the identification of MtrI, a previously uncharacterized small protein encoded by an sORF, tightly associated with the Mtr complex in our preparation. This association was confirmed by reciprocal affinity purification of the Mtr complex using a His6-tagged variant of MtrI expressed in <italic>M. mazei</italic>. Our structure further suggests that MtrI may recognize oxidatively modified or inactive forms of MtrA in the Mtr complex. It is known, that the number of axial ligands that bind to cobalt in cobamide-cofactors is dependent on the redox-state of the cobalt center. In general, Co(I) is ligand-free, Co(II) harbors one axial ligand (either upper or lower) and Co(III) binds two axial ligands (upper and or lower). The presence of Cys40 from MtrI as an upper-axial ligand and His85 of MtrA as a lower-axial ligand suggests a Co(III) oxidation state. This oxidation likely results from oxygen exposure during purification, suggesting that MtrI senses an oxidized cobamide cofactor. By blocking the MtrCDE cavity, MtrI might prevent sodium leakage and inhibit MtrA-CoM turnover. The stability of the Mtr complex under these conditions is uncertain. It could be marked for repair by connectase enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Fuchs <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), activated reductively by as-yet uncharacterized ATP-dependent RaCo enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Huening, Jiang and Krzycki, 2020</xref>), or targeted for degradation. While the exact function of MtrI remains unclear, its association with Methanosarcinales’ adaptation to oxygen exposure is particularly intriguing.</p><p id="P31">Unlike Class I methanogens, Methanosarcinales exhibit greater resilience to microoxic conditions and inhabit diverse environments, such as wetlands, peat bogs, and oxygenated sandy sediments, where they frequently encounter oxygen exposure. The exclusive occurrence of MtrI in Methanosarcinales suggests that it evolved as an adaptation to oxygen-exposed environments. <italic>Methanosarcina</italic> are also known to employ mechanisms such as antioxidant enzymes, including catalase and superoxide reductase, as well as a high-affinity terminal oxidase, cytochrome bd (CydAB), to contend with oxygen and oxidative stress. Changes in thiol-molecule and polyphosphate (polyP) content, along with the development of biofilms, further enhance their ability to withstand oxidative conditions. Further studies are essential to clarify MtrI’s precise role and determine whether it represents a key factor in oxygen resistance, potentially as part of a broader protective mechanism within Methanosarcinales. Besides our finding, there is further recent evidence that small proteins can modulate the activity of the Mtr complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Habenicht <italic>et al</italic>., 2025</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Overall, this study has an impact that extends beyond our understanding of Mtr: it establishes the previously unrecognized role of small proteins in regulating core bioenergetic complexes in methanogenic archaea.

Grids were blotted for 6 seconds with a blot force of 6, while the chamber-atmosphere being kept at 4 °C and 100% humidity.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Data collection and processing</title><p id="P47">Cryo-EM data for LMNG-solubilised Mtr was acquired using Smart EPU Software on a TFS Krios G4 cryo-TEM operating at an accelerating voltage of 300 keV and equipped with a Falcon 4i Direct Electron Detector (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Selectrics Energy Filter set at a 10 eV slit width. Data were acquired at a nominal magnification of 165 000 x corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 0.73 Å. Images were acquired with an exposure dose of 60 e<sup>−</sup> Å<sup>-2</sup> in counting mode and exported as an electron-event representation (EER) file format. A dataset containing 21 552 micrographs was acquired. The entire processing was done in CryoSPARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Punjani <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). The EER files were fractionated into 80 frames, motion corrected using patch motion correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>), followed by contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation. Importing beam-shifts and successive optical grouping (38 groups) improved later estimation of higher order aberrations. Manually picking of 500-600 particles was followed by training of a Topaz model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bepler <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Topaz extract of all micrographs led to an initial particle set of 1.1 million particles. Particles were initially extracted at a box size of 450 pixels and subjected to heterogeneous refinement to sort particles in 3D. An initial map, that was generated from a testing dataset, was used three times as an input seed. One of the three heterogenous refinement output maps, containing 450 704 particles, was further re-extracted at a box size of 576 pixels and refined to 2.44 Å. Masked 3D classification without alignment (20 classes, filtered at 6 Å) was performed by placing a soft mask on the MtrA subunit. Masks were created with ChimeraX map eraser tool or the molmap command, followed by map filtering and successive CryoSPARC import. Six out of 20 classes (139 221 particles) showed MtrA bound to the membrane plane. The particles were subjected to non-uniform refinement followed by reference-based motion correction and another non-uniform refinement yielding the Mtr consensus-map at a resolution of 2.06 Å with C<sub>1</sub>-symmetry. To better resolve MtrA, we applied local refinement using the same MtrA-mask as in the 3D-classification, yielding a local map at a resolution of 2.49 Å. To resolve MtrH, we created a soft mask around the flexible MtrH dimer region and performed 3D variability analysis with five modes to solve at a filtered resolution of 5 Å. Successive 3D Variability Display of a single component in cluster mode led to 20 clusters filtered at 5 Å, seven of which showed MtrH in similar positions. These seven clusters, containing 225 093 particles were further subjected to masked 3D classification using the same MtrH mask. Out of four classes, one (56 229 particles) was locally refined to obtain a map of 3.2 Å resolution. To create a complete Mtr composite map, MtrH was further C<sub>3</sub>-symmetrized using Volume alignment tools with 120° 3D rotations. The composite map was constructed in ChimeraX using the vop max command upon normalizing the maps to the same threshold with vop scale. The final composite incorporated the consensus map, the locally refined MtrA and the C<sub>3</sub>-symmetrized MtrH.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Model building and refinement</title><p id="P48">Initial models were built with AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Jumper <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). To interpret the unknown density between MtrCDE and MtrA, we used ModelAngelo (v.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Jamali <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>) without providing a sequence and using the consensus map as an input. ModelAngelo modelled a continuous peptide of 52 residues into the density. A protein BLAST showed highest similarity to a hypothetical protein that is conserved in <italic>Methanosarcina</italic> species. As the protein was not annotated in the protein database, we performed <italic>tBLASTn</italic> to retrieve the corresponding <italic>M. mazei</italic> sequence. The best-matching result by far was a reading frame of 204 nucleotides encoding a 68-residue protein with the locus name MM_2401 and the UniProt accession Q8PUD4. ChimeraX and Coot (v.0.9.8.91) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Emsley <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>) were used for manual model building. Real-space refinements of models were performed iteratively with the PHENIX-package (v.1.21-5207). Ramachandran, reference model and secondary structure restraints were applied during refinement. CIF files for ligands like the etherlipids were created using AceDRG in the CCP4 suite or eLBOW in PHENIX. Maps were graphically depicted using ChimeraX and Coot.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental information</label><media xlink:href="EMS206215-supplement-Supplemental_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d44aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="P49">We acknowledge the contributions of the cryo-EM Facility of the Philipps-University Marburg.
