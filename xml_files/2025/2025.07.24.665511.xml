Plant Cysteine Oxidases (PCOs) control this step by catalysing the oxidation of an N-terminal Cys residue exposed by ERFVIIs. In the present study, we investigated the functional impact of replacing Arabidopsis PCOs with diverse N-terminal cysteine oxidases (NCOs) from across the three eukaryotic kingdoms, hypothesizing that structural and kinetic differences may influence gene regulation of ERFVII targets under hypoxia and thus impact stress tolerance. Combining structural analyses, <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical characterisation and <italic>in planta</italic> complementation assays we observed that not all tested NCOs are functionally equivalent to the endogenous PCOs. In fact, despite the remarkable conservation of catalytic motifs, we identified key differences in enzyme architecture that appear to affect the enzyme’s capacity to regulate hypoxia responses in plants. Notably, NCO efficiency in oxidising ERFVII peptides inversely correlated with hypoxic gene expression under aerobic conditions and enhanced submergence survival, suggesting that partial ERFVII stabilization primes plants to cope with hypoxia. However, enhanced basal expression of hypoxia-responsive genes in turn correlated negatively with development and biomass accumulation, pointing to a trade-off between growth and stress resilience. Our findings demonstrate that tuning NCO activity can reshape the transcriptional and physiological hypoxia response, suggesting it is possible to enhance plant resilience under fluctuating oxygen conditions through enzyme engineering and precision breeding.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Classification</title><kwd>Biological sciences/Plant Biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><kwd>cysteine dioxygenase</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>flooding</kwd><kwd>oxygen sensing</kwd><kwd>mathematical modelling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Low-O<sub>2</sub> responses in vascular plants rely on proteolytic control of Cys-initiating (N-cys) members of the group VII of the ethylene response factors (ERFVIIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). In angiosperms, additional contribution to accommodate chronic, acute and fluctuating hypoxia is provided by the Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) 2 subunit Vernalization 2 (VRN2) and the LITTLE ZIPPER 2 (ZPR2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P3">These N-cys proteins undergo O<sub>2</sub>-dependent destabilisation via post-translational regulation through the N-degron pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). This involves Plant Cysteine Oxidases (PCOs), non-heme iron (Fe(II))-dependent dioxygenases, which act as main O<sub>2</sub> sensors by catalysing oxidation of the N-terminal cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). The resulting sulfinylated cysteine is recognised for arginylation by arginyltransferase (ATE), which leads to ubiquitination by the E3 Ubiquitin-ligase PROTEOLYSIS 6 (PRT6) and BIG, thereby targeting the protein to the proteasome for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Notably, N-cys degron-mediated proteolysis also requires nitric oxide (NO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Oxygen depletion under hypoxic conditions prevents PCO activity, stabilising N-cys substrates, which then accumulate in the nucleus to trigger the activation of hypoxic response genes, including those coding for anaerobic metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The identification of PCOs in vascular plants led to the discovery that the human homolog, 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (ADO), also acts as an enzymatic O<sub>2</sub> sensor, alongside the Prolyl Hydroxylases (PHDs) and histone demethylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). ADO catalyses the oxidation of N-terminal cysteine residue of N-cys proteins involved in cell signalling such as the regulator of G-protein signalling 4 and 5 (RGS4/5), interleukin-32 (IL-32) and the member 10 of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family (ACAD10), thus modulating angiogenesis, inflammation and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Sequence alignments revealed conserved catalytic site features between PCO and ADO, despite the absence of shared targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Moreover, experiments <italic>in planta</italic> demonstrated the ability of <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> ADO (HsADO) to complement the homozygous quadruple <italic>pco1/pco2/pco4/pco5</italic> (<italic>4pco</italic>) mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). A recent study using an <italic>in vitro</italic> reporter assay also confirmed that HsADO can turn over ERFVII peptides, alongside those corresponding to the endogenous substrates Regulator of G-protein signalling RGS4 and RGS5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Finally, a cross-kingdom survey revealed that N-terminal cysteinyl-dioxygenases (NCOs) are ubiquitously distributed across plants and animals, with PCO-<italic>like</italic> proteins also found in the chytrid lineage of fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The most common cause of acute hypoxia for plants is flooding, due to a four orders of magnitude decrease in the gas-exchange rate in water compared to air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Limitation in O<sub>2</sub> availability severely impacts cell metabolism, including aerobic respiration, leading to reduced ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Upon hypoxia detection, plant cells reconfigure their metabolism to ensure basal energy production even when aerobic respiration is impossible. These include the activation of fermentation and the promotion of starch and sucrose catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). While anaerobic metabolic adaptation is conserved across land plants, recent evidence suggests that ERFVII as N-degron substrates emerged relatively late, with the evolution of vascular plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). O<sub>2</sub> concentrations below aerobic levels have also been reported to occur physiologically in plant tissues such as seeds, ripe fruits, and bulky storage organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). The physiological relevance of oxygen sensing is also highlighted by the developmental defects observed in the homozygous <italic>4pco</italic> mutant, including delayed germination and growth, increased leaf serration, and flower sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Recent studies also demonstrated the establishment of endogenous hypoxic niches in shoot and root meristems, thus designating the role of O<sub>2</sub> as a diffusible signalling molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Additionally, fluctuations in O<sub>2</sub> levels between day and night have been recently reported to impact shoot growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Modulation of the O<sub>2</sub> sensing pathway to anticipate, enhance or redirect regulation of adaptive genes is a highly sought goal of plant hypoxia research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). This can be achieved by interfering with the N-degron substrates, such as the ERFVIIs, or the O<sub>2</sub>-dependent effectors, such as the NCOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Previous studies have showed that increasing the levels or stability of ERFVII transcription factors enhances submergence and hypoxia tolerance in plants: for example, in Arabidopsis, overexpression of RAP2.2, RAP2.12, HRE1, and HRE2 improved tolerance to low-O<sub>2</sub>, though constitutively stable RAP2.12 impaired growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Since constitutive ERFVII stabilisation can be detrimental, precise tuning is necessary to ensure a beneficial effect. Acting on the molecular switch that regulates ERFVIIs in hypoxia, such as N-cys oxidation, could be the key to modulate intensity and dynamics of the molecular response to hypoxia. PCOs are regarded as the ideal target to manipulate, due to their more specialised activity, and thus likely reduced number of substrates, compared to ATE and PRT6/BIG. Moreover, the identification of key residues within PCO enzymes, along with examination of reported and predicted structures of NCO enzymes in which some of these amino acids are not conserved, provides an opportunity to understand how to modulate the activity of these enzymes and to predict the consequences of their molecular engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Predicting hypoxia response dynamics in case of alteration of PCO properties</title><p id="P8">We first assessed the theoretical impact of varying PCO activity or levels on the expression dynamics of a generic <italic>Hypoxia Responsive Gene</italic> (<italic>HRG</italic>) by applying a previously established model based on ordinary differential equation (ODE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). For this prediction, we assumed a simplified cell environment with a single ERFVII (RAP2.12) and a single PCO (PCO4). We calculated the effects of varying <italic>PCO4</italic> expression levels, its Michaelis-Menten constants (<italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic>) for O<sub>2</sub> and RAP2.12, and its catalytic rate constant (<italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Our ODE-based simulations predicted constitutively high <italic>HRG</italic> expression in the case of reduced PCO4 levels or activity. Alteration of substrate affinity (<italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic>) showed high potential to enhance the magnitude of <italic>HRG</italic> induction under hypoxia (1% O<sub>2</sub>). Taken together, these predictions suggest that reducing <italic>PCO</italic> expression or modifying the enzyme to decrease its catalytic rate are effective strategies for priming plants against hypoxia. In contrast, altering substrate affinity is predicted to be an effective strategy to modulate the intensity of the response during hypoxia. We therefore set out to test experimentally whether NCOs with drastically different kinetic parameters would produce the effects predicted by our ODEs model, and whether this would actually help plants to cope with low-O<sub>2</sub> stress.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Sequence and structure divergence among eukaryotic NCOs</title><p id="P9">We next explored the divergence of NCO sequences within the eukaryotic domain. We selected 50 NCO sequences from the animal, plant and fungal kingdoms and reconstructed their phylogeny based on amino acid sequence comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>). This analysis confirmed the taxonomic clustering across the three kingdoms and guided our selection of NCOs for subsequent biochemical characterization. Specifically, we chose <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> ADO (HsADO) and <italic>Amphimedon queenslandica</italic> ADO (AqADO) from the animal kingdom, <italic>Spizellomyces punctatus</italic> ADO (SpADO) from fungi, and <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> PCO (MpPCO), <italic>Klebsormidium nitens</italic> PCO (KnPCO), and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> PCO4 (AtPCO4) from plants. HsADO was included due to its previously demonstrated ability to complement the Arabidopsis <italic>4pco</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). AqADO was chosen as a representative of early metazoan lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). SpADO belonging to the chytrid clade, represented fungal NCOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Finally, MpPCO and KnPCO, from bryophytes and algae, respectively, were selected to explore PCO diversity among non-plant clades that do not have ERFVIIs as Cys-degron substrates. AtPCO4 served as a control throughout the study.</p><p id="P10">We looked into structural differences among the selected NCOs. We relied on the structures which have been solved by X-ray crystallography for AtPCO4 and HsADO (PDB: 6S7E and 7REI, respectively) whereas we used the AlphaFold2-predicted structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) for the remaining NCOs. The core active site, comprised of two β-barrels, is conserved across all six enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a(I)</xref>). Analysis of the internal substrate-binding cavity revealed varying volumes: HsADO and SpADO possessed smaller pockets (276.8 Å<sup>3</sup> and 316.8 Å<sup>3</sup>, respectively) compared to AtPCO4 (568.4 Å<sup>3</sup>). In contrast, AqADO, MpPCO, and KnPCO exhibited cavity volumes comparable to AtPCO4 (681.2 Å<sup>3</sup>, 680.6 Å<sup>3</sup> and 587.3 Å<sup>3</sup>, respectively), suggesting a shared potential to accommodate protein N-termini (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, analysis of the electrostatic potential surrounding the active site revealed notable differences, implying variations in the interaction with substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a(II)</xref>). For example, HsADO and AqADO exhibited a similar predicted three-dimensional structure and overall size to AtPCO4 but displayed more negative electrostatic charge around their active sites. This electrostatic difference could explain the previously demonstrated substrate preference of HsADO for positively charged peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Outside the active site, SpADO featured an additional N-terminal α-helix and an internal loop (residues 250-260) and was more positively charged than AtPCO4 at the C-terminal region. MpPCO and KnPCO showed conservation at the core active site but contained additional internal loops and a less positively charged external surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). When zooming in on the two β-barrel domains (Domain I: residues 96-115, Domain II: residues 164-182 in AtPCO4) that coordinate the iron centre in AtPCO4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>), alignment of these domains revealed high sequence similarity, including conserved histidine residues (H98, H100, H164), which are critical for iron coordination, aspartate (D176) and tyrosine (Y182) proposed to be necessary for substrate binding in AtPCO4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). A high level of sequence similarity for these residues was also found more generally across all the analysed NCO sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To assess the potential for these NCOs to be functionally relevant <italic>in vivo</italic>, we first performed an <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of their interaction with the PCO-substrate RAP2.12<sub>2-15</sub> peptide using molecular docking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). HsADO, AqADO, MpPCO and KnPCO exhibited similar RAP2.12<sub>2-15</sub> molecular trajectories to AtPCO4. Instead, SpADO showed altered positioning, with an additional internal loop for SpADO (residues 254-259, indicated by the orange surface shading) hindering peptide access to the active site.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>NCOs vary in the catalysis ERFVII oxidation</title><p id="P12">To test the ability and efficacy of the six selected NCOs to regulate ERFVIIs in plants, we first compared their kinetic parameters for Arabidopsis RAP2.12 and oxygen. Notably, even among Arabidopsis PCOs, different isoforms exhibit different kinetic activities, with AtPCO4 having the highest catalytic turnover among the five PCOs, potentially influencing substrate preferences and different roles of PCOs under stress or physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Based on this, we hypothesized that NCOs with greater sequence divergence might display even more distinct kinetic properties. While kinetic data for AtPCO4, MpPCO, and KnPCO were already available from previous studies, which demonstrated their oxygen-dependent activity on RAP2.12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>), we extended the analysis to AqADO, HsADO, and SpADO. Therefore, we expressed these three NCO proteins in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified them as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). We determined the kinetic parameters of AqADO and HsADO for a peptide corresponding to the first 14 amino acids of RAP2.12 (RAP2.12<sub>2-15</sub>). Substrate turnover using varying RAP2.12<sub>2-15</sub> concentrations was used to estimate catalytic parameters via Michaelis-Menten fitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Subsequently, we determined the <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> (O<sub>2</sub>) values of AqADO and HsADO with respect to RAP2.12<sub>2-15</sub> oxidation, in order to assess their oxygen-sensing potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P13">It is worth noting that we used 200 μM RAP2.12 peptide in this study to determine oxygen affinity, which is lower than that used to determine kinetic parameters of AtPCO4, MpPCO and KnPCO in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Full kinetic data including standard errors are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1, 2</xref>. These data confirmed that AqADO and HsADO can function as cysteine dioxygenases on the RAP2.12<sub>2-15</sub> peptide in an oxygen-dependent manner, similar to AtPCO4. In contrast, SpADO showed no substrate turnover over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>), indicating its inability to oxidize RAP2.12 <italic>in vitro</italic> (at least under the conditions used in this study) consistent with the <italic>in silico</italic> predictions.</p><p id="P15">Comparative analysis of <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values for RAP2.12<sub>2-15</sub> revealed the highest peptide affinity (11 μM) for MpPCO, even higher than AtPCO4 (690 μM) or any other AtPCOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>), followed by AqADO and HsADO (206 μM and 392 μM, respectively), with KnPCO showing the lowest (914 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). The high affinity of MpPCO for the RAP2.12<sub>2-15</sub> peptide is particularly remarkable considering that even the most affine PCO in Arabidopsis, AtPCO2, has a <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> almost 8 times higher than MpPCO (90 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>).</p><p id="P16">When considering O<sub>2</sub> affinity, MpPCO again showed the lowest <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> (3.2 %) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>), even lower than that reported for any other AtPCOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Additionally, all the other NCOs tested in this assay displayed higher <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> (O<sub>2</sub>) compared to the value of 17.3 % reported for AtPCO4 in the literature, with HsADO exhibiting the lowest affinity (81.5 %). The high affinity of MpPCO for both oxygen and RAP2.12<sub>2-15</sub> determined the highest catalytic efficiency (<italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> / <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>) (0.39 s<sup>-1</sup> μM<sup>-1</sup> for O<sub>2</sub> and 0.75 s<sup>-1</sup> μM<sup>-1</sup> for RAP2.12<sub>2-15</sub>) among all tested NCOs, despite its low catalytic constant (<italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>) (15.5 s<sup>-1</sup> for O<sub>2</sub> and 8.2 s<sup>-1</sup> for RAP2.12<sub>2-15</sub>). Notably, MpPCO and KnPCO exhibited the highest and similar levels of catalytic efficiency towards O<sub>2</sub> (0.39 s<sup>-1</sup> μM<sup>-1</sup> and 0.17 s<sup>-1</sup> μM<sup>-1</sup>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). This suggests that MpPCO and KnPCO could be catalytically active in plant cells, and thus repress ERFVII accumulation, even at low-O<sub>2</sub> concentrations.</p><p id="P17">In contrast, AqADO showed kinetic values for O<sub>2</sub> similar to those of AtPCO4 but had a higher RAP2.12<sub>2-15</sub> peptide affinity. This indicates that AqADO would respond similarly to AtPCO4 under decreasing O<sub>2</sub> concentrations; however its strong peptide affinity suggests a stronger interaction with ERFVII substrates, which could enhance the substrate recognition and therefore NCO activity. Finally, HsADO showed comparable catalytic efficiency towards RAP2.12<sub>2-15</sub> compared to AtPCO4, but reduced affinity for O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Although this may reflect the conditions under which this parameter was determined, it nevertheless suggests that HsADO may be unable to effectively target ERFVII in mild hypoxic conditions.</p><p id="P18">We next predicted the impact of these kinetic parameters on gene expression under hypoxia. We integrated the kinetic values of each NCO into the above-described ODE-based model to simulate generic hypoxia-responsive gene (<italic>HRG</italic>) expression under hypoxic conditions (1% O<sub>2</sub> v/v) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>). As expected, the model predicted no <italic>HRG</italic> induction in hypoxia with MpPCO, whereas control of RAP2.12 by AqADO, HsADO and KnPCO increased <italic>HRG</italic> levels compared to the levels obtained with AtPCO4.</p><p id="P19">To validate the predictions on cysteine dioxygenase activity of the selected NCOs, we utilized yeast as a heterologous expression system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3g</xref>). Yeast, possessing the Arg/N-degron pathway components (ATE1 and UBR1) but lacking endogenous NCOs and ERFVIIs, provides a suitable environment for assessing NCO activity without interference. We co-transformed yeast cells with each of the NCO enzymes and the Dual Luciferase Orthogonal Reporter (DLOR) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), enabling <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation of NCO catalytic activity. Co-transformed yeast cells were subjected to hypoxia (1% O<sub>2</sub> v/v) or normoxia (21% O<sub>2</sub> v/v) for 6 hours. As expected, the ERFVII-based, Cys2-substrate was stabilized under hypoxia in yeast expressing AtPCO4. Significant substrate stabilization was also observed in yeast expressing AqADO, HsADO, and MpPCO. Conversely, KnPCO expression did not result in RAP2.12 accumulation under hypoxia.

Remarkably, the overlap between differentially expressed genes was extremely limited among NCO-expressor lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). GO enrichment analysis revealed that expression of all three NCOs led to the up-regulation of low oxygen inducible genes, although only MpPCO-expressors exhibited higher levels of core hypoxia-response genes, especially those that require ERFVII for their up-regulation, under low oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8c</xref>).

While it is difficult to explain the enhanced growth and biomass accumulation observed for <italic>AqADO</italic>-expressing plants based on the DEGs list, on the other hand the reduced size of <italic>MpPCO</italic>-expressors is potentially associated with the activation of the hypoxic response under aerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c-d</xref>), as observed in case of constitutive ERFVII stabilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). These observations suggest that reduced <italic>in planta</italic> activity of these NCOs toward PCO substrates may lead to incomplete repression of the hypoxia response under normoxic conditions. However, the little overlap in DEGs suggests that, while HsADO and AqADO, differently from MpPCO, can effectively repress ERFVII activity, other substrates could evade the cysteine dioxygenation catalysed by them and trigger signalling events that result in alteration of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>NCOs with reduced activity on ERFVII increased tolerance to submergence</title><p id="P26">Finally, we investigated the effect of different NCO enzymes on the plant's low-O<sub>2</sub> response.

Statistical analysis revealed a significant increase in the expression of all three hypoxia-responsive genes in MpPCO #1 plants under normoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9a</xref>). Also, MpPCO #2 exhibited a tendency towards elevated <italic>HRG</italic> expression in air, although this increase was not statistically significant. As expected, hypoxia induced expression of these genes in all genotypes. Notably, both HsADO-complemented lines and MpPCO #1 plants showed significantly higher expression levels compared to all other genotypes, including the AtPCO4 #1 control. Upon reoxygenation, <italic>HRGs</italic> expression decreased, though MpPCO #1 and, for <italic>ADH1</italic>, MpPCO #2, maintained higher expression relative to other genotypes. These findings suggest that the specific activity of each NCO enzyme can differentially modulate the hypoxic response of plants, with MpPCO leading to constitutively higher expression of hypoxia-responsive genes, which persisted during reoxygenation.</p><p id="P27">Next, we assessed the impact of NCO enzyme complementation on tolerance to low-O<sub>2</sub> stress. 17-day-old soil-grown plants were subjected to full submergence in the dark for 2.5, 3, or 3.5 days. Control plants were maintained in the dark for 3.5 days. Following desubmergence and a 4-day recovery period under standard photoperiod conditions, survival rates were determined. Across all time points, <italic>MpPCO</italic>-expressing lines and <italic>AtPCO4</italic> #2 demonstrated enhanced survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b, c</xref>).

Already under dark conditions, these genotypes displayed slower growth and, for <italic>MpPCO</italic>-expressing lines, reduced biomass accumulation compared to the AtPCO4 #1 control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d</xref>), consistent with the previous fresh weight and seed area measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>). To further investigate their tolerance, we assessed tissue damage by categorizing plants as 'dead', 'alive', or 'damaged' (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9b</xref>).

The motivation to undertake such a broadly cross-species approach relies on the opportunity offered by natural variation in the three eukaryotic kingdoms to explore the evolutionary space available for N-terminal cysteine oxidases. Our results confirm that variations in NCO sequences, structures and kinetic properties do impact Cys2-substrate activity, and show how this affects plant growth and development. This transgenic substitution alters the basal expression levels of genes involved in the adaptations to low oxygen availability and their dynamics when cells experience fluctuations in oxygen availability, ultimately affecting the plant’s capacity to cope with submergence conditions.</p><p id="P30">Although NCOs are ubiquitously found in plants and animals, the number of intra-specific variants varies between kingdoms. While only one or two isoform variants are found in metazoans, in flowering plants, where they constitute the main cellular oxygen sensor, their number expanded remarkably, even when considering genome duplication events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). The observation that this is not the case for the other enzymes that participate to the N-cys-degron, such as ATE and PRT6/UBR, suggests the need, in flowering plants, for finely-tuned control of N-cys substrate stability, and the opportunity to achieve this through a cell-specific suite of PCO isoforms. For example, thorough characterisation of Arabidopsis PCOs has revealed that isoforms with limited sequence diversity exhibit rather distinct kinetic activities, potentially influencing substrate preferences and different roles of PCOs under stress or physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that NCOs with higher sequence divergence might have even more diverse kinetics.</p><p id="P31">Indeed, a comparison of six NCO from across the eukaryotic domain revealed even greater differences in affinity for the canonical ERFVII peptide and for O<sub>2</sub>, and activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a-e</xref>). This is most likely due to differences in sequence and structure among the enzymes, which impact, besides catalysis, substrate interaction and selectivity. Phylogenetic and structural analyses confirmed that NCOs are conserved across eukaryotic lineages, not only in their primary amino acid sequences but also in core structural features, such as the β-barrel catalytic pocket and residues essential for the iron coordination and substrate interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). These conserved features support a shared enzymatic mechanism and a potentially ancestral functional role. Nevertheless, we observed key structural variations among homologs, particularly in electrostatic surface charge distribution and substrate pocket volume. Such divergence likely reflects lineage-specific substrate specialization, consistent with the kingdom-specificity of known NCO targets such as plant ERFVIIs and animal RGS proteins. Our docking simulations further support this hypothesis, as the fungal SpADO displayed divergent docking trajectories for the Arabidopsis RAP2.12 peptide, suggesting substrate incompatibility. These findings also highlight the usefulness of <italic>in silico</italic> modelling in predicting substrate interaction, particularly for peptide-like substrates.</p><p id="P32">It is plausible that some of the tested NCOs, including ADO, may also turn over small thiol-containing molecules rather than peptide-based substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). In such cases, structural features like differences in the binding pocket volume may be indicative of this substrate preference, although further biochemical validation is needed. Importantly, while structural and docking data can be informative, they do not always correlate with <italic>in vivo</italic> function. For instance, SpADO exhibited a markedly altered three-dimensional structure, including an additional loop potentially occluding the active site, and failed to catalyse RAP2.12 oxidation <italic>in vitro</italic> or complement the <italic>4pco</italic> mutant phenotype. Conversely, KnPCO, despite showing minimal structural deviation, was similarly inactive, suggesting potential adaptation to non-angiosperm-specific substrates or limitations in our docking approach, which focused on peptide segments rather than full proteins.</p><p id="P33">Variation in sequence and structure is also likely to impact the interaction with other proteins, including potential post-translational regulators of PCO activity. Y2H and co-immunoprecipitation surveys indicate only few potential interactions of Arabidopsis PCOs, PCO2 with the SEC5A subunit of the exocyst complex, PCO3 with the sulfurtransferase SUFE1 and PCO5 with the subunit 5A COP9 signalosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). While this study was not designed to explore this aspect of PCO regulation, it can explain the discrepancy between the predicted and measured effects of NCOs and HRGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f-g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a</xref>). The DLOR assay in yeast, where NCO expression levels are substantially comparable across cells, exhibited a trend of enhanced substrate stability in hypoxia for <italic>HsADO</italic>- and <italic>AqADO-</italic>expressing cells. However, the model indeed overestimated KnPCO and MpPCO capacity to induce Cys2-substrate degradation. This could raise doubts about the capacity of our ODE-based model to effectively predict the effect NCO substitutions on HRG expression. As stated above, protein-protein interactions are likely to impact this. Additional complications are determined by cell heterogeneity in plant tissues and the impact of NCO and ERFs transcription and translation towards the determination of <italic>HRG</italic> expression. Because of well-known feedback mechanisms such as <italic>ERFVIIs</italic> and <italic>PCOs</italic> gene induction by hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), <italic>HRG</italic> expression prediction are especially challenging in plants.</p><p id="P34">Despite the afore-described limitations, our approach defines an effective pipeline for improving the control of hypoxia responses that can be conveniently conjugated with the rational-design or directed evolution of NCO. When applied through precise gene editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>), this has the potential to affect the plant’s ability to respond to hypoxia exactly in the desired trajectory, as the impact on gene expression in this case would be negligible. This is crucial, when looking at the phenotypes observed for plants grown under aerobic conditions in this study. Substitution of PCO4 with HsADO, AqADO, and MpPCO affected rosette biomass accumulation, flowering time, and seed size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). This phenotypic variability suggests that differences in kinetic efficiency or substrate interaction dynamics markedly influence growth and developmental outcomes. For example, AtPCO4 #2 line exhibited only mild <italic>HRG</italic> induction and yet showed marked developmental delays, consistent with computational predictions that reduced <italic>PCO</italic> expression drives <italic>HRG</italic> upregulation. Similarly, HsADO, characterized by a smaller pocket volume and reduced catalytic efficiency toward O<sub>2</sub>, also led to altered phenotypes in planta, including trends toward increased <italic>HRG</italic> expression, albeit without statistically significant differences. These results suggest that phenotypic differences likely reflect organ or tissue-specific roles for NCOs, associated with the need to regulate different substrates. The N-cys-degron substrates identified so far participate to various developmental processes, including root and leaf development and shoot apical meristem activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). The comparison of transcript profiles of <italic>AqADO</italic>- and <italic>MpPCO</italic>-expressing plants compared to PCO4-complemented ones suggest the existence of additional substrates. There are more than 200 MC-proteins in Arabidopsis, and more Cys2-proteins can be created by endoproteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>).</p><p id="P35">When evaluating the effect of flooding, plants complemented with MpPCO and HsADO, which exhibited delayed seed germination, slow vegetative development, and late flowering, displayed enhanced submergence survival. These findings suggest that a trade-off may exist between growth and stress tolerance. One possibility is that enhanced hypoxic response in low-efficiency NCO-complementing lines directly influence developmental and growth regulators. However, it is also plausible that the altered phenotype is due to the regulation of other N-degron targets, such as VRN2 or ZPR2, which are known to play roles in flowering and developmental transitions. Alternatively, the link may be indirect: delayed development could allocate fewer resources to growth and more to survival mechanisms when plants experience stress. This aligns with prior studies on strategies evolved by plants to reduce growth to improve flooding tolerance due to enhanced carbon storage or metabolic flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>).</p><p id="P36">We consider this approach particularly valuable given the expanding roles of ERFVIIs in responding to drought, heat, salt, oxidative, and osmotic stresses, often mediated through ABA and ROS signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>).</p><p id="P37">The elevated basal hypoxic response in MpPCO lines suggests partial stabilization of ERFVIIs under normoxia. This is supported by prior mutagenesis studies in <italic>AtPCO4</italic>, where disruption of substrate-binding residues (e.g., H164 and D176) resulted in increased <italic>HRG</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). While this constitutive activation is not necessarily advantageous under normal conditions, it raises the question as to whether constitutive or elevated <italic>HRG</italic> expression could enhance hypoxia tolerance by priming the response system. A similar concept has been observed in ethylene-treated plants, where <italic>PHYTOGLOBIN1</italic> induction enhances flooding tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). Similarly, pre-exposure to waterlogging has been shown to improve stress resilience via redox, transcriptional, and metabolic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). Finally, N-degron signalling has been previously linked to chromatin remodelling, via the VRN2 substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), both of which could contribute to long-term priming to low oxygen stress. It remains an open question whether a moderate, constitutive hypoxic signature, as observed in the <italic>MpPCO</italic>-expressing lines, is broadly beneficial or if it risks detrimental trade-offs under non-stress conditions. These observations highlight the broader role of ERFVII signalling beyond hypoxia. NCO-mediated differential RAP2.12 stability likely affects redox homeostasis, with implications for both hypoxic stress and the subsequent reoxygenation. Modulation of ERFVIIs has been shown to impact H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signalling and activate specific transcriptional responses during reoxygenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>). The phenotypic variability observed across our complemented lines likely reflects differences in energy use, redox homeostasis, and developmental state. Given this, modulating ERFVII stability via NCO activity has far-reaching implications for plant stress resilience more generally.</p><p id="P38">In summary, our findings reveal that, while the core NCO structure is conserved across eukaryotes, variations in kinetic properties, substrate pocket size and electrostatic surface potential significantly alter downstream hypoxic responses <italic>in planta</italic>, development and stress tolerance. This is evidenced by the differential complementation phenotypes in the Arabidopsis <italic>4pco</italic> mutant and the enhanced submergence tolerance observed in lines expressing less efficient <italic>NCO</italic> variants. These differences reflect a complex interplay between enzyme expression and kinetics, developmental regulation and ability to promptly respond to an environmental cue. By integrating structural, biochemical, and physiological analyses, this data highlights the potential for tuning the hypoxic response through targeted engineering of PCO and ultimately improve plant survival under low oxygen stress.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Phylogenetic analysis</title><p id="P39">Phylogenetic analyses were performed using MEGA X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>).

statement</title></caption><p>Control of low oxygen responses to improve crop flooding tolerance is a long-sought objective of molecular plant breeders. The oxygen-dependent oxidation of N-terminal cysteines in transcription factors is thought to be a key step in modulating the transcriptional response to hypoxia. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by substituting endogenous N-terminal cysteine dioxygenases with homologues from different species characterized by highly divergent sequences, structures, and kinetic properties. We show that indeed these variations effectively and predictably influence gene transcription in plants exposed to hypoxia, thereby affecting their tolerance to submergence. However, we also demonstrate that, unexpectedly, these substitutions impact plant growth and development under aerobic conditions, revealing a trade-off between flooding stress resilience and biomass accumulation or yield.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Hypoxic gene induction as a function of PCO features.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Oxygen-dependent regulation of ERFVIIs in flowering plants. ERFVII substrates are characterized by an N-terminal cysteine which, in presence of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is targeted for oxidation by Plant Cysteine Oxidases (PCOs). The resulting Cys-sulfinic or Cys-sulfonic acid triggers proteasomal degradation of ERFVIIs. The activity of PCOs is influenced by their expression levels as well as their kinetic parameters (<italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>) for substrates such as RAP2.12 and O<sub>2</sub>. In the absence of O<sub>2</sub>, PCOs are unable to oxidize the N-terminal cysteine, leading to stabilization of the ERFVIIs, which in turn can enter the nuclei and activate <italic>HRG</italic> by binding the hypoxia-responsive promoter element (HRPE).
