production. In species A rotaviruses, the disordered protein NSP5 forms condensates in cells via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Yet the sequence diversity of NSP5 raises the question of whether condensate formation is conserved across all strains and if distinct variants employ alternative mechanisms for nucleating phase separation. Using a machine learning approach, we demonstrate that NSP5 variants differ significantly in their propensity to phase-separate. We engineered a variant incorporating amino acid signatures from strains with low LLPS tendency, which failed to phase separate in vitro yet supported the formation of replicative condensates in recombinant viruses in cells. Low-tendency LLPS strains require phosphorylation of NSP5 to nucleate phase separation, whereas high-tendency strains do not, suggesting distinct nucleation mechanisms. Furthermore, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry revealed a phosphorylation-driven allosteric switch between binding sites on the high-propensity variant. These findings establish that phosphorylation plays a context-dependent role in the formation of replicative organelles across diverse rotaviruses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) underpins the formation of cellular compartments lacking a membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>) including P-bodies, stress granules, and nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Brangwynne et al., 2011</xref>, 2009). LLPS is driven by weak interactions between multivalent, polymer-like molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Brangwynne et al., 2015</xref>). This mechanism is commonly explained using the “stickers and spacers” model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Choi et al., 2020</xref>), where “stickers” refer either to side chain interactions within intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Martin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) or to interactions involving folded domains that recognise specific binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Banani et al., 2016</xref>). Regions separating the stickers, known as spacers, modulate interactions mediated by the stickers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ginell and Holehouse, 2023</xref>). The hub-and-driver model describes a system in which a “hub” molecule characterised by a low intrinsic propensity for LLPS binds to “driver” molecules whose IDRs confer a higher LLPS propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Galagedera et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P5">While LLPS is predominantly governed by inherent physico-chemical characteristics of macromolecules, understanding the emergent properties of condensates presents a formidable task. Due to their minimalistic proteomes, viruses provide excellent models for dissecting the roles of a relatively small number of components that drive LLPS, and indeed, many viruses employ LLPS to form viral factories that support their replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Borodavka and Acker, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Heinrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Monette et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Nikolic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Group A rotaviruses (RVA) represent a large and diverse class of important double-stranded RNA pathogens that infect humans and other animals worldwide. Several RVA strains that infect mammals, including simian SA11 and RRV, bovine RF, and porcine OSU have all been shown to form cytoplasmic replication factories, termed viroplasms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Campagna et al., 2007</xref>; Carrenno-Torres et al., 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Geiger et al., 2021</xref>). Viroplasms represent protein-RNA condensates formed via LLPS of the non-structural protein NSP5 and the RNA chaperone NSP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Geiger et al., 2021</xref>). While both proteins are required for nucleating phase separation <italic>in vitro</italic>, NSP5 is believed to be the LLPS scaffold/driver, and NSP2 is a major client/hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Geiger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Nichols et al., 2023</xref>). The onset of viroplasm formation depends on the expression levels of both proteins, and on the multiplicity of infection and its duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Geiger et al., 2021</xref>). The 35 kDa RNA chaperone NSP2 forms an octamer with positively charged grooves involved in NSP5/RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Bravo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Jayaram et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Jiang et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, NSP5 is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) harbouring an 18 amino acid C-terminal homo-oligomerisation region (CTR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Geiger et al., 2021</xref>). Removal of the CTR renders the remaining IDR unable to drive LLPS when mixed with NSP2 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Geiger et al., 2021</xref>). Amino acids 1 - 33 and the CTR of NSP5 are involved in binding to NSP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arnoldi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Eichwald et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Fabbretti et al., 1999</xref>). During infection, the 21 kDa NSP5 undergoes a phosphorylation cascade leading to the formation of phospho-isoforms ranging from 26 kDa to 35 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Afrikanova et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Eichwald et al., 2004a</xref>). In the cell-culture adapted strain SA11, nine phosphorylation sites, including Ser2/4, Ser30, Ser37, Ser42, Ser56, Ser67, Ser101, Ser127, and Ser164, have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Sotelo et al., 2010</xref>). These residues undergo phosphorylation following the initial phosphorylation of the conserved Ser67 upon NSP2/NSP5 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Papa et al., 2019</xref>). It remains unclear how sequential NSP5 phosphorylation influences phase separation and the functional state of viroplasms across diverse RVA variants.</p><p id="P7">Phosphorylation can modulate the phase behavior of IDPs in diverse ways. It may enhance liquid-like properties in condensates formed by the Adenovirus L1-52/55 kDa protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Grams et al., 2024</xref>), or protect against aberrant liquid-to-solid transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Ranganathan et al., 2023</xref>). Conversely, phosphorylation may reduce condensate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Bressler et al., 2023</xref>), highlighting the system-dependent nature of phosphoregulation. Mechanistically, phosphorylation has been proposed to alter the conformational ensemble of IDPs, whereby it can influence subsequent interactions or modifications within the same disordered polypeptide chain through a process known as dynamic allostery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Berlow et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Ferreon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Hilser and Thompson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Kern and Zuiderweg, 2003</xref>) However, identification of such allosteric events within IDPs that drive changes in the architecture and composition of condensates remains challenging.</p><p id="P8">It remains unclear whether all RVA strains utilise LLPS, and if they do, whether they rely on a common, conserved mechanism. Given the large number of RVA strains encoding diverse NSP5 sequences, assessing their individual propensities for LLPS is challenging. This difficulty is compounded by the limited ability of many RVA isolates to grow in cell culture, with strains SA11 and RF being the most characterised and readily grown in cell culture (Arnold et al., 2012; Pena-Gil et al., 2023; Ward et al., 1984). To overcome these limitations, we employed a machine learning algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Saar et al., 2021</xref>) to evaluate the phase separation potential of various NSP5 variants and engineered an SA11-like strain expressing an NSP5 variant with a low LLPS score, designated SC<sub>low</sub>.</p><p id="P9">Our comparative analysis of a low-tendency LLPS variant alongside high-tendency variants reveals that phosphorylation plays a dual role: it nucleates phase separation in low-propensity NSP5 variants and modulates binding interactions within condensates in high-propensity variants. This dual function suggests that the capacity for NSP5 to undergo phase separation is a conserved feature essential to the replication cycle of RVAs, with low-scoring variants acquiring this capability through phosphorylation, underscoring phosphorylation as a pivotal regulator of viroplasm assembly.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Engineering an NSP5 variant with diminished LLPS potential</title><p id="P10">To evaluate the condensate-forming potential of NSP5 across a range of RVA strains and isolates, we performed an <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of their LLPS propensities using DeePhase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Saar et al., 2021</xref>). Of the 451 unique RVA NSP5 sequences retrieved from the NCBI virus database, most exhibited DeePhase scores above 0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), indicating a high propensity for LLPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Saar et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, the NSP5 protein from the cell culture-adapted SA11 strain exhibited the highest DeePhase score among all sequences analysed. Seven NSP5 variants designated S1<sub>low</sub> to S7<sub>low</sub> displayed DeePhase scores below 0.4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting a limited or absent ability to undergo phase separation.</p><p id="P11">To estimate sequence divergence between the well-characterised reference strain SA11 and the identified low-propensity NSP5 variants, we calculated pairwise Levenshtein distances between each S1<sub>low</sub> to S7<sub>low</sub> and SA11 sequences. The Levenshtein distance quantifies the minimum number of single-residue changes needed to transform one sequence into another, providing a straightforward numerical measure of their overall similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Levenshtein, 1966</xref>). The analysis identified four SA11-like variants, designated S4<sub>low</sub> through S7<sub>low</sub> that form an SA11-like cluster (SC) based on their shortest pairwise Levenshtein distances to each other and to SA11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We then engineered an SA11-like NSP5 variant with reduced LLPS propensity by aligning the four naturally occurring SC variants (S4<sub>low</sub> - S7<sub>low</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Katoh and Standley, 2013a</xref>), and deriving a consensus sequence that maintained NSP5 conserved regions while introducing only amino acid substitutions predicted to reduce its LLPS score. Given the 21 degenerate positions in the SC variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), we replaced each of these residues with the corresponding amino acid from the S4<sub>low</sub> variant, which exhibited the lowest DeePhase score (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Since the resulting sequence diverged from S4<sub>low</sub> at seven amino acid positions, we generated all 2^7, or 128 possible combinations of these substitutions and evaluated each variant using DeePhase.</p><p id="P13">Seventy-eight of the 128 variants scored below 0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), demonstrating that substitutions at these seven positions significantly influence the DeePhase score of the SA11-like SC variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Notably, all amino acid substitutions mapped exclusively to the predicted intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of NSP5, suggesting that alterations within the IDR alone are sufficient to differentiate low- from high-LLPS-propensity NSP5 variants. We then generated a consensus sequence using the 78 low-LLPS score NSP5 variants with a single residue remaining ambiguous. This ambiguity was resolved by selecting the corresponding amino acid from S4<sub>low</sub> variant to generate the final SC<sub>low</sub> sequence that achieved the DeePhase score of 0.36.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>A low-LLPS NSP5 variant supports viroplasm formation and viral replication</title><p id="P14">We next evaluated whether the SC<sub>low</sub> NSP5 variant could support replication of an SA11-like RVA in cell culture. Given the segmented nature of the RVA genome, we considered the possibility that sequence mismatches between the SC<sub>low</sub> NSP5 gene (gene segment 11) and the SA11 backbone might impair virus rescue or propagation. To minimise potential inter-segmental incompatibility, we synonymously substituted all nucleotides in the SC<sub>low</sub> NSP5 coding sequence that differed from the SA11 reference, selecting synonymous codons with the smallest evolutionary distance to the original sequence, as detailed in the Methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Expanded view Fig 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We used a modified plasmid-based reverse genetics system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Expanded view Fig 3B</xref>), incorporating the SC<sub>low</sub>-encoding gene segment 11, to rescue SC<sub>low</sub>-RV in an MA104 cell line stably expressing wild-type NSP5 (NSP5-MA104), a platform previously employed to recover NSP5-deficient viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Papa et al., 2019</xref>). Upon rescue, SC<sub>low</sub>-RV could also replicate in wild-type MA104 cells, confirming that SC<sub>low</sub> NSP5 was functional. Sequencing of the SC<sub>low</sub> NSP5 gene from recombinant rotavirus indicated that its sequence remained stable for at least ten passages in MA104 cells at a low multiplicity of infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary File</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Regions of NSP2 previously implicated in NSP5 binding (residues 64−68, 179−183, 232−251 and 291−302 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Jiang et al., 2006</xref>)) were conserved in SC<sub>low</sub>-RV and remained unchanged after ten sequential passages, suggesting that NSP2 retains its ability to interact with the low-scoring NSP5 variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Expanded view Fig 3C</xref>). As SA11 gene segment 11 also encodes NSP6, which enhances viral growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Komoto et al., 2017</xref>), we analysed the modified segment and confirmed that NSP6 was retained in SC<sub>low</sub>-RV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Expanded view Fig 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To further characterise SC<sub>low</sub>-RV, we compared plaque morphologies of SC<sub>low</sub>-RV and SA11-RV. Despite comparable end-titres, plaques formed by SC<sub>low</sub>-RV were significantly smaller than those of SA11-RV (2.0 ± 1.4 mm<sup>2</sup> vs 3.0 ± 1.7 mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). We next assessed SC<sub>low</sub>-RV by comparing its replication kinetics with the WT virus in MA104 cells infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. SC<sub>low</sub>-RV replicated more slowly than SA11-RV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>), although this difference diminished at later stages of infection (48 h.p.i), consistent with the similar end-titres observed. We further confirmed viral particle production in viroplasms formed by SC<sub>low</sub>-RV using electron microscopy (EM) imaging at 8 h.p.i, which revealed the presence of multiple viral particles adjacent to viroplasms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). Finally, single-molecule RNA Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation (smFISH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Strauss et al., 2023</xref>), confirmed that viroplasms formed by SC<sub>low</sub>-RV harboured viral transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>). Taken together, we show that SC<sub>low</sub>-RV supports viroplasm formation and robust replication in cell culture.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>SC<sub>low</sub>-RV displays delayed viroplasm maturation and reduced NSP5 hyperphosphorylation</title><p id="P18">Having established that SC<sub>low</sub>-RV replicates and forms viroplasms in infected cells, we next examined the kinetics of viroplasm formation in cells infected with SC<sub>low</sub>-RV compared to SA11-RV. To visualise viroplasms, we infected NSP5-eGFP MA104 cells with either SC<sub>low</sub>-RV or SA11-RV at an MOI of 20. Infected cells were imaged at 4, 6, and 8 hours post infection (h.p.i.). Both SC<sub>low</sub>-RV and SA11-RV produced spherical NSP5−eGFP-tagged condensates as early as 4 h.p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). However, a marked reduction in both the abundance and size of viroplasms was observed in SC<sub>low</sub>-RV infected cells compared to SA11-infected cells at early time points (up to 8 h.p.i.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B &amp; C</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Given that hyperphosphorylation of NSP5 increases progressively during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Papa et al., 2019</xref>), we next investigated whether SC<sub>low</sub> -RV SC^low-RV undergoes a similar phosphorylation trajectory. From 6 h.p.i. onward, a notable difference in NSP5 hyperphosphorylation emerged between the two strains. This was especially pronounced at 8 h.p.i., when the most highly phosphorylated isoform of NSP5 (migrating at ~35 kDa) was absent in SC<sub>low</sub>-RV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D</xref>). These findings suggest that the delayed and reduced viroplasm formation observed in SC<sub>low</sub>-RV-infected cells may be linked to impaired NSP5 hyperphosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Phosphorylation Restores Phase Separation and Viroplasm Formation by a Low-LLPS NSP5 Variant</title><p id="P20">As viroplasms represent complex condensates containing RNAs and additional viral proteins, we investigated phase-separation properties of SC<sub>low</sub> using a minimal <italic>in vitro</italic> system containing NSP2 and SC<sub>low</sub>. Unlike its wild type counterpart, SC<sub>low</sub> failed to form condensates upon mixing with NSP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>), in agreement with DeePhase predictions. Given that NSP5 undergoes progressive phosphorylation during RVA infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Papa et al., 2019</xref>), and that we observed differences between WT-NSP5 and SC<sub>low</sub> NSP5 phosphorylation patterns, we next asked whether phosphorylation could restore the ability of SC<sub>low</sub> to phase separate <italic>in vitro</italic>. We introduced eight Ser-to-Asp mutations into both the WT-NSP5 (strain SA11) and the SC<sub>low</sub> sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>), targeting residues previously identified as phosphorylation sites in hyperphosphorylated NSP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Sotelo et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, we generated recombinant NSP5 from the bovine RVA strain RF (DeePhase score of 0.61), previously shown to undergo phase separation both in vitro and in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Geiger et al., 2021</xref>). These hyperphosphomimetic variants - derived from SA11, RF, or SC<sub>low</sub> are referred to as NSP5 SA11 HP, NSP5 RF HP and SC<sub>low</sub> HP, respectively.</p><p id="P21">Unlike SC<sub>low</sub>, the SC<sub>low</sub> HP variant formed condensates upon mixing with low micromolar concentrations of NSP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>), confirming that phase separation of SC<sub>low</sub> is phosphorylation dependent.</p><p id="P22">We observed that condensates formed by all HP variants were significantly larger than those formed by their non-phosphorylated counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>). Moreover, both SA11 and RF HP variants formed condensates at lower concentrations (i.e., reduced saturation concentration, C<sub>sat</sub>) and were significantly larger than those formed by SC<sub>low</sub> HP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6</xref>).</p><p id="P23">LLPS driven by homotypic interactions is characterised by a well-defined C<sub>sat</sub>, above which dense phases grow continuously as more protein is added. This behaviour is evident in the phase diagram of non-phosphorylated NSP5, which shows phase boundaries parallel to the concentration axes without re-entrant behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6</xref>). In contrast, LLPS driven by heterotypic interactions can be saturated by an excess of either component, leading to re-entrant behaviour, where condensates form and then dissolve as the stoichiometric ratio changes. This behaviour was observed in hyperphosphorylated NSP5 variants, including SC<sub>low</sub> HP, which display curved phase boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6</xref>).</p><p id="P24">To better understand the mechanistic basis of these differences, we examined NSP5 structural models generated by AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) since no experimental structures of NSP5 are available. Both WT and SC<sub>low</sub> monomers displayed similar features, notably a putative C-terminal alpha-helical region (CTR) and a largely disordered N-terminal region, which were also preserved in all HP variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7A</xref>). As these monomeric structures did not reveal major differences between variants, and since oligomerisation of multivalent scaffold proteins can nucleate LLPS, e.g., by altering stoichiometry or affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Banani et al., 2017</xref>), we next assessed the oligomerisation capacity of the NSP5 variants using mass photometry. NSP5 SA11, RF, and their HP variants formed a range of higher-order oligomers, whereas SC<sub>low,</sub>showed only a single peak at 35 ± 5 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7B</xref>). Remarkably, the SC<sub>low</sub> HP variant formed a similar distribution of higher-order oligomers, confirming that phosphorylation is required for both oligomerisation and phase separation in this variant.</p><p id="P25">Given that phosphorylation enables phase separation of SC<sub>low</sub>, we hypothesised that abrogation of phosphorylation would impair viroplasm formation and viral propagation in cells infected with the SC<sub>low</sub>-RV. To test this, we introduced the S67A mutation, previously shown to abrogate NSP5 hyperphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Papa et al., 2019</xref>), into the SC<sub>low</sub> background to generate the SC<sub>low</sub> S67A recombinant RVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8A</xref>).

Although both SA11 S67A and SC<sub>low</sub> S67A viruses produced viroplasms at 24 h.p.i., only the former yielded visible condensates; no viroplasms were detected following SClow S67A infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8C</xref>). Nonetheless, RV transcripts accumulated in MA104 and MA104-NSP5 cells infected with SC<sub>low</sub> S67A-RV, indicating that viral transcription occurred in both contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8D</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Together, these findings support the conclusion that phosphorylation is critical for SC<sub>low</sub> NSP5 to undergo LLPS, form viroplasms, and support efficient rotavirus replication.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Phosphorylation tunes NSP5 binding modes in condensates</title><p id="P27">Phosphorylation events in NSP5 are confined to the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Sotelo et al., 2010</xref>).

This finding suggests that the IDR normally inhibits uncontrolled CTR aggregation, implying that both regions act cooperatively in oligomerisation and phase separation. Consistent with this, deletion of the CTR (yielding the IDR-only construct) abolished homo-oligomerisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7B</xref>) and eliminated NSP2-driven phase separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Geiger et al., 2021</xref>). To dissect the contributions of each domain to condensate formation, we titrated increasing concentrations of the isolated IDR or CTR into preformed NSP5/NSP2 condensates. As expected, the CTR strongly disrupted condensate nucleation, reflecting its aggregation-prone nature. The IDR also impaired condensate formation, though requiring a ~3-fold higher concentration. Notably, replacing NSP5 with its phosphomimetic variant (NSP5 HP) conferred greater tolerance to the CTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig 9</xref>), suggesting that phosphorylation of the IDR modulates homotypic interactions within condensates. In all cases, condensate size decreased when full-length NSP5 concentration was reduced, indicating that both termini are required for efficient condensate growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig 9</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Given that SC<sub>low</sub> fails to phase separate unless phosphorylated and resembles the IDR in its oligomeric behaviour, we hypothesised that phosphorylation of the IDR also regulates its interaction with NSP2. To test this, we introduced phosphomimetic mutations into the RF-derived NSP5 IDR (IDR HP). Like its unmodified counterpart, IDR HP failed to form higher-order oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7B</xref>). However, in the presence of NSP2, IDR HP was able to phase separate, albeit forming smaller condensates and requiring ~4-fold higher concentrations than WT NSP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6</xref>). These data indicate that IDR phosphorylation is required for co-condensation with NSP2, but that the CTR remains essential for efficient condensation, as reflected in the elevated C<sub>sat</sub> of IDR HP.</p><p id="P30">Since non-phosphorylated IDR does not interact with NSP2, we hypothesised that phase separation of IDR HP is largely driven by electrostatic interactions with the positively charged NSP2. To test this, we examined whether poly-arginine could induce condensation of the IDRs via cation−π interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Geiger et al., 2021</xref>). While NSP2 failed to induce condensation with the non-phosphorylated IDR, poly-arginine efficiently promoted condensate formation with both IDR variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Expanded view Fig 9</xref>). These results indicate distinct mechanisms of condensation for phosphorylated versus unphosphorylated NSP5 in the presence of NSP2.</p><p id="P31">To map phosphorylation-dependent binding interfaces, we performed hydrogen−deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) on WT NSP5 and its phosphomimetic variant in the presence of NSP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig 10</xref>). In unmodified NSP5, NSP2 binding led to significant protection of both the CTR (residues 167−191) and an IDR region (residues 26−47), in agreement with previous reports of NSP2−NSP5 interaction sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Eichwald et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Lee et al., 2024</xref>). In contrast, the NSP5 HP variant showed no protection at these sites.

This allowed us to engineer a low LLPS propensity NSP5 variant, SC<sub>low</sub>, which retains conserved features of the SA11 sequence.

Paradoxically, SC<sub>low</sub> fully supported viral replication, forming viroplasms in infected cells.

Our combined use of in silico prediction and mutational analysis revealed that DeePhase is sensitive primarily to sequence differences within IDRs, but not to contributions from structured regions, which may still be critical for phase separation. Notably, phosphomimetic substitution of serines previously identified as phosphorylated in infected cells, restored the ability of SC<sub>low</sub> to nucleate LLPS similarly to the wild-type protein.</p><p id="P35">Previous studies identified the helical C-terminal region (CTR) of NSP5 as the key interface mediating its homo-oligomerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Sen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Torres-Vega et al., 2000</xref>).

Indeed, deletion of the CTR abrogates high molecular weight NSP5 species, while removal of the IDR results in aggregation of the CTR, indicating that both regions contribute to NSP5 oligomerisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig 11A</xref>).</p><p id="P36">Importantly, oligomerisation of NSP5 appears to be dispensable for NSP5/NSP2 co-condensation, as the IDR HP alone can phase separate with NSP2. However, oligomerisation significantly reduces the saturation concentration (Csat), suggesting that interactions promoting NSP5 self-assembly are distinct from those driving its co-condensation with NSP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). This implies that sequence features within the IDR not only prevent CTR aggregation but also modulate the cooperative assembly of NSP5 oligomers, and NSP5 condensates.</p><p id="P37">We propose a model in which unphosphorylated NSP5 binds NSP2 via the CTR, forming a hub−driver architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Galagedera et al., 2023</xref>), where the remaining free IDRs mediate phase separation through non-stoichiometric interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig 11</xref>). This is consistent with our observation that the non-phosphorylated IDR alone cannot bind NSP2. Phosphorylation introduces negative charges predominantly within the IDR, which may either weaken homotypic IDR−IDR interactions or enhance binding to a distinct region of NSP2, driven by electrostatic attraction to its positively charged domains. As a result, the mechanism of phase separation may shift from weak, non-saturating multivalent interactions to specific, saturable ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig 11B</xref>), representing an allosteric switch in NSP5’s interaction mode. Upon phosphorylation, the IDR binds NSP2, and homotypic interactions occur primarily through the CTR. Unlike IDR-mediated interactions, CTR-based oligomerisation is saturable and can be competitively inhibited by excess NSP5, leading to condensate dissolution. These findings align with theoretical models proposing that condensate function is governed by a balance of weak, competing interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bhandari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Schmit et al., 2021</xref>), which are often elusive to conventional biophysical methods.

Similarly, multiple phosphates reside within an IDR of ETS-1 transcription factor that functions as an allosteric effector of autoinhibition. Graded phosphorylation of ETS-1 serves as a rheostat to fine-tune DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Pufall et al., 2005</xref>), providing another example of an elegant control of phosphorylation-driven allosteric regulation in IDRs, that can dynamically tune the strength of such interactions.</p><p id="P40">Hyperphosphorylated NSP5 gradually accumulates during infection, remaining undetectable during early stages of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Blackhall et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Campagna et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Criglar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Eichwald et al., 2004a</xref>). Such phosphoregulation may be required for the advanced stages of viral replication as the amount of NSP5 and NSP2, as well as other viral components required for virus assembly is high. In the SA11 strain, which has high intrinsic LLPS propensity, NSP5 phosphorylation is not required for in vitro condensate formation or early-stage viroplasm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Papa et al., 2019</xref>). Conversely, SC<sub>low</sub> lacking IDR-IDR interactions cannot initiate condensate formation unless phosphorylated. The S67A mutation, which blocks a key phosphorylation site, abolishes phase separation and viroplasm formation in the SC<sub>low</sub> background. Thus, in NSP5 variants with low LLPS propensity, phosphorylation serves as a prerequisite for condensate nucleation and viral replication. Despite sequence divergence, phosphorylation enables these variants to form condensates, underscoring a conserved mechanism across rotavirus strains.</p><p id="P41">We propose that hyperphosphorylation of NSP5 serves dual roles depending on strain context.

This may help compensate for mutations that weaken condensate formation, while also facilitating the use of host-specific kinases.

These properties make viral IDPs promising antiviral targets, particularly through the development of allosteric inhibitors. Indeed, such an approach has successfully targeted the IDR of a protein tyrosine phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Krishnan et al., 2014</xref>).

Homotypic interactions of NSP5. NSP5 molecules with low LLPS scores (black IDRs and green CTRs) are unable to self-associate effectively. In contrast, NSP5 variants with high LLPS scores or those containing phosphorylated IDRs can form condensates, with LLPS favoured by interactions between the IDR and CTR. Phosphorylation of the IDR enhances these IDR−CTR interactions, facilitating homo-oligomerisation and condensate formation.</p><p><bold>B</bold>. Heterotypic interactions between NSP5 and NSP2. At early stages of infection, positively charged NSP2 octamers (light blue doughnuts) bind NSP5 via stoichiometric interactions with its CTR. In NSP5 variants with high LLPS propensity, the flexible, unstructured IDRs form a non-stoichiometric interaction network that drives phase separation. In contrast, low-LLPS NSP5 variants can still bind NSP2 via the CTR but fail to phase separate due to insufficient IDR−IDR interactions. During late infection, phosphorylation of NSP5 increases the negative charge of the IDR, promoting interactions with positively charged regions of NSP2.
