We show that MRTF-SRF activity is required for effective proliferation of both primary and immortalised fibroblast and epithelial cells. Cells lacking the MRTFs or SRF proliferate very slowly, express elevated levels of SASP factors and SA-β-galactosidase activity, and inhibit proliferation of co-cultured primary wildtype cells. They exhibit decreased levels of CDK1 and CKS2 proteins, and elevated levels of CDK inhibitors, usually CDKN1B/p27. These phenotypes, which can be fully reversed by re-expression of MRTF-A, are also seen in wildtype cells arrested by serum deprivation. Moreover, in wildtype cells direct interference with cytoskeletal dynamics through inhibition of ROCKs or Myosin ATPase induces a similar proliferative defect to that seen in MRTF-null cells. MRTF-null cells exhibit multiple cytoskeletal defects, and markedly reduced contractility. We propose that MRTF-SRF driven cytoskeletal dynamics and contractility are essential for operation of the pro-proliferative signal provided by cell-substrate adhesion.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>MRTF-A</kwd><kwd>MRTF-B</kwd><kwd>SRF</kwd><kwd>MKL1</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>quiescence</kwd><kwd>senescence</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">The cell cycle is controlled by a conserved network of Cyclin/CDKs and their regulators that ensures that cell growth, genome replication and segregation, and cell division occur in the right order and at the right time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Malumbres &amp; Barbacid, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Morgan, 1997</xref>).

A similar proliferation defect is induced in wildtype MEFs upon serum starvation or stringent inhibition of ROCKs or myosin ATPase, and MRTF-null cells exhibit cytoskeletal defects and reduced contractility.

The multiple cytoskeletal defects seen in <italic>Mrtfab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs raises the possibility that their defective proliferation might result from inability to respond to such mechanical environmental cues. First, we examined the effect of matrix complicity. Wildtype and <italic>Mrtfab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs were plated on substrates of increasing rigidity, and proliferation measured by EdU incorporation.

We focussed on cell contractility, which is required for progression through the G1/S checkpoint in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). The Rho kinases (ROCKs) are important regulators of cell contractility, controlling both F-actin assembly and myosin activity (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Rath &amp; Olson, 2012</xref>), and ROCK inhibition was previously reported to lead to both cytokinesis defects and cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kumper <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P49">Treatment of wildtype MEFs with the pan-ROCK inhibitor H1152 reduced actin stress fibres and focal adhesions, as did serum-deprivation, but did not induce the cell rounding seen in <italic>Mrtfab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">Figure S7C</xref>). Nevertheless, H1152 reduced proliferation of immortalised WT MEFs to a level comparable to that of <italic>Mrtfab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D-F</xref>). ROCK-inhibited wildtype MEFs exhibited similar changes in p27, CDK1 and CKS2 expression to <italic>Mrtfab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs and serum-deprived wildtype MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7G</xref>), as well as increased SA-βGal activity, and elevated transcription of SASP markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">Figure S7E, S7F</xref>).

Treatment with the Myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin also inhibited proliferation of WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D, 7H</xref>). Blebbistatin-treated wildtype MEFs exhibited similar cytoskeletal changes to ROCK-inhibited cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">Figure S7C</xref>), and blebbistatin treatment induced similar effects on cell cycle marker expression to H1152 treatment or serum deprivation of wild type cells, or MRTF inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7G</xref>). Finally, we directly examined contractility in <italic>Mrtfab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs using traction force microscopy. <italic>Mrtfab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs exhibited reduced contractility, exerting 70% less force per unit area than wildtype MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7I</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the proliferation defect observed in <italic>Mrtfab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs is likely due to intrinsic defects in actin dynamics, and that this at least in part reflects reduced contractility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S28" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P50">In this study we have shown that the MRTF-SRF axis plays a significant role in cell proliferation in fibroblast and epithelial cells. Inactivation of SRF, or of MRTF-B in fibroblasts lacking MRTF-A, induces a profound proliferative defect, with decreased levels of cyclin D, CDK1 and CKS2, increased amounts of the CDK inhibitor p27, elevated neutral β-galactosidase activity, and expression of numerous SASP markers. Similar phenotypes are also seen in wildtype cells upon serumstarvation, or upon inhibition of the ROCKs or actomyosin contractility. MRTF-SRF inactivation results in multiple cytoskeletal defects, including substantially reduced contractility. MRTF-A and MRTF-B function redundantly to promote cytoskeletal integrity and cell proliferation. Our findings suggest that MRTF-SRF dependent cytoskeletal dynamics, particularly contractility, play a pivotal role in generating the pro-proliferative signal provided by cell-substate adhesion in adherent cells.</p><p id="P51">Several aspects of the <italic>Mrtfab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> phenotype are seen in senescent cells, but we do not consider MRTF-null cells to exhibit classical senescence. The stringent definition of senescence has been hampered by the lack of well-defined and specific markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Munoz-Espin &amp; Serrano, 2014</xref>). MRTF-null MEFs exhibit a SASP-like secretory phenotype, and can inhibit proliferation of co-cultured wildtype cells. However, SASP-like phenotypes have also been reported in quiescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Anwar <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), and recent studies suggest that the SASP and SA-bgal reflect duration of cell cycle withdrawal rather than a distinct non-proliferative state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Ashraf <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Irreversibility has been conventionally been considered a hallmark of senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Campisi &amp; d'Adda di Fagagna, 2007</xref>), but we found that all MRTF-null MEF phenotypes can be fully reversed by MRTF-A re-expression.

Elevated p27 levels are characteristic of cell cycle inhibition induced in various cell contexts by non-genotoxic cues including serum deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Coats <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>), TGF-β treatment or contact inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Polyak <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>), restriction of cell spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>), low matrix stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Klein <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), or lovastatin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hengst <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hengst &amp; Reed, 1996</xref>). Many of these directly affect activation of the MRTF-SRF signalling pathway, or impinge on cytoskeletal dynamics. At least in some settings, arrest-induced p27 accumulation, which is Rho-dependent, reflects decreased Skp2 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Mammoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Decreased Skp2 levels are also seen in SRF-null VSM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Werth <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Both Skp2 protein and transcript levels were slightly decreased in our MRTF-null MEFs, and we note that in breast cancer cells, Skp2 expression also responds to mechanical cues via the YAP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Jang <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P54">The CDK inhibitors p27 and p21 inhibit CDKs through a common mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Polyak <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>), and p27 and p57 share functions in proliferation control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Matsumoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Susaki <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). We found that in contrast to immortalised <italic>Mrtfab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs, <italic>Mrtfab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> primary kidney fibroblasts and tracheal epithelial cells exhibited elevated p21 levels, with correspondingly reduced p27 levels. While this suggests that p27 or other CIP/KIP family proteins might function redundantly to mediate the proliferation defect, we found that inactivation of neither p27 nor all three CIP/KIP proteins was sufficient to restore proliferation to <italic>Mrtfab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs. This finding extends previous studies showing that MEFs lacking individual CIP/KIP family members retain growth control by contact inhibition and serum deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Deng <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Nakayama <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). We therefore suggest that CKI elevation upon MRTF inactivation is a consequence rather than a cause of proliferation arrest in MEFs.</p><p id="P55">We found culture of wildtype MEFs on limited areas of adhesion also reduced cell proliferation to a comparable extent to unconfined <italic>Mrtfab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells. Such confinement also increases cellular G-actin levels, which would be expected to decrease MRTF activity (R Fedoryshchak <italic>et al</italic>, manuscript in preparation). In contrast proliferation was not affected when wildtype cells are allowed to spread under conditions of limited adhesion area in agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>), and in this case G-actin levels are unaffected. We therefore speculate that primary driver for confinement-mediated impairment of cell proliferation may be altered actin dynamics. We note, however, that the greatly reduced proliferation of <italic>Mrtfab<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs can also be further inhibited by confinement, suggesting other mechano-responsive pathways promote proliferation. One such pathway might be the mechano-responsive YAP/TAZ system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Dupont <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P56">The quiescence-like state associated with MRTF inactivation can also be induced in wildtype MEFs by treatment with the ROCK1/ROCK2 inhibitor H1152 or the myosin inhibitor blebbistatin. Both ROCKs and myosin are critical for cell contractility, and MRTF-null MEFs exhibit substantially impaired contractility. Moreover, classical studies have shown that F-actin integrity and cell contractility are required for progression through the G1 restriction point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Iwig <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kumper <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Reshetnikova <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). How might this affect cell progression? Two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms can be envisaged. First, MRTF inactivation might directly limit contractility-dependent changes in cell morphology required for cell cycle progression. For example, during G2/M, ROCK- and myosin-dependent contractility promotes mitotic cell rounding by multiple mechanisms (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Ramkumar &amp; Baum, 2016</xref>) including focal adhesion disassembly and the assembly of rigid cortical actomyosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Jones <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Matthews <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Ramanathan <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>), and the actomyosin contractile ring at cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Green <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Moreover, in pseudo-stratified epithelia such as the tracheal epithelial cells studied here actomyosin contractility is essential for the nuclear movements required for mitosis (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Meyer <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). A second possibility is that MRTF inactivation limits the generation of pro-proliferative signals from the cytoskeleton. Mechanical cues, including cell adhesion and spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Mammoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), and matrix compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Klein <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Mih <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>) promote cell cycle progression in anchorage-dependent cells. Focal adhesions, whose assembly is MRTF-SRF dependent in our cells, would be a prime candidates to generate such signals (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Burridge &amp; Chrzanowska-Wodnicka, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kamranvar <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P57">MRTF-SRF target genes include both components and regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, including the actins themselves (Schratt, 2002 #21, reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Olson &amp; Nordheim, 2010</xref>). We propose that the contractily deficits underpinning defective proliferation of MRTF-null cells reflect reduced expression of multiple cytoskeletal MRTF-SRF target genes, although it remains possible that MRTF-SRF also directly controls expression of cell cycle regulators. G-actin plays a critical role in regulation of MRTF activity, and in at least some contexts overexpression of cytoplasmic actin can rescue MRTF-dependent phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Maurice <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Salvany <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, in MEFs the inactivation of cytoplasmic actin genes results in defective proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bunnell <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Patrinostro <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Tondeleir <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). The proliferative and cytoskeletal phenotypes of MRTF-null cells may thus at root reflect deficient actin expression, and we are currently testing this idea.</p><p id="P58">We have shown that MRTF-SRF activity is required for proliferation of anchorage dependent fibroblasts and epithelial cells, most likely because MRTF-SRF dependent cytoskeletal dynamics and contractility allow adherent cells to execute the morphological changes required for cell division. However, many untransformed cell types also proliferate independently of adhesion, and anchorage-independent proliferation is also a hallmark of oncogenic transformation. In principle oncogenic signals could simply substitute for pro-proliferative signals generated in nontransformed cells by substrate adhesion. According to this view, proliferation of transformed cells might occur independently of MRTF-SRF activity, providing that constraints on cytoskeletal dynamics are not limiting, which might well be the case for non-adherent cells. Our future work will focus on the relation between transformation, MRTF-SRF activity, and the cytoskeleton.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>TABLE 1 - RNAseq data</label><media xlink:href="EMS206355-supplement-TABLE_1___RNAseq_data.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d42aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>TABLE 2 - GSEA and GO analysis</label><media xlink:href="EMS206355-supplement-TABLE_2___GSEA_and_GO_analysis.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d42aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Table S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS206355-supplement-Table_S1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d42aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Table S2</label><media xlink:href="EMS206355-supplement-Table_S2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d42aAcEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Video 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS206355-supplement-Video_1.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d42aAcEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Video 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS206355-supplement-Video_2.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d42aAcEgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Video 3a</label><media xlink:href="EMS206355-supplement-Video_3a.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d42aAcEhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Video 3b</label><media xlink:href="EMS206355-supplement-Video_3b.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d42aAcEiB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD9"><label>Video 4a</label><media xlink:href="EMS206355-supplement-Video_4a.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d42aAcEjB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD10"><label>Video 4b</label><media xlink:href="EMS206355-supplement-Video_4b.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d42aAcEkB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD11"><label>Video 5a</label><media xlink:href="EMS206355-supplement-Video_5a.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d42aAcElB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD12"><label>Video 5b</label><media xlink:href="EMS206355-supplement-Video_5b.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d42aAcEmB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD13"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS206355-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d42aAcEnB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Patrick Costello, lab members, Michael Way, and Francesco Gualdrini for helpful discussions, and Gerard Evan, Michael Way and Paul Nurse for helpful comments on the manuscript.

SB conducted initial characterisation of MRTF- and SRF- depleted cultures, and established the similarity between the ROCK-inhibited and MRTF-null phenotype. RT established the project, designed and interpreted experiments, and with JN wrote the paper with input from the other authors. <table-wrap id="T3" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><table
