Influenza A virus (IAV) faces similar constraints during infection but may have evolved strategies to enhance the biogenesis of its own membrane proteins. One such protein, the viroporin M2, contains functionally essential hydrophilic residues within its transmembrane domain, which should hinder efficient membrane insertion. We hypothesize that IAV has adapted to overcome these sequence-based limitations and ensure robust M2 biogenesis. Using a biotin pulse-labelling system in intact cells, we uncover the dynamics of M2 targeting and ER insertion. Attenuating the insertion rate by ablating a key insertion factor, the ER membrane protein complex (EMC), leads to M2 accumulating in the cytosol, but remaining partially insertion competent. We find that cytosolic stability of non-inserted M2 is crucial for efficient biogenesis under these conditions and identify amphipathic helix−mediated membrane association as the molecular mechanism that counteracts proteasomal degradation. We propose membrane association as a novel buffering mechanism that regulates membrane protein biogenesis by stabilizing pre-insertion intermediates.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Membrane protein biogenesis</kwd><kwd>Influenza A virus M2</kwd><kwd>Protein quality control</kwd><kwd>amphipathic helix</kwd><kwd>ER membrane protein complex (EMC)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Membrane proteins are synthesized by cytosolic ribosomes and must be efficiently inserted into their target membrane to avoid cytotoxic aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Non-inserted aggregation prone proteins like prion protein (PrP) may require fast removal but may not represent the broader class of membrane proteins. Recent studies have revealed a more nuanced picture: non-inserted or mislocalized membrane proteins are initially captured by cytosolic holdases such as SGTA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], the BAG6 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], and ubiquilins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], which mask hydrophobic segments and temporarily stabilize these clients in the cytosol. From this buffered state, proteins may be inserted or targeted for degradation by the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Thus, the cytosolic stability of non-inserted membrane proteins is not universally short-lived, but dynamically regulated and may serve as a critical checkpoint in membrane protein homeostasis. However, how protein features contribute to the stability of pre-insertion intermediates in the cytosol is poorly understood.</p><p id="P3">Fundamentally, the efficiency of membrane protein biogenesis is shaped by a protein’s sequence features and its interaction with available biogenesis machinery. Transmembrane domain (TMD) and signal peptide hydrophobicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], strongly influence membrane protein biogenesis efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] and influence targeting pathways and translocon selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p><p id="P4">The influenza A virus (IAV) proton channel M2 exemplifies this challenge. M2 is an essential component of the virion envelope, functioning in the uncoating step during viral entry and has been an effective antiviral drug target until the emergence of drug-resistant strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. M2 is a 97-amino-acid, type III membrane protein with a single TMD that includes highly conserved hydrophilic residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. These sequence features render M2 a suboptimal substrate for canonical targeting factors and insertases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. M2 sequence may have evolved other features to mitigate these suboptimal client features.</p><p id="P5">M2 encodes an amphipathic helix downstream of its transmembrane domain which has been extensively studied for its function during viral egress, enabling ESCRT-independent membrane scission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], and is sufficient to localize cytosolic proteins to membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Amphipathic helices are known to mediate membrane association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], but have never been investigated as potential targeting features during membrane protein biogenesis. Using a biotin pulse-labelling assay to obtain kinetic measurements of glycosylation intermediates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], we show that amphipathic-helix-mediated membrane tethering stabilizes non-inserted M2 in the cytosol and enhances its access to translocons, effectively buffering against biogenesis bottlenecks. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated intermediate state in membrane protein quality control to ensure robust insertion.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The loss of EMC affects M2 ER insertion rate</title><p id="P6">The EMC is the central insertase for transmembrane domains with short, translocated flanking domains at the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. In our accompanying study, the use of a glycosylation-competent M2 variant (M2.Y.F with a Leu2Asp mutation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) was crucial in revealing the role of the EMC in M2 biogenesis and identifying compensatory insertion pathways. We hypothesized that the lack of EMC creates a membrane insertion bottleneck for M2. To test this, we sought to resolve the timing of M2 targeting and insertion, by complementing steady-state glycosylation analysis with a biotin pulse-labelling assay. M2.Y.F was N-terminally tagged with an AVI-tag (AVI.M2.Y.F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), a short peptide sequence specifically biotinylated by birA ligase in the presence of biotin. This highly sensitive labelling approach minimally perturbs M2 biogenesis and preserves native cytosolic complexity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Cytosolically expressed birA biotinylates AVI.M2.Y.F during the window when its N-terminus resides in the cytosol—beginning with emergence from the ribosomal exit tunnel and ending upon membrane translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). M2’s translocation kinetics are observed via glycosylation. M2 in the cytosol is initially unglycosylated (-Y), will be glycosylated upon ER insertion (+Y) and further glycosylated when trafficked along the secretory route (++Y, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Within each compartment, M2 could be subjected to degradation through different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]</p><p id="P7">A time course of pulsed biotinylation from 5 to 40 minutes in WT and EMC6 KO cells (Δ6) revealed a pronounced difference in the glycosylation dynamics. Whereas glycosylated species rapidly accumulated in WT cells, mostly unglycosylated species accumulated in Δ6 cells (+DTT - PNGase <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). We quantified the glycosylation efficiency, which only reached 34% of the WT in absence of EMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). The maximal rate of M2 insertion reduced to 44% of the WT in Δ6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). In order to substantiate glycosylation as marker for ER insertion, we additionally measured disulphide-linked dimerization of M2, which occurs at positions C17 and C19 through the action of ER luminal isomerases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. The lack of EMC resulted in reduced dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> -DTT +PNGase). Interestingly, our data showed that despite the highly reduced N-terminal translocation efficiency, unglycosylated M2 (-Y) accumulated at a rate that kept the total biotin labelled fraction close to equal between WT and Δ6 cells over the labelling period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> +DTT +PNGase), whereas the total M2 levels remain reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The lack of EMC has been reported to result in topologically inverted membrane insertion in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. The accumulation of a non-glycosylated band may be consistent with a defect in topogenesis, thus we test if M2’s C-terminus may be translocated across the ER with a mutant that carries a glycosylation acceptor site at both N- and C-terminus (AVI.M2.NYCY.F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). AVI.M2.NYCY.F is not glycosylated in a 10-minute biotin pulse in Δ6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> lane 6), which excludes a defect in topogenesis. We conclude that a reduction in the rate of successful ER insertion reactions of M2, likely results in the accumulation of pre-insertion intermediates in the cytosol.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>M2’s amphipathic helix mediates membrane association and stabilizes non-inserted M2 in the cytosol</title><p id="P9">The accumulation of a stable unglycosylated M2 due to a defect in ER translocation is somewhat unexpected, as quality control mechanisms should rapidly degrade this fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. M2 sequences encodes an amphipathic helix directly following its transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), which has been shown to target cytosolic red fluorescent protein to membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. We hypothesized that M2’s amphipathic helix may have a role in M2 biogenesis, potentially stabilizing non-inserted M2 in association with the cytoplasmic faces of the ER. We opted to construct a previously characterised amphipathic helix mutant, which maintains the secondary structure but abolishes membrane interaction by mutating 5 hydrophobic residues to alanine (AVI.M2-AHmut.Y.F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>].</p><p id="P10">First, we assessed if amphipathic helix mediates membrane association through monitoring palmitoylation, which occurs at a cysteine at position 50, located within its amphipathic helix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Palmitoylation takes place at the cytosolic face of membranes and is catalysed by enzymes that localise to the ER, the Golgi, and the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. In agreement with membrane association, we detected palmitoylation as a shift in +Y and -Y fractions of AVI.M2.Y.F in both WT and EMC ablated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> lane 1 and 7), compared to the DTT treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> lane 2 and 8), or when the cysteine at position 50 is mutated to a serine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref> lane 3,4 and 9,10). Strikingly, this band is almost entirely lost when M2’s amphipathic helix is disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> lane 5,6 and 11,12), suggesting that M2’s amphipathic helix can stabilize -Y in association with the cytoplasmic faces of the ER.</p><p id="P11">To determine the subcellular localization of -Y, we selectively permeabilized the plasma membrane using digitonin and extracted the cytosolic contents. In WT cells, -Y was nearly undetectable in the cytosolic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, lane 2). In contrast, Δ6 cells showed partial detection of -Y in the cytosolic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, lane 5), while a strong -Y signal remained in the digitonin-resistant fraction in both WT and Δ6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, lanes 3 and 6). Notably, overall -Y protein levels were markedly reduced when expressing the AVI.M2-AHmut.Y.F construct under the same conditions as AVI.M2.Y.F. This was accompanied by a substantial decrease in both the cytosolic -Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, lanes 8 and 11) and the digitonin-resistant -Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, lanes 9 and 12).</p><p id="P12">These data suggest that amphipathic helix-mediated membrane association stabilizes fully translated M2 in association with the cytosolic membrane face of the ER, prior to post-translational membrane insertion. We test post-translational membrane insertion at the ER by inhibiting translation with a high dose of cycloheximide for 30 minutes, before pulse labelling cytosolic AVI.M2.Y.F with biotin. Indeed, we can observe glycosylation under these conditions in WT and Δ6 cells, confirming that at least a part of cytosolic -Y can insert post-translationally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cytosolic stability enhances biogenesis efficiency and delays proteasomal degradation</title><p id="P13">We hypothesize that an increased stability of pre-insertion intermediates in the cytosol may increase M2’s chance of ER insertion, and thus buffer against ER insertion bottlenecks. To assess how membrane association influences cytosolic stability and ER insertion rates, we pulse-labelled M2 and treated cells with either DMSO (mock), the proteasome inhibitor MG132, or the autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 for 6 hours. The effectiveness of MG132 and bafilomycin A1 was confirmed by increased LC3 lipidation (LC3-II) compared to DMSO-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). To rule out differences in transfection efficiency as a confounding factor, we confirmed comparable expression of co-transfected birA across all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Consistent with previous experiments, we observed a substantial reduction in the insertion rate of +Y over 20 minutes in the absence of EMC (31% Δ6<sup>M2</sup>/WT<sup>M2</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Notably, mutation of the amphipathic helix also significantly reduced M2 insertion (22% WT<sup>AHmut</sup>/WT<sup>M2</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). When both EMC was ablated and the amphipathic helix mutated, the insertion rate dropped even further (7% Δ6<sup>AHmut</sup>/WT<sup>M2</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This multiplicative effect suggests that EMC and the amphipathic helix function independently, yet both are critical for efficient M2 insertion. We confirmed these findings using time-resolved biotin pulse-labelling, which showed a marked reduction in the maximal insertion rate of AVI.M2-AHmut.Y.F upon EMC ablation (19% Δ6/WT, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Together, these results highlight a strong contribution of membrane association—mediated by the amphipathic helix—to the biogenesis efficiency of M2, independent of translocation site availability.</p><p id="P15">If the cytosolic stabilization of a pre-insertion M2 aids in biogenesis efficiency, we should observe an increase in +Y levels through the inhibition of degradation. Proteasomal inhibition increased the -Y levels over DMSO treatment in all conditions (2x WT<sup>M2</sup>, 2x Δ6<sup>M2</sup>, 3.5x WT<sup>AHmut</sup>, 9x Δ6<sup>AHmut</sup>) and resulted in higher +Y levels relative to the DMSO treatment in all conditions except in WT cells expressing AVI.M2.Y.F (1x WT<sup>M2</sup>, 1.5x Δ6<sup>M2</sup>, 2x WT<sup>AHmut</sup>, 2.5x Δ6<sup>AHmut</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Interestingly, lysosomal inhibition only increased AVI.M2.Y.F’s +Y levels in WT cells (3x WTM2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), which is in agreement with previous research that links strong M2 expression with its lysosomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. We conclude that M2 can adhere to the cytosolic face of membranes via its amphipathic helix to escape proteasomal degradation, increasing its biogenesis efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Lack of amphipathic helix renders infection more sensitive to EMC loss</title><p id="P16">M2 is highly expressed during PR8 infection, but only small amounts of M2 are needed at the plasma membrane to incorporate into virus particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. If membrane association via M2’s amphipathic helix contributes to M2’s biogenesis efficiency, we should observe a defect in M2 plasma membrane accumulation when mutating the amphipathic helix. We created a mutant virus in the PR8 background carrying the same mutations in M2 that abolishes the hydrophobic features in the amphipathic helix (PR8-AHmut).</p><p id="P17">We infected WT and Δ6 cells, and measured HA and M2 accumulation at the plasma membrane together with viral titer at 8hpi. We assessed the magnitude of plasma membrane localization of these proteins in non-permeabilized cells in a flow cytometry assay and separated the infected cell population by modelling the expression profile with two skew-normal distributions, only considering the highly fluorescent population as infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). As expected, HA cell surface accumulation was not affected by EMC6 KO in both viruses. In contrast to the results we obtained in transfection, in infection M2-AHmut cell surface levels were not different from wild type M2 in WT cells. This suggests that IAV may regulate cellular processes that allow efficient biogenesis of M2 lacking the amphipathic helix in these cells. However, M2 accumulation at the plasma membrane was slightly more affected by EMC ablation when lacking the amphipathic helix (46% Δ6<sup>PR8</sup>/WT<sup>PR8</sup> vs 28% Δ6<sup>AHmut</sup>/WT<sup>AHmut</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The loss of EMC function only modestly affected viral titer when comparing PR8 infected Δ6 to +6 cells (+6 = Δ6+EMC6 rescue cells). However, strikingly, the loss of EMC showed a significant impact on viral replication when M2’s amphipathic helix was mutated in PR8-AHmut replication (25% Δ6 PFU/+6 PFU, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). We observe similar effects in MDCK EMC6 KO cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). These results demonstrate the functional relevance of M2’s amphipathic helix increasing M2’s biogenesis efficiency important to sustain sufficient ER insertion when insertion sites are scarce.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">Efficient membrane protein targeting and insertion are critical for cellular homeostasis, ensuring that thousands of simultaneously synthesized proteins are inserted into their correct organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>].

Investigating M2’s ER translocation dynamics revealed that non-inserted M2 is initially stable in the cytosol rather than being rapidly degraded. Further analysis showed that cytosolic M2 can transiently associate with membranes via an amphipathic helix located near its transmembrane domain. Membrane association may hinder access of cytosolic ubiquitin ligases, prevent premature degradation, and thus increase the amount of insertion-competent substrate for translocon engagement. To the best of our knowledge, this has never been demonstrated.</p><p id="P21">The ability to buffer against limited translocation capacity may provide a significant advantage in viral infection. In our PR8 infection model, we show that M2 maintains sufficient plasma membrane levels to sustain viral replication in EMC-deficient cells. M2’s amphipathic helix is highly conserved across IAV strains, but certain mutations are common in viruses of specific hosts and serotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Interestingly, the strength of its hydrophobic moment (strength of segregation of polar and apolar amino acids between the helix faces) varies between viruses of different host species, suggesting potential for adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Other viral ion channels may exploit similar strategies. For example, HIV’s Vpu ion channel encodes two amphipathic helices in its C-terminus, suggesting that membrane association might be a conserved feature among viroporins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>].</p><p id="P22">Transmembrane domain-adjacent amphipathic helices may be a widespread feature. Computational analysis reveals that a significant portion of viral and human type III membrane proteins encode transmembrane domain-proximal amphipathic sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). This suggests that translocation buffering via amphipathic helix-mediated membrane association could be a widespread adaptation among viruses and possibly some host proteins.</p><p id="P23">The M2 transmembrane domain must simultaneously function as a proton-conductive pore and provide a signal for membrane insertion—two roles that impose inherently conflicting sequence requirements. In particular, the hydrophilic residues critical for ion conductance can interfere with efficient membrane targeting.

The mutations in the IAV genomic segment 7,PR8-Segment7, were introduced in the same way to obtain PR8-Segment7-AHmut. birA was amplified from myc-birA (gift from Alfonso Bolado, Edinburgh) and tagged with an N-terminal V5-tag, and tagged with a C-terminal nuclear export signal (cytoBirA) and cloned into pcDNA3.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Viral infection with samples for flow cytometry and plaque assay</title><p id="P30">Cells plated the previous day were washed in PBS and infected with viral solutions in serum free DMEM at MOI of 3. At the intended time points, cell supernatants were collected and frozen at -80°C until use. For flow cytometry samples cells were detached in trypsin at 37°C for 7min and transferred to a 96 well plate with conical bottom to spin down at 300xg 4°C for 3min each spin. Cells were washed once in PBS + 1% FBS and once in PBS and fixed in PBS + 4% formaldehyde for 10min at room temperature. Cells were spun down at 500xg 4°C for 5min and washed twice in PBS and stored at 4°C for a maximum of 2 days. Cells were stained for 1h in primary antibody solution or PBS for unstained controls at room temperature. Cells were spun down and washed twice in PBS and stained with 1:1000 isotype specific secondary antibody solution Alexa 488 or Alexa 647 for 30min at room temperature.

Single cells gated data for the two measured channels M2 and HA was exported and further processed in Python with custom scripts. Optimal parameters were fitted by maximum likelihood estimation for a mixture model of two skew-normal distributions using global optimization via differential evolution. Only the distributions with the larger mean at each time point were analyzed further. The data was processed in two different ways. First, the data for each channel was normalized to the 15h time point for each protein in the WT cells and the mean at each time point was compared between WT and Δ6 cells. Second, each repeat for each protein and WT or Δ6 condition was fit to a logistic growth model using a differential evolution algorithm and normalized to the parameter L of the WT condition for each protein and repeat. The data was fit again to obtain the final optimized parameters of the normalized data.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Plaque assay</title><p id="P32">MDCK cells were seeded in 12 well plates to reach confluency the next day.

Statement</title></caption><p>Membrane proteins failing to insert into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) may be rapidly degraded to avoid protein aggregation in the cytosol. Our findings challenge this prevailing view. We show that the influenza A viroporin M2, despite possessing unfavourable features for membrane insertion, can increase biogenesis efficiency by associating with the membrane prior to insertion. Membrane association buffers the protein against quality control pathways and promotes successful biogenesis—even in the absence of a key insertion factor. These results reveal an alternative fate for non-inserted membrane proteins and uncover a viral strategy that redefines how cells manage unstable insertion intermediates.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Pulsed biotinylation reveals M2’s ER membrane translocation dynamics.</title><p>A) Scheme of M2 reporter constructs. M2 Leucine at position 3 is mutated to Asparagine and fused to a C-terminal Flag-tag (M2.Y.F). A 15 amino acid AVI-tag is fused to M2.Y.F’s N-terminus (AVI.M2.Y.F) which creates a highly specific biotinylation site for birA. An additional glycosylation site is inserted in M2.Y.F’s C-terminus (AVI.M2.NYCY.F). B) Scheme of possible reactions during M2 biogenesis acting on M2 with their results on glycosylation. 1) Membrane insertion 2) Trafficking 3) Retrotranslocation 4) Degradation 5) Cleavage. C) A549 WT and Δ6 cells were transfected with cytoBirA plus AVI.M2.Y.F for 24h, labelled with biotin for the indicated time intervals before harvesting on ice to quench the labelling reaction. The lysates were further treated either with DTT to dissociate M2 oligomers or PNGase to deglycosylate M2 and analyzed by western blot (N=3). D) Glycosylation efficiency (+Y/SUM(+Y,-Y)) and +Y levels were quantified by densitometry. An exponential model was fitted to the mean glycosylation efficiency of WT or Δ6. A logistic growth model was fitted to the mean +Y accumulation of WT or Δ6 of each repeat and data was normalized to the maximal estimated value and the maximal slope was determined as max accumulation rate. E) A549 WT and Δ6 cells were transfected with cytoBirA plus AVI.M2.-Y.F (no glycosylation site), or AVI.M2. Y.F (NY, regular N-terminal glycosylation site) or AVI.M2.NYCY.F (N- and C-terminal glycosylation site) for 24h, labelled with biotin for 5min before harvesting on ice to quench the labelling reaction.

Protein sequences with consensus 41WILDRLFFKCIYRRFKYGLKRG62 were analyzed for the maximal hydrophobic moment in a 12 amino acid window, assuming 3.6 residues per turn of a helix and applying the Eisenberg hydrophobicity scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Data was plotted by year of sampling and the organism category the sequence was sampled from indicated by color. A jitter around the y value was applied for better visualization. B) Sequences from the database described in the accompanying publication were analyzed in the same way as in A) along a 100 amino acid stretch centred around the TMD (typical TMD length being 20 amino acids).
