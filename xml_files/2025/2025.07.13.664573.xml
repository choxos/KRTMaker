However, the neural correlates underlying this effect and its disentanglement from motivational factors (i.e., performance goals) remain unknown. To investigate the time deception effect on fatigue, we developed a novel EEG design in which participants performed 100 isometric contractions at a fixed pace and resistance per session. The actual contraction duration (short or long) and the calibration of the displayed clock (normal or biased to an acceleration or deceleration) were independently manipulated between sessions to examine whether fatigue and its neural correlates evolved based on perceived or actual time. Our results show an accumulation of physical fatigue that follows the perceived time, irrespective of motivational factors. This effect was consistently observed only when the clock was slowed down. This time deception effect was mediated by an oscillatory dynamic that followed perceived time in frontal (theta- and beta-bands) but not motor areas (beta-band). Further analyses highlighted the key role of the frontal oscillatory dynamics in the effectiveness of the time deception effect on physical fatigue.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The relationship between the mind and body has been a subject of inquiry for centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Dijkerman &amp; Lenggenhager, 2018</xref>), raising fundamental questions about how mental states influence bodily processes. A prevalent approach to exploring this relationship involves deceptively manipulating participants’ beliefs while recording psychophysiological variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Crum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Crum &amp; Langer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Jones et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). Among the various psychological parameters that can be successfully deceived, manipulating the subjective passage of time has been suggested as particularly relevant because of the trust we routinely place in its measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Thönes et al., 2018</xref>). This manipulation is typically achieved by covertly altering the clock’s speed displayed to participants during a task, either slowing it down or accelerating it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Thönes et al., 2018</xref>). For instance, when the passage of time is artificially slowed down, studies have reported a reduced perceived pain in response to thermal stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Pomares et al., 2011</xref>) but also a smaller decrease in blood glucose level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Park et al., 2016</xref>) and slower healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Aungle &amp; Langer, 2023</xref>). Similarly, studies interested in physical activity have shown that, in the presence of a slowed-down clock, there is a slower spontaneous motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Craik &amp; Sarbin, 1963</xref>) and a slower accumulation of physical fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Matta et al., 2024</xref>). Conversely, accelerating the perceived passage of time has been associated with opposite effects, with the notable exception of physical fatigue, which remains, to our knowledge, unexplored in this context.</p><p id="P3">Although these perceived time-dependent effects are being demonstrated for several variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Thönes et al., 2018</xref>), their underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Moreover, motivational factors, such as performance goals, are critical confounds often unaccounted for when measuring deceptive effects. These confounds are particularly important in physical fatigue, in which previous studies have consistently employed deceptive manipulations to enhance physical performance (i.e., the amount of time a task to exhaustion is maintained or the time needed to complete a given distance) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ansdell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Ducrocq et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Matta et al., 2024</xref>). Consequently, previous results on physical fatigue may be alternatively explained by performance-related goals rather than time perception.</p><p id="P4">In the current study, we investigate the neural correlates associated with the time deception effect on the accumulation of physical fatigue, and we carefully isolate this effect from motivational confounds. In addition, we also test its temporal symmetry, that is, when the clock is either slowed down or accelerated. To this end, we used an original 2×2 design, where each session consisted of performing 100 isometric contractions at a given pace against a fixed individualized resistance. The contraction’s actual duration (short or long) and the calibration of the displayed clock (normal or biased toward acceleration or deceleration) were manipulated between sessions to test whether physical fatigue was evolving according to the perceived (i.e., displayed) or actual time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). Unlike previous studies, we tested all four possible combinations for the first time in a within-subject design. We recorded EMG and EEG signals to assess fatigue accumulation and associated neural correlates. Regarding EEG, we specifically looked at the oscillatory dynamics within the motor cortex (MC) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), as both regions are involved in physical fatigue and effort maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bigliassi &amp; Filho, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Matta et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">McMorris et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Robertson &amp; Marino, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Design Summary</title><p id="P5">Participants performed four sessions (each spaced 3 to 10 days apart) of 100 quadriceps isometric contractions, during which EMG and EEG were continuously recorded. For each participant, the contraction intensity was identical across sessions (≤ 20% of the participant’s maximal force; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Methods</xref> for details). While the rest time between contractions was identical for each session, each contraction’s real (R) and perceived (P) time were independently manipulated. In each session, the contractions’ time was either short (10 s) or long (12 s), while the digital clock displayed in front of the participants was either Normal (N) or Biased (B), leading to 4 counterbalanced conditions: N10 (10s P, 10s R), N12 (12s P, 12s R), B10 (10s P, 12s R), B12 (12s P, 10s R) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). Before and after the task, participants performed Maximal Voluntary Contractions (MVC) and 3-minute EEG resting states.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Neuromuscular fatigue</title><p id="P6">We first compared the physical fatigue generated in the two sessions with unbiased clocks (i.e., N12 and N10 sessions) to confirm that a longer effort generated a measurable difference in neuromuscular fatigue. To this end, we computed the difference between each session’s maximal voluntary torque pre-post variation rates and, as expected, we found a significantly negative difference (t<sub>(23)</sub> = 1.84, p = .039, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.38, BF = 1.75), indicating greater physical fatigue in the N12 session compared to the N10 session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A, 2C</xref>). We then applied the same analysis to the B10-N10 and N12-B12 differences, thus comparing the sessions with the same subjective time but different real times. Remarkably, we found no difference between the B10 and N10 sessions (t<sub>(23)</sub> = 0.66, p = .52, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.14, BF = 0.26), suggesting similar levels of fatigue between the two, despite the B10 session having a longer amount of actual work, identical to the N12 one. However, this subjective time-dependent relationship was non-symmetric, as evidenced by a significantly negative difference between the N12 session and the one perceived as long but identical to the short session, namely B12 (t<sub>(23)</sub> = 2.82, p = .010, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.58, BF = 4.99). This comparison indicates more fatigue in the N12 session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A, 2C</xref>), consistent with its higher actual workload.</p><p id="P7">We then investigated whether the biased clock influenced physical fatigue during the task, as observed in the pre-post measurements. To this end, we considered the sum of the EMG Root Mean Square (RMS) activity recorded during each session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Merletti et al., 1991</xref>). As in the pre-post case, we found a significantly positive difference between the N12 and N10 sessions (t<sub>(23)</sub> = 2.28, p = .016, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.47, BF = 3.64), supporting a greater fatigue accumulation in the longer, normal session. Concerning the comparison between the sessions with the same perceived time but a different real one, we found no differences between the subjectively short ones (B10-N10: t<sub>(23)</sub> = 1.26, p = .22, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.26, BF = 0.43), as well as between the subjectively long ones (N12-B12: t<sub>(23)</sub> = 1.44, p = .16, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.29, BF = 0.53) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B, 2C</xref>). Together, these results indicate that physical fatigue follows perceived rather than actual time when the clock is slowed down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Matta et al., 2024</xref>), whereas the results appear less compelling when the clock is accelerated.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Power modulations in the motor cortex</title><p id="P8">After demonstrating that physical fatigue depends on perceived time, consistently when the clock is slowed down but less clearly when it is accelerated, we investigated the neural correlates underlying this effect. We first examined the Motor Cortex (MC) activity, a key region involved in executing voluntary contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Brown, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Pearson, 2000</xref>). In line with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dal Maso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Forrester et al., 2006</xref>), we considered the Cz electrode and assessed relative spectral power changes in each participant’s individualized beta-band (Iβ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Matta et al., 2025</xref>) (i.e., a 5 Hz spectral window in the beta band with the largest desynchronization, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Methods</xref> for details). Importantly, we found an absence of difference between the N12 and N10 sessions (t<sub>(23)</sub> = 0.46, p = .33, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.094, BF = 0.32), possibly due to the relatively small discrepancy between the two sessions’ workload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Matta et al., 2025</xref>). Similarly, we found no difference between all pairs of sessions with the same subjective time (p &gt; .65, d &lt; 0.093, BF &lt; 0.24) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A, 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We additionally looked at the Cz electrode’s pre- to post-resting states (RS) Iβ power changes. Aligning with our previous results showing a consistent absence of physical fatigue difference between the sessions with a perceived short time, we found no difference between B10 and N10 Iβ power pre-post changes (t<sub>(23)</sub> = 0.15, p = .89, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.030, BF = 0.22). Other comparisons were found to be statistically inconclusive (N12-N10: t<sub>(23)</sub> = 1.30, p = .10, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.27, BF = 0.81; N12-B12: t<sub>(23)</sub> = 1.72, p = .099, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.36, BF = 0.80), though both showed a trend towards a significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A, 3B</xref>), overall reflecting the same pattern observed in the MVT results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A, Fig 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Power modulations in the prefrontal cortex</title><p id="P10">Next, we investigated changes in prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity, as it has been proposed to play a key role in effort maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bigliassi &amp; Filho, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Denis, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">McMorris et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Robertson &amp; Marino, 2016</xref>). We analyzed relative spectral power changes in the theta (θ) and Iβ bands of the averaged F3, F4, F7, and F8 electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Okamoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Robertson &amp; Marino, 2015</xref>). While frontal θ is assumed to reflect cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cavanagh &amp; Frank, 2014</xref>), the β band has also been proposed to have a similar function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Stoll et al., 2016</xref>). We found a significantly positive N12-N10 difference in both the θ (t<sub>(23)</sub> = 1.96, p = .031, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.40, BF = 2.10) and Iβ bands (t<sub>(23)</sub> = 2.23, p = .0.018, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.45, BF = 3.29). Remarkably, we also found that the sessions with the same perceived time did not exhibit any power difference for both bands (B10-N10, θ: t<sub>(23)</sub> = 0.72, p = .48, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.15, BF = 0.27; Iβ: t<sub>(23)</sub> = 0.54, p = .60, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.11, BF = 0.25); B12-N12, θ: t<sub>(23)</sub> = 0.33, p = .75, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.066, BF = 0.23; Iβ: t<sub>(23)</sub> = 0.42, p = .68, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.085, BF = 0.23)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C, 3D</xref>), indicating a strong dependency of these variables on perceived rather than actual time. Differently than in the MC, for which we did not observe an influence of the time manipulation, these results suggest a key role of the oscillatory activity of the PFC in the perceived time-dependent fatigue accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>EEG-EMG Connectivity</title><p id="P11">After independently investigating the EMG and the EEG power modulations, we considered the link between them by computing subject-by-subject correlations. We first found consistently across participants a negative correlation between EMG and Iβ Cz for all sessions (p &lt; .045, d &gt; 0.43, BF &gt; 1.41) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>), indicating more EMG activity for larger Iβ desynchronization. We then investigated the link between EMG and frontal oscillatory activity. Similarly, we found a negative correlation between EMG activity and frontal θ-band oscillations in B10 (t<sub>(23)</sub> = 2.70, p = .013, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.46, BF = 3.96), and as a trend in N10 (t<sub>(23)</sub> = 1.99, p = .059, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.41, BF = 1.14), but no correlations in the N12 and B12 sessions (p &gt; 0.36, d &lt; 0.19, BF &lt; 0.32) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). Conversely, we found a positive correlation between the EMG activity and the Iβ in the B12 session (t<sub>(23)</sub> = 2.25, p = .035, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.46, BF = 1.74) and, as a trend, in the N12 one (t<sub>(23)</sub> = 1.75, p = .094, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.36, BF = 0.80), while there was no correlation in the sessions whose perceived time was shorter (N10 and B10, p &gt; 0.75, d &lt; 0.66, BF &lt; 0.23, for both) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>). These results mirror the trends observed in frontal power modulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>), showing lower PFC-EMG correlations for short perceived times and larger correlations for longer ones, suggesting their dependency on perceived rather than actual time.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Relationship between frontal oscillatory dynamics and fatigue accumulation</title><p id="P12">Our results show a perceived time-dependent accumulation of physical fatigue and a frontal oscillatory dynamic that thoroughly follows perceived rather than actual time. Starting from the assumption that PFC is involved in belief representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Geuter et al., 2017</xref>), we hypothesized that participants with the strongest deceptive effect in the PFC would also exhibit the most substantial effect in the EMG. To test our hypothesis, we split the participants twice into two groups, via a median split, computed on the normalized θ power difference between the two sessions with the same perceived time. Such differences were computed as the absolute sum of the θ power difference between the B10-N10 and the N12-B12 sessions, normalized by the difference between the N12 and N10 conditions. In both cases, smaller differences correspond to a larger deceptive effect, as the θ power modulation in PFC follows the perceived rather than the actual time (‘Subjective-time’ (ST) group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>). Conversely, participants with larger power differences would rely more on the actual rather than the perceived time (‘Objective-time’ (OT) group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>). Note that we used the θ power difference to perform our median split due to its well-established relationship to cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cavanagh &amp; Frank, 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The ST group was the only one showing a significant positive difference between N12 and N10 in the fatigue accumulation as reflected by the EMG activity (ST: p &lt; .033, BF &gt; 2.58, OT: p &gt; 0.13, BF &lt; 0.86). Remarkably, when considering the θ-band power difference between B10-N10 conditions to split participants, we found an absence of difference between B10 and N10 (t<sub>(11)</sub> = 0.11, p = .91, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.033, BF = 0.29), as well as between N12 and B12 (t<sub>(11)</sub> = 0.47, p = .65, d<sub>z</sub> = 0.13, BF = 0.32) for the ST group in their EMG response. Further considering the θ-band power difference between N12-B12 conditions to split participants, we also found a trend for an absence of difference for the two sessions with the same perceived time (p &gt; .19, BF &lt; 0.63 for both B10-N10 and N12-B12) for the ST group. Conversely, the OT group showed no difference for any pairs of sessions, regardless of the power differences considered to split participants (p &gt; 0.27, BF &lt; 1.25 for all) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A,5B</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the power changes occurring within the PFC play a key role in the effectiveness of the deceptive effect on fatigue accumulation, as measured by the EMG. Interestingly, it also reveals that, in the ST group, fatigue can be slowed down and accelerated.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Link between interoceptive awareness and deception</title><p id="P14">To further explore the individual differences that may affect the strength of the deceptive effect, we considered as a mediating parameter the participants’ interoceptive awareness, which was measured via the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Mehling et al., 2012</xref>) after their last session. We specifically focused on the ‘Noticing’ and ‘Body Listening’ subscales, which are more closely linked to bodily processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Iodice et al., 2019</xref>). We then tested the correlation between the Noticing and Body Listening scores with the normalized absolute difference of neuromuscular fatigue accumulation (i.e., EMG) for the two sessions with the same subjective time (B10-N10 or N12-B12). In short, a low normalized index indicates no difference between the two sessions, suggesting a large deceptive effect, while a high index reflects the opposite. We hypothesized a positive correlation between the interoceptive score and the normalized index, i.e., the lower the interoceptive awareness, the higher the deceptive effect, and vice-versa. Using non-parametric Kendall’s tau correlation, we found a positive correlation between the Body Listening score and the B10-N10 normalized difference only (τ = 0.29, p = 0.029, BF = 3.16, unilateral test, H1: positive correlation). No correlation was found with the Noticing score (p &gt; 0.27, BF &lt; 0.47). These results suggest that the participant’s body awareness might predict the deceptive effect on neuromuscular fatigue accumulation in the slow-down clock configuration.</p><p id="P15">As our findings previously suggested a role of the PFC in the deceptive effect, we tested the correlation between the Noticing and Body Listening scores with the normalized absolute difference of θ frontal power modulations for the two sessions with the same perceived time. We found a positive correlation between the Body Listening score and the N12-B12 θ normalized difference only (τ = 0.31, p = 0.020, BF = 4.30, unilateral test, H1: positive correlation). While this result supports a link between interoception awareness and the deceptive effect, it remains unclear why it only appears when time is accelerated but not slowed down, as no other significant correlations were found (p &gt; 0.11, BF &lt; 1.02, unilateral test, H1: positive correlation).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">In the current study, we used a novel design to test the influence of time deception on physical fatigue accumulation while monitoring associated EEG power modulations. We found that physical fatigue consistently evolved according to the perceived rather than the actual time when the clock was slowed down, while it was not systematic for the accelerated clock. Importantly, this deceptive effect was found in the absence of motivational confounds, demonstrating for the first time the direct influence of time deception on the course of physical fatigue. Regarding the neural correlates of the deceptive effect, we observed no significant impact in the MC, possibly due to a relatively small difference in workload between the sessions. However, we found that frontal oscillatory dynamics thoroughly followed the perceived time. We then showed that frontal dynamics predict the effectiveness of time deception on fatigue accumulation, suggesting a key role of the PFC in the time deception effect.</p><sec id="S11"><title>Physical fatigue follows the perceived time</title><p id="P17">Our findings reveal that physical fatigue follows the subjective rather than the objective time when the clock is slowed down, echoing previous work emphasizing the mind’s influence on bodily processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Craik &amp; Sarbin, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Crum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Crum &amp; Langer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Langer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">London &amp; Monello, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Pomares et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Schachter &amp; Gross, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Snyder et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Thönes et al., 2021</xref>), such as blood glucose level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Park et al., 2016</xref>) and healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Aungle &amp; Langer, 2023</xref>). While physical fatigue has been proposed to depend on subjective time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Matta et al., 2024</xref>), the current study is the first to accurately disentangle the motivational effects from the temporal deception. Furthermore, our results seem to show an asymmetrical effect regarding clock manipulation. A possible explanation may involve efficiency considerations, as slowing down the process that conducts to exhaustion appears effective in fulfilling the required task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Meyniel et al., 2013</xref>), while accelerating it may be counterproductive. However, complementary analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>) nuance this effect, showing that some of the participants rely more on perceived time, both when the clock was slowed down and accelerated, while others follow objective time. Our findings suggest that interoceptive awareness mediates this effect: lower interoceptive awareness is associated with a larger deceptive effect, and vice versa. However, other factors likely influence this perceived-time dependency, such as the strength of participants’ beliefs (e.g., expectations that shorter times lead to less fatigue) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Shiv &amp; Carmon, 2005</xref>), the effectiveness of external clock manipulations on the perception of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Craik &amp; Sarbin, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Thönes et al., 2018</xref>), but also participants’ backgrounds or personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>).

This increase in theta power has been proposed as reflecting a fatigue-related compensatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Wascher et al., 2014</xref>) to allow sustaining performance, seemingly driven by subjective rather than actual performance. Moreover, given that frontal theta is a well-established marker of cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Arnau et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cavanagh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cavanagh &amp; Frank, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Ehrhardt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Howells et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Huster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Ishii et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Lopez-Gamundi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">McFerren et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Yu et al., 2022</xref>), our results suggest that the cognitive control required to sustain a physical task depends on perceived rather than actual time. Finally, several studies also reported an increase in frontal beta with the rise in fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bailey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Enders et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hottenrott &amp; Gronwald, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kubitz &amp; Mott, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Mechau et al., 1998</xref>).

Together, these results highlight the reliance of specific cognitive control time-related correlates to perceived rather than actual time. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of considering subjective components in cognitive experimental paradigms, as various subjective factors may significantly influence physiological measures.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>A predictive coding perspective</title><p id="P20">We found that PFC oscillatory dynamics and physical fatigue evolve according to perceived rather than actual time. The influence of the PFC on physical fatigue may be explained through predictive coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kaptchuk, 2018</xref>), a framework suggesting that the brain continuously generates expectations about incoming sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Friston, 2010</xref>). When there is a mismatch between expected and actual sensations – a prediction error – the brain can resolve this discrepancy either by updating its expectations (priors) or by actively adjusting bodily states (active inference) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Friston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Pezzulo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Seth, 2013</xref>). If we apply this framework to our findings, we may consider beliefs about time as prior factors that regulate physical fatigue through an active inference process. In this situation, the temporal deceptive manipulation induces an inaccurate temporal estimate, which generates a prediction error in the participants about their current fatigue level. In order to minimize such prediction error – the discrepancy between expected and actual fatigue – the brain may modulate interoceptive input (i.e., interoceptive signals related to physical fatigue, later influencing EMG signals), thereby adjusting the evolution of physical fatigue rather than revising its priors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Pagnini et al., 2023</xref>). In line with this framework, frontal oscillatory dynamics could reflect temporal priors, as the PFC has been proposed to play a key role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Geuter et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, previous research has demonstrated that beliefs can influence physiological effector systems such as the autonomic nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Amigo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Meissner, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Nakamura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Wager et al., 2009</xref>). In line with this interpretation, one may speculate that the change in the physical fatigue course is mediated by an indirect pathway that originates in the PFC and regulates peripheral organs (e.g., cardiac, respiratory) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Hassan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Thayer et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">2012</xref>), impacting muscle fatigue as an outcome to reduce the prediction error. Furthermore, our complementary analysis, splitting the participants based on their PFC power difference between sessions with the same subjective time, support the hypothesis that frontal areas modulate the time manipulation effect. Indeed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, only participants exhibiting strong deceptive effects in the PFC also experienced the deceptive effect on fatigue, as revealed in the EMG recordings. This result may pinpoint the PFC as one of the core structure involved in mediating the time deception effects on physical fatigue.</p></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P21">Our study demonstrates the direct influence of time deception on physical fatigue, irrespective of motivational factors and performance goals, and reveals key neural correlates of this effect. We show that this influence is primarily mediated by frontal oscillatory dynamics, which thoroughly follow the perceived time and are pivotal to the effectiveness of such deceptive time manipulation. Building on these findings, we propose potential mechanisms underlying this mind-body interaction. Future research will further investigate the neural mechanisms driving this phenomenon from different perspectives (e.g., cardiac, respiratory or fMRI recordings), to further deepen its theoretical understanding and explore its potential applications to clinical conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S16" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P22">Twenty-eight healthy volunteers (16 women, age: 24 ± 4, weight: 70 ± 18, mean ± SD) with no known history of neurological diseases or physical injuries and regular physical practice (once to several times a week) participated in this study. Out of the 28 individuals, 24 were able to complete the entire protocol and were kept on for the analysis. Before participating in the study, all individuals provided informed consent and were informed of their right to withdraw from the study at any time.

Their right leg was securely fastened to the ergometer accessory at the ankle with a non-compliant strap just above the malleolus. Two shoulder and one abdominal harnesses guaranteed a reduction in their range of motion and the involvement of other muscles besides the quadriceps. The installation parameters were optimized for every subject individually and kept identical within subjects for each session.</p><p id="P24">Torque and electromyography (EMG) were recorded at 2000 Hz using a Biopac MP150 system and AcqKnowledge software. EMG was recorded through three pairs of electrodes (AG-Cl, diameter: 11 mm, interelectrode distance: 2 cm), which were placed on the Vastus Medialis, Vastus Lateralis, and Rectus Femoris according to SENIAM recommendations. Before placement, the skin was carefully prepared through shaving and alcohol to ensure low impedance (&lt;5 KΩ). The reference electrode was positioned on the patella of the contralateral knee. EEG was recorded using a 64 electrodes Biosemi Active 2 system with 64 Ag-AgCl sintered active electrodes at 2048 Hz. The EEG electrode locations followed the 10–20 international system. The offset was kept below 20 mV using an active gel.

</p><p id="P33">Regarding the main task, participants performed 100 contractions at a fixed individualized intensity, defined as 20% of their maximal force, or 40 N.m if their maximal force was larger than 200 N.m. The intensity was the same among the four sessions. While the rest time between contractions was identical for each session (5 s), each contraction’s real (R) and perceived (P) time were independently manipulated. In each session, the contractions’ time was either short (10s) or long (12s), while the clock displayed to the participants was either Normal (N) or Biased (B). This manipulation led to 4 counterbalanced conditions: N10 (10s P, 10s R), N12 (12s P, 12s R), B10 (10s P, 12s R), B12 (12s P, 10s R). In practice, a sound indicated to the participants when to begin and end each contraction. Simultaneously with the starting sound, a rectangle was displayed in the middle of a black screen to provide online feedback to the participants on their actual force compared to the individualized targeted one. The rectangle’s color was updated online according to the ongoing force produced: red indicated that participants were below the targeted force, blue above, and green in the aimed range (-5% to +5% around the targeted force). A digital clock was displayed in the middle of the colored rectangle 0.75 s after the start of the contraction (preparation time left to the participants to reach the targeted force). This clock allowed us to perform our manipulation: it was either normal (N10 and N12), slowed down (B10), or accelerated (B12) without the participants knowing it. After the ending sound, the final perceived time (10.0 or 12.0 s) remained on the screen for 1 s, then the number of contractions already performed was displayed during the resting time. Note that data from the two normal sessions (N10 and N12) have been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Matta et al., 2025</xref>) in the context of a different question; Long MVC were specifically used there.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Data pre-processing</title><p id="P34">All data pre-processing and analyses were conducted offline using custom MATLAB (version 2022b) scripts along with EEGLAB functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Delorme &amp; Makeig, 2004</xref>).

On average, 61.7 ± 1.8 (mean ± SD) channels were retained for analysis. The electrodes were then re-referenced using a common average reference. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was performed with the Infomax algorithm, and the resulting components were labeled using the ICLabel plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Pion-Tonachini et al., 2019</xref>).

A final epoch rejection procedure was applied to the main task EEG data to remove additional noise. Epochs with a standard deviation greater than 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) above the 3rd quartile or below 1.5 times the IQR under the 1st quartile were rejected for each subject and electrode.

The three muscle EMG values were averaged over time to yield one EMG value per contraction in the main task.

statement</title></caption><p>Can a clock change the course of physical fatigue? In this study, we addressed this question while controlling for motivational confounds and monitoring EEG-associated power modulations. Our findings demonstrate a slowed-down fatigue accumulation in the presence of a slowed-down clock. This time manipulation effect was driven by a frontal oscillatory dynamic that thoroughly followed the perceived time. These results highlight the direct influence of psychological factors on physiological processes and unveil the neural correlates underlying this effect.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Experimental protocol and EMG/EEG computation</title><p>A. Experimental Protocol. All participants performed 100 contractions during four separate sessions. While the rest time between contractions was identical (5s) for each session, each contraction’s real (R) and perceived (P) time were manipulated. In each session, the contractions’ time was either short (10s) or long (12s), while the digital clock displayed in front of the participants was either Normal (N) or Biased (B). Before and after the task, Maximal Voluntary Contractions (MVC) were performed to assess the fatigue generated by the 100 contractions. Resting State (RS) EEG (3 min) was recorded before and after the task to quantify the associated EEG correlates. B. EMG/EEG Computation. All panels represent the typical trace of one contraction except the upper right panel, which illustrates the whole task. EMG and EEG were recorded throughout the task and explicitly analyzed over a 2 to 10 s window within each contraction (0 s being the contraction onset), from which we extracted one average value for each contraction. The EMG was computed in normalized Root Mean Square (RMS), while we computed the mean power of the theta (θ) and an individualized beta-band (Iβ) for the EEG (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Methods</xref> for details).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207333-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Physical Fatigue</title><p>A.
