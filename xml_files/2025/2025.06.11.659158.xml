Studies of neural circuit evolution often focus on a few elements within a network. However, addressing fundamental questions in evolutionary neuroscience, such as whether some elements are more evolvable than others, requires a more global and unbiased approach. Here, we used synapse-level comparative connectomics to examine how an entire olfactory circuit evolves. We compared the full antennal lobe connectome of the larvae of two closely related <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. erecta</italic>, which differ in their ecological niches and odour-driven behaviours. We found that evolutionary change is unevenly distributed across the network. Some features, including neuron types, neuron numbers and interneuron-to-interneuron connectivity, are highly conserved. These conserved elements delineate a core circuit blueprint presumably required for fundamental olfactory processing. Superimposed on this scaffold, we find rewiring changes that mirror each species’ ecologies, including a systematic shift in the excitation-to-inhibition balance in the feedforward pathways. We further show that some neurons have changed more than others, and that even within individual neurons some synaptic elements remain conserved while others display major species-specific changes, suggesting evolutionary hot-spots within the circuit. Our findings reveal constrained and adaptable elements within olfactory networks, and establish a framework for identifying general principles in the evolution of neural circuits underlying behaviour.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The astonishing diversity of animals’ sensory driven behaviours is a direct consequence of evolution shaping neural circuits. However, in contrast to our rapidly increasing understanding of how sensory information is processed in the brain, we know far less about how neural circuits evolve to generate species-specific behaviours. Some progress has been made by focusing on specific neurons within sensory circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, this strategy rarely offers the global perspective required to address fundamental questions about the way neural circuits evolve, for example, whether some elements are more evolvable than others.</p><p id="P4">An ideal way to gain such a systematic outlook is to examine complete circuits at synaptic resolution in species with different behaviours by using comparative connectomics. This approach was pioneered by comparing the neural circuits of two distantly related nematode species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, providing important insights into neuronal evolution. However, it remains unclear how broadly these findings apply across the diverse nervous system architectures found in other animals. Additionally, given the large phylogenetic distance between the two nematode species examined, the question of how neural circuits evolve over shorter evolutionary timescales remains open.</p><p id="P5">The olfactory system of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva is an attractive model because it shares core organisational features with olfactory circuits of other clades, including vertebrates, yet its smaller size unlocks the potential for a complete, synaptic level characterisation of a complex glomerular olfactory network through connectomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">A key feature of glomerular olfactory systems, whether in vertebrates or invertebrates, is that the axons of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that express the same receptors project to a common region within the first olfactory relay centre: the antennal lobe in insects and olfactory bulb in vertebrates. These regions, defined by the molecular identity of the OSNs, are called glomeruli and are the functional units of olfactory circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. As with most neural networks, the information from these structurally organised inputs is processed by local interneurons and sent to other brain regions via output projections neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Some of the computations performed by local neurons are common across phyla and networks, such as divisive normalisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, studying olfactory circuits can provide insights widely applicable to other neural networks. At the same time, their organisation into clearly defined functional units – the glomeruli – facilitates the interpretation of function out of structure, making them ideal systems for connectomics.</p><p id="P7">Although the organisational principles of olfactory circuits are similar across large evolutionary distances, the degree to which the network changes at the synaptic level across species as these adapt to different ecological niches remains largely unknown. Drosophilids are a powerful model clade to investigate the evolution of neural circuits because of the divergent behaviours displayed by closely related species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and the insights that can be gained by comparing them to the well-characterised circuits of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Although most studies have focused on adult flies, <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae have a complex olfactory-guided behavioural repertoire that allows them to navigate the heterogeneous ever-changing environments of decaying fruits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Importantly, the larvae of <italic>D. erecta</italic>, a close relative of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, has divergent odour-guided behaviours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1b-c</xref>), akin to differences reported for adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. <italic>D. erecta</italic>, like its relative <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, originated in Africa; while <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> has since become a cosmopolitan generalist – feeding and breeding on a wide range of fruits – <italic>D. erecta</italic> is endemic to West Africa and is specialised to exclusively feed and breed on the green and woody fruits of the shrub <italic>Pandanus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">To address questions about how neural circuits evolve in an unbiased and integrated way, we here provide, to our knowledge, the first synaptic resolution cross-species comparative connectomic analysis of a complete glomerularly organised olfactory network. We compare the full antennal lobe circuitry of the larvae of two closely related <italic>Drosophila</italic> species with divergent ecologies and odour-guided behaviours. We find that both species share a common circuit blueprint, including an identical complement of homologous neurons. Accordingly, direct comparison of how the <italic>same</italic> neurons connect in <italic>new</italic> ways, enables us to investigate the evolution of neuronal connectivity at the level of individually identified neurons.</p><p id="P9">We find that evolutionary change is unevenly distributed across the network. Some connectivity features, such as the interneuron-to-interneuron connectivity, are strikingly conserved, pointing to their key role in odour processing across species. These “stable” circuits are embedded in a suite of changes, including a systematic shift in the balance of excitation to inhibition in the feedforward network in a way that matches each species’ ecologies. Remarkably, we uncover that not all circuit elements have evolved their connectivity to the same extent, and that even within single neurons some synaptic elements remain conserved while others display major species-specific changes. Our work highlights how evolution can differentially impinge on the elements of a neural circuit with synaptic precision and suggests that some elements might act as hot-spots for behavioural change.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Comparing olfactory circuits across species at synaptic resolution</title><p id="P10">We acquired, using electron microscopy, a synaptic resolution volume of the central nervous system of a first instar <italic>D. erecta</italic> larva that encompasses the whole brain and part of the ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">Methods</xref>). We bilaterally reconstructed all olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and their synaptic partners and compared these reconstructions to a corresponding <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> connectome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We find that <italic>D. erecta</italic> has the exact same neuronal complement as <italic>D. melanogaster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>,</italic> including 21 OSNs connecting one to one with each of the 21 uniglomerular projection neurons (uPNs), constituting the feedforward uniglomerular system. In addition, information is carried to higher brain centres by a second set of 15 multiglomerular projections neurons (mPNs). Olfactory information is processed in both species by five distinct classes of local inhibitory interneurons (LNs), classified as: global LNs – encompassing the classes Broad (5 neurons per hemisphere) and keystone (2 medial bilaterally projecting neurons) –, and selective LNs – consisting of the classes Choosy (2 neurons per hemisphere), Picky (5 per hemisphere) and ventral (1 per hemisphere)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,e-f</xref>). This conservation points at changes in connectivity, rather than neuronal cell types, as the key substrate for behavioural change across closely related species.</p><p id="P12">To examine differences in connectivity with cellular and synaptic resolution, we next established homologies for each of the 21 uPNs (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">Methods</xref>), thus defining 21 homologous glomeruli across species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Employing similar methods, we established homologies for all the neurons in the circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-g</xref>). In the following sections we analyse their connectivity. Features conserved across species likely represent elements required for core computations in olfactory processing, while species-specific differences might reflect adaptations of each species to their respective ecological niche. Throughout the manuscript we have applied a stringent framework to define species-specific features, favouring a conservative approach that robustly identifies both, conserved connections as well as cross-species changes (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">Methods</xref>). Briefly, based on previous work, we use bilateral symmetry to estimate within species variability. Connections represented by more than 2 synapses in each hemisphere were shown in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larva to be species-characteristic connections that can be found reliably between the same homologous identifiable neurons across individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, and furthermore those representing more than 1% of input/output connectivity are considered to be strong and conserved within a species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. In addition, we attach a divergence confidence score to every cross-species difference, and identify strongly conserved connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">Methods</xref>). Therefore, for each cross-species change in connectivity we report the magnitude of the difference and its confidence.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>A common circuit blueprint</title><p id="P13">We clustered all LNs of both species based on their total connectivity and found that homologous neurons clustered together as expected, closely matching their clustering based on morphological similarity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). This result confirms our assignment of homologs across species (which was agnostic to neuronal connectivity) and establishes a conserved circuit blueprint of the AL across species. OSNs provide input to all circuit elements and receive input mostly from Broad and Keystone LNs. The two output channels of the AL, uPNs and mPNs, receive their main inputs from OSNs followed by Broad LNs (for uPNs) and Picky LNs (for mPNs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To uncover general features of this common circuit blueprint, we first determined the selectivity of each of the LN classes by calculating their cumulative glomerular synapse score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2b</xref>). We further characterise each LN class by measuring its input/output characteristics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2c</xref>) and its influence in the information flow through the network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig, S2d-e</xref>). The later calculated with two metrics: out-degree – a measure of how much a neuron influences its postsynaptic partners, and local reaching centrality – a measure of how far the activity of a neuron spreads through the network (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">Methods</xref>). We found that these quantitative features delineate each LN class and are conserved across species, with some subtle differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Next, we investigated how the network architecture of the AL has evolved by using modularity analysis to identify groups of neurons with high connectivity within groups and lower connectivity across groups. Although the network is not strongly modular, this approach independently identified the same 6 communities across both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">Methods</xref>). These communities are delineated by the interneuron to interneuron (LN-to-LN) connectivity, highlighting strong conservation in the local interneuron network. Interestingly, OSN-uPN pairs always cluster together in the same community but their association to specific communities has changed across species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary table 1</xref>). These observations suggest that the interneuron to interneuron (LN-to-LN) connectivity has remained relatively conserved while the way in which each of the olfactory channels plug into this backbone network has changed to a greater extent. We confirmed these conclusions by calculating the connectivity dissimilarity for each neuron in the core AL network and then <italic>in-silico</italic> removing either all LN-to-LN connectivity, all connectivity but LN-to-LN, or all connectivity but those originating from OSN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). This revealed that LN-to-LN connectivity is more similar across species than both, the overall connectivity of the AL and the connectivity from OSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). This uncovers a first principle in the evolution of olfactory circuits: conservation of the general blueprint of the local inhibitory network with divergence of the connectivity from individual olfactory channels.</p><p id="P16">In the following sections we delve deeper into the conserved and divergent connectivity features, tackling each element of the circuit in turn. First, we examine the uniglomerular circuit, OSNs and uPNs, followed by each of the LNs and the mPNs.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Evolution of the excitatory versus inhibitory input balance at the first synapse of olfaction</title><p id="P17">The shortest feedforward pathway of an olfactory circuit is the connection from OSNs to their glomerular partner uPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We calculated the anatomical transfer function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> of this synapse per glomerulus and surprisingly found that in each species a different set of OSNs are either strongly or weakly connected to their partner uPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). This cannot be explained solely by compensatory mechanisms adjusting OSN outputs to maintain a constant synaptic density on uPNs with larger dendrites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, because in that case we would expect these patterns to disappear when normalising by uPN dendritic cable length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3a-b</xref>). Importantly, whether looking at OSN synaptic number, or normalising by uPN inputs or cable length, three OSNs – all predicted to detect leafy odours (82a, 63a and 22c, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary table 2</xref>) – are more strongly connected to their corresponding uPNs in <italic>D. erecta</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2b-c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3a-b</xref>). This matches <italic>D. erecta’s</italic> ecology, given that pandan is a green, leafy, woody fruit. Furthermore, of these, 82a OSNs encode with high sensitivity the presence of geranyl acetate, a major component in the volatiles of pandan fruit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Our results, therefore, indicate specific increases in <italic>D. erecta’s</italic> OSN-to-uPN transfer function, potentially increasing the reliability of the signal for ecologically key odours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">In sensory circuits, the feedforward signal from sensory neurons is typically shaped through presynaptic inhibition by local interneurons, in the larval olfactory circuit this function is largely carried out by the Broad LNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3c</xref>). We found that <italic>D. erecta</italic> OSNs receive less Broad LN inputs than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, despite the former having slightly longer cable length and synaptic output (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3d</xref>). This results in lower presynaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3e</xref>) and a net increase in the excitation vs inhibition ratio in the terminals of OSNs in <italic>D. erecta</italic> when compared to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3e</xref>). This could be an adaptation that in the specialist, <italic>D. erecta,</italic> increases signal sensitivity by reducing noise introduced by local inhibitory neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> – facilitating navigation within a single fruit -, while in the generalist, <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> favours signal discriminability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> across multiple substrates.</p><p id="P19">Surprisingly, we found that some OSNs reliably synapse onto themselves – and occasionally other OSNs. Such autapses are also present in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larval OSNs, although they have not previously been reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e-f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3g-h</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">Methods</xref>). These synapses represent a small fraction of total OSN input (on average 9.8% and 12.2% for <italic>Dmel</italic> and <italic>Dere</italic> respectively) but can be high for some OSNs, up to 27% for 82a OSN in <italic>D. erecta</italic>. Furthermore, this connectivity motif has also evolved in a way that correlates with each species’ ecology: In <italic>D. erecta,</italic> autapses are restricted to OSNs detecting leafy and fruity odours, while in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are more evenly distributed, mostly happening in yeasty and nutty OSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Excitatory autapses can implement positive feedback loops that sustain activity beyond the time a neuron would be active based on its input activation alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Furthermore, in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> antennal lobe, it has been shown that OSN-to-OSN excitatory synapses can mediate decorrelation of odour responses and increase odour discriminability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Therefore, the differences in OSN autapses might serve as a mechanism to amplify signals of ecologically relevant channels, leading to increased decorrelation and discriminability of these odour representations. Furthermore, this axo-axonic connectivity establishes larval OSNs as the first processing layer of olfactory information, even before information is transferred to the local interneuron network.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Increased excitation vs inhibition in the specialist <italic>D. erecta</italic> is a feature of the uniglomerular circuit</title><p id="P20">We next examined the second neuronal class of the uniglomerular circuit, the uPNs, main downstream partners of OSNs and one of the two output channels of the AL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The dendrites of uPNs integrate excitatory input from OSNs and lateral inhibition from LNs, mostly Broad LNs followed by Choosy LNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4a</xref>). We found that excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto uPN dendrites are correlated within each species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>), indicating that the dendrites of each uPN keep a specific balance. In both species excitation dominates over inhibition, a pattern that is significantly stronger for <italic>D. erecta</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>).

The main synaptic partners of both types are OSNs and uPNs. However, the synaptic weight contribution for each type is different.

The key function in odour signal processing of these connectivity motifs likely underlies their conservation, while evolution has tuned their levels in a species-specific fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref>). In particular, <italic>D. erecta</italic> Broad LNs generally receive more inputs from OSNs and fewer from uPNs than <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>).

Broad LNs share many inputs within types and across species, with only slightly more differences when comparing across types (i.e. Broad Ds vs Ts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d-e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9</xref>). In contrast, the output dissimilarity matrix has more structure, revealing common outputs for Broad Ds, and conserved characteristic connectivity for each Broad T LN type, leading to comparable dissimilarity within types and species but larger across type dissimilarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d-e</xref>). This pattern is driven by reciprocal inhibition among Broad Ts in both species, and removing intra-Broad T connectivity breaks the pattern and reduces across types dissimilarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8a</xref>), suggesting that depending on the combination of activated glomeruli, one of the three Broad Ts might dominate presynaptic inhibition in the AL.</p><p id="P25">Superimposed on these general patterns, we found that although these local interneurons sample across all glomeruli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5, S7 and S9</xref>), the strength of the connectivity with specific OSNs and uPNs is heterogeneous, with some strongly conserved connections and some species-specific weight changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7-S8</xref>). Most prominently, glomerulus 82a – whose OSNs express a high sensitivity receptor for a pandan volatile –seems to operate relatively independently of the Broad LN circuit in <italic>D. erecta</italic>. In this species Broad LNs do not receive any strong inputs from either 82a OSN or uPN and only send weak outputs to 82a OSN but not 82a uPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7-S8</xref>). This might be an adaptation to reduce the noise and increase the reliability of this important ecological signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.

These bilateral interneurons receive input from most glomeruli but, unlike Broad LNs, they provide inhibition in a more heterogeneous way across the AL, as reflected by their lower output glomerular scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b-c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2b</xref>). A conserved feature across species is that even though Keystone LNs have a lower number of downstream partners than Broad LNs (i.e. a lower outdegree), the strength of their influence over the AL network dynamics might be similar, as reflected in their comparable local reaching centrality scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2d-e</xref>).</p><p id="P28">In both species, Keystone LNs and Broad LNs inhibit each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5-S6, and S11-S13</xref>), a connectivity motif that had been suggested to regulate whether presynaptic inhibition is dominated by one or the other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, two lines of evidence argue against this interpretation. First, Keystone LN neurites are mixed input/output elements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2c</xref>), and recent functional data has shown that OSN activation leads to local Keystone LN depolarisation, suggesting that neurites within glomeruli can act independently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Second, we found that Broad LNs inputs onto Keystone LNs are not homogenous (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13a-b</xref>) and scale with OSN inputs onto Keystones LNs in each glomerulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13d</xref>). This suggests a strongly conserved and previously undescribed computation for olfactory processing, whereby Broad LNs implement divisive normalisation of Keystone LNs responses as a function of total OSN drive per glomerulus.

This evolutionary switch in the multi-sensory integration of Keystone LNs suggest that, in <italic>D. erecta,</italic> Keystone LNs are more driven by ecologically relevant olfactory input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e-i</xref>), presumably leading to keystone-dependent processing in the presence of pandan.</p><p id="P30">To further explore this pattern, we analysed the connectivity of Keystone LNs with OSNs, taking into account the relative anatomical position of each glomerulus. This is functionally important because OSN activation generates Keystone LN neurites depolarisation over a few nearby glomeruli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Despite the larger input contribution from OSNs in <italic>D. erecta</italic>, the relative connectivity pattern to Keystones LNs is overall conserved with a few cross-species differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). In both species there is a cluster of antero-ventral glomeruli strongly connected to Keystone LNs likely strongly influencing their activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>).

The proportion of outputs to OSNs is more similar between the two species, with common targets that include the above-mentioned common input cluster, and a few – mostly leafy glomeruli – more strongly targeted in <italic>D. erecta</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). These connectivity patterns suggest that Keystone LNs are activated in the presence of host cues and evolution has tweaked their tuning, biasing it towards each species niche – leafy olfactory in <italic>D. erecta</italic> and mixed olfactory and gustatory for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Their activation, in turn, leads to presynaptic inhibition of select OSNs, a computation that produces lateral inhibition potentially enhancing contrast among key odour channels.</p><p id="P31">Moreover, Keystone LN activity is also regulated by Picky LN 0, which inhibits them in a glomerular-selective fashion, more so in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> than in <italic>D. erecta</italic>. This contributes further to the heterogeneous inhibition that Keystone LNs exert on OSNs. For example, 82a OSNs are under slightly stronger Keystone LN inhibition in <italic>D. erecta</italic>, a difference that is amplified through the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>-specific inhibition of Keystone LNs in this glomerulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4j</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S13e</xref>).

In both species, these interneurons get input almost exclusively from OSNs with leafy descriptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S14a</xref>), with 82a and 45a – the high and low sensitivity OSNs for geranyl acetate, a pandan volatile – more connected in <italic>D. erecta</italic>. Interestingly, 13a is the only OSN strongly synapsing with all Choosy LNs in both species. This OSN had been described to respond mostly to leafy odours, but some of its major ligands have also been identified as products of the degradation of fruit pigments by bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> and as products of yeast fermentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>). It is possible that Choosy LNs integrate olfactory channels and modalities to compute fruit “ripeness”; 13a would indicate fruit degradation by microorganisms, while the other leafy “green” channels could inform ripeness progression – in particular for <italic>D. erecta</italic> through the levels of geranyl acetate in pandan -, taste inputs carry information on bitter/sweet qualities of the substrate which decrease/increase as fruits ripen, while mechanosensory information informs fruit hardness. This suggest a previously unappreciated possibility, that some olfactory LNs might compute stimulus features that are ecologically relevant, such as “ripeness”, analogous to, what has been suggested for some amacrine cells in the visual system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Under such scenario, Choosy LN input connectivity might have evolved to best represent the ripeness features of each species fruit hosts.</p><p id="P35">This ripeness feature representation in Choosy LNs could be used to shape the response of key projection neurons, thus leading to appropriate behaviours. As major providers of inhibition to uPNs and mPNs Choosy LNs are well positioned to carry out this function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Choosy LNs provide postsynaptic inhibition to half of the uPNs in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and the two geranyl acetate sensors in <italic>D. erecta</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S14b</xref>).

Although little is known about the function of these projection neurons, Cobra mPN – which is targeted more strongly by Choosy LNs in <italic>D. erecta</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>) – has been described to mediate innate aversion to geranyl acetate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, raising the possibility that adequate pandan ripeness levels could, through the activation of Choosy LNs, counteract this aversion.</p><p id="P36">We next looked at another component of the selective inhibitory network, the Ventral LNs.

The opposite is true for P2 and P4, whose inputs are very different but share more common outputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g</xref>). Importantly, the cross-species change index revealed that evolution has differentially impinged in the input and output connectivity of each Picky LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6h</xref>).

Our first question was whether this stereotyped OSN input connectivity might have evolved more than the Picky LN to mPN inputs. We computed the cross-species change index for both connectivity features and found that while, indeed, overall OSN inputs have evolved more than those from Picky LNs, the connectivity from the two neuronal classes has changed to different extents in different mPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>). For example, seahorse and D mPNs have dramatically evolved their OSN connectivity, while their Picky LN inputs have remained remarkably conserved. At the other end, A3 and B3 mPNs have undergone the opposite evolutionary trajectory, with many more changes to their Picky LNs than OSN inputs. This, again, underscores the “multiplexed” nature of evolutionary change in neuronal connectivity, whereby within the same dendritic field some input elements can diverge while other remain conserved.</p><p id="P45">To explore the evolution of OSN connectivity to mPNs, we plotted the network diagram of mPNs with at least 30% input contribution from OSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e</xref>, the connectivity matrix for all olfactory mPNs is in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S20b</xref>).

Intriguingly, another new IFL in <italic>D. erecta</italic> involves the high sensitivity geranyl acetate sensor OSN 82a, which is connected to cobra mPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e</xref>) as well as Picky LN 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>) in <italic>D erecta</italic> but not in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> – the loop is closed by the connection of Picky LN 4 to cobra mPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S21</xref>).

We found that 40% of these are shared between the two species and have a strong representation of OSNs with yeasty descriptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7g</xref>) – matching the ecological relevance of yeast fermentation for both species. <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> specific IFLs have a stronger contribution from OSNs with fruity descriptors, while those exclusive to <italic>D. erecta</italic> are enriched in OSNs with leafy descriptors – including the two IFLs involving 82a and 45a described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7f-g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S3</xref>). These patterns reflect the evolution of the combinatorial OSN excitatory and Picky LN inhibitory input onto mPNs.

Furthermore, key questions in evolutionary neuroscience – such as the evolvability of different elements in the circuit – are best addressed by examining complete circuits in an unbiased way. Here, we have leveraged the small size, yet complex organisation, of the olfactory circuit of the Drosophilid larvae to carry out, to our knowledge, the first cross-species comparative connectomics of a glomerularly organised olfactory circuit. Importantly, this glomerular organisation facilitates the interpretation of function out of structure, making them an ideal system for connectomics. By comparing, at synaptic resolution, the circuits of two closely related species with divergent ecologies and odour-guided behaviours, we have uncovered evolutionary patterns that might be generalisable to other networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><sec id="S14"><title>Conserved features</title><p id="P47">Comparing circuits across species enables us to identify not only the changes, but also the conserved features that define a putative circuit blueprint.

However, when looking at finer resolution, into individually identifiable neuronal elements, we found that while the interneuron-to-interneuron connectivity is conserved, the way in which each of the olfactory channels “plug” into this network has evolved to various degrees. This profiles a mode of evolution by which the circuit motifs performing core computational transformations required to process olfactory information remain conserved, but their synaptic weights and sensory channel specificity are shaped by species-specific environmental needs.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Evolved features</title><p id="P49">A key difference between the olfactory system of the generalist versus the specialist species is a change in the excitatory-to-inhibitory ratio in the feedforward circuit, most prominently onto the dendrites of its main output channel, the uPNs. We speculate that this might be an adaptation to each species’ lifestyles. Lateral inhibition has been shown to decorrelate uPN responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, increasing odour discriminability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, but it also introduces noise <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Therefore, the observed shift would favour stimuli discriminability in the generalist – which needs to navigate varied substrates –, and sensitivity in the specialist (by reducing noise into the system) – for which accurately sensing the right ripening stage of a single fruit might be crucial. This finding contrasts with the evolutionary trajectory found when comparing subcircuits in the cortex of human and mice, whose projection neurons – the pyramidal cells – maintain a strict E/I ratio but where the interneuron-to-interneuron connections have evolved substantially<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. The origin of this difference is unclear, given that the exact identity of the inhibitory neurons undergoing the change remains unknown, and future work on the identity and function of different types of cortical neurons might help resolve this question. This highlights the need to examine circuits in different brain regions and across a wide variety of species and evolutionary distances, as merging the knowledge across these studies can inform future work and help us gain a global understanding of how neural circuits evolve.</p><p id="P50">Another important finding is that not all elements of the system have evolved to the same extent. Generally, the interneuron-to-interneuron connectivity is well conserved while the sensory input that LNs receive has evolved to a greater extent. However, even this is variable from neuron to neuron. For example, we find that a single interneuron, Picky 4 LN, stands out as a hot-spot, having changed its input connectivity the most. Furthermore, within a single neuron, synapses with some neuronal types might remain conserved while those with other neuronal populations might change dramatically, evidencing synaptic evolutionary multiplexing, reminiscent of what has been reported in the evolution of direction selective circuits in the retinas of mice and rabbits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In the antennal lobe, this is best exemplified by the inputs to mPNs, where each mPN has independently evolved its Picky LN and OSN inputs to different extents.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Outlook and limitations</title><p id="P51">Examining full circuits at synaptic resolution is challenging given the limitations of data acquisition, both in terms of imaging and circuit reconstruction. Therefore, we have compared a single individual of each species, meaning that potentially some of the differences identified could be cross-individual rather than cross-species. We have aimed at minimising this possibility by leveraging bilateral symmetry (the lack of crossover of OSNs in the larva), and previous connectomics work, to inform a stringent framework for the identification of cross-species differences (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">Methods</xref>). We attach to every connection two values: the magnitude of change and a confidence score of divergence/conservation. Changes represented by a large difference in magnitude across species and a strong divergence confidence value are most likely to be true cross-species differences, and we have focused on these throughout the manuscript. In the future, acquisition of multiple connectomes per species – aided by recent advances in automatic neuronal reconstruction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> – will enable to fine tune the confidence values identified here. Finally, arguably one of the most important outcomes of connectomics is the generation of specific and testable hypotheses. In this regard, our work – thanks to the tractability of Drosophilids – opens exciting future opportunities to experimentally investigate the functional implications of the identified neural circuit changes and their contribution to behavioural evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S18"><title>Electron microscopy sample preparation</title><p id="P52">The central nervous system of an 8 to12 hour old <italic>D. erecta</italic> larva was dissected in 4°C cold Baines solution and immediately processed.

Next, we validated these assignments by examining the morphology of uPNs – similar morphology is a hallmark of homology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Because uPNs are born sequentially from different neuroblasts the position of their cell bodies reflects this developmental origin, with neurons forming a tract in the direction of the neuroblast of origin with earlier born neurons having cell bodies closer to the neuropile and later born neurons closer to the outside of the brain. Homologous neurons are expected to have common developmental origins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and thus similar cell body positioning. Next, we examined the anatomy of uPNs, in particular their axonal paths and arbourisations in the lateral horn and mushroom body. This was done iteratively by several observers. This gave a high confidence identification of homologs of all OSN-uPN pairs across species. We note that the naming of the glomeruli is according to the olfactory receptor expressed by each OSN in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. We find that <italic>D. erecta</italic> has the same complement of olfactory receptors and targeted experiments have confirmed for a subset of them – as expected – their expression in the same OSNs as in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.

For example, Trito neurons exist in both species, but in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> only receive SEZ input while in <italic>D. erecta</italic> they receive a small fraction of OSN inputs.

In each case, this is indicated in the figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Comparing connectomes across species</title><p id="P61">To compare connectomes across species we first defined what constitutes each species connectome. Because OSNs do not cross-over the midline, the right and left ALs develop independently. Therefore, we used bilateral symmetry as an indication of true species characteristic connectivity and consider asymmetries as an indication of within-species variability. This approach is based on previous connectomics work. First, work on the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae showed that connections between two identified neurons that are represented by 2 or more synapses in each hemisphere of the same animal are true species-characteristic connections that can be found reliably between the same homologous identifiable neurons across individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Furthermore, analysis of whole brain connectomes of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larval and adult revealed that connections that constitute more than 1% of either input or output connectivity are considered to be strong and conserved within a species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Therefore, we use these two heuristics through the paper to describe species-characteristic connectivity. Specifically, we define species-characteristic connections as those between homologous pre- and post- synaptic partners that are observed to consist of 2 or more synapses in both hemispheres (e.g. a connection between two homologous neurons that is represented by a single synapse in one side is not considered a reliable connection, even if on the other hemisphere the connection consists of more than 2 synapses). We define strong connections using a similar criteria but with a higher threshold, considering strong species-characteristic connections as those that constitute in each hemisphere at least 1% of input or output connectivity between two connected pairs of homologous neurons. We indicate in the text and the figures which of these two thresholds is being applied. For bilateral neurons, such as Keystone LNs and some mPNs, we applied the same rule as for unilateral neurons, virtually flipping their arbours to compare left-right homologs connectivity (i.e. we avoid thresholding across the branches within the same hemisphere, and instead compare the arbour ipsilateral to cell body of each homolog with each other and the contralateral arbour to the contralateral arbour for each neuron).</p><p id="P62">To compare connectomes across species we have applied a stringent framework, favouring a conservative approach that robustly identifies cross-species changes, at the expense of overlooking potential subtle differences. This is one of the motivations behind employing two different synapse thresholds, for example, using the more stringent threshold of 1% might eliminate true synapses in one species, which might be represented only by 0.9% on one side, but not the other species, where both sides might be connected at 1%, if this is the only connectivity that is being compared, it could lead to the wrong conclusion that this is a connection present in one species but not the other, while the connection is truly present in both species, but at different strengths. Therefore, in an effort to robustly identify species differences, across the manuscript we have examined connectivity without any thresholding and with the two thresholds presented above. In addition, we attach to every species divergence a confidence score, calculated based on three parameters: 1) for any connection between two identified neurons, the number of synapses connecting them in any of the two hemispheres of one species can not overlap with that of the equivalent connectivity between homologous across any of the two hemispheres of the other species, if they do, the confidence score is drawn to zero, 2) the same criteria applies to their normalised connectivity – i.e, fraction of input or output connectivity that the connection represents. 3) we calculate for each connection the percentage of change in synapse fraction across species and, based on recent analysis of multiple connectomes of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> adult brains, we assign a low confidence (grey colour) to differences below 30%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, for each cross-species changes in connectivity we report the magnitude of the difference and its confidence. This means that sometimes we might find small differences, with high confidence, and conversely bigger differences with lower confidence, depending on how variable the connectivity is across hemispheres within a species. In addition, we identify robustly conserved connections as those that are represented by more than 2 synapses across both hemispheres of each species, and whereby both the raw number of synapses as well as its proportion of total synapses have at least 90% similarity, including those connections where the distributions of either raw synaptic count or proportion of synapses overlaps across species at least 80%.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Community detection</title><p id="P63">Modularity analysis was performed using the Louvain method of modularity maximization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>, by employing the “lovain_communities” function of the Communities subpackage of the NetworkX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> package for Python, with a standard resolution of 1.

More precisely, the transparency of each node is the proportion of iterations (out of all 1000 iterations) where the focal node is assigned to the same community as in the ‘reference’ configuration. For example, neurons that were assigned to the same community in all 1000 repetitions are coloured in solid colour, while those that only appeared in the ‘reference’ configuration 500 times would have a 50% transparency appearance.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Glomerular meshes</title><p id="P65">Glomerular meshes were generated by taking the location of OSN inputs onto AL neurons and calculating a gaussian kernel density per OSN identity using the skimage script within the scikit-image python package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. Additionally, we generated a bounding AL mesh using olfactory inputs and outputs of Broad LNs and an alphashape fitted to the resultant points. We used these to then generate the final glomerular meshes with the ‘AL glomeruli meshes’ script from <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Properties of Antennal lobe neurons</title><p id="P66">The segregation index was calculated using the R package catnat v0.1. Briefly, catnat makes use of the synapse flow centrality algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> to assign dendrite and axon identity to sections of the neuronal arbour. Subsequently, it calculates a segregation index based on the distribution of pre- and post- synaptic sites in each compartment.</p><p id="P67">Local reaching centrality (LCR) and out-degree were calculated as presented in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Briefly, LCR of a neuron (node) is a measure of the proportion of other nodes in the network can be reached via outgoing connections. Therefore, a high LCR is an indication that the activity of a neuron can – theoretically – propagate through a large part of the network. It was calculated using NetworkX v2.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>, which takes directed weighted graphs and takes into account the weight of each edge (number of synaptic connections). Out-degree is the weighted count of all outgoing connections from a neuron. Unlike LRC it measures the influence of a neuron over its immediate downstream synaptic partners.</p><p id="P68">Synaptic scores were calculated as presented in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Briefly, for each morphological type we constructed a matrix where each row was a neuron and each column a glomerulus, indicating the number of input or output synapses each neuron gets/gives per glomerulus (for the input and output synapse scores respectively). For each neuron (column) the rows were normalised between 0 and 1 and sorted in descending order. From here the sum of the ranked glomeruli was calculated within each neuronal class.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Excitatory vs inhibitory balance analysis</title><p id="P69">We calculated the bilateral averages of the number of excitatory and inhibitory input synapses for OSNs and uPNs, and calculated the ratio: excitatory divided by inhibitory. From here, we compared the number of synapses within each neuron-pair across the two species, normalised to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (=1), such that <italic>D. erecta</italic> data shows the corresponding fold-change. Stats are based on a 2-tailed Wilcoxon Rank test. In addition, we also used origin-restricted linear regression to quantify the relationship between the number of excitatory and inhibitory synapses per neurons in a class. These analyses were done using custom written scripts in Igor-Pro 9 (Wavemetrics).</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Cross-species change index and dissimilarity matrices</title><p id="P70">To produce the dissimilarity matrices, we generated for each neuron a vector of either its input or output connectivity normalised by total inputs or outputs from homologous identified neurons. Using these normalised vectors, we calculated the Euclidean distance between each neuron and plotted it as a dissimilarity matrix using R. The cross-species change index was then calculated as follows. We estimated intra-species dissimilarity for each neuron by averaging the dissimilarity index of the left and right homologs of each species, i.e. intra-species dissimilarity = μ ((dissimilarity left vs right in Dmel), (dissimiliary left vs right in Dere)). Then we estimated inter-species dissimilarity by averaging the dissimilarity between all the possible combinations of homologs across species, i.e. inter-species similarity = μ ((dissimilarity of right Dmel vs right Dere), (dissimilarity of right Dmel vs left Dere), (dissimilarity of left Dmel vs right Dere), (dissimilarity of left Dmel vs left Dere)). The cross-species change index was then calculated as, index = ((inter-species dissimilarity) – (intra-species dissimilarity)) / (intra-species dissimilarity).</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Connectivity per glomerulus in Keystones</title><p id="P71">To calculate the input and output that the neurites of Keystone LNs make with Broad LNs and Picky 0 LN per glomeruli, we first generated meshes for each glomerulus in the four ALs of our datasets, and then extracted the synapses of each Keystone LN branch from within the corresponding glomeruli mesh.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Behavioural assays</title><p id="P72">Clear 10 cm square petri dishes filled with 1% agarose in distilled water were used as experimental arenas. At opposing sides of the plate, 1 cm from the edge, two stripes of parafilm were placed, and on top 10 droplets of 10ul each of either grape juice or pandan extract were pipetted onto each side. For each experiment, 10-15 newly hatched (0-2 hours after egg laying) larvae were place on the midline of the plate and left to crawl for 30 minutes and final larval positions recorded. The preference index was calculated as A-B/A+B, A and B being the number of larvae on each side. Larvae that did not move from the midline were excluded from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Visualisations</title><p id="P73">The <italic>D. erecta</italic> brain mesh was generated by segmenting a subset of frames using 3DSlicer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup> and using the interpolation function. This generated a NRRD file that was used to compute a mesh object by employing the Marching Cubes algorithm via the skin image and trimesh modules in Python<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. The mesh was exported in STL format and subsequently treated in MeshLab 2021.05<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup> by using its Uniform Mesh Resampling tool. Finally, this resulting mesh was solid-fied using the Make Solid tool in MeshMixer.

In black are those neurons that belong to the same community across both species, in red are those that in each species has been assigned to a different community. The algorithm was run 1000 times.
