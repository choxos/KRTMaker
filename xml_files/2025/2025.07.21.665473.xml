Here, fully DNA-based HMPs are presented, whose material properties can be precisely tuned by sequence-programmable design of self-assembling DNA nanostructures. These DNA-HMPs offer control over size, stiffness, viscoelasticity and ligand presentation. They are formed by microfluidic encapsulation of two types of orthogonal DNA nanostars and a sequence-complementary DNA linker in water-in-oil droplets. By varying the valency of the DNA nanostar designs, tunable mechanical properties are achieved – spanning three orders of magnitude in Young’s modulus from 30 Pa to 6.5 kPa with distinct viscoelastic behavior. Click-chemistry based functionalization with the small fibronectin-derived peptide cyclic-RGD (c[RGD]) enables integration into fibroblast spheroids. DNA-HMPs are stably retained within the spheroids for several days and undergo design- and stiffness-dependent remodeling, indicating active interactions between the cells and the DNA-HMPs. Combining tunable material properties and inherent biocompatibility of DNA with straightforward functionalization and stimuli-responsiveness, these DNA-HMPs represent a versatile tool to probe and manipulate tissue behaviors in 3D cell cultures and in vivo models.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DNA nanotechnology</kwd><kwd>DNA hydrogel</kwd><kwd>microfluidics</kwd><kwd>biomaterials</kwd><kwd>hydrogel microparticles</kwd><kwd>3D cell culture</kwd><kwd>mechanobiology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Tools that enable localized perturbation and monitoring of the cell microenvironment are essential to advance 3D cell culture for tissue engineering, disease modeling, and precision medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Hydrogel microparticles (HMPs) – micron-sized gel beads – are well-suited for this task. Unlike conventional bulk hydrogels, they are cell-sized objects that allow biochemical and mechanical cues to be applied from within complex multicellular systems, as well as enabling real-time readouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. HMPs have been produced from polymers such as alginate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], polyacrylamide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], polyethylene glycol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], and agarose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. They are prominently used as cell culture substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] or as adjuvants that provide physical or chemical signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Beyond this, they serve as spatially discrete sensors in tissues owing to their elastic material properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. However, most conventional polymeric HMPs lack versatility in terms of the capacity for targeted chemical functionalization, fine-scale mechanical programmability, and integration of dynamic or stimuli-responsive behavior, such as controlled structural changes or molecular release in response to environmental cues. DNA-based materials offer a promising alternative due to their sequence-defined self-assembly, precise mechanical tuning, and straightforward chemical modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. DNA hydrogels have been applied in various biomedical contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], yet efforts have focused on bulk gels. Despite extensive rheological studies of bulk DNA networks showing storage moduli ranging from 10Pa to 100 kPa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], HMPs made from DNA hydrogels with controllable size, mechanical properties, and biofunctionality have not yet been realized. Moreover, such materials have not been explored as deformable force-responsive elements within living tissues. Here, we thus introduce fully DNA-based hydrogel microparticles (DNA-HMPs) with programmable viscoelastic properties and functional biointerfaces. These particles are formed by microfluidic co-encapsulation of self-assembling DNA nanostars and sequence-complementary linkers. They exhibit finely tunable Young’s moduli over three orders of magnitude from 30Pa to 6.5 kPa that offer exceptional resolution in material design. Beyond microfluidics, DNA-HMPs can also be generated by simple vortexing of the solution making their production broadly accessible without specialized equipment. Once formed, the DNA-HMPs are highly stable and retain their structure for at least 1 year under refrigerated conditions. They behave predominantly elastic under low-frequency indentation, but their viscoelastic response can be modulated through rational DNA nanostar design. The HMPs can be further functionalized via click chemistry with cyclic-RGD (c[RGD])-peptides to enable active cellular interaction. When added to fibroblast spheroids, the DNA-HMPs are readily internalized, stably retained, and undergo design-dependent deformation and remodeling, highlighting their potential as minimally invasive cell-interactive mechanical probes. Combining modular mechanical tuning, biochemical customization, and biocompatibility, DNA-HMPs establish a new class of materials to interact with the 3D cell microenvironment. In the future, DNA-HMPs can therefore serve as a platform for tissue engineering approaches and biophysical analysis in a variety of setups.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><label>2</label><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Size-controlled formation of DNA-HMPs by microfluidics</title><p id="P3">Towards applications in 3D cell culture, we first derived a strategy to produce DNA-HMPs in a reproducible and size-controlled manner. We used microfluidics to encapsulate the hydrogel-forming DNA components into water-in-oil droplets. After gel formation, stable DNA-HMPs were released from the droplet shell into an aqueous environment as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>. We selected a DNA nanostar design which has been shown to form stable hydrogels in bulk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. The design is composed of three single strands of DNA, which form a 3-arm nanostructure upon thermal annealing (for details see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Experimental Section</xref>). To enable imaging of the resulting DNA-HMPs by fluorescence microscopy, one of the single strands was covalently labeled with a Cyanine-3 (Cy3) dye (for details see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Experimental Section</xref>). Two sets of such DNA nanostars (A and B), each equipped with orthogonal nine nucleotide-long overhangs on all three arms, form the monomeric units of the hydrogel. As A and B have non-complementary overhangs, cross-linking and hydrogel formation is only initiated upon addition of an 18 nucleotide long single-stranded DNA linker (for DNA sequences see Table S1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. In the following, we will refer to this design as “3-arm short” to distinguish it from other designs that will be introduced later.</p><p id="P4">To prevent clogging of the microfluidic device by gel-forming DNA species, we designed a double-inlet microfluidic device where A and B only encounter the DNA linker after the formation of the water-in-oil droplet (for chip layout see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). To form the DNA-HMPs, A and B were supplied in one inlet, while the second inlet delivered the DNA linker, added at three times molar excess to the 3-arm short DNA nanostars, such that each of the three arms binds one linker. At the intersection of the aqueous phases with a surfactant-oil phase, water-in-oil droplets formed, encapsulating the DNA components.</p><p id="P5">Sequence-specific binding of the DNA linker to both types of sticky-end overhangs inside the water-in-oil droplets then resulted in the formation of spherical DNA hydrogels which condensed into stable DNA-HMPs over the course of several hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Note that for maximum yield, DNA-HMPs were normally matured for 72 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). The DNA-HMPs were then released from their droplet shells by adding a droplet-destabilizing surfactant, perfluoro-1-octanol, as previously used for the formation and release of droplet-stabilized giant unilamellar vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. This allowed us to collect the fully-formed, stable DNA-HMPs in aqueous solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Control experiments confirmed that formation of the DNA-HMPs only occurred when both the nanostars and the DNA linker were co-encapsulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Tracking the formation of the DNA-HMPs in water-in-oil droplets over time, we observe the formation of smaller DNA clusters that then condense into a singular spherical DNA-HMP per droplet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Video S1</xref>). During this process, the area fraction of the fluorescent signal inside the droplets and thus the size of the forming DNA-HMP decreases over the course of 2 h before reaching a plateau, indicating maturation of the DNA-HMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B-D</xref>). Cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (cryoSEM) further revealed that the DNA-HMPs consist of interconnected domains of higher DNA density with a diameter on the order of 200 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3E</xref>). This architecture indicates that the condensation of the DNA into HMPs is aided by liquid-liquid phase separation on the nanoscale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>].</p><p id="P7">In order to create uniform DNA-HMPs of varying sizes, we adjusted the flow-rates of the oil- and the aqueous phase, respectively, fine-tuning the diameter of the resulting droplet. We formed DNA-HMPs with narrow size distributions of 9.1 μm ± 1.0 μm, 16.4 μm ± 0.8 μm and 28.6 μm ± 0.9 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, for corresponding flow rates see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Experimental Section</xref>). Utilizing a wider microfluidic channel of 60 μm instead of 30 μm, we were able to produce DNA-HMPs as large as 59.9 μm ± 5. 8 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), allowing us to mimic a vast range of cell sizes found in mammalian tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. For the production of large quantities of DNA-HMPs, we additionally developed a scalable one-pot method. It involves layering the DNA-containing solution on top of the oil surfactant mix in a reaction tube or any larger reaction container. Instead of using microfluidics, the formation of water-in-oil droplets is induced by vortexing. While the one-pot method results in a broader size distribution (23.3 μm ± 9.5 μm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), it is fast, scalable and does not require specialized expertise or equipment. It thus facilitates the implementation of DNA-HMPs in laboratories without access to microfluidics when stringent size control is not required. With fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments on DNA-HMPs, we confirmed that they consist of a stable gel-phase after release from the droplet shell; the fluorescence of the bleached area did not recover over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Video S2</xref>). Moreover, the high stability of the DNA-HMPs makes handling straightforward. They can be stored in solution at 4°C for at least 1 year without any apparent morphological changes or loss of structural integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Additionally, they settle inside a reaction tube within minutes and can be pelleted by centrifugation using a simple table-top spinner. This allows for quick buffer exchange, washing and functionalization which is key for downstream applications.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2.2</label><title>Characterization of the material properties of DNA-HMPs tunable by sequence design</title><p id="P8">Having demonstrated the feasibility of DNA-HMPs, we next explored whether their mechanical properties can be tuned by altering the valency of the DNA nanostars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] and their arm lengths. Thus, we designed three more DNA nanostars, named 3-arm, 4-arm and 6-arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the updated 3-arm design, the sticky-end overhangs of the 3-arm short DNA nanostar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) were elongated by three additional nucleotides. The DNA linker was extended accordingly, resulting in an increase of the melting temperature from 46°C (unbound fraction at 37°C = 23%) to 66°C (unbound fraction at 37°C = 8.8%). We reasoned that this higher thermal stability would improve the suitability of the DNA-HMPs for applications in cell culture and animal models at physiological temperature. Hence, we used the elongated linker also for the higher-valency nanostars with 4 and 6 arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, for DNA sequences see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P9">While DNA-HMPs from the 3-arm and 4-arm DNA nanostars were readily formed at room temperature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A/B</xref>), 6-arm DNA-HMPs required thermal annealing. This is likely because, partial crosslinking traps the DNA-HMPs in a gel state once three or more arms are bound, while unbound arms act as surfactants, destabilizing the overall structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Thermal annealing decreases the amount of unbound arms, enabling the formation of stable 6-arm DNA-HMPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>, for details see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Experimental Section</xref>). To overcome the need for annealing, we reasoned that introducing flexibility in the DNA linkers should also enhance the chances of complete binding. We thus added two flexible thymine-nucleotides to the center of the 6-arm linker (6-arm flexible), which rescued 6-arm DNA-HMP formation at room temperature (Table S1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 2A/S4D</xref>). In summary, we developed five distinct DNA nanostar designs that allow for the water-in-oil droplet-templated formation of DNA-HMPs.</p><p id="P10">Next, we set out to investigate how nanostar valency and design influence the material properties of the DNA-HMPs. Both the stiffness and viscoelasticity of cells and tissues play critical roles in regulating cellular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. These mechanical properties should therefore be carefully considered when designing materials for tissue engineering applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Cells exhibit type-specific Young’s moduli ranging from around 0.1 kPa in neurons to 20 kPa and above for osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Similarly, the environment and tissues surrounding cells vary greatly from less than 0.1 kPa in mucus up to the GPa range in bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. In addition, cells and their microenvironment also display a broad range of viscoelastic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. To analyze the different designs and determine their material properties, we turned to microindentation measurements by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>. In DMA, a material is exposed to sinusoidal stress as a function of outer parameters such as frequency. Hence, DMA gives insights into the responsiveness of a given material to repeated physical change, allowing for the determination of material properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. For this, the DNA-HMPs were adhered to a glass substrate coated with positively-charged poly-l-lysine (PLL, MW = 150 kDa - 300 kDa) by electrostatic interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p id="P11">3-arm short DNA-HMPs exhibited frequency-independent storage moduli (E’) of 607Pa ± 287Pa at 20 μM nanostar concentration to 885Pa ± 88Pa at 35 μM nanostar concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). In the low frequency range (&lt;1 Hz) the loss moduli (E”) of the DNA-HMPs were substantially lower and likewise frequency-independent. A slight increase of E” was found at higher frequencies (&gt;5 Hz), but never exceeding E’. This is also reflected in the loss tangent <italic>tan</italic>(<italic>δ</italic>), which even at the highest frequency tested (20 Hz) remains &lt;0.5. These data indicate that the 3-arm short HMPs behave largely as elastic materials, displaying viscous dissipation only at high frequencies. These findings are in line with previous work on the rheological behavior of comparable macroscale bulk DNA hydrogels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>].</p><p id="P12">We next assessed the role of nanostar arm length and valency for the material properties of DNA-HMPs. We hypothesized that elongating DNA nanostar arm lengths would result in a more porous and softer network, owing to the formation of larger nanogel clusters taking up a greater volume fraction of the resulting hydrogel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. Conversely, increasing nanostar valency was expected to yield stiffer DNA-HMPs due to higher connectivity within the DNA network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>].</p><p id="P13">In agreement with these expectations, DMA revealed that the 3-arm DNA-HMPs are softer and more viscous than those formed with the 3-arm short design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). HMPs assembled from the 4-arm design displayed similar viscoelastic behavior at monomer concentrations below 35 μM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>), while those formed at 35 μM showed increased elasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results indicate that the viscoelastic properties of our DNA-HMPs can be tuned by nanoscale design. Networks with lower connectivity exhibit more viscous behavior, whereas networks with higher valency and DNA concentration are more elastic. DMA of the 6-arm flexible and 6-arm HMPs further underlined this trend.

DNA-HMP uptake by the spheroids was facilitated by addition of the short fibronectin-derived peptide sequence c[RGD] to the DNA linkers. c[RGD]-tagged DNA linkers were created using Dibenzocyclooctin (DBCO)-azide click chemistry of DBCO-tagged DNA single strands (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) and an azide-modified c[RGD] moiety.

While 3-arm HMPs are strongly deformed, 4-arm HMPs remain more spherical, but are still compressed over time. The 6-arm flexible and 6-arm HMPs retained a more spherical shape, with the stiffest design showing minimal deformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Videos S7</xref>—<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">S10</xref>). Analysis of the roundness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) and the compression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>) of individual DNA-HMPs inside the spheroids is consistent with their respective rheological properties. The softer DNA-HMPs decrease their cross-sectional area with time, indicating that an increasing compressive stress generated by fibroblasts is sufficient to compact the HMPs. By contrast, the stiffer 6-arm DNA-HMPs maintain the same cross-sectional area over the 14 h observation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). The strong decrease in size of the 4-arm HMPs compared to the 3-arm design may be explained by the difference in viscosity between the two designs. As the 3-arm HMPs are more viscous in nature, they seem to show rather complex remodeling instead of the plastic compaction observed for the 4-arm HMPs. Due to their soft nature, the 4-arm HMPs get compacted rather than sheared like the 3-arm design, which can also explain their relative roundness over time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="conclusions"><label>3</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P23">In this work, we show the formation and characterization of DNA-HMPs for 3D cell culture applications. We demonstrate that their size, stiffness, viscoelasticity and functionalization are controllable by sequence design alone; a property which is difficult to achieve to the same extent with conventional hydrogel systems. In particular, the Young’s modulus of our DNA-HMPs is finely tunable across three orders of magnitude from 30Pa to 6.5 kPa. While low-valency 3- and 4-arm DNA nanostar designs result in very soft and more viscous HMPs, higher valency 6-arm HMPs exhibit stiffer and more elastic behavior. Intriguingly, this switch is tunable by changing the DNA overhang design, as shorter overhang 3-arm structures are more elastic and stiffer than those with longer overhangs. This suggests that with changes as small as 3 nucleotides, DNA hydrogel network properties can be fundamentally altered. This property warrants further exploration and could lead to evolvable “Darwinian” materials. Finally, we show that c[RGD]-functionalized DNA-HMPs are uptaken into 3D spheroid structures. Further, depending on the material properties of the spheroid-embedded HMPs, the surrounding fibroblasts are able to interact with and deform them.</p><p id="P24">The DNA-HMPs are delivered into 3D cellular systems in a completely non-invasive manner thanks to the functionalization with cell-binding peptides, opening up the possibility for their further usage in other 3D or 2D multicellular systems.

Profiles were plotted in OriginPro 2021 - Update 6 (Origin Lab Corporation) and their peaks counted and analyzed using its Peak Analyzer tool to get the number of peaks and the gray value at each peak’s center for every recorded profile, which were then plotted over the recorded time.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (CryoSEM)</title><p id="P45">CryoSEM sample preparation was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>]. Briefly, 3 μL of a droplet emulsion was deposited onto a 0.8 mm-diameter gold specimen carrier mounted on a freeze-fracture holder (Leica Microsystems) and immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen. The cryo-embedded droplets were then transferred using an evacuated, liquid nitrogen-cooled shuttle (Leica EM VCT100, Leica Microsystems) into a freeze-fracture and etching system (Leica EM BAF060, Leica Microsystems). Fracturing was carried out in a vacuum chamber (10<sup>-6</sup> to 10<sup>-7</sup> mbar) at -160°C using a cooled knife. To enable sublimation of water from the fractured droplets, the sample stage was subsequently heated to -90°C for 45 min. After sublimation, the freeze-fractured droplets were coated with a 4nm layer of platinum/carbon (Pt–C) by electron beam evaporation. For image acquisition, the samples were transferred via the same liquid nitrogen-cooled shuttle into the imaging chamber of a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; Zeiss Ultra 55, Carl Zeiss Microscopy), equipped with in-lens, secondary electron (SE), and angle-selective back-scattered electron (ASB) detectors (Carl Zeiss SMT). Top-view imaging was performed under cryogenic conditions (stage temperature -115°C ± 5°C) with a working distance of 3 - 5mm. Due to the low conductivity of the emulsion droplets, low acceleration voltages of 1.5 – 4.0 kV were used. Signals were detected using the in-lens detector.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Sample preparation and workflow for microindentation</title><p id="P46">24 Well Glass bottom Plates (Cellvis) were treated with oxygen plasma under vacuum (0.5mbar final pressure, 200W) for 3 min using a 300 Semi-auto plasma processor (PVA TePla AG). The wells were next filled with 1 mL of a 0.5 mg/mL poly-l-lysine (MW = 150 kDa - 300 kDa, Sigma Aldrich) solution in MilliQ water, and incubated for 60 min. The wells were then washed three times using 1x PBS and 10mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution. 100 μL of DNA-HMPs in solution were added to a total volume of 1mL 1x PBS and 10mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in the wells and allowed to settle and adhere to the poly-l-lysine coated wells for 30 min before washing the wells three times using 1x PBS and 10mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution. Indentation experiments were conducted on a Pavone microindenter (Optics11Life) using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) in displacement mode. For the single particle measurements, a cantilever with a tip size of 3.5 μm and a spring constant of 0.019 N/m was used. DMA was conducted at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 Hz frequency applying an indentation amplitude of 100nm, 2 s relaxation time between frequencies and an initial relaxation time of 10 s. For each sample, measurements on five separate DNA-HMPs were undertaken. Each condition was measured as triplicates. Calculation of the Young’s moduli was based on Hertz-model fits of the indentation curve fitted to an indentation depth equal to 16% of the cantilever-tip diameter (560nm). Further, each sample was indented no further than 5% of the sample diameter, to exclude any measurement artifacts based on the underlying substrate. The data is presented as the mean ± the standard deviation of the resulting values for the Young’s modulus. Storage, loss moduli and tan(<italic>δ</italic>) of the different types of DNA-HMPs are presented as single data points. Data analysis was conducted using the analysis software DataViewer (V2.5.0, Optics11Life), while plotting of the data as well as the statistical analysis were managed using OriginPro 2021 - Update 6 (Origin Lab Corporation).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Measurement of hydrodynamic drag forces during microindentation</title><p id="P47">Oscillating cantilevers in viscous medium experience a force even in the absence of physical contact with a surface due to hydrodynamic drag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. This drag depends on the viscosity and density of the medium, the size of the cantilever, and the frequency of oscillation. Thus, it needs to be determined for any given set of experimental parameters, as it can otherwise be mistakenly attributed to the properties of the material being tested during DMA. We thus measured the hydrodynamic drag force experienced by the utilized cantilever to estimate its influence on DMA measurements and corrected the data accordingly. For this, the cantilever tip was placed 500nm above a DNA-HMP and the DMA sweep from 0.1 - 20 Hz performed there to estimate the viscous drag. This measurement was repeated five times to yield an average drag force measurement.

Images were acquired using a high-speed CMOS-camera (MC1362, Microtron).</p><p id="P49">Right before each measurement, DNA-HMPs in suspension (100 μL per run) were pelleted for 1 min using a C1008-GE myFUGE mini centrifuge (Benchmark Scientific). 80 μL of supernatant were discarded and the pellet resuspended in 150 μL CellCarrierB (Zellmechanik Dresden). The resuspended DNA-HMPs were then aspirated into a 1mL glass syringe with PEEK tubing connector and PTFE plunger (SETonic) mounted on a syringe pump system (NemeSys, Cetoni). The DNA-HMP-CellCarrierB solution was then applied to a Flic20 microfluidic chip (Zellmechanik Dresden) using PTFE-tubing (S1810-12, Bola). Through a second 1mL glass syringe, CellCarrierB was applied to the Flic20 microfluidic chip as sheath flow for the RT-DC experiment. For all samples, two sequential measurements using 0.04 μL/s and 0.08 μL/s total flow rates (ratio of sheath to sample flow: 3:1) were performed for a duration of at least 900 s each. The measurement software ShapeIn (version 2.2.2.4, Zellmechanik Dresden) was used to detect DNA-HMPs in real time. The pixel-size was adjusted to 0.68 μm/px, fitting the utilized 20x/0.4 Ph2 objective and all DNA-HMPs imaged at the rear part of the flow channel ensuring regular deformation of each particle. For each condition triplicates were measured. The analysis software Shape-Out (version 2.10.0, Zellmechanik Dresden) was then used to analyze the behavior of the DNA-HMPs in the flow channel. All samples were equally gated for porosity (1.0 - 1.15) and DNA-HMP size (40 μm<sup>2</sup> - 180 μm<sup>2</sup>). Statistical significance was analyzed using a linear mixed model (R-lme4) as integrated in Shape-Out (version 2.10.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>]) yielding ANOVA p-values. Calculation of the Young’s modulus, deformation and volume as well as preparation of the data for contour plots were all carried out using Shape-Out (version 2.10.0). Population mean values of the measured samples are presented with their standard error of the mean.

Likewise, the frame rate of the CMOS-camera (MC1362, Microtron) was set to the maximum of 7000 f/s to allow for the imaging of individual particles as they undergo deformation. Sample preparation and data analysis was conducted in the same way as for the other RT-DC experiments. Plots and data fits were created using OriginPro 2021 - Update 6 (Origin Lab Corporation). To fit the deformation data of the DNA-HMPs during dRT-DC measurements, the speed of the particles inside of the flow channel was calculated. For this, the volume of the whole channel as 20 μm ⋆ 20 μm ⋆ 300 μm = 120 000 μm<sup>3</sup> was taken into account. The volume of the channel divided by the flow rate of 0.04 μL/s as 40 000 000 μm<sup>3</sup>/s resulted in a channel traversing time of 3 ms for the DNA-HMPs. Given the channel length of 300 μm, the speed of the DNA-HMPs was calculated as 100 μm/ms and the data plotted accordingly. The relaxation (characteristic response) time τ as well as its standard error of the different DNA-HMP populations were then extracted from exponential fits of the resulting deformation curves using OriginPro 2021 - Update 6 (Origin Lab Corporation).</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Formation of c[RGD]-tagged DNA linker strands</title><p id="P51">The small peptide cyclo[Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys(Azide)] (c[RGD], Hölzel Diagnostika Handels GmbH) was diluted in a 1x PBS (no CaCl<sub>2</sub>, no MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH = 7.4; Gibco) solution to yield a concentration of 2.4mM.

Two DNA nanostars (A and B) with non-complementary overhangs are encapsulated with a DNA linker using a double-inlet microfluidic device. Upon encapsulation, DNA hydrogel formation is initiated. After full gelation, DNA-HMPs are released from their droplet shell into an aqueous solution.

DNA-HMPs are initially spherical and deform upon entering the channel. Within milliseconds, they reach a steady-state deformation. After leaving the channel, they return to their spherical shape. Scale bar: 20 μm. B) Deformation scatter plots of 35 μM 3-arm short, 6-arm flexible and 6-arm HMPs plotted over the channel length during dRT-DC. Each point corresponds to an individual DNA-HMP (n = 13000). Insets 1 - 4 show DNA-HMPs at the corresponding positions during dRT-DC depicted in the scatter plots. The relaxation time t<sub>rel</sub> of the DNA-HMPs was extracted from the exponential fit of the relaxation scatter plot (red curve).

C) Exemplary contour plots showing DNA-HMP deformation over the particle volume for different DNA nanostar concentrations for the 3-arm short, 6-arm flexible and 6-arm designs. The data is presented using contour plots showing the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile (dashed line) and 95<sup>th</sup> percentile (solid line). Isoelasticity lines derived from numerical simulations are shown additionally, indicating stiffness changes where a steeper slope corresponds to softer particles.
