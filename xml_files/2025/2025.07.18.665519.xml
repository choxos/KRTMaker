They have highlighted the enormous undescribed diversity of microbial species and provided valuable insights into microbial ecosystems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The scale and breadth of sampled environments is increasingly advancing our understanding of microbial dispersal, niches and biogeography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, characterizing individual roles of microbial species within their communities and across geographic boundaries remains challenging.</p><p id="P7">The gold standard for characterizing microbial species requires isolation as pure cultures, followed by metabolic and physiological characterization. This often impractical and time-consuming approach is increasingly complemented by culture-independent methods that assemble microbial genomes directly from environmental sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. While these metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) enable first functional insights into uncultured microbes, their predictions do not always translate directly into phenotypes or ecological roles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Furthermore, despite recent efforts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, the number of microbial species that have been cultured, phenotyped or (meta)genome-sequenced at sufficient quality is still orders of magnitude lower than the estimated total species richness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Marker gene sequencing offers an orthogonal approach to study microbes directly in their native community context. It systematically maps microbial species across environments, providing culture-independent insights into their abundance patterns, environmental conditions, and co-occurring taxa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. A cornerstone of this approach is the 16S small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (16S SSU rRNA), the most universally used molecular marker for microbial lineage identification. Large reference collections now aggregate millions of these sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, facilitating cross-study integration and revealing extensive microbial diversity. Despite limitations in quantifying lineage abundances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, SSU rRNA sequencing remains a cost-effective tool for microbiome analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. While phylogenetic resolution is constrained by sequence length and quality, advances in long-read technologies, such as circular-consensus and nanopore sequencing, are increasingly enabling species- and potentially even strain-level resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Previous marker gene studies, while restricted in scope, have proven instrumental in the characterization of the ecological preferences of microbial taxa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, the rare biosphere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, the identification of host-associated microbial taxa characteristic of health and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, and the identification of statistical signals indicative of biotic interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. However, many essential phenomena, including planetary biochemical cycling, global pathogen dispersal, and climate change, operate across environmental boundaries and thus require a global perspective.</p><p id="P10">Tracking microbes across multiple environments and studies remains challenging, as most existing large-scale datasets are confined to specific environments or hosts, and methods to systematically link these collections are lacking. The largest cross-environmental study to date, the Earth Microbiome Project, analyzed over 27,000 microbial community samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, yet it captures only a small fraction of publicly available datasets and remains largely unintegrated with other studies.</p><p id="P11">Millions of environmental and clinical microbiome samples are hosted by repositories like the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>) and the EBI European Nucleotide Archive (ENA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>), yet much of this raw data is not readily available for cross-study analyses. To help mitigate this issue, several databases and web resources have recently emerged to facilitate access to public microbiome data, typically focusing on single sequencing technologies. Some platforms analyze mainly metagenomic samples, providing high-resolution community profiles (SPIRE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, Sandpiper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>), sometimes combined with functional insights from MAG assembly and gene- or protein-level characterizations (SPIRE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, MGnify<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>). A few specialize in specific environments, like the oceans (OMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>). However, due to the high cost of generating and analyzing metagenomic data, processed microbial communities remain limited to between tens of thousands and several hundred thousand per platform. Other resources (Qiita<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, MGnify, IMNGS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>) process subsets of the more abundant 16S amplicon data (up to half a million samples), but commonly applied <italic>de novo</italic> clustering or denoising techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> can lead to incompatibilities between studies analyzing different hypervariable regions of the 16S gene, hindering cross-study analyses within platforms. In addition, most resources focus on named taxa or fixed operational taxonomic units (OTUs), limiting the exploration of undescribed diversity at different taxonomic scales.</p><p id="P12">Here, we present MicrobeAtlas, an integrated resource of 2,390,937 analyzed microbial communities from all around the globe. We compared these microbiome samples against a reference database with over 1.5 million full-length 16S and 18S SSU rRNA sequences, pre-clustered hierarchically into hundreds of thousands of OTUs at selectable granularity. Mapping to a common, full-length reference enables OTUs and communities to be tracked across sequencing strategies (metagenomic, amplicon) and protocols (e.g., amplified 16S region) throughout the entire resource. Extracted metadata keywords and two-level environmental ontology assignments are available for each sample, complemented with carefully extracted geographic coordinates and spatial connections to terrestrial ecosystem definitions by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>). Communities are hierarchically grouped into community clusters, providing a bird’s-eye view on global community patterns and potential niche distributions. Analyzing a robust subset of more than one million MicrobeAtlas samples reveals intriguing patterns: communities are broadly structured by environment, but also according to diverse, informative keywords related to specific conditions and hosts. Soil and aquatic microbiomes emerge as global richness hotspots with many poorly characterized members, contrasting most animal microbiomes. Individual OTUs can be reliably traced across the globe, revealing detailed habitat generalism and specialism trends, as well as geographic preferences. This includes the uncharted majority of OTUs without cultured representatives, sequenced genomes, or robust taxonomic assignments, revealing first glimpses of their ecology. Finally, we identified blind spots in current sampling efforts that point to geographic regions, ecological lifestyles, and specialized biomes that require more concerted attention by the community.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The MicrobeAtlas dataset</title><p id="P13">We comprehensively screened the NCBI SRA database for microbial community sequencing samples and downloaded raw reads and metadata for 2,390,937 samples (52,950 studies). Utilizing a sequencing strategy-agnostic workflow, we quality-checked and mapped 6.87 trillion raw reads against a custom database of 1,536,850 full-length 16S/18S marker gene sequences. After removing samples with low community complexity, coverage, and sequencing depth (Methods), we obtained a dataset of 1,153,349 consistent, comparable community abundance profiles (24,349 studies) used for analyses in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P14">How different community members are defined and distinguished can profoundly impact ecological analyses. In order to enable flexible definitions, we therefore clustered our reference sequences into hierarchical OTUs with 90% to 99% sequence identity (33,361 to 241,196 OTUs, default: 97%-OTUs) and profiled the communities of all samples at each OTU level. In order to reduce redundancy and facilitate niche-focused analyses, we additionally hierarchically clustered community profiles into 356,182 microbial community clusters, each potentially representing an ecological niche with distinctive microbial composition.</p><p id="P15">A key component of MicrobeAtlas is its rich metadata. For this purpose, we extracted information on environments, geo-locations, and informative keywords from raw metadata to provide detailed biological and technological context for each community. We categorized samples into a simple, two-tiered environmental ontology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and, where possible, additionally linked terrestrial samples geographically to the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology, providing more precise ecosystem definitions based on macro-ecological characteristics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">3</xref>). The resulting dataset spans four main environments (animal, aquatic, soil, plant) and 65 sub-environments, covering a plethora of habitats, hosts, and conditions from all continents. In addition, we linked MicrobeAtlas OTUs to culture collections (BacDive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>) and genome clusters (proGenomes3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>), connecting ecological distributions with phenotypic and genetic information. To our knowledge, MicrobeAtlas houses the largest and most diverse collection of cross-study comparable microbial community profiles available to date.</p><p id="P16">To enable intuitive exploration of this dataset, we created a feature-rich website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microbeatlas.org">www.microbeatlas.org</ext-link>) that allows the tracking, comparison, and download of studies, samples, and individual taxa from around the globe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). OTUs can be searched based on taxonomic or metadata matches and can be visualized on a global map, together with their abundance distributions across environments. Similarly, samples and projects can be identified using rich metadata search and explored in terms of community composition, keywords, and technical information, across flexible OTU definitions.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>A map of global microbiome structure</title><p id="P17">We projected 26,487 robust community clusters (with at least 5 samples per cluster) to obtain a global view of planetary microbial diversity across environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). While a few large projects individually contribute large numbers of samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), smaller studies collectively accounted for the vast majority of community clusters (92.6%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), a proxy for the breadth of the captured community compositions. We found that samples from selected major consortium studies typically had close matches within smaller studies, but in contrast samples from smaller studies were more distant from major studies (min. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity: 0.31 vs. 0.67; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), further emphasizing the additional variation contributed by smaller studies. Community clusters were mainly animal-associated (63.5%, human 23.0%), followed by aquatic (19.3%, marine 4.3%), soil (14.3%, agricultural 2.8%), and plant (2.9%, rhizosphere 0.6%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The number of community clusters did not saturate with increasing sample size, suggesting a large fraction of thus-far undiscovered community clusters remains in each main environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In contrast, OTU richness rarefaction curves were closer to saturation, indicating that the majority of reference OTUs has been detected within their respective environments (with the notable exception of plant communities, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Notably, this saturation is constrained to our reference database and therefore conservative (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The projection revealed distinct, biologically informative patterns: clusters grouped by main and sub-environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, top; PERMANOVA (unifrac-w): R<sup>2</sup> = 14.7% (main), R<sup>2</sup> = 10.6% (sub), p = 0.001 for both), with environmental (aquatic, soil) and plant clusters typically separated from animal-associated clusters. Most freshwater samples are located between marine and soil clusters (supported by diverse dissimilarity metrics, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>), indicating potential microbial exchange between soil and freshwater environments, in line with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Similarly, environmental samples are closer to surface body sites (skin, oral, nasal/airways, vagina) than to gut communities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>), likely reflecting higher prevalence of environmental microbes on more accessible body sites.</p><p id="P19">Among larger projection clusters, we observed detailed patterns, where neighboring yet distinct sub-clusters differ in both microbial composition and metadata annotation in biologically interpretable ways. Using keyword analysis, we characterized a freshwater projection cluster in more detail and distinguished it from two marine clusters, one related to benthic and sediment communities, and the other dominated by planktonic and host-associated communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, bottom). These clusters also differ in community composition at the class level, with marine clusters being more similar to each other than to the freshwater cluster (class level Bray-Curtis: 0.25 vs. 0.42). In addition, we found examples of highly localized keywords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>) distinguishing projection regions enriched for certain soil types (tundra, farm soil), hosts (horse, bird), or conditions (high-fat diet). A more targeted extraction of host information via host-specific fields and taxonomic IDs recovered 2682 host species, the most frequent ones often localized in specific regions of the projection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Mouse was the second most frequent host (after human, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>) and, notably, mouse gut communities formed a separate cluster in our projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Closer examination of semantic keyword groups (Methods) revealed enrichment of categories related to (experimental) perturbation and laboratory conditions in this cluster, including terms such as “antibiotics”, “disruption”, “heat-killed”, “dose-dependent”, “stress” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). In contrast, the core human gut cluster was closer to non-mouse hosts in the projection and featured more observational keyword groups related to subject traits or diseases, such as “female”, “twin”, “infant”, “malnutrition”, “ulcer” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p id="P20">In line with previous studies, we found that environments differ strongly in diversity. Estimated mean OTU richness per community cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>) was particularly high in environmental (soil, freshwater, marine; mean 715-1257 OTUs), waste water (1142 OTUs), and ruminant animal samples (988 OTUs), independent of sequencing technology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). In contrast, we found lower richness in other animals (mean 490 OTUs; in particular insects with 281 OTUs) and surface plant organs (539 OTUs). Counting observed OTUs after rarefaction led to the same qualitative conclusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). In terms of taxonomic coverage, human samples had high fractions of reads classified at least to genus level (mean 78.4%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>), while environmental communities had strongly reduced fractions (down to mean 35%), indicating notable under-characterization of these high-richness habitats. This was particularly apparent for soils, sediments, and marine samples (37.2%, 35.9%), but also freshwater (45.7%), and, intriguingly, mouse communities (42.7%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). In general, classification fraction and richness were negatively correlated across community clusters (ρ = -0.36, p &lt; 1 × 10<sup>-100</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Finally, we also identified technology-associated effects. A minor region of the projection, comprising community clusters from diverse environments, was strongly enriched for Eukaryotes (mean Eukaryotic fraction: 88.5%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>), particularly Fungi (29.3%) and Metazoa (17.5%). Samples in a manually inspected subset were typically generated using Eukaryote-specific 18S primers or, in some cases, by amplifying 16S genes from Eukaryotic organelles, particularly mitochondria and chloroplasts. Beyond Eukaryote-specific patterns, we also observed signs of localized clustering among metagenomic samples (i.e. generated using whole-genome shotgun protocols, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 14a</xref>) compared to amplicon samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 14b</xref>). However, these effects were small compared to the main environment signals described above (PERMANOVA (unifrac-w): R<sup>2</sup> = 0.6%, p = 0.001).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ecological insights into the uncharacterized microbial majority</title><p id="P22">BacDive and proGenomes3 are two of the most comprehensive collections for culture strain and genome information, respectively. We mapped these databases to MicrobeAtlas OTUs and found that most available strains (92.6%) and genomes (97.3%) were covered. In contrast, the vast majority of OTUs in MicrobeAtlas (n=99,241, 88.7%) lacked cultured isolates, genomes, and detailed taxonomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-c</xref>), making them potential representatives of “microbial dark matter”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. As expected, OTUs without any culture strain or genome information (ncg-OTUs) tended to be less taxonomically classified: only 21.6% had confident consensus assignments at the genus level (class: 83.0%), whereas OTUs with culture strain or genome annotations (cg-OTUs) reached 65.4% (class: 93.0%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Notably, 14,985 ncg-OTUs were classified only at the phylum level or higher, outnumbering all cg-OTUs combined (12,543). Among them, 4,988 ncg-OTUs (5%) lacked any consensus phylum annotation and may potentially represent uncharacterized phyla. In addition, the vast majority of described (candidate) phyla were dominated by ncg-OTUs, while only around half of the described genera showed this trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p><p id="P23">MicrobeAtlas allowed us to globally track both taxonomically characterized and uncharacterized OTUs to gain insights into their ecology. We observed a notable number of ncg-OTUs among the most abundant microbes across environments (17 out of the top 150), despite cg-OTUs being on average 16 times more abundant than ncg-OTUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Top ncg-OTUs included many Bacteroidales OTUs (e.g., Muribaculaceae, <italic>Bacteroides</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>), but also an archaeal OTU classified as <italic>Candidatus</italic> Nitrosocosmicus, detected in 82,660 samples (4,232 studies) across all continents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>) and most prevalent in soil (56%). Notably, several OTUs without phylum annotations also reached high abundances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, up to the 97th percentile), for instance OTU 97_17665 with 16,222 samples (2,736 studies), most abundant in drinking water-associated communities and biofilms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 16</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Out of 99 bacterial and archaeal phyla, 43 featured exclusively phylum-level OTUs, and only a minority of phyla were on average classified at the family or genus level (26 and 2 phyla, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 17c</xref>). In general, we found classification level, phylum diversity (number of distinct 97% OTUs per phylum) and global abundance to be significantly correlated: well-classified phyla tended to be OTU-rich and abundant (ρ = 0.33, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, and ρ = 0.67, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−10</sup>, respectively).

This trend was strongest for domain-level OTUs, the least characterized group, in aquatic environments: 65.8% of domain-level reads mapped to aquatic communities (up from 14.3% for genus-level OTUs), most frequently to the sub-environments marine, sediment, and waste water (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 18</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Each OTU in MicrobeAtlas is part of a nested hierarchy generated by agglomerative clustering of 16S sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

We observed most latitudinal trends in aquatic samples (54% of significant correlations), followed by animal (31%) and soil (14%), and very little in plants (2%, possibly due to undersampling). Notably, soil samples harbored both equatorial- and polar-associated microbes (63% equatorial), in contrast to all other environments (86% - 99% equatorial correlations). In line with high equatorial associations in aquatic OTUs (97%), marine OTU richness also peaked near the equator (max. richness bin: 0°N to 20°N, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>), consistent with latitudinal species diversity gradients observed for many multicellular organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> and matching previous reports on marine microbes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.

To investigate global habitat generalism trends, we devised a score that globally quantifies habitat generalism tendency based on per-environment abundances at a coarse-grained level. Under this entropy-based metric (Methods), OTUs with even abundance distributions across major environments (aquatic, soil, plant, animal) score closer to one (i.e. are more generalist), while species with uneven distributions, i.e. with abundance peaks at one or few environments, score closer to zero (are more specialist) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>).</p><p id="P32">On this level of environmental granularity, we found that OTUs show a clear tendency towards habitat specialism (39.6% of OTUs have scores in the bottom quarter of the range, but only 10.3% lie in the top quarter; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>, top histogram), mostly thriving in aquatic and, to a lesser extent, animal habitats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>, bottom stacked bar charts). In contrast, OTUs abundant in soil and plant-associated environments appeared more generalist, i.e. were more likely to also be abundant in animal and aquatic environments. This pattern remained when adjusting for potential assignment ambiguities between plant rhizosphere and soil (recomputing generalism scores without the “plant” category, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 24</xref>). Similarly, soil and plant communities on average harbored significantly more generalist species than aquatic or animal communities (mean log ratio 1.58 vs. 0.30, p &lt; 10<sup>-99</sup>, Mann-Whitney U test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>), again robust to potential soil/rhizosphere ambiguities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 25</xref>).

However, within community clusters (proxies for occupied niches), highly generalist and specialist OTUs (top and bottom 10%) both had similar mean abundances (4.8 × 10<sup>-5</sup> vs. 9.2 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) and prevalences (0.546 vs. 0.549) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d, e</xref>), indicating comparable colonization success within these realized niches. Notably, specialist OTUs exhibited greater variation in both metrics: some specialists dominated their niches more than comparable generalists, while other specialists showed the opposite pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d, e</xref>). In addition, we found clear signals of culturing biases: generalists were significantly more likely to have cultured representatives than specialists (odds ratio = 6.85, p &lt; 10<sup>-99</sup>, Chi-squared test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d, e</xref>) and, in addition, more abundant and prevalent species were also significantly more likely to have been cultured (AUC = 0.72 and 0.66, p &lt; 10<sup>-99</sup> both, Mann-Whitney U test).</p><p id="P34">In terms of taxonomy, we observed notable family-level shifts across the generalism gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>).

In contrast, high-scoring generalists include families known for their adaptability and dispersal potential, most notably Pseudomonadaceae and Bacillaceae. Despite these trends, each investigated family harbored OTUs from both sides of the generalism spectrum and some families showed a remarkably balanced distribution of generalists and specialists (e.g., Oscillospiraceae, Flavobacteriaceae).</p><p id="P35">Generalists may differ from specialists in terms of genomic characteristics (e.g., genome size, number of genes), potentially providing increased flexibility in the face of varying environmental pressures. Indeed, when we investigated the average number of genes per genome within each OTU (available for 7427 97% OTUs, based on our 16S-based mapping to proGenomes3), we found that gene counts increased consistently with higher generalism scores. Counts peaked for OTUs with generalism scores between 0.6 and 0.7, averaging 3935.6 genes (mean), a significant 36.4% increase compared to OTUs with generalism scores between 0.0 and 0.1 (p = 10<sup>-46</sup>, Mann-Whitney U test).

Intuitively, keywords that are more closely related within the set of possible keywords should cluster together more often on average, decreasing semantic distance.</p><p id="P52">Based on these semantic distances, umap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup> (v0.5.7) and sklearn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup> (v1.5.2) K-means clustering were used to reduce and identify clusters of semantically related keywords. For each cluster, the average odds ratio, defined as average fold change of prevalence in mouse compared to human samples, was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Geographic mapping and IUCN annotation</title><p id="P53">Sampling coordinates (latitude and longitude) were parsed directly from dedicated SRA annotation fields; a total of 31 distinct field headers were encountered that either matched ‘longit*’ or ‘latitud*’ separately, or a combination of ‘lat*’ and ‘lon*’. For the coordinates themselves, a variety of different formatting choices were observed, such as decimal vs. degree notations, various levels of precision, different syntaxes, and different ways of distinguishing North/South and East/West. The coordinates were thus parsed using distinct regular expressions in custom Python code; in an iterative procedure, coordinate records that initially failed to parse were inspected manually and corresponding regular expressions for special cases were added (a total of 11 regular expressions were eventually needed).</p><p id="P54">In a subsequent step, the resulting sample placements were inspected visually on a zoomable world-map; large sample collections with improbable coordinates stood out and were followed up manually. Obvious errors were corrected if possible; these included accidental lat/lon reversals in the original metadata, as well as series of samples that differed systematically by one numerical unit from each other, creating vertical or horizontal lines of samples on the map (these possibly originate from MS Excel manipulation errors).</p><p id="P55">For IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology assignments, the filtered MicrobeAtlas dataset was further screened for samples assigned as “soil” and with available coordinates, yielding 98,642 samples. Indicative geographic maps for terrestrial Ecosystem Functional Groups (EFGs) were obtained from the IUCN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://global-ecosystems.org/">https://global-ecosystems.org/</ext-link>). Maps with lower spatial resolution (T2.5 “Temperate pyric humid forests” and T1.3 “Montane tropical forests”) were improved by integrating more recent maps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup> for EFG-specific criteria applied by the IUCN, yielding resolutions of 30S per pixel. Samples were only assigned to an EFG if i) their coordinates matched an area of “major occurrences” (covering &gt;=25% surface area) of that EFG, and ii) no other EFGs had a “major occurrence” in that area. Similarly, terrestrial IUCN Biomes were assigned if a sample’s coordinates overlapped with “major occurrence” EFGs from only a single biome.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Cultured isolate and genome mapping</title><p id="P56">Two external databases were crosslinked to MicrobeAtlas: proGenomes3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> (accessed: September 2022), containing almost one million bacterial genomes, and BacDive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> (accessed: November 2022), containing genomes of bacterial strains in culture. To estimate how much of the diversity contained within MicrobeAtlas is covered by these two resources, 16S rRNA genes were extracted from the genomes of both proGenomes3 and BacDive. When multiple 16S rRNA genes were found in proGenomes3, the longest sequence was selected (with a minimum length of 600 bp). Out of 907,388 genomes in proGenomes3, 753,909 representative 16S rRNA sequences were extracted using Barrnap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. These were then mapped together with 16S sequences from BacDive (based on annotations within NCBI GenBank and RefSeq) to the 97%-identity set of MicrobeAtlas OTUs. Mapping was performed with MAPseq against the MAPref 3.0 reference set, keeping only best hits with a minimum identity of 97%. Following this procedure, 732,912 of the 753,604 (97.3%) 16S rRNA sequences identified in proGenomes3 confidently mapped to 11,084 MicrobeAtlas 97%-OTUs. In BacDive, 26,269 of the 28,227 (92.6%) sequences were confidently mapped to 6,722 MicrobeAtlas 97%-OTUs.</p><p id="P57">The extracted 16S sequences from proGenomes3 underwent further analysis to establish links between specI clusters and MicrobeAtlas OTUs. The linking was performed at the 98% OTU level (approximately species level), which in our tests optimized the overlap between specI clusters and MicrobeAtlas OTUs. A majority-rule approach was implemented, where a connection was only established when a minimum of 80% of the 16S sequences (mapped with at least a 40% confidence score) within one specI cluster corresponded to the same 98% MicrobeAtlas OTU. This process resulted in 19,902 specI clusters reliably mapped to 9,511 MicrobeAtlas 98%-OTUs.</p><p id="P58">To ensure a finer sequence resolution and to better reflect the strain level differences contained in BacDive, 99%-OTUs were used for the MicrobeAtlas-BacDive links reported on the website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://microbeatlas.org">https://microbeatlas.org</ext-link>). Only unambiguous mappings with at least a 40% confidence score were kept, resulting in 15,656 BacDive strains linked to 9,434 MicrobeAtlas OTUs at the 99% OTU level.</p><p id="P59">For genome size analyses, MAPref 3.0 OTUs were mapped back to MAPref 2.2b OTUs to ensure compatibility with other analyses in this study. To achieve this, OTUs with high sequence overlap between the two references were linked, resulting in 7427 MAPref 2.2b OTUs with at least one mapped non-MAG genome and associated generalism scores. For each genome, genes were called and counted by running Prodigal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup> (v2.6.3) with the following parameters: translation table 11 (-g 11), closed ends (-c), treat runs of N as masked sequence (-m), single procedure (-p single).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Diversity estimation and latitudinal analyses</title><p id="P60">Total community richness was extrapolated using formula 7 in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup> (based on an improved version of the Good-Turing frequency estimator). For additional consistency checks, sample richness was also estimated by counting observed OTUs in samples rarefied to 1000 SSU reads. Beta diversity between samples and community clusters was computed as Bray-Curtis distance on relative abundances, using the Distances.jl package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup> (v0.10). Weighted and unweighted unifrac dissimilarities were computed using Strided State Unifrac<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup> from the biocore.unifrac package (v1.3). For community clusters, beta diversity between two clusters A and B was defined as the average pairwise Bray-Curtis or unifrac dissimilarity between all samples in A and all samples in B. For unifrac, each community cluster was reduced to three randomly chosen samples to improve computational tractability. The phylogenetic tree used for unifrac was computed by aligning all 16S reference sequences with Infernal (for details, see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>), followed by maximum-likelihood tree inference using FastTree<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup> v2.1.10 (parameters: “-nt -gtr -gamma”).</p><p id="P61">For the latitudinal diversity analysis of marine communities, only samples with sub-environment “marine”, “ocean”, or “sea” were considered (50,480 samples). The “Global oceans and seas” shapefile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref></sup> (version 1) was used to remove samples not located in oceans, resulting in a final set of 43,156 samples. For latitudinal diversity analysis of terrestrial samples, diversity curves were computed per IUCN biome in order to not mix vastly different ecosystems (e.g., agricultural soils and deserts) within one analysis. Only biomes covering at least 3 of 10 latitudinal bins with a minimum of 100 samples per bin were included. These criteria were only matched by "Deserts and semi-deserts" (600 samples, 3 bins), "Temperate-boreal forests and woodlands" (2,464 samples, 4 bins), and "Intensive land use" (42,133 samples, 7 bins).</p><p id="P62">To compute latitudinal abundance associations, latitudes were discretized into 50 evenly sized bins and 97% OTUs present in at least 25 bins and with minimum global prevalence of 250 were considered. For each OTU, relative abundances per bin were averaged and log10-transformed, followed by computing Pearson’s ρ between log-transformed averages and per-bin latitudes. OTUs were assigned to a main environment based on their maximum average abundance within the four major environments: animal, aquatic, soil, and plant.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Habitat generalism</title><p id="P63">To obtain habitat generalism scores for all OTUs, average relative abundances in each main environment (animal, aquatic, soil, plant) were computed. While computing abundances independently per environment reduces the impact of sampling bias, the choice of relative abundance instead of prevalence reduces the effect of contaminants, which are expected to disperse widely, but to only reach low abundances in non-native samples. These per-OTU environmental abundance profiles were then converted into proportions to make profiles of abundant and rare OTUs comparable. Finally, Shannon entropy scores were computed for each normalized profile, resulting in a measure that peaks if an OTU is found in all major environments with equal abundance (highly generalist) and becomes zero when an OTU is only found in one major environment (highly specialist). OTUs that peak in a few environments but show low or zero abundance in others yield intermediate scores. Scores were further normalized to lie between 0.0 and 1.0 through division by the theoretical maximum entropy (obtained for a perfectly even distribution across the four major environments). Per-OTU main environment assignments followed the same approach as described in the latitudinal analyses section.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Statistics, normalization, and visualization</title><p id="P64">UMAP projections were computed based on the Bray-Curtis distances used for community clustering (see above), utilizing the umap package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup> (v0.5) in julia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup> v1.9 via PyCall.jl<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref></sup>.
