detail beyond those accessible with short-read methods. Although insightful, these approaches have typically been costly and yielded limited data for each individual cell. Recent advances in library preparation approaches and sequencing throughput have brought long-read single-cell studies closer to the mainstream.</p><p id="P2">Here, we present a comparative analysis of commercial approaches for single-cell long-read sequencing. We have performed parallel analyses of the same cDNA material, generated using the 10X genomics platform, on Illumina short-read, and PacBio and Oxford Nanopore long-read platforms. We also demonstrate the impact of CRISPR-based depletion of libraries, to remove highly expressed transcripts, prior to long-read sequencing in these experiments.</p><p id="P3">By analysing single-source cDNA libraries in parallel, we enable a direct comparison of each platform, evaluating standard metrics alongside concordance in clustering and cell type identification. While each approach generates usable gene and isoform expression data, we identify limitations common across platforms, primarily linked to cDNA synthesis inefficiencies and read filtering strategies. Our work demonstrates the increasing utility of single-cell long-read sequencing for isoform-resolved analyses, such as direct immunoglobulin chain reconstruction without additional amplification, and the detection of alternative splicing patterns across immune cell subtypes in CD45, a key gene for immune cell activation and differentiation. Our benchmarking of current platform options provides a foundation for researchers looking to adopt single-cell long-read sequencing into their transcriptomic studies, providing a framework for its integration into diverse biological questions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) has transformed the study of multicellular systems by enabling transcriptomic profiling at cellular resolution. Recent advances in scRNAseq technologies have facilitated the parallel analysis of millions of cells, supporting the generation of comprehensive cell atlases at the organ and whole-organism scale <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">As these technologies have advanced, there has been a near-universal focus on 3’ or 5’ transcript end counting to overcome the technical and economic constraints of high throughput single-cell measurements. Although this approach has been transformative, it inherently restricts the resolution of complex and biologically meaningful transcriptomic events - such as alternative splicing, gene fusions and single-nucleotide variants - across the full-length of the transcript.</p><p id="P6">Several studies have now demonstrated the value of long-read sequencing technologies, particularly Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and PacBio, in recovering full-length transcript sequences from both bulk <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and single-cell datasets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. These approaches enhance the detection of novel transcripts, landscapes of transcription, alternative splicing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and regulatory networks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Increased scale of sequencing and improvement in read quality have made long-read sequencing of scRNAseq libraries a more realistic opportunity. In addition, concatemerization of cDNA molecules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, and improvements with ordered concatemerization, termed MASseq <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> (now commercially supplied by PacBio as Kinnex), offer a novel approach to improve the output of the PacBio approach by as much 16-fold. Further modifications to library generation such as CRISPR-based depletion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, allow more targeted sequencing, by eliminating highly expressed transcripts prior to sequencing, reducing consumption of sequencing capacity on uninformative reads.</p><p id="P8">Although these developments have expanded the practical utility of long-read scRNA-seq, many benchmarking studies predate these recent technical innovations. Here, we present a comparative analysis of long-read single-cell RNA-seq protocols on PacBio and ONT platforms, incorporating MAS-seq and targeted CRISPR-based depletion to remove highly expressed transcripts prior to sequencing. We assess these approaches in terms of read yield and informational content, as well as their utility for cell-type classification and isoform-level resolution within immune cell populations. Together, these analyses demonstrate the potential of long-read scRNA-seq to uncover isoform-level features in immune cells, providing a foundation for studying cell-state transitions and immune function with greater resolution.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Biases in cDNA synthesis limit full-length transcript recovery in long-read scRNA-seq</title><p id="P9">We generated cDNA libraries using the 10X Genomics 3’ v3.1 platform and used the same cDNA pool as input into five different library preparation and sequencing approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our aim was to systematically compare how different sequencing platforms and library construction strategies, following manufacturer recommendations, enable isoform-level transcript resolution in single cells. Specifically, we evaluated long-read sequencing using the ONT PromethION (SQK-PCS111 kit) and the PacBio Revio and Sequel IIe platforms with the MAS-seq (now Kinnex) kit, alongside conventional short-read sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000.</p><p id="P10">The cDNA generated exhibited a typical length distribution for a 10X Genomics experiment. When visualised using fluorescence measurements on the y-axis (as is conventionally presented), the size distribution appeared to range from ~500 bps to 2–3 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, it is important to note that fluorescence-based detection may overestimate the apparent length of the library, as shorter fragments incorporate less dye and therefore produce lower signal intensities. When molarity is instead plotted on the y-axis, it becomes clear that molecules longer than 1 kb are present at low abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). This pattern is reflected in the raw read length distributions across all sequencing platforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). ONT produced the longest reads, with a mean read length of 878 bp, while PacBio platforms showed slightly shorter read lengths, with Revio ranging from 785–839 bp and Sequel IIe from 782–842 bp.These findings highlight a key limitation of standard 10X Genomics cDNA, where the apparent length distribution overestimates molecule size, and most molecules are actually &lt;800 bp, limiting full-length transcript recovery in long-read sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Stratified gene body analysis reveals transcript length-dependent coverage across platforms</title><p id="P11">To evaluate gene body coverage across platforms, we categorised transcripts into defined length intervals rather than computing a global coverage distribution. This approach accounts for variability in transcript length and minimises biases that would otherwise distort coverage profiles. Differences in sequencing chemistry may lead to coverage dropout effects, particularly in longer transcripts, whereas shorter transcripts may exhibit higher terminal coverage due to fragmentation or incomplete cDNA synthesis.</p><p id="P12">By binning transcripts into three categories (0–500 bp, 500 bp–1 kb, &gt;1 kb), we assessed how effectively long-read sequencing captures full-length transcripts across different gene sizes. Our analysis shows that reads surviving filtration steps enable full-length coverage of genes in the 500 bp–1 kb range across all long-read platforms, with far superior coverage of the transcript body and 5′ end compared to Illumina sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We also compared the distribution of aligned bases across different genomic regions (intergenic, intronic, CDS, and UTR). As expected, most reads aligned to coding region of genes, with approximately 50% of aligned bases aligned to CDS across all platforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). While the overall distribution of bases across genomic categories was similar between platforms, we observed that Jumpcode treatment reduced the proportion of bases aligning to intergenic and intronic regions, with a corresponding increase in UTR alignment. This is consistent with Jumpcode’s design to deplete highly abundant, uninformative transcripts and fragments, thereby enriching for reads mapping to more biologically relevant regions.</p><p id="P14">To further assess the extent to which reads-derived isoforms likely represent full-length transcripts, we compared the length distributions of detected isoforms with those of reference transcripts (Human_hg38_Gencode_v39 for PacBio, 10X genomics refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A for ONT) for both full splice match (FSM) and incomplete splice match (ISM) transcripts, as defined by SQANTI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. This analysis revealed that longer transcripts present in the reference were largely absent among the isoforms detected in our data, with transcripts longer than 1.5-2kb generally underrepresented across platforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Given that the same cDNA was used across all experiments, the observed differences in FSM transcript lengths between platforms suggest that the additional processing involved in MAS-seq library preparation may also contribute to biases toward shorter transcript recovery in long-read single-cell workflows (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S6 and S7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Read retention is low across long-read scRNA-seq platforms but varies by preprocessing stage</title><p id="P15">While long-read sequencing offers advantages in transcript resolution and gene body coverage, data retention at each stage of processing is critical for maximising usable reads for downstream analyses. To assess this, we examined read loss at key preprocessing steps across platforms, evaluating how much sequencing data was ultimately retained and incorporated into the final expression matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). We processed PacBio and ONT data using their respective recommended scRNA-seq workflows, following standard analysis pipelines. This approach allows us to evaluate sequencing outputs as an end-user would obtain them and to assess how platform-specific processing influences read retention. While both workflows follow a similar overall structure, they differ in step order and incorporate platform-specific processing steps due to differences in sequencing chemistry.</p><p id="P16">Since the gene × cell and transcript × cell expression matrices form the foundation of downstream analyses, we examined read retention at each processing stage, tracking how much sequencing data was lost from the total raw reads to the final dataset used for expression analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). ONT generated the highest number of raw reads (145.9M), followed by Revio with Jumpcode (101.9M) and Sequel IIe (33.9M). Median read quality scores were substantially higher for PacBio (Q31–34) compared to ONT (Q13), reflecting known differences in sequencing accuracy across platforms.</p><p id="P17">Across all platforms, the percentage of full-length (FL) reads was consistently high (≥93%), indicating minimal data loss at this initial step. However, substantial read attrition occurred at later stages of processing. During the transition from FL reads to FL reads with valid barcodes, ONT retained only 69.2% of its total raw reads, compared to 93.7–94.8% in PacBio datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). This suggests that ONT’s higher sequencing error rate affects barcode correction, leading to early read attrition that is not observed in PacBio platforms.</p><p id="P18">The most substantial read loss across all platforms occurred by the UMI deduplication stage, where ONT retained only 36.4% of its original reads, indicating that nearly half of all ONT reads were removed during this step. PacBio platforms also experienced losses by this stage, with Revio retaining 56.1%, Sequel IIe retaining 60.7%, and Revio with Jumpcode treatment showing the largest reduction, retaining only 27.8% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). The steep decline in ONT suggests that error-prone UMIs contribute to increased filtering at this stage, whereas PacBio’s higher sequencing accuracy may lead to more stable read retention.</p><p id="P19">A notable difference between analyses is the incorporation of SQANTI3-based isoform classification and filtering in the PacBio workflow (<italic>pigeon</italic>), which removes low-confidence isoforms as a standard step, whereas the ONT workflow does not include an equivalent isoform filtering step by default. Previous studies (Lebrigand et al. 2020) and our own findings indicate that long-read single-cell datasets often contain a high proportion of unwanted artifacts, including template-switching by-products, ligation-derived adapter sequences, intrapriming events, and non-canonical splice site artifacts. These do not correspond to true cDNA structures yet consume a significant portion of sequencing throughput. As a result, ONT initially retained a far greater number of reads in the expression matrices, which could lead to an overestimation of isoform diversity. To ensure the analysis approaches were as comparable as possible between approaches, we applied default SQANTI3 filtering to the ONT dataset before generating the final count matrices for downstream analyses. After applying SQANTI3 filtering, the number of usable ONT reads dropped to 10.9% of the original dataset (15.85M reads), aligning closer with Revio (12%) and Sequel IIe (19%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). This suggests that while ONT initially appeared to retain more usable reads, many of these were likely false isoforms that PacBio’s default pipeline would have already filtered out.</p><p id="P20">These analyses indicate that while 10X Genomics cDNA libraries introduce length bias, long-read sequencing achieves high gene body coverage across single-cell transcriptomes. Despite this, recovered transcript lengths consistently fall short of reference annotations, highlighting a need for protocol optimisation to enable true end-to-end transcript capture at single-cell resolution.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Long-read platforms yield consistent barcode recovery but variable isoform detection at single cell resolution</title><p id="P21">To assess molecule recovery at single-cell resolution, we compared UMI counts per cell across sequencing platforms. Among long-read datasets, ONT and PacBio Revio recovered similar UMI counts per cell, differing by only ~2%, while Sequel IIe detected substantially fewer UMIs (~36% fewer) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In comparison, Illumina short-read sequencing yielded the highest median UMI count per cell (5510), approximately 79% higher than ONT—the best-performing long-read platform for UMI recovery—indicating that short-read sequencing remains superior to long-read approaches in this metric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P22">While ONT yielded the highest UMI counts among long-read datasets, gene detection per cell was highest with PacBio MAS-seq combined with Jumpcode depletion on the Revio platform, recovering a median of 1,142 genes per cell—the highest among long-read libraries sequenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Comparatively, ONT and Sequel IIe libraries detected approximately 40% and 43% fewer genes per cell on average. This trend was consistent at the isoform level, with the Revio MAS-seq Jumpcode library demonstrating the strongest performance, both in the median number of isoform UMIs (2,912) and isoforms detected per cell (1,004) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P23">For Jumpcode-treated libraries, we anticipated a reduction in mitochondrial transcript content, as the kit is designed to deplete highly expressed, often uninformative genes, thereby preserving sequencing capacity molecules of greater biological interest. Our analysis confirmed this, with mitochondrial transcripts decreasing by ~87-91% following Jumpcode treatment, from from ~5–6% in untreated samples to 0.6-0.8% in treated libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Consistent with this, treatment with Jumpcode improved per-cell gene detection on both MAS-seq libraries, increasing by 24% on Revio and 32% on Sequel IIe, suggesting that depletion of highly abundant transcripts enhanced transcriptome complexity.</p><p id="P24">To further evaluate the effectiveness of Jumpcode treatment in depleting target transcripts, we compared the summed expression of all genes from the Jumpcode panel across untreated and Jumpcode-treated samples sequenced on both the Sequel IIe and Revio platforms. Jumpcode treatment resulted in a substantial and statistically significant reduction in panel gene expression across both platforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). In Sequel IIe samples, Jumpcode reduced panel gene expression by approximately 2.9-fold compared to untreated controls (log<sub>2</sub> fold change = 1.55; Kolmogorov-Smirnov D = 0.427, p = 6.18 × 10<sup>−27</sup>). Similarly, in Revio samples, a ~2.3-fold reduction was observed following treatment (log<sub>2</sub> fold change = 1.21; D = 0.340, p = 2.84 × 10<sup>−17</sup>). To assess whether Jumpcode depletion impacted coverage of untargetted transcripts (i.e., transcripts not included in the panel), we examined distributional shifts and found minimal differences following treatment (D = 0.092 for Sequel IIe and D = 0.063 for Revio), suggesting depletion was highly specific to the targeted gene set without broadly affecting non-target transcripts. ECDF plots illustrating these distributional differences for panel and non-panel genes are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>.</p><p id="P25">We next examined the relationship between sequencing depth and isoform detection across platforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). Across all datasets, we observed a strong positive correlation between the number of reads and isoforms detected per cell. This relationship was most pronounced in Jumpcode-treated libraries, with both PacBio Revio and Sequel IIe exhibiting near-perfect correlations (r = 0.99), indicating highly efficient and consistent isoform recovery following depletion, reinforcing the utility of targeted depletion for isoform-level resolution in long-read protocols.</p><p id="P26">Given that all libraries contain the same cells sequenced across platforms, we next evaluated whether cell barcodes were detected consistently across technologies despite platform-dependent differences in molecular recovery. We observed high concordance in barcode detection across platforms, with most cell barcodes consistently recovered irrespective of technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). While a small number of barcodes were detected exclusively in Illumina (n = 11) and ONT (n = 28) datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>); these cells exhibited markedly lower UMI counts and were among the poorest-performing barcodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2I</xref>). Their limited expression profiles suggest these barcodes represent low-quality cells rather than genuinely platform-specific captures.</p><p id="P27">In summary, combining Revio MAS-seq with Jumpcode depletion yielded the most comprehensive isoform recovery across platforms tested. Although ONT achieved marginally higher UMI recovery among the long-read datasets, this did not translate to greater gene or isoform detection per cell. Moreover, these results show that applying targeted transcript depletion enhanced transcriptome complexity at isoform resolution, supporting their utility in single-cell long-read sequencing workflows.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Long-read scRNA-seq refines cluster annotation and enhances subpopulation resolution</title><p id="P28">To enable meaningful comparisons between platforms, all datasets underwent consistent quality control and were processed independently using the same parameters. Cells were visualised using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) at a fixed resolution and annotated based on canonical marker expression, supported by automated cell type prediction tools. Each dataset was annotated in isolation, without reference to labels from other platforms. We identified the same broad immune cell types across all six datasets, consistent with the composition of PBMCs, including T cells (CD4+, CD8+), B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes (CD14+, CD16+), dendritic cells (DCs) and platelets.</p><p id="P29">To evaluate annotation consistency, we compared cell type assignments to those derived from Illumina short-read data, and assessed the added impact of incorporating isoform-level information on cell type resolution. Notably, B cells and NK cells were the most reliably annotated across all platforms, with minimal variation in assigned labels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). These populations exhibited high concordance with short-read -based annotations and were recovered at similar proportions, reflecting their distinct transcriptional profiles and robustness to differences in platform sensitivity. In contrast, the annotation of T cell subsets showed greater variability, particularly CD8+ sub-populations. This may reflect the finer transcriptional distinctions among T cell states, and highlights differences in how each platform resolves transcript complexity and gene identity.</p><p id="P30">To assess how isoform-level information influenced cell-type resolution, we compared clustering and annotation across datasets using gene-level, isoform-level and integrated data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Major immune cell types remained consistent across analysis modes, but isoform-level data provided improved resolution of specific populations and greater separation between closely related T cell subsets. Sankey plots revealed that while most cells retained consistent annotations across gene- and isoform-level assignments, a subset of cells shifted labels—most frequently between closely related T cell states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, H), suggesting isoform data captured transcript features not evident at the gene level, refining cell identity in ambiguous regions. Isoform-aware annotation resulted in reclassification across all platforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). These findings indicate that isoform-level analysis adds resolution beyond gene expression alone, particularly for fine-grained distinctions among populations, for instance, T cells.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Direct detection of immune repertoires without targeted amplification and improved resolution of γδ T cells with isoform-aware scRNA-seq</title><p id="P31">Single cell clustering of long read data captured the same cell types at similar proportions, with the notable exception of a population of γδ T-cells that were not detected in conventional 10X-Illumina sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). To explore this further, we subsequently used Trust4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> to perform immune repertoire analysis of the long-read data from all samples. Trust4 reconstructs recombined TCR and BCR sequences directly from RNA-seq data, using full-length transcript alignments to infer V(D)J gene usage and CDR3 sequences.</p><p id="P32">In conventional single-cell analyses, immune receptor profiling typically requires preparation of dedicated sublibraries for either class of receptor through targeted 5’ amplification, generating separate libraries for gene expression and αβ-TCR/BCR detection. Commercial approaches are available for mouse and human αβ-TCR and BCR sequencing, but a custom approach must be employed for γδ-TCR sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, or immune profiling in non-model organisms. We demonstrate that long-read sequencing of single-cell libraries can uniquely enable detection of all classes of recombined TCR/BCR molecules without additional library preparation, including both αβ and γδ T-cells/TCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 B-C</xref>).</p><p id="P33">We assessed the detection of full-length paired chains in B, αβ T, and γδ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>) to evaluate immune receptor recovery across platforms. Across all datasets, a substantial proportion of cells had both chains recovered, with the highest proportions observed in ONT and MAS-seq Revio libraries. Notably, full γδ TCR pairing was reliably achieved in both Revio libraries, highlighting the ability of high-fidelity long-read platforms to capture complete receptor sequences without enrichment. Sequel IIe libraries showed lower overall pairing rates, though performance improved with Jumpcode depletion. These results reinforce the potential of long-read RNA-seq for immune repertoire profiling.</p><p id="P34">To quantify the relative contribution of gene- and isoform-level data to cluster identity, we examined WNN modality weights, which reflect the information content of each modality at the single-cell level. Values near 1 indicate that isoform-level features are more informative for a given cell, whereas values near 0 reflect dominance of gene-level information. We visualised the distribution of isoform modality weights across WNN clusters annotated by cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). γδ T cells showed the highest isoform modality weights, indicating that isoform-level data contributed disproportionately to their identification. In contrast, monocytes and dendritic cells showed more balanced or gene-dominated weights, suggesting that isoform-level resolution provided less additional information for these cell types. These results highlight cell-type-specific differences in the added value of isoform data, particularly in lineages where transcript structure may be more functionally relevant or discriminative.</p><p id="P35">Prompted by the high isoform weight scores in γδ T cell clusters in our long-read data — not distinguishable as γδ T cells in our matched Illumina short-read dataset — we explored why gene-level signals alone may have been insufficient to resolve them. γδ T cells are a rare lymphocyte population (1–5% of circulating T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>) that adopt an alternative TCR architecture, expressing TCR γ and δ chains (e.g., TRDC) rather than the αβ chains predominant in conventional CD3+ T cells. This grants them the ability to detect a wider array of antigens, including endogenous and exogenous non-peptidic molecules and stress-induced antigens, bypassing the need for MHC mediation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Bridging innate and adaptive immunity, γδ T cells exhibit cytotoxic capabilities and cytokine profiles that closely parallel those of NK cells, reflecting their shared roles in early immune responses. In line with this, we found substantial overlap between gene-level markers for γδ T and NK cells in our dataset. For example, TRDC, a canonical γδ T cell marker, was robustly expressed in NK cells, which co-expressed CD56 (NCAM1), NKG7, GZMA, GNLY, CST7, and CCL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). Notably, TRDC expression in NK cells has been reported previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, although its functional relevance remains unclear. Consistent with this overlap, when examining matched cell barcodes in our Illumina short-read dataset, these same cells were annotated predominantly as NK or NKT-like cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>), highlighting the limitations of gene-level classification in resolving γδ T cells within standard scRNA-seq data. Our data suggest that γδ T cells—identified exclusively in long-read data through TRUST4 TCR reconstruction—can be more accurately distinguished from NK cells in scRNA-seq through long-read sequencing. These findings illustrate how isoform-level resolution can disentangle overlapping transcriptional signatures and improve annotation of closely related but functionally distinct immune subsets. This has important implications for immunology, particularly in efforts to characterise rare or unconventional immune populations, trace their lineage relationships, and understand their distinct effector functions. Specifically, in contexts such as tumour immunology or adoptive cell therapy development, where γδ T and NK cells are of interest for their cytotoxic potential <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, improved isoform-level resolution may facilitate mechanistic insights and support therapeutic targeting of these populations.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Platform-dependent differences in clonal architecture captured by long-read scRNA-seq</title><p id="P36">To further assess the ability of long-read sequencing platforms to reconstruct immune repertoires, we used scRepertoire to assign clonotypes based on strict sequence identity and compared clonal distributions across datasets. Since immune receptor analysis is a key application of full-length transcript sequencing, this allowed us to evaluate how well each platform captures clonal architecture across major lymphocyte subsets. TCR and BCR sequences were analysed separately and grouped into B cells, αβ T cells, and γδ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G–I</xref>), where clonotype similarity was quantified using Morisita’s index to evaluate overlap across datasets.</p><p id="P37">B cell clonotypes showed the most consistent patterns, with dominant clones broadly shared across all datasets, as visualised in the riverplot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). While ONT showed a higher proportion of its top B cell clone relative to other technologies, which may reflect its higher recovery of paired BCR chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>), the overall BCR repertoire appeared relatively stable across methods, with similar rank and diversity profiles.</p><p id="P38">For αβ T cells, the PacBio MAS-seq Revio library had the highest number of unique clones identified, consistent with its greater recovery of fully paired αβ TCR chains. While distributions were broadly similar across platforms, ONT detected fewer total clones, and its repertoire appeared more skewed toward top-ranked clonotypes. In contrast, PacBio Revio and Revio with Jumpcode libraries exhibited smoother clone distributions, with greater retention of intermediate-abundance clonotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>), suggesting improved resolution of subdominant T cell expansions.</p><p id="P39">γδ T cell clonotype distributions were more variable across platforms and skewed towards a smaller number of dominant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>). This likely reflects a combination of lower γδ T cell abundance in the input sample and variability in paired-chain recovery, which limits the number of assignable clonotypes. Interestingly, both Jumpcode libraries retained a greater proportion of top γδ clones compared to their untreated counterpart, suggesting that depletion may help preserve dominant clonotypes by reducing background reads.</p><p id="P40">Overall, this analysis demonstrates that long-read single-cell RNA-seq enables reconstruction of clonal immune architecture across multiple lymphocyte lineages without dedicated receptor enrichment. The differences observed in clonal distributions here reflect technical variation in full-length receptor recovery rather than biological differences, as all datasets derive from the same input cell population.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Cell-type-specific CD45 splicing captured by isoform-resolved scRNA-seq</title><p id="P41">To explore the utility of single-cell long-read sequencing in immunology, we leveraged TRUST4 classifications to separate reads by immune cell type (B cells, αβ T cells, and γδ T cells) for read-level splicing analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. This allowed for a direct, read-level analysis of splicing patterns across immune cell types and study of base modifications. We focused on PTPRC (CD45), a regulator of white blood cell activation and differentiation, where exons 4, 5, and 6 are subject to alternative splicing to produce isoforms such as CD45RA, CD45RO, and CD45RB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). These isoforms influence TCR signalling thresholds and the activation states of naive, memory, and effector T cells, with evidence supporting conserved, cell-type-specific splicing patterns across immune lineages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The evidence for distinct functional roles across CD45 isoforms remains inconclusive, but there is strong support for conserved cell-type and differentiation-stage specific expression patterns in immune cell development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Moreover, dysregulation of CD45 splicing has been implicated in autoimmunity and haematological malignancies, yet the precise landscape of isoform expression at single-cell resolution has remained largely unexplored. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Our analysis revealed that B cells predominantly expressed isoforms retaining exons 4–6, corresponding to CD45RABC, whereas T cells primarily expressed shorter isoforms lacking these exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, gene-level expression of PTPRC appeared uniform across immune cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), highlighting the limitations of gene abundance alone in resolving biologically relevant splicing differences revealed by isoform-level analysis. Isoform-resolved profiling at single-cell resolution thus provides a more informative view of post-transcriptional regulation in immune cells and enables the study of splicing patterns in immunology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P42">This study provides a comparative analysis of single-cell long-read transcriptomics workflows, evaluating platform-specific wet-lab protocols and recommended bioinformatics pipelines under realistic usage conditions. Our analyses demonstrate that both platforms can recover complex transcript isoforms across diverse immune cell types, with comparable performance in barcode recovery, cell type identification, and overall per-cell resolution. However, we also highlight key differences between platforms that influenced downstream interpretation, shaping the granularity of isoform detection and the resolution of cellular subtypes.</p><p id="P43">To objectively evaluate platform performance, we analysed each dataset independently, treating each experiment in isolation while ensuring consistent parameters throughout sample processing and data interpretation. Across all datasets, the addition of isoform-level information restructured cell type clustering, often improving the resolution of closely related subsets, as exemplified by the improved identification of γδ T cells in long-read data relative to short-read sequencing. We also show that immune receptor repertoires can be reconstructed from standard gene expression libraries, extending the utility of long-read sequencing beyond dedicated immune profiling workflows.</p><p id="P44">While long-read approaches capture significantly more full-length transcripts than traditional short-read methods, transcript completeness declines sharply above ~1 kb, reflecting a persistent limitation compounded by single-cell-specific artefacts such as mispriming and overamplification. Together, these factors highlight the need for optimised cDNA synthesis strategies prior to library preparation to reduce truncation and improve transcript recovery. In this study, while we did not deviate from manufacturer-recommended protocols to enable fair comparisons across platforms, modifications to cDNA synthesis workflows—including reverse transcription, amplification, and purification steps—represent a feasible and actively tested avenue for improving the recovery of longer transcripts. We demonstrated that CRISPR-based depletion of highly abundant transcripts, such as mitochondrial and ribosomal RNA, substantially improved the recovery of informative features. By redistributing sequencing capacity, depletion increased both gene and isoform detection. In the current landscape of limited throughput, targeted strategies such as transcript depletion or enrichment is proving the most effective means of enhancing coverage of transcriptional heterogeneity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, particularly when specific biological processes or gene families are of interest.</p><p id="P45">These experimental challenges were mirrored by limitations in data interpretation. Unlike gene-level analyses, isoform quantification requires precise inference of transcript boundaries, splice junctions, and exon connectivity, making analyses highly sensitive to technical artefacts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Current pipelines, largely adapted from bulk data, do not adequately account for key sources of noise—including internal priming, non-canonical junctions, and poly(A) tail miscalls that are prevalent in scRNA-seq <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>—which not only convolute interpretation of results but also leads to substantial data loss during pre-processing. Moreover, isoform detection and quantification, particularly for rare or alternatively spliced transcripts, require substantially higher sequencing depths than gene-level quantification due to the increased complexity of transcript structures. Our analysis revealed the substantial extent to which reads are filtered during early processing steps when following the recommended pre-processing workflows for each platform. Currently, artefacts such as chimeric, truncated, or misprimed molecules, and the inherent sparsity and variability of single-cell datasets remain unaddressed, limiting confidence in accurate isoform assignment. As the field matures, the development of platform-aware, artefact-sensitive pipelines will be essential to enable robust isoform-level analyses in single-cell contexts.</p><p id="P46">The selection of the most appropriate single-cell long-read sequencing approach to incorporate into transcriptomic studies, will also require considerations beyond data yield and quality. This includes costs, laboratory and bioinformatic staff time, training and the laboratory facilities available. In line with this, we have approximated the current processing time from cell isolation to completion of sequencing for each of the platforms implemented in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>), though we acknowledge this will vary significantly between facilities and with continued development in the field. Since the completion of this work, further developments in long-read single-cell transcriptomics workflows have continued to advance. At the time of writing, the MAS-seq protocol, rebranded as Kinnex, now supports sample multiplexing and 5′-end compatibility, broadening its applicability across single-cell preparations. Similarly, the Oxford Nanopore libraries generated here using the SQK-PCS111 kit on R9 flow cells have been superseded by updated chemistries with improved read accuracy and yield. These developments reflect the rapid pace of progress in the field and a growing trend towards platform interoperability. Emerging combinations, such as pairing long-read sequencing with other single-cell approaches, point towards the potential to scale full-length isoform capture to tens of thousands of cells in the near future.</p><p id="P47">Despite these advances, it is important to recognise that the prevailing emphasis on cell throughput continues to constrain per-cell resolution. This trade-off is particularly limiting in biological contexts where low-abundance transcripts and subtle isoform changes can have functional significance, such as in lineage commitment and cell-state transitions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Consistent with the findings of others, our results indicate that long-read sequencing is well positioned to address these challenges. Realising this potential, however, will require a deliberate shift in strategy prioritising deeper sequencing of fewer cells and developing informatic tools capable of extracting robust isoform-level insights from single-cell data.</p><p id="P48">Overall, this study demonstrates that single-cell long-read sequencing provides practical and actionable isoform-level resolution for refining cell type annotation and repertoire analysis across immune cell types. Researchers seeking to investigate transcript diversity, splicing patterns, and clonal architecture should consider long-read approaches while balancing current throughput and cost constraints. As sequencing chemistries and informatic tools continue to advance, single-cell long-read sequencing will become increasingly integral to characterising transcriptional heterogeneity and post-transcriptional regulation, offering deeper insights into immune cell function in health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Single-cell cDNA preparation</title><p id="P49">Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from StemCell Technologies (Cat.
