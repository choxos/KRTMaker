With limited therapeutic options and increasing resistance to antifungals, novel treatment strategies for <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections is paramount. The exact immune response to <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections can be influenced by the surrounding microenvironment, for example, metabolic stresses or co-infection; although, knowledge on whether responses are enhanced or inhibited is lacking. Macrophages are a key immune cell in defence against <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection through phagocytic uptake and cytokine production that alerts other immune defence mechanisms. Here, we utilise a discovery screen approach using Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) based total proteomics to describe murine bone marrow derived macrophage (BMDM) response to <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection as well as in response to co-infection with gram-negative bacterial outer membrane component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or live gram-negative bacteria <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. We found <italic>C. albicans</italic> induced a surprisingly muted immune response in BMDMs as compared to LPS or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Moreover, upon co-infection with LPS or <italic>P. aeruginosa, C. albicans</italic> suppressed the BMDM proteome landscape and selectively suppressed BMDM secreted IL-6 and IL-12p40 cytokine responses to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Thus, <italic>C. albicans</italic> has significant suppressive capabilities in the host innate immune responses that could impact clinical outcomes during infection.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Human fungal infections are increasing in incidence globally, contributing to 3.8 million deaths annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). One of the main contributors to fatal fungal infections are <italic>Candida</italic> species, including <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. As an opportunistic, polymorphic pathogen, <italic>C. albicans</italic> frequently causes mucosal infections in its yeast form which are normally cleared by the immune system in healthy individuals. In some cases, <italic>C. albicans</italic> may cause systemic infection. This occurs most commonly in immunocompromised individuals, and are much more serious and carry a high mortality rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Globally, 1,565,000 individuals are reported to develop invasive Candidiasis, of which 63.6% individuals succumb to the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Infection with <italic>Candida</italic> species is also problematic in clinical settings, with Candidemia being the fourth most common hospital acquired bloodstream infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). A growing concern in the context of <italic>Candida</italic> infections is the increased resistance of some <italic>Candida</italic> species to existing antifungals drugs. This is compounded by the low number of antifungal drugs available, meaning that effective treatments are becoming increasingly problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Thus, new treatment strategies are critical to address the issue of rising incidence in fungal infections and their resistance to current anti-fungal drugs.</p><p id="P3">Systemic <italic>Candida</italic> infections can occur when the body’s cutaneous or mucosal barriers fail, allowing dissemination of <italic>Candida</italic> through the bloodstream as a yeast. Once in the bloodstream, <italic>C. albicans</italic> yeast can morphologically change into filamentous hyphae due to environmental cues including factors in the serum and temperatures of 37 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). This can allow <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae to grow out from blood vessels into surrounding tissues, resulting in tissue damage and potentially organ failure and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). This complex pathogenesis mechanism requires an equally complex immune response to counter it with important roles for both innate and adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Macrophages play an important role in the initial response to <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection, as demonstrated by an increased susceptibility in <italic>Candida</italic> infection models following experimental depletion of various macrophage populations <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Pattern recognition Receptors (PRRs) expressed on macrophages are able to identify pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including structural components of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Activation of these receptors can potentially stimulate the macrophage to produce inflammatory mediators to aid in pathogen killing or coordinate downstream immune reactions. PRRs together with phagocytic receptors also coordinate the engulfment of <italic>C. albicans</italic> through phagocytosis to aid in killing of the <italic>Candida</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Commonly studied PRRs in the context of <italic>Candida</italic> infection include C-type lectin receptors (CTLRs) Dectin-1, Dectin-2, Clec4d and Clec4e, which identify both yeast and hyphal cell wall structural components β-glucan, α-mannan and mannose, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Additionally, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) also identify and respond to <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall components and genetic content, also inducing an inflammatory response, including TLR1, TLR2, TLR4 and TLR6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Much of what we understand about the macrophage signalling response to <italic>C. albicans</italic> is through studies utilising isolated PRR agonists including fungal cell wall components like zymosan—from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>—or heat killed <italic>C. albicans</italic> in cedll culture experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Activation of TLRs and CTLRs results in activation of pathways which are dependent on MyD88/TRIF and Syk-CARD9 signalling cascades, respectively. Despite having different upstream components, these pathways converge on activation of ERK1/2, p38 and canonical NFκB signalling pathways, which together result in induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-12 and TNF as well as the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). While these agonists are critical for understanding specific PRR responses, they may not best replicate responses to live pathogens as some pathogens, like <italic>C. albicans, can</italic> have outer-cell wall components which mask identification by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Studying the host response to live pathogen is intrinsically more complicated by <italic>C. albicans</italic> polymorphic phenotypes, as host cells are responding to multiple morphologies with varying exposure and masking of PAMPs. Additionally, hyphal transition transcriptionally controls <italic>C. albicans</italic> virulence factors, like candidalysin, which also have been shown to modulate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Thus, studying live <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection provides a more complex interaction between pathogen and host cell responses which is more representable of <italic>in vivo</italic> interactions.</p><p id="P5">In addition, <italic>in vivo Candida</italic> infection may not occur in isolation and may occur in the context of a polymicrobial environment, especially for infections of mucosal membranes. Mixed bacterial-fungal infections have been associated with increased disease severity. For example, <italic>in vivo</italic> murine sublethal co-infections of <italic>C. albicans</italic> and bacterial <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> was shown to have 80% mortality, whereas infection of <italic>C. albicans</italic> or <italic>S. aureus</italic> alone resulted in no mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). <italic>C. albicans</italic> is often found together with gram negative <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (bacterium) in polymicrobial biofilms from cystic fibrosis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). Furthermore, Zebrafish models challenged to co-infection with <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> showed reduced survival compared to single infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). While polymicrobial infections have been shown to increase risk for host mortality, it is not yet clear how the host cell responds to bacterial and fungal co-infections.</p><p id="P6">To gain further insight into these interactions, we studied the murine BMDM proteome remodelling after 8-hours of <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection, in combination with the gram-negative bacterial cell wall component LPS or co-infection with the gram-negative bacteria <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> using Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) based proteomic approaches. Together, we found that while macrophages have a limited measurable response to <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection in isolation, <italic>C. albicans</italic> has targeted protein suppression of important inflammatory macrophage responses to LPS or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection, including IL-6 and IL-12 secretion.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>C. albicans</italic> infected BMDM proteomes consistently regulate a distinct group of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory proteins</title><p id="P7"><italic>C. albicans</italic> has been shown to induce MAPK and NFκB signalling as well as TNF production in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). In line with this, we found that infection of murine Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages (BMDMs) with live <italic>C. albicans</italic> stimulated TNF secretion and activation of the p38 MAPK and NFκB pathways (Supplementary Figure 1). To better understand the overall response of BMDMs to <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection, total proteomes were analysed after 8 hours of <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection and compared to unstimulated controls in two independent proteomic experiments, each with 4 biological replicates. The estimated total protein content per cell in unstimulated and <italic>C. albicans</italic> infected BMDMs were not significantly different suggesting the protein content and macrophage size was unchanged during infection (Supplementary Figure 2 A, B). Unstimulated BMDM protein expression from Experiment 1 and 2 were well correlated (Spearman coefficient 0.9774) (Supplementary Figure 2C), although the variation between Experiment 1 and 2 was greater than the variation between the biological replicates within one experiment (Spearman coefficients ranged from 0.98 to 1.0 for comparison of individual replicates within each experiment). This may reflect slight variations in the macrophage differentiation on different days, and for this reason, data from the two experiments was analysed separately. To determine the differential expression of proteins between <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection and unstimulated conditions, regulated proteins were defined as those <italic>with q</italic>-values (Limma calculated adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value) of less than 0.05 and a Log2 fold-change of more than 1 standard deviation from the median. Up-regulated proteins were removed from the list if identified in 2 or less stimulated replicates, while in the down-regulated subset, proteins were removed if identified in 2 or less of the unstimulated replicates. An additional group of proteins were categorised as regulated, where proteins were included in the up-regulated list if proteins were not detected in unstimulated conditions yet present in all stimulated replicates; or down-regulated if present in all replicates of unstimulated group yet not detected in stimulated groups.</p><p id="P8">In the first experiment, <italic>C. albicans</italic> infected BMDMs up-regulated 162 proteins and down-regulated 108 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the second experiment, <italic>C. albicans</italic> infected BMDMs proteome differentially up-regulated 99 proteins and down-regulated 36 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Analysis of these two experiments showed that the overlap between the regulated protein groups in the two experiments was not perfect (Supplementary Figure 2D and E), especially for Experiment 1 were many of the down-regulated proteins were not replicated in the 2<sup>nd</sup> experiment. To define a list of proteins robustly regulated by <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection, proteins found up- or down-regulated across the two experiments were collated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 C, D</xref>; Supplementary Table 1). Within this list of proteins, the fold changes between Experiment 1 and 2 showed a strong positive correlation (spearman correlation r=0.8289) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The list of up-regulated proteins included several PRRs (Clec4d, Clec4e, TLR2) and signalling proteins that act downstream of PRR activation (IRAK2, CHUK/IKKa) while the NFkB inhibitor NFKBIB/IkBb was down-regulated. In addition, several immune regulatory proteins (ACOD1, IL-1RN and SLAMF7), transcription factors with roles in innate immunity (ATF3, JUNB and CEBPB) and two autophagy associated proteins including UBQLN4 and SQSTM1 (2 isoforms were detected) were also up-regulated on <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>C. albicans</italic> infection modulated the LPS response in BMDMs</title><p id="P9">Overall, the effect of <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection on proteome remodelling was modest, despite the important roles attributed to macrophage infection models <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). For this reason, coupled to the finding that <italic>C. albicans</italic> did regulate some proteins with known function in innate immunity, we compared the macrophages response to infection with live <italic>C. albicans</italic> and the changes occurring with LPS or the bacterial pathogen <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Given that <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure to <italic>C. albicans</italic> may occur in a polymicrobial environment, we also examined whether <italic>C. albicans</italic> might modulate the macrophage response to either LPS or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection.</p><p id="P10">LPS is a component of gram-negative bacteria outermost membrane and has been used extensively to mimic anti-bacterial responses in cultured macrophages. In terms of proteomic remodelling, both LPS and infection with the gram negative-bacteria <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> resulted in similar responses after 8 hours in BMDMs (Warner <italic>et al</italic>., manuscript in preparation). We therefore initially used LPS as a simplified model of <italic>C. albicans</italic>-bacterial co-infections. Cytokine secretion was compared in BMDMs infected with <italic>C. albicans</italic>, stimulated with LPS, or co-treated with both. As expected, LPS stimulation induced a robust increase in the secretion of IL-6, IL-12p40, TNF, and IL-10 compared to unstimulated controls. In contrast, <italic>C. albicans</italic> infected BMDMs did not induce a large cytokine response compared to LPS stimulated BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-D</xref>). BMDMs co-treated with <italic>C. albicans</italic> and LPS produced more TNF and IL-10 compared to those treated with LPS alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Interestingly <italic>C. albicans</italic> significantly suppressed IL-6 and IL-12p40 production in response to LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Yet, this suppression was selective as co-treated BMDMs secreted significantly more TNF and IL-10 relative to LPS stimulated BMDMs. The decrease in LPS induced IL-6 and IL-12p40 secretion in co-treated BMDMs was not due to <italic>C. albicans</italic> affecting the viability of the BMDMs during the 8-hour stimulation as there was no significant difference between total number of cells or their survival, as judged by cellular exclusion of DNA binding dyes, between the LPS and co-treated conditions (Supplementary Figure 3).</p><p id="P11">To determine whether the effect of <italic>C. albicans</italic> on LPS cytokine secretion was due to upstream suppression of known TLR4 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), these pathways were examined at 0.5 and 2.5 hours of treatment (Supplementary Figure 4). In line with previous reports, LPS induced the activation of the p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK cascades, as judged by phosphorylation of their TXY activation motifs, or the phosphorylation of CREB, a known downstream target of MAPK signalling in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). IKK signalling was also activated, as determined by the phosphorylation of the p105 NFkB subunit. <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection with <italic>C. albicans</italic> alone only weakly activated signalling compared to LPS. Co-treatment with LPS and <italic>C. albicans</italic> resulted in similar levels of MAPK and NFkB activation (Supplementary Figure 4), suggesting <italic>C. albicans</italic> did not affect IL-6 and IL-12p40 production by modulating the initial signalling induced by TLR4.</p><p id="P12">To examine if the suppression of IL-6 by <italic>C. albicans</italic> was specific for its induction by TLR4 activation, the effect of <italic>C. albicans</italic> on IL-6 production in response to TLR agonists was examined. In line with the results for LPS, co-treatment with <italic>C. albicans</italic> and either Pam3CSK (TLR1/2), R848 (TLR7/8), CL097 (TLR7/8) or CpG DNA (TLR9) resulted in lower IL-6 production relative to the TLR agonist alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). <italic>C. albicans</italic> has been reported to activate the C-type lectin receptor Dectin-1 with β-glucan structures in the fungal cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Unlike live <italic>C. albicans</italic>, depleted zymosan, a selective Dectin-1 agonist, was able to induce IL-6 production in macrophages, although not as strongly as LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). LPS co-treatment with depleted zymosan did not reduce IL-6 production compared to LPS stimulation alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that Dectin-1 activation by <italic>C. albicans</italic> was not responsible for the effects seen on LPS induced IL-6 production seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>. In line with the suppression being independent of Dectin-1, <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection also suppressed depleted zymosan induction of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In response to TLR stimulation, macrophages secrete IL-10 which can activate a feedback loop that inhibits IL-6 and IL-12p40 secretion. As IL-10 was elevated in LPS and <italic>C. albicans</italic> co-treated BMDMs relative to LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), a potential role for IL-10 in the suppressive effect of <italic>C. albicans</italic> on TLR induced IL-6 production was tested using an IL-10 neutralising antibody. As expected, treatment of the BMDMs with the IL-10 antibody increased LPS stimulated IL-6 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). <italic>C. albicans</italic> was, however, still able to inhibit LPS induced IL-6 secretion in the presence of the IL-10 antibody suggesting the effect of <italic>C. albicans</italic> is independent of IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). To determine whether <italic>C. albicans</italic> needed to be alive to suppresses the LPS induction of IL-6, macrophages were treated with either heat-killed or sonicated <italic>C. albicans</italic> in combination with LPS. This showed that only live <italic>C. albicans</italic> suppressed the LPS induced IL-6 response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p id="P14">It is possible that <italic>C. albicans</italic> could modulate IL-6 production through secreted factors such as toxins, proteases or quorum sensing microbial communication molecules. To determine whether IL-6 suppression requires direct contact between the macrophage and <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 0.4 μm pore polycarbonate cell culture inserts were used to physically separate <italic>C. albicans</italic> from BMDMs, while still allowing interaction with secreted molecules and LPS. In conditions without inserts (allowing physical interactions) <italic>C. albicans</italic> suppressed IL-6 as previously shown. Interestingly, separation of <italic>C. albicans</italic> from BMDM — through use of the insert — prevented the suppression of IL-6 secretion in co-treated BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, contact between <italic>C. albicans</italic> and BMDMs appears to be necessary for selective suppression of LPS induced IL-6.</p><p id="P15"><italic>C. albicans</italic> is a polymorphic pathogen, meaning it changes from yeast to hyphae depending on environmental queues. Hyphal formation is triggered during <italic>in vitro</italic> infections, when <italic>C. albicans</italic> is in the presence of FBS supplemented media, and when deprived of nutrients within the macrophage phagosome. The hyphae G1 cyclin-related gene <italic>(HGC1)</italic> is required for morphogenesis of yeast to hyphae transition; thus, <italic>Hgc1</italic> KO (knockout) strains are locked in the yeast morphology <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). To determine whether hyphal transition may affect IL-6 suppression in BMDMs, wild type <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>Hgc1 knockout</italic> strains were compared for their ability to affect IL-6 production. Interestingly, induction of IL-6 by LPS was not significanly suppressed by <italic>Hgc1</italic> KO co-treatment, although there was a trend towards suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Taken altogether, this data suggests <italic>C. albicans</italic> suppression of IL-6 production in response to TLR/CTLR activation, is independent of IL-10, but dependent on <italic>C. albicans</italic> being alive and having a polymorphic phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>C. albicans</italic> broadly suppresses LPS up-regulated proteome</title><p id="P16">To further examine the effect of <italic>C. albicans</italic> on the macrophages LPS response, proteomics was used to identify LPS induced changes in macrophages in the presence or absence of live <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Initially, we focused on the subset of genes identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> as being regulated by <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection, comparing single stimulation of LPS or <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection. The proteins down-regulated by <italic>C. albicans</italic> were more strongly down-regulated by LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The proteins up-regulated by <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection could be divided into 2 main categories – those that were also regulated by LPS and those that were more selective for <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Proteins regulated by both treatments generally showed a higher up-regulation with LPS than with <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection. This group contained multiple proteins, such as JUNB, IL1RN, ICAM1, TNFAIP2, SLFN2, TLR2 and ATF3 which are all known to be regulated by MAPK or NFκB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). Their increased up-regulation by LPS is consistent with the finding that LPS is a stronger activator of these pathways than infection with <italic>C. albicans</italic> (Supplementary Figure 4).</p><p id="P17">Analysis of the LPS response across the 2 proteomic experiments resulted in the identification of 2 groups of consistently regulated proteins, a group of 84 down-regulated and 349 up-regulated protein (according to the specifications outlined in the methods Supplementary and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). To look at the effect of co-treatment, the Log2 fold change for the <italic>C. albicans</italic> and LPS group relative to the LPS group alone was calculated. Analysis of these values in the LPS up- or down-regulated protein groups showed that the median fold change between co-treatment and LPS alone was strikingly lower for LPS up-regulated proteins than proteins either down-regulated or unaffected by LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). A more detailed analysis of LPS down-regulated proteins showed no clear effects of co-treatment with <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection across this group of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 C, D</xref>). In contrast, <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection appeared to show a consistent suppression of the BMDM LPS up-regulated protein subset. This subset showed the majority of the protein expression in co-stimulated BMDMs was less than the expression in LPS stimulated BMDMs; as shown by fold changes plotted less than 0 in the volcano plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 E, F</xref>) with a similar pattern between the two experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Given these global effects, the proteomic data was further mined to look at the effect of <italic>C. albicans</italic> on LPS stimulated BMDM expression of proteins known to be important in the macrophage response. The data for individual proteins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> is from Experiment 2; however, the same results were obtained in Experiment 1 and the corresponding data is shown in Supplementary Figure 6.

Identification of IL-6 and IL-10 were insufficient to report meaningful results, as they were not consistently detected in the proteomic dataset. Based on the proteomic data, intracellular levels of IL-1β and IL-18 were increased by LPS treatment and in both cases this induction was reduced when the macrophages were also infected with <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). IL-27 and IL-1RN were also detected in the proteomics and induced by LPS; however, these cytokines expression were not supressed by <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E, F</xref>). Similar to what was observed with cytokines, the induction of some chemokines by LPS was suppressed by co-treatment with <italic>C. albicans</italic>, as in the case of CCL3, CCL5 and CXCL10, while CCL2, CCL4, CCL7 and CXCL16 were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G-N</xref>). CXCL2 was unusual in that it showed a synergistic induction by a combination of LPS and <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6L</xref>). An important component of the macrophages response to inflammatory stimuli is the production of prostaglandins, whose synthesis is controlled by the level of Ptgs2 (COX-2). Ptgs2 was induced by LPS; however, this was not reduced by co-treatment with <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6O</xref>). Interestingly, LPS induction of Nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), an important macrophage anti-microbial protein, was suppressed by co-treatment with <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6P</xref>). Additionally, anti-inflammatory protein, ACOD1, which is significantly regulated by <italic>C. albicans</italic> and LPS separately, was suppressed in co-treated BMDMs relative to LPS stimulation alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6 Q</xref> and Supplementary Figure 6 Q). The transcription factors highlighted here (ATF3, JUNB and CEBPB) were induced by <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection alone, and either significantly increased during co-infection or not significantly different to LPS simulation alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6 R-T</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title><italic>C. albicans</italic> modulates the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> response in BMDMs</title><p id="P19">As LPS is a component of gram-negative bacterial outer membrane, LPS is a common agonist used to model bacterial infection, such as <italic>Pseudonomas aeruginosa</italic>.

Mirroring the results for LPS, the induction of IL-12p40, IL-18, CCL5, by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection was reduced by co-infection; while IL-1β, CCL3 and CXCL10 expression trended towards suppression in co-infected BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A,C,D,H,J,M</xref>). Also similar to LPS, CXCL2 induction was more strongly induced by co-infection than either single infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8L</xref>). TNF, IL-27, IL-1RN, CCL2 and CXCL16 were not effected by <italic>C. albicans</italic> co-infection relative to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B,E,F,G,N</xref>). CCL4 and CCL7 showed reduced levels in co-infected relative to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infected BMDMs, which is in contrast to the results for LPS where they were not affected (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8I</xref> and K to 6I and K).

This could indicate that many of the PAMPs in the cell wall are hidden and not directly available for activation by cell surface receptors on the macrophages. <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection of BMDMs resulted in a much more muted MAPK and NFκB signalling response, cytokine induction and proteomic changes compared to LPS or live <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection. This was unexpected, given that <italic>C. albicans</italic> can induce a strong inflammatory response <italic>in vivo</italic> and that macrophage depletion <italic>in vivo</italic> results in significantly increased fungal burdens and decreased survival in invasive candidiasis models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). One potential explanation for this difference would be that opsonisation of the <italic>C. albicans</italic>, either by antibodies or complement, occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that this is important for fully activating the macrophages.</p><p id="P24">The response of macrophages to <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection was found to be much weaker than that to the TLR4 agonist LPS or infection with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. While this is consistent with <italic>C. albicans</italic> being less able to activate PRR induced signalling, we also unexpectedly found that <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection was able to repress components of the macrophage response to LPS or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection. This included both IL-6 and IL-12p40 production – two cytokines known to be involved in control <italic>Candida</italic> infection <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). The production of nitric oxide is another function of macrophages that has been linked to controlling <italic>Candida</italic> infection. The production of nitric oxide in macrophages requires the enzyme NOS2, which is induced in macrophages of TLR stimulation or bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). In this study infection of macrophages with <italic>C. albicans</italic> did not induce measurable NOS2 expression. In contrast, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection or LPS treatment robustly induced NOS2 protein expression, and this was reduced by co-treatment with <italic>C. albicans</italic>, similar to what was observed for IL-6 or IL-12p40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The ability of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to reduce LPS induced nitric oxide production has been observed previously. Interestingly, this was found to require live <italic>C. albicans</italic> and direct contact of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> and the macrophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>), similar to what was observed for suppression of IL-6 here.</p><p id="P25">While <italic>C. albicans</italic> only induced a limited proteome remodelling response, this study did highlight a core set of proteins consistently regulated by <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection across two independent experiments, and it is possible some of these proteins may affect the ability of macrophage to respond to other signals. One protein that may be of note in this respect is the transcription factor ATF3. In macrophages ATF3 has been described as a negative regulator of the inflammatory response, with loss of ATF3 function resulting in elevated induction of IL-6, IL-12 and NOS2 is response to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>). In the proteomics experiments reported here, ATF3 was induced by both <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection or LPS stimulation but was one of the few proteins to show a higher induction when the macrophages were co-treated with LPS and <italic>C. albicans</italic> compared to LPS alone. This elevated ATF3 would be consistent with the reduction in IL-6, IL-12p40 and NOS2 expression in the co-treated cells relative to LPS alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Similar results were obtained in the experiments looking at <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> co-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). ATF3 is a bZip transcription factor and has been reported to inhibit transcription when it acts as dimer. Alternatively it may form heterodimers with members of the AP-1 subfamily of bZip transcription factors such as ATF2, c-Jun, JunB and JunD and in these cases it may promote transcription (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>)). Interestingly, JunB was also induced by LPS stimulation or <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection; however, this transcription factor would be less likely to mediate suppression of LPS induced proteins by <italic>Candida</italic> was work with JunB knockout macrophages indicates that it promotes rather than inhibits IL-12p40 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>).</p><p id="P26">ACOD1 was up-regulated during <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). During inflammatory macrophage activation, ACOD1 diverts cis-aconitate from the Citric Acid Cycle, producing itaconate, which has been found to limit inflammatory responses in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>). ACOD1 was up-regulated more strongly by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection or LPS compared to <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection. Intriguingly, despite being up-regulated by <italic>Candida</italic> infection on its own, ACOD1 was induced less strongly in macrophages co-treated with <italic>C. albicans</italic> and LPS compared to LPS alone. As such, while ACOD1 may have an anti-inflammatory function it is unlikely to be mediating the repressive effect of <italic>C. albicans</italic> in LPS responses.</p><p id="P27">Perhaps the most intriguing result presented here, was the broad impact on suppressing BMDM protein expression in LPS stimulation or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection. This was described both by the broad suppression of LPS or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> up-regulated proteins. WT <italic>C. albicans</italic> more strongly suppressed secreted IL-6 and IL-12p40 in co-treated conditions than <italic>Hgc1</italic> KO (yeast locked) strain of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. This could suggest that phagolysosomal stress imparted by <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphal transition may have an impact on selective cytokine suppression in BMDMs. The growth of the hyphae puts stress on the phagosome, requiring merging of other host intracellular vesicles including lysosomes, delivering reactive oxygen species, hydrogen pumps lowering the pH and cathepsins as antimicrobial defences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>). Additionally, from within the phagosome, <italic>C. albicans</italic> has its own defence mechanisms including a pH neutralising processes and pore forming proteins which together enable <italic>C. albicans</italic> to escape the phagosome and then the host cell altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Altogether, the data in this paper is consistent with the idea that <italic>C. albicans</italic> can act to evade macrophage activation and while also potentially acting to repress aspects of the macrophages inflammatory function in response to other inflammatory stimuli such as LPS or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection. This suppression requires contact between the <italic>C. albicans</italic> and the macrophages; however, its molecular mechanism is not clear. It does, however, have implications for how the host may respond to polymicrobial infections.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Mice</title><p id="P29">Mice were used for the isolation of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) at either the University of Dundee or University Aberdeen. 8 to 12 week old male C57Bl6/J mice used in Dundee were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (UK) and experiments approved by the Ethical Review and Welfare Committee at the University of Dundee.

Summary</title></caption><p>Human fungal pathogens are of increasing concern for global health due to infections in hospitalised patients, limited treatment options and increased resistance to antifungal treatments. The host inflammatory response to invasive infections like <italic>Candida albicans</italic> are important for trying to contain the pathogen. Pathogen evasion of this immune response poses a critical threat and can increase host morbidity and mortality. Macrophages are an important innate immune cell which recognises and responds to <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here, we found that <italic>in vitro</italic> macrophage signalling, secreted cytokines and the total proteomic responses to <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection was much more subtle than the macrophage responses to live bacterial infection or the bacterial outer membrane component, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Co-infection of <italic>C. albicans</italic> and bacteria suppressed selective macrophage protein expression including important inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-12p40. Thus, we describe an impressive suppressive response by <italic>C. albicans</italic> which poses a potential mechanism of enhanced immune evasion.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>BMDM proteomic response to <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection</title><p>(A-D) BMDMs were infected with <italic>C. albicans</italic> for 8 hours and then lysed for proteomic analysis.
