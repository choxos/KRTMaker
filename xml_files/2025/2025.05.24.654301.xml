One of the most fascinating examples of allelic exclusion underpins the ‘arms race’ between many pathogens and their hosts through monogenic expression of surface exposed antigens and immunoglobulins, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Among such pathogens are unicellular parasitic protozoa that cause malaria and sleeping sickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p><p id="P3">African trypanosomes are transmitted by tsetse flies, in the mammalian host, they replicate freely in the bloodstream and several extra-vascular spaces, fully exposed to the host immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. They rely on antigenic variation, a highly sophisticated virulence mechanism, for successful immune evasion. To this end, they express a single variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), which they periodically switch in a stochastic manner. The active-VSG is GPI-anchored to the membrane, forming a dense coat on their surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Notably, <italic>VSG</italic> expression is a remarkable example of ‘extreme biology’ whereby a single variant is expressed from the largest gene family in nature (&gt;2,600 genes and pseudogenes), at very high levels, with the <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA and protein being the most abundant in the cell (5–10% of the total in each case) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Despite the vast genetic repertoire, <italic>VSG</italic> genes are exclusively expressed from one of ∼15 sub-telomeric, polycistronic transcription-units, designated <italic>VSG</italic> expression-sites (<italic>VSG</italic>-ESs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. RNA polymerase-I (Pol-I) transcribes the single active-<italic>VSG</italic>-ES within a specialised nuclear body, the expression-site body (ESB), while other <italic>VSG</italic>-ESs, despite sharing a common set of DNA elements, are transcriptionally repressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Each <italic>VSG</italic>-ES also contains several expression-site-associated-genes (<italic>ESAGs</italic>). Some are surface exposed and involved in host-parasite interactions, including protecting the parasite from human serum lytic effects, modulating the host’s innate immune response, uptake of essential nutrients and contribution to antigenic variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Numerous telomere-associated factors, epigenetic regulators and chromatin remodellers have been implicated in <italic>VSG</italic> gene silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. The ESB, however, has remained largely mysterious for over 20 years. Recently, through a combination of affinity purification-based approaches as well as genetic and image-based screens, significant advances have been made. Yet only two ESB components have been identified to date: ESB-specific protein 1 (ESB1) and VSG-Exclusion protein 2 (VEX2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Both form discrete protein condensates in the mammalian-stage of the parasite but display distinct roles: ESB1 is a transcriptional activator whereas VEX2 prevents activation of silent ES-associated <italic>VSGs</italic>, rendering them positive and negative regulators of <italic>VSG</italic> expression, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Notably, besides its role as an exclusion factor, VEX2 has also been shown to play a pivotal role in mediating interchromosomal interactions associated with increased <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Specifically, VEX2 associates with the chromatin at the single active <italic>VSG</italic>-ES and forms an allele-selective interchromosomal bridge, via VEX1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], to one of the two <italic>SL</italic>-arrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. These arrays encode for the <italic>SL</italic>-RNA required for <italic>trans</italic>-splicing, a process that adds a common <italic>spliced leader</italic> sequence to each pre-mRNA and is coupled to polyadenylation in kinetoplastid parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>].</p><p id="P7">Whilst Pol-I transcription hugely contributes to such high levels of <italic>VSG</italic> expression, several post-transcriptional mechanisms also play a critical role. On the one hand, transcription and splicing are spatially integrated in the 3D nuclear space to maximise <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA processing and maturation. Indeed, the ESB was not only shown to be in close spatial proximity to the <italic>SL</italic>-array-associated body (SLAB), but also to two other nuclear bodies involved in RNA processing and maturation - a NUFIP-body and a ‘Cajal-like’ body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. In simple terms, a conglomerate of nuclear bodies, a ‘nuclear factory’, sustains high levels of <italic>VSG</italic> expression. On the other hand, both the VSG mRNA and protein are remarkably stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. The <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA contains a highly conserved ’16-mer’ sequence in its 3’UTR, which binds CFB2, a cyclin-like F-box protein, and promotes N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of the poly(A) tail. Both m6A and CFB2 greatly contribute to the stability of the <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>].</p><p id="P8">Intriguingly, it has long been known that <italic>ESAGs</italic> upstream of <italic>VSGs</italic>, despite co-transcription in the same polycistron, yield far fewer transcripts (&gt;140-fold less), reflecting the need for much higher levels of <italic>VSG</italic> expression and implicating a layer of post-transcriptional regulation within the ESB that has remained elusive for decades. Together, these observations strongly emphasise the role of post-transcriptional regulation in 1) selective <italic>VSG</italic> expression; 2) refining the levels of the active-<italic>VSG versus</italic> other expression-site-associated-genes. However, our knowledge of both the mechanisms and molecular players involved remains incomplete.</p><p id="P9">Here, we used TurboID-mediated proximity labelling combined with quantitative mass spectrometry to identify the protein network involved in post-transcriptional regulation at the ESB. We identified three new ESB components: two ESB-specific, exclusively expressed in the mammalian stage (ESB-specific proteins 2 and 3 – ESB2 / ESB3) and a third that localises to the ESB in bloodstream forms but is also expressed in the insect stage (ESB-associated protein 1 - ESAP1). We show that ESB2 is an RNA nuclease that negatively regulates <italic>ESAG</italic> transcripts. Moreover, mutation of key amino acids required for its nuclease activity significantly impacts its recruitment to the ESB, which is hierarchically dependent on VEX2, ESAP1 and ESB3. Overall, we unravelled a novel molecular mechanism that fine-tunes expression of virulence genes through specialised RNA decay in <italic>T. brucei</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>VEX proximity proteomes identify novel components of the ESB and surrounding nuclear bodies</title><p id="P10">Based on previous studies, we hypothesised that the ESB is likely to have separately assembled ‘transcriptional and processing subdomains’, which are ESB1 and VEX-dependent, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. To identify the protein network within the ESB ‘processing subdomain’ and at the interface with the SLAB, we performed proximity labelling combined with quantitative mass spectrometry using VEX2 and VEX1 as baits, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We fused the proteins of interest with TurboID, which labels proteins in living cells and is faster and more efficient than other biotin ligases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. In the case of VEX2, given its large size and that its N and C-termini are in closer spatial proximity to the ESB and the SLAB respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], we generated fusions at both termini to increase spatial resolution. We confirmed that VEX1 and VEX2 fusions biotinylated proximal proteins in the expected sub-nuclear compartments upon addition of exogenous biotin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a-e</xref>). Biotinylated material was affinity purified and submitted to mass spectrometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1f-g</xref>).</p><p id="P11">As expected, the baits and known interactors, including the histone chaperone CAF-1a-c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], were highly enriched in the ‘plus biotin’ samples. In addition and as expected, Pol-I subunits, the Pol-I elongator TDP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], all known telomere binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] and all known NUFIP body components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] were also highly enriched. We also detected SIZ1, a known small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase, consistent with the ESB lying within a highly SUMOylated focus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a-c</xref>). Moreover, we identified 49 proteins that had not been previously associated with the ESB or surrounding bodies. GO term analysis revealed that most of them were likely involved in mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1h-i</xref>), indicating that our efforts to capture the ESB ‘processing subdomain’ were successful. We then ranked 17 of those as ‘high priority hits’ based on 1) fold enrichment in the biotin-treated samples; 2) upregulation in the mammalian stage of the parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]; 3) sequence divergence in African trypanosomes; 4) nuclear speckle-like localisation in insect forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1j</xref>). Among these, 8 were hypothetical proteins of unknown function, which, at first, we designated VEX Proximity Labelling X, V2PLx (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">methods</xref> section). We endogenously tagged the 17 ‘high priority hits’ and assessed their localisation relative to the ESB, SLAB and NUFIP body using fluorescence microscopy.</p><p id="P12">We identified three novel ESB components, which we designated ESB-specific proteins 2 and 3 (<bold>ESB2</bold>; Tb927.1.1820 / V2PL02 | <bold>ESB3</bold>; Tb927.9.15850 / V2PL01) and ESB-associated protein 1 (<bold>ESAP1</bold>; Tb927.10.11600 / V2PL04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-h</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d-f</xref>). We found 4 proteins that were accumulated at the ESB, albeit not exclusively: CPSF3, a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]; BRCA2, a protein involved in homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]; Tb927.10.12030 (V2PL05), a protein of unknown function; and BDF2, a bromodomain protein involved in epigenetic regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a-i</xref>). Putative components of other assemblies within the cleavage and polyadenylation complex were also significantly enriched in the VEX proximity proteomes: CLP1 (Tb927.11.9760) and CstF1 (Tb927.10.15740) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), which integrate cleavage factor II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. Similarly, most of BDF2 known interactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>] were enriched in the ‘plus biotin’ samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3h</xref>). Notably, BDF2 had been shown to interact with the chromatin at the active-ES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Another bromodomain containing protein, BDF6, and its known interactors, EAF6 (component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex) and Tb927.10.14190 (V2PL03) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>] were enriched in the VEX proximity proteomes, but all localised to the nucleoplasm with a speckle-like profile without notable enrichment at the ESB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3h/j</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Additionally, we identified a new SLAB component, <italic>SL</italic>-associated protein 2 (SLAP2; Tb927.4.3360 / V2PL07) and 4 new NUFIP body components (NufB3-6), previously identified as KKT (kinetochore components) interacting proteins (KKIP 2/3/4/11) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We then decided to focus our functional studies on the ESB-specific factors.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>ESB2, ESB3 and ESAP1 are developmentally regulated</title><p id="P15">ESB2, ESB3 and ESAP1 form a single discrete protein condensate in G1 cells, that colocalises with the ESB in &gt;95% of the nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d-f</xref>), as confirmed by high resolution Airyscan 2 imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f-h</xref>). Structural and sequence-based domain analysis showed that ESB2 contains a C-terminal PIN domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>), which usually functions as a nuclease that cleaves single stranded RNA in a sequence- or -structure-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. ESAP1 has an RRM-like RNA binding domain and C-terminal arginine/serine (RS) repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>), both usually present in splicing regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. No domains could be identified in ESB3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Next, we assessed the expression and localisation of ESB2, ESB3 and ESAP1 in procyclic (insect) forms of <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i-j</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), where <italic>VSG</italic> expression is repressed, and therefore the ESB is absent. RNA-Seq analysis showed that ESB1, ESB2 and ESB3 mRNA levels were modestly upregulated in bloodstream forms, yet no significant changes were observed for VEX1, VEX2 and ESAP1 between the two developmental stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). At the protein level, ESAP1 was downregulated in insect forms and displayed a speckle-like profile throughout the nucleoplasm, whereas ESB2 and ESB3 could not be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i-j</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>).

Further, depletion of ESB2 and ESAP1 in procyclic forms using RNAi did not result in any fitness cost or changes to the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5e-g</xref>). Whilst this result was expected for ESB2, as we showed that it is not expressed in this developmental stage, the function of ESAP1 in procyclic forms remains unclear.</p><p id="P17">Altogether, the data shows that ESB2 and ESB3 are stage-specific, similarly to ESB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], whereas ESAP1 is expressed in both developmental stages, but ESB-associated in the bloodstream form, similarly to VEX2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] – these attributes are reflected in the names that we assigned them.

Upon induction, we observed a pronounced fitness cost in all three knockdowns, particularly for ESB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-c</xref>). Successful protein depletion was confirmed by protein blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d-f</xref>). ESB2 always displays two bands, the expected molecular weight aligns with the lower band (59.59 kDa including 12xmyc tag), but the predominant band has a higher molecular weight, suggesting post-translational modifications. Induced and non-induced cells for all three knockdowns homogeneously expressed VSG-2 (the active VSG in our strain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We then conducted RNA-Seq analysis at 24 hours post induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h-o</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). ESB2, ESB3 and ESAP1 depletion led to a striking and specific upregulation of all <italic>ESAG</italic> transcripts from the active <italic>VSG</italic>-ES (up to 11-fold), accompanied by a modest reduction in the active-<italic>VSG</italic> transcript abundance. Additionally, we also observed a significant increase in some <italic>ESAG</italic> transcripts originating from ‘silent’ <italic>VSG</italic>-ESs, without any major changes in the mRNA levels of the corresponding <italic>VSGs</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h/k</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="P20">This hinted that ESB2, ESB3 and ESAP1 somehow negatively regulate the expression of <italic>ESAGs</italic>.

To test this hypothesis, we proceeded to investigate the co-dependency between ESB2 / ESB3 / ESAP1 and other ESB-associated factors.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>ESB2 recruitment hierarchically depends on VEX2, ESAP1 and ESB3</title><p id="P21">Firstly, we focused on the ‘interactions’ between ESB2 / ESB3 / ESAP1 and assessed how they reciprocally impacted their relative mRNA and protein abundances as well as localisation to the ESB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a-e</xref>). ESAP1 localisation was not affected by ESB2 or ESB3 knockdown and was therefore ESB2 and ESB3-independent. Its protein expression was also not significantly affected by VEX2, ESB2 or ESB3 knockdowns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a/c</xref>). Next, ESB3 localisation was shown to be ESAP1-dependent, with a significant reduction in the percentage of nuclei where an ESB3 focus could be detected following ESAP1 RNAi, but without significant changes in protein abundance. Further, while ESB3 localisation was ESB2-independent, its protein levels were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a/d</xref>). Lastly, we observed that ESB2 localisation depended on both ESAP1 and ESB3; in uninduced cells, ESB2 foci could be detected in ∼97.4% of nuclei, whereas following both knockdowns, the foci could no longer be detected in ∼78% of nuclei. Additionally, in the absence of ESB3, ESB2 protein levels were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7e</xref>). Interestingly, ESB2 and ESB3 reciprocally modulate each other’s protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>); transcriptomic data showed no significant changes at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Secondly, we investigated whether the ESB integrity was impacted by ESB2, ESB3 and/or ESAP1 depletion; we used VEX2 and ESB1 knockdowns as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7f</xref>). ESB1 knockdown reduced the percentage of nuclei where an ESB could be detected by approximately 22% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). VEX2 depletion, which disrupts <italic>VSG</italic> monogenic expression, resulting in &gt;90% of cells expressing at least two VSGs, had a much more significant impact on Pol-I localisation. An ESB could only be detected in 28.6% of nuclei, and the nucleolar pool of Pol-I was also significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d-e</xref>). These results were consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. In contrast, ESB2, ESB3 and ESAP1 depletion did not significantly impact the ESB integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7f</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Thirdly, since 1) VEX2 has a major role in maintaining, possibly establishing the ESB structure; 2) ESB2, ESB3 and ESAP1 were found in proximity to VEX2; we next asked whether their localisation was VEX2-dependent. VEX2 knockdown led to a pronounced nuclear dispersion of ESB2, ESB3 and ESAP1 in &gt;64% of nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f-g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7g</xref>). Conversely, ESB2, ESB3 and ESAP1 RNAi did not impact VEX2 localisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h-i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7h</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Altogether, these observations allowed us to define a complex network of co-dependencies at the ESB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3j/k</xref>), whereby its integrity depends on both VEX2 and ESB1, albeit by independent mechanisms. Additionally, VEX2 liaises the ESB to the SLAB via VEX1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], and is required for the sequential recruitment of ESAP1, ESB3 and ESB2 to the ESB.</p><p id="P25">We then performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3l-o</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7i-k</xref>) using the RNA-Seq data generated for ESB2, ESB3 and ESAP1 RNAi cell lines in this study and previously published RNA-Seq data for VEX2 RNAi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. The most significant changes following VEX2 depletion were the upregulation of ‘silent’ <italic>ESAGs</italic> (32-fold) and ‘silent’ <italic>VSGs</italic> (dual promoter 344-fold; single promoter 42-fold), which reflect activation of silent <italic>VSG</italic>-ESs. ‘Silent’ <italic>ESAGs</italic> were also upregulated following ESB2, ESB3 and ESAP1 RNAi, albeit to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3n-o</xref>). Other Pol-I transcribed transcripts (<italic>mVSGs, procyclins, PAGs</italic>) were upregulated in all conditions, but most significantly following VEX2 depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7i-k</xref>). Notably, the most significant change following ESB2, ESB3 and ESAP1 knockdown was the upregulation of ‘active’ <italic>ESAGs</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3l</xref>). Considering the hierarchy of co-dependencies we established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3k</xref>), the modulation of ‘active’ <italic>ESAGs’</italic> mRNA abundance is likely to be mediated by ESB2; similar changes observed in the VEX2, ESB3 and ESAP1 RNAi samples are possibly indirect and cannot be differentiated from the effect of ESB2 mislocalisation and/or downregulation. Thus, we then focused our subsequent efforts on ESB2.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>ESB2 is an RNA nuclease and inactivation of key catalytic residues impacts recruitment to the ESB</title><p id="P26">Based on protein sequence, ESB2 has orthologues in other trypanosomes and <italic>Leishmania</italic>, whereas ESAP1 has no orthologues beyond trypanosome species.

However, when inspecting ESB2’s PIN domain, we found that the closest experimentally determined structural homologue occurred in human SMG6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-c</xref>), an endonuclease and critical component of the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, which is mostly known for the degradation of aberrant transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>].

Based on the fitness cost caused by its depletion, ESB2 is likely to be essential for parasite survival in a nuclease-dependent manner.</p><p id="P28">Since we could not generate viable mutants when editing the endogenous alleles, we then decided to express a tetracycline inducible ectopic copy of ESB2, either wild-type or a catalytic mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e-i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10a-b</xref>). Depending on the PIN domain, one to three of the catalytic residues may need to be mutated to completely inactivate the nuclease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. To be sure, we mutated three aspartic acids (D240A, D330A, D353A), as previously performed for human SMG6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. First, we assessed protein localisation. Overexpression of wild-type ESB2 led to its accumulation at the ESB in 85.8% of nuclei often with additional nucleoplasmic signal; the focus at the ESB was larger than the one observed when the protein was expressed at endogenous levels. To our surprise, ESB2 containing an inactive nuclease, when detected, localised solely to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e-g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10a</xref>). Notably, the triple replacement abrogates the nuclease activity and/or RNA-binding capacity but does not compromise protein folding or stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]. It is conceivable that somehow these mutations led to a conformational change that either obstructed the nuclear localisation signal (NLS) or ESB2’s ability to interact with a binding partner that transports it into the nucleus through a piggyback mechanism. We then decided to fuse this mutant version of ESB2 with a known NLS to drive it into the nucleus. The mutant could then be detected in 68.4% of nuclei, but only in 24.2% of which, it clearly accumulated at the ESB by microscopy. A wild-type version fused with the same NLS was generated as a control, and no changes to its localisation were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e/g</xref>). Protein blotting analysis showed that both wild-type and mutant versions of ESB2 were expressed at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h-i</xref>); neither had an impact on the percentage of cells where an ESB could be identified or its morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10b</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Next, we asked whether ectopic expression of wild-type or mutant ESB2 could rescue the RNAi-mediated loss of fitness. To this end, we engineered constructs with dual-inducible ESB2 RNAi and overexpression. The overexpression sequences, both wild-type and mutant were recoded so that they were refractory to the RNAi targeting sequence, which would then only target endogenous <italic>ESB2</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4j</xref>). Ectopic copies were untagged and in the case of the mutant, we fused it with an NLS to ensure that it reached the nucleus. The ectopic wild-type copy of ESB2 could rescue the RNAi phenotype, but not the catalytic mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4k</xref>). Depletion of endogenous <italic>ESB2</italic> and expression of the ectopic copies was confirmed at the RNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4l</xref>); depletion of endogenous ESB2 was also confirmed at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4m</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Collectively, these experiments show that ESB2’s nuclease activity (and/or RNA binding capacity) is required for function and recruitment to the ESB.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>ESB2 negatively regulates <italic>ESAG</italic> transcripts in a nuclease-dependent manner</title><p id="P31">We then ectopically expressed tetracycline-inducible untagged versions of either wild-type or mutant ESB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a-b</xref>) and analysed their transcriptomes. We observed that overexpression of wild-type or catalytically inactive ESB2 led to a downregulation or upregulation of <italic>ESAGs</italic> at the active-<italic>VSG</italic>-ES, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10c</xref>).

The phenotype was less penetrant than the RNAi, presumably given the mutant’s poor recruitment to the ESB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e/g</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Lastly, we wondered if ESB2’s role in modulating the expression of <italic>ESAGs</italic> was specific to this gene cohort or linked to the position within the transcription-unit. To test this, we used an RFP:PAC reporter under the control of tubulin 5’ and 3’UTRs (unrelated DNA elements), which was integrated immediately downstream of the active-ES promoter and therefore immediately upstream of the first <italic>ESAG</italic> gene, <italic>ESAG7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f-g</xref>). We found no significant differences in <italic>RFP</italic> expression between the parental line and induced and uninduced samples of ESB2 RNAi.

A plausible explanation is that this location confers mammalian-specific expression, especially considering that trypanosomes have limited control over transcription initiation in Pol-II transcription-units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. Another prevailing theory is that <italic>ESAGs</italic> are involved in host adaptation. For instance, trypanosomes, like many other pathogens, scavenge iron from their mammalian host through transferrin uptake. Their transferrin receptors are heterodimers of ESAG6 and ESAG7, whereby only one receptor is expressed at a time. Whilst sequence variation was originally thought to enable uptake of transferrin from different mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>], recent structural and biochemical studies elegantly showed that polymorphic sites are mostly found in exposed regions not involved in transferrin binding, suggesting that receptor diversification might be driven by a need for antigenic variation to prolong survival in the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Whether other <italic>ESAGs</italic> are involved in host adaptation and/or contribute to antigenic variation is yet to be determined.</p><p id="P36">Overall, despite their critical roles, <italic>ESAG</italic> gene products are required at much lower levels than the active-VSG, which forms a dense coat on the trypanosome surface.

While several post-transcriptional mechanisms have been implicated in enhancing <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA processing and stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], no mechanism had been previously linked to the regulation of <italic>ESAGs</italic>, although a recent genome wide untranslated region (UTR) screen suggested <italic>ESAGs</italic> UTRs might contain negative regulatory sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>].

Here, we identified three novel factors, ESB2, ESB3 and ESAP1, and more importantly, we identified a novel layer of post-transcriptional regulation within the ESB. These factors are developmentally regulated, raising questions as to how their expression is repressed in the insect-stage and subsequently reactivated. Additionally, we found a complex network of co-dependencies that supports our initial prediction that the ESB has separately assembled subdomains, associated with transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. ESB1 is a transcriptional activator enriched near the Pol I promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], whereas VEX2 is a multi-functional factor with a central role in maintaining ESB integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], preventing activation of silent <italic>VSG</italic>-ESs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>] and coordinating post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. The latter include: 1) enhancing <italic>VSG</italic> mRNA processing through spatial proximity to the <italic>SL</italic>-array via VEX1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]; and 2) assembling the ESAP1 / ESB3 / ESB2 axis for negative regulation of <italic>ESAGs</italic> expression.

This restricted access to mRNA processing machinery aligns with previous reports that the low amounts of transcripts generated from silent <italic>VSG</italic>-ESs are not efficiently polyadenylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>]. These observations are consistent with a role for VEX2 in the spatial integration of <italic>VSG</italic> transcription and RNA processing in the 3D nuclear space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</p><p id="P38">Interestingly, while NMD is dispensable in <italic>T. brucei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>] and none of VEX2, ESAP1, ESB3 or ESB2 are homologues of its major regulators, they do share structural features with some of its components. VEX2 has an Up-frameshift-1 (UPF1)-like helicase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], ESAP1 has an UPF3-like RRM domain and ESB2 has an SMG6-like PIN domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). NMD is widely known as an RNA surveillance pathway responsible for the degradation of aberrant transcripts in metazoa, such as those containing premature stop codons. However, it has been increasingly associated with gene expression regulation to facilitate cellular responses to environmental changes and genome maintenance. In fact, in mammals, ∼10% of its target transcripts are unmutated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>] and recent studies have showed that UPF and SMG proteins, originally discovered to function in NMD, also have roles in other pathways. For instance, UPF1 has been implicated in telomere homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>] and specialised mRNA decay pathways, including regulated degradation of replication-dependent histone mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>].

While some nucleases can be highly specific to a single RNA target, others are sequence independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>]. However, the fundamental principles of substrate recognition and cleavage by PIN containing proteins remain elusive, mostly challenged by the difficulty in stabilising the protein-RNA complex for structural studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>].</p><p id="P40">Therefore, the mechanism underpinning ESB2-mediated <italic>ESAG</italic> transcript regulation remains to be determined. Since eukaryotic PIN domains tend to be part of larger protein complexes, it is conceivable that the interaction with a binding partner could either direct substrate specificity and/or activate the nuclease that is otherwise kept in an ‘off state’. It is tempting to speculate that ESB3 could be one such interacting partner, given that orthologues can only be found in trypanosomes that possess <italic>ESAGs</italic> and the fact that ESB2/ESB3 modulate each other’s abundance. Further, ESB2 displays a higher molecular weight than predicted, consistent with the presence of post-translational modifications, which remain undefined.

The primers annealed outside the recoded region amplifying both endogenously and ectopically expressed <italic>ESB2</italic> (left hand side) or in the recoded region amplifying only ectopically expressed <italic>ESB2</italic> (right hand side). One-way ANOVA; ns, non-significant; **** <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001. <bold>c-e</bold>, RNA-Seq analysis of ESB2<sup>WT</sup> and ESB2<sup>Mut-NLS</sup> overexpression at 72 hours post induction. Three biological replicates were used as well as parental and uninduced controls. <bold>c-d</bold>, scatter plots comparing average gene expression in the parental line (in RPKMs, reads per kilobase per million) with fold change in expression in ESB2<sup>WT</sup> overexpression over parental (<bold>c</bold>) and ESB2<sup>Mut-NLS</sup> overexpression over parental (<bold>d</bold>). <bold>e</bold>, heatmap depicting the Log<sub>2</sub>FC within the active-ES (BES1) for induced samples of ESB2<sup>WT</sup> and ESB2<sup>Mut-NLS</sup> overexpression compared to ESB2 RNAi – all normalised against the parental line. Hierarchical clustering – average linkage, Euclidean distance. <italic>ESAG2</italic> and <italic>ESAG11</italic> were omitted as their expression could not be detected in all replicates in the parental line when applying high stringency mapping. <bold>f-g</bold>, analysis of cell lines containing an RFP:PAC fluorescent reporter at the active <italic>VSG</italic>-ES before and after ESB2 RNAi. <bold>f</bold>, determination of <italic>RFP, ESAG7</italic> and <italic>ESB2</italic> mRNA levels by RT-qPCR. Two-tailed paired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test; ns, non-significant; ** <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01; **** <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001. <bold>i</bold>, fluorescence microscopy analysis. DNA was stained with DAPI (cyan); scale bars: 2 μm. For all RT-qPCR experiments (<bold>b/f</bold>), the expression of the gene of interest was normalised against actin (housekeeper gene) and displayed as fold change in relation to the parental cell line. Each experiment was conducted using three technical replicates per condition, which were averaged. Three independent clones of ESB2 overexpression or RNAi were tested; in <bold>f</bold>, two independent experiments are depicted. The floating bar graphs span between minimum and maximum values, centre lines correspond to the mean, all datapoints are displayed. <bold>h</bold>, cartoon depicting the nuclear architecture of <italic>T. brucei</italic> bloodstream forms, including all known components of the ESB and the VEX-mediated interaction with one of the <italic>SL</italic>-arrays. ESB1 is a transcriptional activator required for transcription at the active-ES. VEX2 is an exclusion factor, which prevents activation of silent <italic>VSGs</italic> and therefore a negative regulator. ESAP1 and ESB3 are required for ESB2 recruitment, which ultimately negatively regulates <italic>ESAGs</italic> expression.
