A compromised, leaky BRB is a hallmark of vision-threatening retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) that affect millions of persons worldwide. Strategies to enhance BRB integrity hold promise as therapeutic interventions to prevent vision loss. Previous studies identified Netrin-1 (<italic>NTN1</italic>) as a key regulator of BRB stability and revealed reduced Netrin-1 signaling in DR patients, suggesting that Netrin-1 supplementation could help preserve BRB function and prevent disease progression. Herein, we used genetic <italic>NTN1</italic> overexpression to investigate effects on BRB development and maintenance. We show that global <italic>NTN1</italic> overexpression converted leaky vessels at the P5 angiogenic front into a non-leaky state. In pathological settings, <italic>NTN1</italic> overexpression reinforced BRB integrity in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), improving electroretinogram (ERG) amplitudes and rescued vascular leak in laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Mechanistically, we determined that <italic>NTN1</italic> overexpression minimally and transiently affected retinal angiogenesis in an Unc5b independent manner, while Netrin’s barrier stabilizing effects were Unc5b dependent. These findings establish Netrin-1 as a promising therapeutic target for preventing BRB breakdown in retinal vascular diseases and suggest that reinforcing the Netrin-1/Unc5b signaling pathway may provide a strategy to selectively stabilize the BRB.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Blood-retina barrier (BRB)</kwd><kwd>Diabetic retinopathy (DR)</kwd><kwd>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)</kwd><kwd>Netrin-1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The blood-retina barrier (BRB) is a highly selective vascular barrier that tightly regulates the movement of molecules between the bloodstream and the neural retina, thereby maintaining the specialized microenvironment necessary for retinal function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The BRB consists of an inner barrier formed by retinal endothelial cells (ECs) and an outer barrier formed by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, both of which utilize tight junctions to restrict permeability while allowing controlled nutrient and waste exchange. Disruption of the integrity of the inner BRB accelerates the development of multiple diseases including diabetic retinopathy (DR) and wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by leading to vascular leak, fluid accumulation and inflammation that cause neuronal damage and vision loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Similar breakdown of the blood-brain barrier is involved in diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease and stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">DR is the leading cause of vision loss worldwide, where functional impairments in vision are driven by retinal blood vessel leakage and macular edema<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. More than 30% of patients with diabetes are reported to have DR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Current treatments include laser photocoagulation, intravitreal steroids, and frequent intravitreal injections of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, alongside blood sugar control. While effective, anti-VEGF therapies require repeated injections and can have off-target effects on retinal neuronal cells that express the signal-transducing VEGFR2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Patients receiving systemic anti-VEGF treatments reported side effects, including hypertension, bleeding, vascular injury, proteinuria, impaired wound healing, and gastrointestinal perforation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. To circumvent these side-effects, anti-VEGF therapy for DR and AMD is administered intravitreally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is another major retinal disease that leads to vision loss. Two distinct forms, dry and wet AMD are distinguished. Dry AMD, the more common form, is characterized by progressive thickening of Bruch’s membrane beneath the RPE, alongside gradual degeneration of photoreceptors, the RPE itself and the underlying choriocapillaris. This progressive damage to the surrounding tissue results in disruption of the BRB, contributing to retinal ischemia and inflammation. The more severe, wet form of AMD is driven by choroidal neovascularization (CNV), where abnormal blood vessels from the choroid invade the RPE and extend into the subretinal space, leading to fluid accumulation, increased vascular permeability, and vision loss. The breakdown of the BRB in wet AMD promotes the leakage of fluid and proteins from newly formed blood vessels, exacerbating retinal damage and accelerating disease progression.</p><p id="P5">The pathogenesis of AMD remains poorly understood and current treatment options are limited. In wet AMD, frontline therapeutics include intravitreal injections of VEGF inhibitors, such as bevacizumab and ranibizumab, which target pathological neovascularization and vascular leakage, are the mainstay of therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. More recently, bispecific antibodies targeting both VEGF and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) have been developed to improve treatment efficacy and reduce the frequency of injections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Preclinical treatment with antibodies blocking the Slit2 receptors Roundabout1 and 2 reduces ocular inflammation and synergizes with anti-VEGF treatment in preventing mouse OIR and CNV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. However, despite these and other advances, AMD remains a major cause of irreversible blindness, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies.</p><p id="P6">Netrin-1 is a key axon guidance molecule that has emerged as a crucial regulator of angiogenesis and BRB integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, and its dysregulation is implicated in DR pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Netrin-1 enhances retinal revascularization in OIR and diabetic models, while its knockdown using shRNA- reduced pathological angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Netrin-1 also modulates vascular permeability in DR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. MMP-9 cleaves Netrin-1 into a bioactive VI-V fragment that increases vascular permeability and diabetic macular edema, and inhibiting MMP-9 prevents this pathological permeability. In contrast, full length Netrin-1 preserves endothelial integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>; thus underscoring the therapeutic potential of preserving Netrin-1 signaling in retinal vascular disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">We previously demonstrated that Netrin-1 maintains BRB integrity by activating endothelial Unc5b and enhancing Norrin–β-catenin signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of retinal ECs identified a BRB gene expression program that is regulated by Netrin-1 and Unc5b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Additionally, UNC5B is essential for maintaining stability at endothelial cell–cell junctions in HUVECs and in retinal plexus branching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. These findings reveal the essential role of Netrin-1 in maintaining BRB integrity and suggest that targeting Netrin-1 signaling may restore barrier function and prevent vascular leakage, offering a novel therapeutic approach for DR and related neurovascular diseases.</p><p id="P8">Beyond the retina, Netrin-1 improves vascular integrity in the aged bone marrow, supporting hematopoietic recovery, while its loss increases vascular leak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Netrin-1 is upregulated in cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and its blockade using an anti-Netrin-1 antibody reduced human endometrial cancer tumor progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. It has also shown to inhibit metastasis and improve survival in mouse pancreatic adenocarcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. In diabetic models, Netrin-1 administration enhances insulin release from β-cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. In atherosclerosis, Netrin-1 expression by lesional macrophages inhibits their emigration, contributing to plaque progression and chronic inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Blocking Netrin-1 signaling in these models promoted macrophage egress and reduced atherosclerotic burden, highlighting its dual role in both vascular stability and inflammatory retention. Together, these findings suggest that Netrin-1 plays a broader systemic role in vascular and tissue homeostasis, raising the possibility that modulating its signaling may offer therapeutic benefits across multiple disease contexts, including those affecting the retina.</p><p id="P9">In this work, we used genetic <italic>NTN1</italic> overexpression mice to determine effects on BRB integrity. We also employed the Oxygen Induced Retinopathy (OIR) and Laser-Induced CNV models of pathological leak, and we investigated the effect of <italic>NTN1</italic> overexpression on OIR induced vision impairment. We found that overexpressing Netrin1 stabilized the BRB in both physiological and pathological models of permeability, and improved vision recovery in OIR. In addition, we found that <italic>NTN1</italic> overexpression minimally and transiently affected retinal angiogenesis in an Unc5b independent manner, while its BRB stabilizing effects were Unc5b dependent. Together, these findings position Netrin-1-Unc5b signaling agonists as promising therapeutic candidates for restoring vascular integrity and visual function in retinal diseases characterized by BRB breakdown.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mouse models</title><p id="P10">All animal experiments were performed under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care Use Committee of Yale University.

Retinas of mice exposed to 75% oxygen (hyperoxia) between P7 to P12 develop vaso-obliteration and a capillary free avascular area in the center of the retina. Upon return to room air at P12, the relative hypoxia induced release of excessive amounts of angiogenic factors, which results in pathological sprouting and neovascular tuft formation, accompanied by leaky vasculature and hemorrhage. When <italic>NTN1iGOF</italic> was induced by TAM administration during the revascularization process, retinas displayed decreased avascular areas and decreased neovascular tuft areas compared to littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-C</xref>). This indicates a shift toward productive angiogenesis, facilitating revascularization, while simultaneously suppressing pathological angiogenesis, which is characterized by disorganized, aberrant vessel growth in neovascular tufts (NVTs). To understand this process better, we focused on OIR tip cells that express Podocalyxin as well as high levels of Esm1 and low levels of Mfsd2a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Podocalyxin+ tip cells in the <italic>NTN1</italic><sup><italic>fl/WT</italic></sup> control OIR sprouting regions were positive for the tip-cell marker Esm1 with limited Mfsd2a expression, but Mfsd2a expression was significantly increased in <italic>Ntn1iGOF</italic> retinas, suggesting improved barrier stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D,E</xref>). Additionally, while control littermate retinas demonstrated the presence of Plvap and diminished expression of Claudin-5 in the arterioles and venules of P17 OIR retinas, littermate <italic>NTN1</italic>iGOF retinas had increased Claudin-5 expression and suppressed Plvap expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F,G</xref>). OIR retinas typically demonstrated leakage of Ter-119+ red blood cells as was seen in control <italic>NTN</italic><sup><italic>fl/WT</italic></sup> retinas and quantified by measuring the mean intensity times area of Ter-119+ staining.
