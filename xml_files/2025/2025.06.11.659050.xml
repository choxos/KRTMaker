Due to intricate disulphide bridge patterns, they are often challenging to produce in standard laboratory settings, which limits engineering approaches to manipulate their structure-function properties. Given the low cost, wide accessibility, and versatility of recombinant expression systems for protein production, we set out to establish a straightforward high-yield strategy across a broad panel of peptide toxins from snakes, spiders and scorpions.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Experimental Approach</title><p id="P2">13 toxin DNA sequences were genetically fused to the C-terminus of either bivalent or monovalent human IgG1 antibody fragment crystallisable (Fc) domain sequences and expressed recombinantly from mammalian Expi293F cells. Affinity-purified proteins were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Function was assessed by Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux assays on CN21 cells, or whole-cell electrophysiology on human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Immunocytochemistry using HEK293T cells and mouse DRG neurons assessed Fc-toxin fusion binding.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Key Results</title><p id="P3">Monovalent Fc-toxin fusions consistently yielded 1-6 mg of pure, non-proteolytically cleaved protein from 20-70 ml cultures for several toxin types, including three-finger toxins from snakes, inhibitory cystine knot (ICK) toxins from spiders, and α-toxins from scorpions, substantially surpassing the performance of unfused toxins or bivalent Fc-toxin fusions which gave low or no yield. Snake toxins targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors retained high single digit nanomolar inhibitory potency. Spider and scorpion toxins targeting the voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 retained pharmacological function and selectivity across a panel of five Na<sub>v</sub> subtypes, albeit with reduced potencies that did not exceed ~70 nM.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Conclusions and Implications</title><p id="P4">We present a strategy for straightforward robust production of pure, monodisperse, and functional animal venom-derived toxins.

Many are potent and selective modulators of ion channels, such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels (Na<sub>v</sub>s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kalia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cardoso and Lewis, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Wulff et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Robinson and Vetter, 2020</xref>). Given that ion channels are high-value drug targets and achieving small molecule selectivity remains challenging, peptide toxins have sparked considerable interest to advance both basic research and scaffold-based drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Montnach et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Nguyen et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Many of the best characterised venom-derived peptide toxins possess intricate arrangements of disulphide bridges. These include, for example, snake venom three-finger toxins, such as α-cobratoxin (αCbTx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bourne et al., 2005</xref>), spider venom toxins that harbour inhibitory cystine knot (ICK) motifs, including protoxin-II (ProTxII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Xu et al., 2019</xref>), and scorpion venom α-toxins, like AahII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Clairfeuille et al., 2019</xref>). The disulphide bridges endow peptide toxins with high biochemical stability but constitute a barrier to production from recombinant cell expression platforms due to disulphide scrambling causing misfolding and loss of potency relative to synthetically produced toxins. Typical recombinant production approaches involve fusing toxins to carrier proteins that enhance solubility, hence improving yields, and/or prolonging toxin plasma half-life for <italic>in vivo</italic> applications. Examples of reported fusion partners include maltose-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cardoso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Rahnama et al., 2017</xref>), serum albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Minassian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Neff et al., 2020</xref>), small ubiquitin-related modifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Sermadiras et al., 2013</xref>), and antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>). Specific additional advantages of antibody fusions include: straightforward polyclonal fluorescence labelling; fragment crystallisable (Fc) chain dimerization to boost avidity; combinatorial toxin presentation to shift selectivity and/or potency; and a range of fusion/conjugation locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Biswas et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Here, we establish a straightforward strategy for the robust, high-yield production of Fc-toxin fusions. We found that monovalent Fc constituted a robust scaffold for toxin production across a variety of snake, spider and scorpion-derived peptide toxins, greatly exceeding yields versus bivalent Fc, and achieving mg quantities from only 20-70 ml cell cultures. Snake toxins retained high potency against nAChRs, with single digit nanomolar IC<sub>50</sub>s. Spider and scorpion toxins retained pharmacological function and selectivity across a panel of five Na<sub>v</sub> subtypes. Potency, albeit reduced, often remained in the EC<sub>50</sub> or IC<sub>50</sub> range of 100 nM to single digit micromolar. The Fc-toxin fusions exhibited monodispersity in chromatography and remained active when kept refrigerated for over one month, while also being amenable to snap freeze-thawing for long-term storage.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Bullet Point Summary</title><sec id="S7"><title>What is already known?</title><list list-type="bullet" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P8">Previous studies provide examples of animal toxins that can be expressed recombinantly as fusion proteins.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="S8"><title>What does this study add?</title><list list-type="bullet" id="L2"><list-item><p id="P9">A methodical study on the impact of toxin valency on Fc-toxin fusion yields.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P10">A straightforward approach for robust recombinant production of distinct snake, spider and scorpion toxins.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="S9"><title>What is the clinical significance?</title><list list-type="bullet" id="L3"><list-item><p id="P11">Enabling toxin production empowers toxin engineering approaches to develop pharmacological tools and therapeutic leads against ion channels.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Fc-Toxin Fusion Construct Design</title><p id="P12">Toxin sequences used in this study are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. For the bivalent fusions, the human immunoglobulin γ1 heavy chain wild-type protein sequence (Uniprot P0DOX5 entry 1-448 QVQL…LSPGK) was used as a template, with the following modifications. The N-terminus was truncated to begin at Lys218 in the upper hinge of the chain, so it only encoded the Fc region (218-448 KSCD…LSPGK) but retained its ability to dimerise. Three point mutations, known to attenuate Fc-dependent effector functions (L234F, L235E, and P331S), were also incorporated to generate the final bivalent Fc-toxin construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Oganesyan et al., 2008</xref>). For the monovalent fusions, this was modified to allow for heterodimerisation through two additional, separate, knobs-into-holes mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Ridgway et al., 1996</xref>), which yielded two complementary constructs: Fc-knob (T366Y) and Fc-hole (Y407T). Toxins were subcloned into the pHLsec vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aricescu et al., 2006</xref>) between the N-terminal signal sequence and a double stop codon. Depending on downstream requirements, the N-terminal signal sequence was followed by no fusion partner and a His8 purification tag before the toxin, or bivalent Fc plus a (GGS)<sub>12</sub> linker and His8 before the toxin, or monovalent Fc-knob plus a (GGS)<sub>12</sub> linker and His8 before the toxin, or bivalent Fc plus a (GGS)<sub>12</sub> linker and His8, followed by the toxin and a C-terminal monoVenus fluorophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Nagai et al., 2002</xref>). The Fc-hole construct was subcloned after the signal sequence with no fusion partners or purification tags.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Recombinant Expression, Purification &amp; Yield Quantification</title><p id="P13">Twenty-five ml batches of Expi293F suspension cells (Thermofisher) were grown to densities of 4×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in Expi Expression Medium (EEM, Gibco), shaking at 130 rpm, 37°C, 8% CO<sub>2</sub> and transfected with 50 μg DNA and 200 μg PEI Max (Polysciences). Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 50 ml fresh media the following day, and supernatant harvested 5 days later with cell viability typically at ~70-80%. For bivalent/unfused expression, a plasmid encoding the bivalent Fc-toxin fusion or the unfused toxin was transfected alone. For monovalent expression, plasmids encoding the monovalent Fc-knob toxin, plus unfused Fc-hole, were co-transfected at a 1:1 ratio. Toxins were purified by addition of 5 ml binding buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.8, 0.3 M NaCl) and 0.4 ml nickel agarose resin, gently rotated at 4°C for 1 hour. All purification buffers were supplemented with 0.02% (v/v) pluronic F-127 (Sigma-Aldrich). After washing and imidazole elution (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.25 M imidazole), final concentrations and total recombinant protein yields of the purified Fc-toxin fusions were calculated by measuring absorbance at 280 nm and correcting for extinction coefficients and elution volumes. For downstream experiments, toxins were concentrated and buffer-exchanged by ultrafiltration using 10 kDa cut-off membranes (Amicon) into extracellular electrophysiology solution (see below for composition). Average yields, for successfully expressed toxins, were ~20 μg or ~40 μg per ml of harvested EEM, for bivalent and monovalent fusions, respectively. Stocks were concentrated to 100 μM and kept refrigerated for up to one month before use.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Analysis of Purity, Dimerisation, Monodispersity &amp; Storage Conditions</title><p id="P14">To estimate the molecular mass and gauge the purity of the products obtained from recombinant expression and purification, all Fc-toxin fusions were run on SDS-PAGE. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE was used to corroborate that both bivalent and monovalent fusions remained in Fc dimer formats, while reducing SDS-PAGE was used to confirm that bivalent and monovalent fusions were composed of homodimers and heterodimers, respectively. To assess sample monodispersity and aggregation propensity, all monovalent fusions and the highest-yielding bivalent fusion were run on size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), using 70 μg loads and a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer containing 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 0.02% (v/v) pluronic F-127. To investigate suitable storage conditions for all Fc-toxin fusions, a subset of the monovalent toxins was snap-frozen at 100 μM, or 5 μM, or 100 μM with a 20% (v/v) glycerol spike, and then thawed once. Samples were run on SEC alongside a non-frozen, refrigerated control to evaluate the effect of different snap freeze-thawing conditions on toxin quality, as indicated by SEC main peak size, monodispersity, and aggregation.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Bivalent Na<sub>v</sub> Toxin Function: Whole-Cell Patchliner Electrophysiology</title><p id="P15">Whole cell recordings of Na<sup>+</sup> currents were made from a previously established HEK293 cell line stably expressing human Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 with C-terminal HAT and FLAG epitope tags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kanellopoulos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Salvage et al., 2023</xref>) on a four-channel automated patch clamp system (Patchliner Quattro, Nanion Technologies).

Baseline signals were recorded for 10 seconds, before 50 μl 4X agonist solution, consisting of NMG buffer with 40 μM acetylcholine chloride (ThermoScientific), was injected and responses were recorded for the next 60 seconds.

This involved &gt; 80 total purifications (not including the larger scale 50-100 ml purifications required to prepare toxins for electrophysiology experiments), which represent larger statistical datasets. Statistical comparison per toxin was not performed because the aim was not to compare by individual toxin but to compare the FcBiV and FcMoV platforms as a whole, which had n = 39 purifications each. Statistical comparison was therefore performed by category (snake, spider, scorpion) using two-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests that allowed for analysis of non-parametric datasets with unequal variances. Toxin monodispersity by SEC to evaluate sample quality and effects of storage conditions was a preliminary study, n = 1 per toxin storage condition, to inform potential users on considerations for best maintenance of toxins. Thus, it did not require statistical analysis. Nevertheless, as for the purifications, this study was performed on 10 toxins, requiring 28 SEC runs; hence, it overall constituted a substantial dataset for informed consideration. All electrophysiological data were obtained with ≥ n = 5 separate cells. Statistical comparison of Patchliner FcBiV construct data used paired t-test, while Qube FcMoV construct data used Welch’s ANOVA test for global comparison of multiple means from parametric datasets with unequal variances, followed by post-hoc analysis with Dunnet’s T3 multiple comparisons test for individual comparisons to the control conditions. The DRG electrophysiology FcMoV-ProTxII data used one-way ANOVA test. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux assay for snake toxins acting at nAChRs was limited to n = 4 separate experiments due to limited sample stocks of valuable synthetic and purified proteins, and statistical analysis was therefore not performed.

Human codon-optimised synthetic DNAs encoding native toxin sequences were used for this study, but with modifications in some instances to mimic amidation at the C-termini (HwTxIV, HwTxIV-m3), to enhance potency (HwTxIV-m3), to modify selectivity (JzTxV), or to remove N-linked glycan sites (AahII, HwTxIV, HwTxIV-m3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P50">A preliminary expression trial of the 13 unfused toxins from transiently transfected Expi293F cells revealed detectable toxin protein bands secreted in the media for only three of 13 toxins: 2/3 snake toxins, 0/6 spider toxins, and 1/4 scorpion toxins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A-C</xref>). We therefore decided to investigate toxin fusion to a bivalent Fc (FcBiV) scaffold due to its high stability and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lo et al., 1998</xref>).

Thus, although different to the situation in nature where the Fc is attached to the C-terminus of the antibody variable domains that target antigens, in this case, to minimise risk of steric hindrance to function, the Fc was fused to the toxin N-terminus. Furthermore, RNA translation of the Fc domain before the toxin domain might help to stabilise toxin folding, hence boosting FcBiV toxin expression.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Expression, Purification, Yield Quantification &amp; Function of Bivalent Fc-Toxins</title><p id="P52">The FcBiV toxins were recombinantly expressed from Expi293F cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-B</xref>) and the resultant media run on reducing SDS-PAGE to visualise Fc-toxin monomers.

For the remaining eight, with the exception of the two FcBiV HwTxIV-variant spider toxins, which both exceeded yields of 20 μg from 1 ml media (n = 3, across three separate transfections and purifications, n = 6 total results), the other FcBiV toxins yielded at or below 12 μg from 1 ml media (n = 3, across three separate transfections and purifications, n = 39 total results). The eight toxins giving detectable yields were all highly pure when run as intact dimers on non-reducing SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). At yields of 12 μg or less from 1 ml media, 80 ml or more of expression media is required to purify 1 mg of Fc-toxin fusion.

We first verified that the FcMoV format itself does not unduly impact expression and purification yield versus the FcBiV format. Unfused FcMoV and FcBiV formats both yielded ~150 μg purified protein from 1 ml media (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A-B</xref>).

It could also independently verify the inactivation profile per cell and set an appropriate 50% inactivation voltage individually tailored to each cell, thus accounting for variability to ensure fair comparison of toxin effects across all tested cells, both for inhibition of Na<sub>v</sub> activation (spider toxins) and for inhibition of Na<sub>v</sub> fast inactivation resulting in potentiation (scorpion toxins) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bosmans and Swartz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ahmadi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P61">For evaluation we used a CHO cell line stably expressing human Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, a target of interest for the treatment of chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Eagles et al., 2020</xref>). We first evaluated the toxins both for percentage modulation and sensitivity. Five of the six FcMoV spider toxins produced significant inhibition versus the no toxin control, ranging from 70-100 % at the highest dose tested (1-10 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C-E</xref>). Only FcMoV-HpTxI failed to inhibit Na<sup>+</sup>-mediated currents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>). The five active toxins retained IC<sub>50</sub>s in the nanomolar to single digit micromolar range despite being produced recombinantly from mammalian cells and being fused to Fc domains, although potency was reduced by two to four orders of magnitude versus synthetic counterparts. ProTxII and HwTxIV IC<sub>50</sub>s were 190 ± 40 nM and 3550 ± 970 nM, respectively, representing 80-fold and 290-fold losses of potency relative to synthetic counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F-G, 6I</xref>). HwTxIV-m3 (70 ± 10 nM), JzTxV (468 ± 80 nM), and Pn3a (1710 ± 230 nM) IC<sub>50</sub>s represented reductions in potency of 180-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Revell et al., 2013</xref>), 740-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Moyer et al., 2018</xref>) and 2,140-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Deuis et al., 2017</xref>), respectively, versus published values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H-I</xref>). For the three FcMoV scorpion toxins, OD1 achieved significant potentiation of ~140 % at the highest dose tested (10 μM), albeit with potency reduced 3,470-fold relative to its synthetic counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6J-M</xref>). Recombinant TsV and AahII failed to elicit significant modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6J, 6M</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P62">We subsequently evaluated durability of activity by testing the four most effective spider toxins, HwTxIV-m3, JzTxV, Pn3a and ProTxII, when prepared fresh versus after being stored at 0°C for one month. Potency is retained within 3-fold during this timeframe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A-D</xref>). We also tested the selectivity profiles of these four toxins by measuring inhibition against five human Na<sub>v</sub> isoforms stably expressed in CHO cells: Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, Na<sub>v</sub>1.5, Na<sub>v</sub>1.6, Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, and Na<sub>v</sub>1.8. Consistent with previous reports for synthetic toxins, all four FcMoV toxin fusions were most potent on Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). HwTxIV-m3 exhibited 6-fold selectivity for Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 over Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 and was completely selective versus Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 or Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). Up to concentrations of 10 μM, JzTxV and Pn3a were completely selective for Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 over the other isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F-G</xref>). ProTxII exhibited no inhibition of Na<sub>v</sub>1.5, and IC<sub>50</sub>s against Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 increased 30-fold, 90-fold, and 30-fold, respectively, such that at 1 μM, ProTxII achieved near-full inhibition of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 versus almost no inhibition of other tested isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7H</xref>). To demonstrate that the recombinantly produced FcMoV-toxins can be used to modulate physiological neuronal excitability, we tested ProTxII on dissociated DRG cultures, which express Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channels along with other Na<sub>V</sub> subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>). Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 has a key role in controlling subthreshold amplification and action potential initiation in rodent and human DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Rush et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alexandrou et al., 2016</xref>). Application of ProTxII (1 μM) led to a significant reduction in action potential firing without a reduction in amplitude, consistent with selective inhibition of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7I-K</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Monovalent Fc-ProTxII Staining of HEK Cells and Dorsal Root Ganglia Neurons</title><p id="P63">Given the ability of the recombinantly produced Fc-toxin fusions to modulate ion channel function we also investigated these reagents for direct visualisation of targets. For this we chose FcMoV-ProTxII against Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, which could be benchmarked against synthetic fluorescent ATTO488-ProTxII, recently developed to address the shortage of good antibodies for visualisation of this subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Montnach et al., 2021</xref>). Staining with FcMoV-ProTxII plus a fluorescent secondary Alexa Fluor™ (AF) 568 antibody versus ATTO488-ProTxII on the HEK293T Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 stable cell line or naïve HEK293T cells revealed no specific detectable signal from either probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A-B</xref>). Notably, the presence of the Fc domain on the FcMoV-ProTxII means the toxin signal can be amplified through polyclonal binding. To take advantage of this we introduced an additional tertiary AF568 antibody binding step (see Methods). This combination resulted in a significantly higher specific fluorescence against the HEK293T Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 stable cell line than naïve HEK cells, observable as surface distributed halos by confocal imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C-E</xref>). We subsequently applied this strategy to staining of dissociated DRG neurons and again observed higher fluorescence versus a negative control of secondary/tertiary antibody mix alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8F-G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S30" sec-type="discussion | conclusions"><title>Discussion And Conclusions</title><p id="P64">Toxins rich in disulphide bridges are potent and selective modulators of ion channels, but as we show here, they are typically poorly expressed recombinantly from mammalian cells. We selected a panel of 13 snake, spider and scorpion toxins to assess yields and function when fused to Fc domains. Whilst FcBiV toxin fusions generally improved expression, protein production remained inconsistent. In contrast, FcMoV toxin fusions exhibited robust expression, with 11 of 13 toxins giving final purified yields of greater than 15 μg from 1 ml of media, meaning mg quantities can be obtained from cultures of only 20-70 ml of Expi293F cells. The FcMoV format boosted yields across the panel while simultaneously enabling production of bioactive toxins that would have otherwise eluded functional characterisation due to poor expression, such as JzTxV and ProTxII. We hypothesise that improved FcMoV toxin yields result from the combination of excellent Fc domain expression and improved stability engendered by reducing toxin copy load from two to one. This is highlighted by the observation that FcBiV-HwTxIV but not FcMoV-HwTxIV toxins precipitated during storage at 0°C within weeks of purification. Despite this, the FcMoV format was not sufficient to stabilise expression of highly hydrophobic ant toxins that do not possess disulphide bridges and so will not be useful for every toxin type that exists in nature.</p><p id="P65">SEC analysis revealed that the fused toxin, despite only representing a small proportion of the total protein mass, exerted strong and unpredictable effects on the monodispersity and aggregation propensity of the Fc fusion constructs. However, FcMoV toxin monodispersity was consistently retained at 100 μM during storage at 0°C for at least one month, and some samples were shown to tolerate snap freeze-thawing at 100 μM, whilst others could tolerate snap-freezing by including 20% glycerol or by reducing the concentration to 5 μM. Furthermore, bioactivity was also retained after being kept at 0°C for one month. These findings support the suitability of the FcMoV toxins for long-term storage and utilisation.</p><p id="P66">Functional effects were observed for the majority of FcMoV toxins, with maximal effects closely matching synthetic toxins. However, potency was reduced. We hypothesise that the reduction in sensitivity is due, at least in part, to a proportion of the toxins experiencing disulphide scrambling during folding in the recombinant expression system, hence rendering a proportion of the molecules inactive. The FcMoV snake toxins were least affected, with potency losses within one order of magnitude, whereas spider toxins showed two to four orders of magnitude reductions in potency and scorpion toxins showed four orders of magnitude losses in potency. This level of reduction in sensitivity means that some toxins such as HpTxI, which has a low sensitivity even in synthetic form (IC<sub>50</sub> ~0.5 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>) do not exhibit activity at doses up to 10 μM, which were the highest tested in this study. The improved retention of potency for snake toxins could suggest that the rigid three-finger motifs provide stricter positioning of the cysteine residues to guide accurate bridge formation. Alternatively, perhaps the more similar mammalian cell expression environment to that of snakes, which are also vertebrates, better supports folding of snake toxins versus toxins from more distantly related species such as arachnids. However, the folding success rate does not appear to be related to bridge density because snake toxin bridge density is ~1 bridge/15 residues, in between that of spider toxin bridge density at ~1 bridge/12 residues, and that of scorpion toxin density at ~1 bridge/16 residues.</p><p id="P67">In the FcMoV spider toxin selectivity trials, HwTxIV-m3, JzTxV, Pn3a, and ProTxII all exhibited selective inhibition of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 over other Na<sub>v</sub> isoforms tested. Notably, three from four of these toxins (JzTxV, Pn3a, and ProTxII) could only be produced with good yield (&gt;15 μg from 1 ml media) in the FcMoV format, rather than FcBiV format. HwTxIV-m3 was marginally selective for Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 over Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.6, and selective against Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.8. In contrast, JzTxV and Pn3a were fully selective for Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 in the concentration ranges tested, while ProTxII was at least 30-fold selective for Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 over Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, Na<sub>v</sub>1.6, and Na<sub>v</sub>1.8, and selective against Na<sub>v</sub>1.5. These selectivity trends match the literature well in all cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Schmalhofer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Xiao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Revell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Deuis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Moyer et al., 2018</xref>), which suggests, importantly, that despite reduced potency, other pharmacological properties of the toxins, such as native target selectivity, remain unaffected by FcMoV fusion recombinant expression. Thus, the utility of these easy-to-produce fusions as selective pharmacological tools for probing physiological systems remains intact. Furthermore, these agents can be used to fluorescently label channels in cell membranes with a greater sensitivity than synthetic toxins due to polyclonal amplification of the signal.</p><p id="P68">Overall, this study provides insights into straightforward efficient production of pure, monodisperse antibody-toxin fusions for downstream pharmacological work. The high proportion of expression success with the FcMoV platform could be applicable to many disulphide bridge-rich peptides, and potentially other types beyond those investigated here. Even with suboptimal potency, selectivity remained intact for pharmacological discrimination between targets. In-house toxin production grants researchers control over downstream experiments and establishes the first step in the protein engineering pipeline: the ability to produce protein. The FcMoV platform sets the stage for the future expression of peptide libraries to optimise function, potency, folding, stability, bioactivity, selectivity and staining intensity. In doing so it lowers the barriers to the development of pharmacological tools and therapeutic leads against ion channels, such as the established analgesic target Na<sub>v</sub>1.7.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figs 1-5</label><media xlink:href="EMS206964-supplement-Supplemental_Figs_1_5.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d2aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS206964-supplement-Table_1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d2aAcFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS206964-supplement-Table_2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d2aAcFdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S32"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Federico Olivero for DRG culture preparation.
