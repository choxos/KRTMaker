blood-brain barrier (BBB), yet until now, its molecular architecture remained unresolved due to the absence of an experimentally determined structure. Using homology modeling and neural network-based structure prediction algorithms, complemented with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we propose a comprehensive model of LRP1 structures. We observe a natural dimerization mechanism and provide insight into the dynamic behavior of its flexible domains under physiological conditions. We investigated the stability of non-covalent interactions keeping LRP1’s α and β chains linked together, and found the energy required to break the link is 180±2 kT. The MD characterization highlights the fundamental role of glycans in the creation of LRP1’s quaternary structure, increasing the number of intra-dimeric contacts. This study opens new avenues for targeted drug design strategies, enhancing our molecular understanding of LRP1’s receptor-mediated transport in the brain and the key mediation of glycosylation in protein-protein interactions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] (LRP1) is a multifunctional glycoprotein involved in diverse biological pathways, including cancer, infection, and neurodegeneration. LRP1 is expressed in many animal tissues, and its malfunction affects various pathways in humans, causing cancer, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. LRP1 is a critical gene, and its deletion prevents vascular and neural development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. As a key endocytic and signaling receptor, LRP1 regulates cellular homeostasis, metabolism, and immune responses, making it a critical player in health and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Notably, LRP1 can interact with over forty different ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. This broad ligand-binding capacity may be attributed to its considerable size, comprising 4,544 amino acids, which allows for multiple interaction domains. LRP1 is initially synthetized as a single chain precursor and further processed by furin in the trans-Golgi compartment, resulting in a non-covalently associated heterodimer composed of a 515 kDa extracellular α-chain and an 85 kDa transmembrane β-chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. The extracellular portion of LRP1, or ectodomain, was observed in 2017 by De Nardis and collaborators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] with negative-stain electron microscopy and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), providing the first structural insights into its overall shape and flexibility in solution. All the images showed a maximum extension of 35nm and a monomeric structure. More accurate observations of LRP1 and other members of the LDL receptor family reported the structure of the three motifs or components of the protein (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The first motif is the calcium binding (CB) motif, believed to constitute the binding domains of LRP1 and to have two main features: the conservation of six cysteines creating three sulfur bridges and four to six acidic amino acids creating an electrostatic favorable coordination site for a coordinated calcium ion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. The second is the β-propeller motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], formed of six β sheets interacting by hydrophobic interactions and with the characteristic propeller shape. Finally, the epithelial growth factor (EGF)-like motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], which is also stabilized by three sulfur bridges does not show a stable coordination site for an ion.</p><p id="P4">While the primary sequence has been known since the discovery of the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], together with its local secondary and local tertiary structures, the scientific community has not produced a satisfyingly accurate characterization of full LRP1’s tertiary structure. To understand the latter better, it is useful to refer to the structures of homologous proteins. Recently, the structure of LRP2, a member of the LDL receptor family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], was resolved using cryo-electron microscopy (PDB ID: 8EM4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. LRP2, also known as megalin, shares the ability to bind numerous ligands with LRP1, some of which are common to both receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Comprising 4655 amino acids, LRP2 features the same structural motifs as other LDL receptor family members, including LRP1, with conserved motif order over long stretches of the protein chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. The resolved LRP2 structure reveals it as a homodimer, with two monomers interacting through hydrogen bonds and salt bridges in specific regions, leading to a quaternary structure; a following work confirmed the structure at physiological pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. This homodimer configuration offers exciting new insights into molecular recognition, binding mechanisms, and transport processes. The similarity between LRP2 and LRP1 raises the possibility that LRP1 might also function in a dimeric state.</p><p id="P5">Both LRP1 and LRP2 are glycoproteins that are characterized by the presence of covalently attached glycans (complex carbohydrate chains). These glycans play a crucial role in modulating protein-protein interactions, often by stabilizing particular protein conformations or by shielding proteolytic cleavage sites to maintain protein integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Increasing evidence has also pointed to the importance of glycan-mediated mechanisms in viral infectivity, most notably in the case of SARS-CoV-2, where glycans influence viral entry and immune evasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. As a result, the field of glycoscience has gained considerable momentum, emerging as a vital area of research with broad implications across molecular biology and biomedical sciences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].</p><p id="P6">LRP1 is involved in the transport and clearance of several extracellular proteins, including amyloid beta and tau, both of which are key pathological factors in neurode-generative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. It therefore plays a critical role in maintaining vascular integrity and mediating the removal of toxic species from the brain across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. In a previous work, we showed that this process involves the creation of tubular vesicular shuttles stabilized by the F-BAR domain protein syndapin-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. The created tubules allow a fast and effective transcytosis passage of misfolded proteins and synthetic nanoparticles across the BBB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. A central concept in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] on LRP1 binding is multivalency, which refers to the ability of multiple LRP1 receptors to simultaneously engage with the ligands displayed on a single nanoparticle. The overall binding strength, or avidity, of these multivalent interactions plays a critical role in determining the route of nanoparticle transport across the BBB. As such, avidity is a key parameter to consider when designing new nanoparticles. To optimize this interaction, it is essential to understand how LRP1 interacts with potential ligands that will decorate the nanoparticle surface. This investigation begins with the production of LRP1’s structure.</p><p id="P7">To further investigate the role of LRP1 in the BBB, in this work, we investigated the localization of LRP1 on the surface of brain endothelial cells and present two novel predictions for the quaternary structures of LRP1: monomeric and dimeric, with the dimeric form derived through homology modeling based on LRP2. These structures were further analyzed for their dynamic properties, emphasizing the role of domain flexibility in the protein, the contribution of glycans to stabilizing the dimeric conformation, and the stability of the non-covalent interactions between the two LRP1 chains.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>LRP1 co-localizes on the surface of bEnd3 cells</title><p id="P8">Using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) imaging, we investigated the structural organization of LRP1 on brain endothelial cells with spatial resolution in the tens of nanometers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2.a</xref>). In our experiments, cells were labelled using an Alexa-647 conjugated secondary antibody, and we first calibrated our system by imaging these antibodies under highly diluted conditions as detailed in the methods section. This calibration, aided by Mean Shift Clustering (MSC) analysis, established that a single secondary antibody produced a median of six fluorescence localizations, setting a baseline to distinguish individual molecules from clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2.c</xref>). When we imaged LRP1 on bEnd3 cell membranes via immunofluorescence, we observed that, unlike the uniformly distributed single antibody signals, LRP1 was organized into discrete clusters, with some clusters exhibiting up to 30 fluorescence localizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2.b</xref>). Further validation through varying the clustering bandwidth from 30 to 200 nm confirmed that even larger bandwidths occasionally merged signals, the LRP1 clusters maintained a more complex distribution than the calibrated secondary antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2.d</xref>). This comprehensive analysis confirms that LRP1 forms higher order structures, with multiple molecules colocalizing in small, discrete clusters on the cell surface. This analysis confirms the ability of LRP1 to interact, forming dimer, trimer, and possibly higher order arrangements.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The monomeric LRP1 Structural Model generation</title><p id="P9">To build an atomistic structural model of LRP1, we proceeded with the following procedure. As a first step, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art structure prediction algorithms like AlphaFold2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] and RoseTTAFold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] predicting the LRP1’s local tertiary structure motifs, shown as examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1.b</xref>. The estimated errors made by the two predictive algorithms are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1.a,b</xref>, which assesses the high confidence of the models. Both algorithms successfully produced the three motifs with high agreement among themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1.c</xref>) and with those observed in 8EM4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], which is now the largest protein observed in the LDLR family (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). We further evaluated the capacity of AlphaFold3 in producing the full-length LRP1, finding a coiled conformation with many atomic clashes and motif superimpositions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). The full prediction can not be used for further studies because of its low quality. Hence, we proceeded with predicting portions of the LRP1 sequence with RoseTTAFold as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3</xref>. The protein model was obtained by joining the predictions of different domains and further manipulated for better clarity in the representation, following the scheme in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>. A 3D arrangement of the LRP1 motifs is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3.a</xref>. It is worth to stress that the prediction of each motif is in line with the results of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>, while the 3D orientation of the motifs was manipulated for obtaining different conformations. After the placement of calcium ions to the calcium binding units’ coordination sites as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1.b</xref>, the protein was prepared for molecular dynamics simulation as described in the Methods section. The resulting structure is highly flexible, potentially extending to a fully stretched 100nm from the cell surface without altering the tertiary structure of the single domains (as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). The latter conformation was obtained by manipulating the dihedral angles to extend the protein but keeping the local motifs intact.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Furin’s shedding side belongs to a β-propeller motif</title><p id="P10">The enzyme furin cleaves LRP1 in correspondence of B8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4.a</xref>), generating two chains, α and β, that are non-covalently bonded. To provide information on the shedding mechanism, we investigated the stability of the non-covalent interactions, specifically hydrophobic interactions between adjacent β-sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4.b,c</xref>), which hold the resulting chains together using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We isolated the region of ASP3779-GLN4235 from the full monomeric structure of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3.b</xref> and prepared the system as described in the Methods section. We performed a series of short simulations using the umbrella sampling method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] to estimate the energy required to separate the α and β chains, going from the conformation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4.b</xref> to the final conformation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3.d</xref>. The potential of mean force (PMF) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4.e</xref>, reveals that the energy required to break the interactions between the two chains is approximately 180±2 kT.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The dimeric LRP1 Structural Model</title><p id="P11">To predict LRP1 in a dimeric conformation, we used the crystallized LRP2 structure at pH 7.5 from mice, PDB index 8EM4; the protocol is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>. As a first step, we modelled the tertiary structure of the mice LRP2 missing amino acids with RoseTTAFold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. We confirmed the results with AlphaFold2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] prediction. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref> shows the predictive performance of structural prediction algorithms in producing high-quality motifs. The sub-sequences inserted in the RoseTTAFold tool are the sequences of mice LRP2 with residue numbers 1272 to 1349, 2279 to 3033, and 3881 to 3992, hereafter called domains D2, D3 and D4, respectively (in green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5.a</xref>). The N-terminal of each predicted D-motif was joined to the correspondent site in 8EM4; i.e. the residue 1272 of domain D2 was covalently bonded to the residue 1271 from 8EM4, etc. We ignored the missing residues from LRP2’s R1 since they are not needed for modelling LRP1. We conducted a pairwise alignment of LRP1 and LRP2 sequences using the Needle algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5.b</xref>). In the LRP2 sequence, we considered the presence of the Dn amino acids. We then ran two homology modelling routines using Modeller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. In the first one, Modeller produced the LRP1 ectodomain in the dimeric conformation. Apart from the missing CB units in the flexible R clusters, patched with the D domains, the LRP2 structure also lacked transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains due to limitations of the method. We then predicted these domains with RoseTTAFold and verified with AlphaFold2. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5.c</xref> shows the predicted C-terminal domain colored according to error estimation from RoseTTAFold prediction. The error indicates a good confidence in the alignment of the five EGF-like domains and a lower confidence in the orientation of the transmembrane helix. The transmembrane domain was connected to the C-terminal of the previously obtained dimeric model and oriented to allow insertion into the lipid membrane. Furthermore, a Modeller run added the missing sulphur bridges, constrained the Cys-Cys distances (previously optimised by the RoseTTAFold model), and arranged a homodimer symmetry. Finally, calcium ions were inserted into the calcium-binding sites. The complete structure generated from a homology modelling protocol was visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5.d and 5.e</xref>. The protein complex occupies a 220x280x355 Å<sup>3</sup> parallelepiped. The protein appears bent in correspondence with the four β-propellers, B3 to B6, which form an arc of 180 degrees. R1, B1, B2, and R2 make the ascending leg; R3, R4, B7, and B8 make the descending leg, which ends up with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains.</p><p id="P12">The buried interface area between two protomers is 5951 Å<sup>2</sup>, accounting for 1.23% of the protein complex’s surface. The interface area is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6.a</xref>. The main interaction among protomers occurs in the canopy region. This part of the dimer is to be investigated later in this work. Other intra-dimer interactions are found between the two B8, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6.b</xref>. As seen in the previous section, the stability of B8 is necessary to keep the LRP1’s α and β chains together. Further intra-dimer contacts could further stabilize the non-covalent interactions between the two monomer’s chains.</p><p id="P">As in the monomer case, the system was prepared for simulations using Charmm-GUI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], generating the sulfur bridges between Cys pairs along the CB and EGF-like units, and finally, energy minimized (see Methods).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Time evolution of the flexible domains</title><p id="P13">The repetition of CB motifs forms three long chains, R2, R3 and R4, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. The flexible behavior of the R domains was observed in the crystal structure of LRP2, where some units of the corresponding clusters have not been resolved with sufficient resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>), as the single particle analysis identified the domains in different conformations. An interpretation of this fact is that while CB motifs are well structured locally, their relative orientations can vary in time.</p><p id="P14">We evaluated the temporal conformational changes of the three LRP1 R clusters, isolated by the rest of the protein, with MD simulations. The systems accounted for were: i) R2, amino acids 803 to 1269, CB3 to CB10 and EGF-like4 to EGF-like6; ii) R3, amino acids 2472 to 3025, CB11 to CB20 and EGF-like10 to EGF-like12; iii) R4, amino acids 3289 to 3868, CB21 to CB31 and EGF-like13 to EGF-like15. We decided to start from a stretched conformation to observe the coiling of the domains towards the equilibrium structure. In the process, we did not use any constraints on the domain terminals and observed the system relaxation. The R domains were prepared as discussed in the Methods section. In all of the systems tested, we observed the tendency to coil by measuring the end-to-end distance (d<sub>EE</sub>). We represent the distributions of d<sub>EE</sub> calculated in the last 200ns of MD simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7.b</xref>. Here, it is visible the reduction of d<sub>EE</sub> with respect of the initial conformation (dotted black vertical line). Furthermore, we compare the distribution of d<sub>EE</sub> with the same quantity calculated in the LRP1 dimeric conformation, represented by the red vertical line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7.b</xref> and shown graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7.c</xref>. We further quantified the flexibility of the three R domains by calculating the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of the alpha-carbon of each amino acid with respect to the initial positions. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6.d</xref>, we show the initial and final conformations of each domain, with the latter colored with respect to the RMSF.</p><p id="P15">During the evolution of the flexible domains, we did not observe any divalent calcium ions leaving their respective coordination sites. We investigated the strength of the interaction between the ion and its coordination site by employing umbrella sampling and the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] (see Methods). For the procedure, we choose to use the CB7 from R2, which displays the two structural features of CBs: i) the conservation of all six Cys; ii) the conservation of the acidic amino acids in the calcium cage: Asp1035, Asp1037, Asp1039, Asp1045 and Glu1046 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8.a</xref>). The results of umbrella sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8.b</xref>) show a potential of mean force (PMF) with a deep equilibrium well. As the reaction coordinate increases, the system finds other equilibrium conformations that are less stable with respect to the original one. In this transient state, the ion is geometrically outside the cage. Finally, the ion is free from the cage interactions. The free ionic conformation is estimated to be reached after giving the system 16±2kT of energy, justifying the rarity of this event.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>The protein glycosylation affects the LRP1 dimer conformation</title><p id="P16">An interesting feature of LRP2 and LRP1 dimers is the large interaction surface between the two monomers in correspondence with the canopy area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9.a</xref>). Since this area is densely glycosylated, we investigated the action of N-glycans on the stability of the dimeric interaction. The analysis focused on amino acids 1140 to 2522 of both monomers, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9.a</xref>. This fragment of the full LRP1 contains β-propellers B3, B4, B5 and B6, as well as the EGF-like5-10 motifs. All the glycans are N-type and bonded to the corresponding glycosylation sites reported in the GlyGen database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. This repository assesses the presence of twenty-one glycosylation sites for each monomer in the considered area. We decided to include only 19 of them, ignoring the ones corresponding to ASN1155, which raises steric hindrance problems with another glycan on ASN1154, and ASN2521, the system’s second-to-last amino acid. The final count of glycans resulted in 38 glycosylation sites. The glycans are the same simple high-mannose used for the flexible domains, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3.c</xref>. The sugar chains were added with the Glycosylator software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], and they needed to be further manipulated to avoid clashes in the small space between the protein canopies. The system, glycosylated and with four calcium ions at the interface (as described by Beenken and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]) was prepared for MD simulations with the Charmm-GUI webserver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].</p><p id="P17">We conducted four sets of classical MD simulations of the dimeric canopy region: i) fully glycosylated monomers, ii)-iii) asymmetric glycosylation of only one dimer member; iv) no glycosylation. Systems were let to evolve for 500ns using constraints on the free terminals, reproducing the effect of the inertial mass of the rest of the protein. After the first 500ns, we relaxed the positional constraints on the terminals and let the systems equilibrate for another 200ns. The changes in protein conformations are determined by the monomer-monomer distance between two amino acids, namely d<sub>MM</sub>, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9.b</xref> and reported as a function of time for all the systems in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9.c</xref>.

The fully glycosylated canopy keeps the initial conformation, called hereafter “closed”. In contrast, the partially glycosylated and non-glycosylated system undergoes a conformational change at the beginning of simulations, assuming an “open” conformation that is kept throughout the simulation. The final conformations for the closed, fully glycosylated, and open, non-glycosylated canopies are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figs. 9.e and 9.f</xref>, respectively.</p><p id="P19">To quantify the conformational difference between the closed, fully glycosylated system and the open, non-glycosylated system, we investigated the hydrogen bonds (HB) between the systems’ entities. We identified the possible HB interactions as: i) protein-protein; ii) protein-glycan; iii) glycan-glycan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10.a</xref>). The fully glycosylated presented all three, while the non-glycosylated presented only protein-protein interactions. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10.b</xref> we show the distribution of HB for the two systems, calculated in the range 400-500ns (with constrained terminals) and 600-700ns (after relaxation). After relaxation, we observed an increase in interactions between the monomers for both the open and closed conformations. The non-glycosylated configuration exhibited an average increment of three HB per frame, located among B3 and B6, which stabilized the open conformation.</p><p id="P20">With respect to the fully glycosylated system, an average increase of four HB was visible. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10.c</xref>, we show the HB components for the fully glycosylated system. While the protein-protein HB displayed a slight depletion, reaching equilibrium in a distribution comparable with the open conformation, the number of protein-glycan interactions notably increased. The number of glycan-glycan interactions was small and did not significantly influence the system’s time evolution.</p><p id="P21">Notably, the non-glycosylated system tended to have less stable hydrogen bonds during the 700ns simulated time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tab. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P22">We further assessed sequence conservation of LRP1 using ConSurf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>) (see Methods). It was identified that amino acids located in the core of β-propellers were highly conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2.a and d</xref>), whilst residues located on the surface were generally less conserved, apart from residues located at the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2.b and c</xref>). Conservation of residues at the dimer interface highlighted their potential role in maintaining protein-protein interactions. However, by comparing evolutionary data with molecular dynamics results, we identified that amino acids involved in intra-dimer HBs in the non-glycosylated system had higher conservation scores but formed less stable HBs than the ones in the glycosylated system. The comparison suggested that conserved amino acids at the dimer interface are less relevant than glycans to the maintenance of the dimer structure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">We present the novel hypothesis of a multi-quaternary structure for LRP1. The STORM analysis highlights the possibility for LRP1 to cluster on the surface of brain endothelial cells. With the available data, it is not possible to affirm what interaction exists between two or more LRP1, nor if it is direct or mediated by other entities; however, the observation of groups of LRP1 indicates the presence of an interaction. After this evidence, we produced two novel models for the LRP1, showing both the monomer and homodimer structure.</p><p id="P24">In the absence of significant experimental details on the tertiary structure, the monomeric structure of LRP1 is presented as a multi-domain flexible protein inserted into the cell membrane. Flexibility highly depends on the three calcium-binding domains R2, R3, and R4.</p><p id="P25">LRP1 is shed into two chains, α and β, by furin in the trans-Golgi compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. The shedding site appears in the β-propeller 8 (B8) motif. We investigated the stability of the B8 motif. We quantified the energy necessary to break the non-covalent bonds between the two chains, finding it to be around 180±2 kBT and hence impossible to break without a specific event. This finding agrees with the literature of soluble LRP1 (sLRP1), a species of LRP1 shed from the membrane of cells under stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Even in blood circulation, under application of strong torque forces, the non-covalent bond of α and β chains is conserved in sLRP1.</p><p id="P26">The homodimer model was obtained using a combination of neural network-based models for protein structure prediction and traditional homology modelling from the structure of a close homologous receptor, LRP2. The obtained structure keeps the same features as the template: a quaternary structure, intra-dimer contacts of rigid domains, and more flexible domains free of evolving in water. Moreover, we advance a hypothesis for the positions of transmembrane and intracellular domains that are not present in the LRP2 template. The dimerization of LRP1 was never observed in physiological experiments. The novelty of this result is of great biological importance: if LRP1, like LRP2, can form homodimers, it raises the possibility of forming heterodimers with the other members of the LDL receptor family, giving birth to unique pathways.</p><p id="P27">The two structures raise the possibility of analyzing LRP1 through different approaches, including MD simulations. Our first analysis studied the time evolution of flexible domains R2, R3, and R4. The three domains were isolated from the rest of the protein and artificially elongated while keeping all the secondary structures intact. These domains show a tendency to coil. The final conformations of R2, R3, and R4 show, at equilibrium, an end-to-end distance comparable to the same domains in the homodimer structure, as reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>. This fact indicates the thermodynamic equilibrium of the R domains in the proposed dimeric conformer, validating the latter. We did not observe a change in the coiling behavior influenced by the presence of glycans.</p><p id="P28">We observed calcium stability in the R domains’ coordination sites. Not a single calcium ion left its site during the MD simulations. We investigated the strength of this bond, finding it is due to two factors: the opposite charges of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and its cage, and the geometric distribution of the cage amino acids surrounding the ion. We employed umbrella sampling to force the ion outside the cage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>), finding that the PMF difference between the bound and unbound state is 16±2 kT. We hypothesize that the energy barrier is even higher; however, we were unable to quantify it.</p><p id="P29">We conducted a study on the canopy region of the LRP1 homodimer. This structure comprises four β-propellers motifs for each protein, disposed in a “U” shape. The two proteins interact laterally through β-propeller interactions. As this region is believed to be highly glycosylated, we tested the stability of the native interactions in the absence and presence of glycans. The presence of glycans notably increases the amount of intra-dimer interactions, making the quaternary structure more stable in the closed dimer conformation. Without glycans, the hydrogen bonds between the two proteins are less stable. Thus, the open structure is not as solid as the closed one.</p><p id="P30">Evolutionary sequence analysis of the canopy β-propellers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>) indicated high conservation of residues in comparison with the rest of the protein, with core residues being more evolutionarily conserved than those at the surface. Conservation of core residues matched previously described YWTD motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Further differences of canopy β-propellers were observed with β-propellers 3 and 6 having the most conserved residues, highlighting a further interesting evolutionary pattern of the motifs. A certain glycosylation pattern may promote a closed conformation and compensate for the divergent mutations at the surface of β-propellers 5 and 6, which instead promote an open conformation of LRP1.</p><p id="P31">A dynamic analysis of the intra-dimer hydrogen bonds indicated weak interactions for more conserved amino acids in the absence of glycans, and strong interactions for less conserved amino acids in the presence of glycans, suggesting a non-functional role of conserved amino acids of the canopy domain in LRP1 dimerization.</p><p id="P32">Together with our other observations, we conclude that glycans could have a fundamental role in allowing dimerization and influencing the quaternary structure conformation of LRP1 and, potentially, of different proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Immunofluorescence staining of bEnd.3</title><p id="P33">Mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3) were seeded onto fibronectin-coated μ-Slide 18-well Glass Bottom chambers (IBIDI) and cultured to confluence over 3 days.

Seven images were taken for LRP1 samples, while two were for secondary antibody calibration. Fluorescence was collected using a Nikon 100× oil immersion objective with a numerical aperture of 1.49. The light passed through a quad-band pass dichroic filter (97335 Nikon). Images were captured over a 256 × 256 pixel region, with a pixel size of 0.16 μm, using a Hamamatsu ORCA Flash 4.0 camera at an integration time of 10 ms. STORM movies were analyzed with Nikon’s NIS Elements software, employing a 2D Gaussian fitting with thresholds of 200 and 250. The threshold represents the distinction between the photon counts in the peak versus the background pixels. The trace length parameter was set to 5 to prevent the consecutive blinking of different molecules. This means that if a molecule is seen in five consecutive frames, it counts as one; if it appears in more than five frames, it will be removed. Signals with more than five localizations have been considered valid for molecular quantification. Then, we carried out the Mean Shift Clustering (MSC) analysis to identify clusters and evaluate the number of localizations. The MSC was performed by selecting arbitrary radii of 50, 100, and 200 nanometers. Outliers were removed from the clusters identified by Mean Shift Clustering by the ROUT method (Q=1).

Selected sequences were aligned using MAFFT. Conservation calculation method was set to the Bayesian method. Evolutionary substitution model was selected as the Best Model (default value). Estimated conservation values were mapped onto the LRP1 dimer model and visualised as cartoon putty using PyMol Molecular Graphics System (Schroedinger, LLC).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS206936-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d47aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Innovation of Spain, FPI grant PRE2021-100507 (G.M.T.); Grants I+D+I PID2020-119914RBI00 and PID2023-149206OB-I00 (G.B.), Grant PID2021-124297NB-C31 (G.F.) and PID2022-138109OB-I00 (L.R.P.) funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and European Union “ERDF A way to make Europe” (G.F.); the Alzheimer’s Association New to the field award (G.B.), European Research Council ChessTaG grant 769798 and MAIN (101123468) (G.B.); Agencia de Gestión de Ayudas Universitaria y de Investigación-Beatriu de Pinos Fellowship (S.A.G.); Activitat científica dels grups de recerca de Catalunya (SGR-Cat 2021) (G.B.); Marco Basile has received the support of a fellowship from “la Caixa” Foundation (ID 100010434).
