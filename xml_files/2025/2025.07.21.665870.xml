Research into psychedelics was widely prohibited in the mid-20th century, following their association with countercultural movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Dyck, 2008</xref>), however since the early 2000s, there has been a resurgence of scientific interest, with a corresponding growing body of evidence suggesting that psychedelics may be effective treatments for a range of mental health conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Andersen et al., 2021</xref>). A phase 3 trial investigating psilocybin vs placebo as a treatment for treatment-resistant depression has recently shown a small but significant improvement in symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">ClinicalTrials.gov, 2025</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The observed improvements in clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Griffiths et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Palhano-Fontes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Carhart-Harris et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Sanches et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Moreno et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Ross et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Gasser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Grob et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bogenschutz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Davis et al., 2021</xref>), and sustained changes following psychedelic administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Griffiths et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Griffiths et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Griffiths et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Doss et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Lebedev et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Schmid and Liechti, 2018</xref>) suggest that a single dose of a psychedelic may result in long-lasting changes, at either a behavioural or neural level. However, we lack an understanding of why this occurs and consequently, how putative therapeutic effects may be augmented. A candidate mechanism of importance is psychedelic-induced enhanced neuroplasticity (for reviews, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Calder and Hasler, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">De Vos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Olson, 2022</xref>), however multiple putative mechanisms of psychedelic action have been identified and may operate synergistically. At a receptor-level, classical serotonergic psychedelics are 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor agonists, however the receptor binding profiles are far more complex (for review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Halberstadt and Geyer, 2011</xref>)). Many other processes have been identified that underlie psychedelic-induced neuroplasticity cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Ly et al., 2018</xref>), including TrkB receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Moliner et al., 2023</xref>), molecular-level changes such as increased expression of c-Fos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Nichols and Sanders-Bush, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Frankel and Cunningham, 2002</xref>), altered gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Nichols and Sanders-Bush, 2002</xref>) and remodelling of the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Nardou et al., 2023</xref>). Systems-level changes within a computational framework include a relaxation of prior beliefs in the context of predictive coding, which has dominated the recent literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019</xref>). Behaviourally, changes in cognitive flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Doss et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">Wießner et al., 2022</xref>), creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Prochazkova et al., 2018</xref>), and enduring changes in wellbeing and personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aday et al., 2020</xref>) have been described. How these levels may interact, or operate synergistically, remains unclear.</p><p id="P9">The acute psychedelic experience is highly influenced by the context, both the external environment (setting), and the internal psychological context (the set) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Carhart-Harris et al., 2018b</xref>). The quality of the acute experience can affect whether sustained effects are positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Roseman et al., 2018</xref>) or negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Carbonaro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Halpern et al., 2018</xref>). In experimental animals, psychedelics have shown neuroplastic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Ly et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Nardou et al., 2023</xref>), and it is possible that these facilitate sustained behavioural change. However, the relationship between neuroplasticity and behavioural change remains unclear and is challenging to measure, especially in humans. This interaction may be explored by examining learning, which is the process of changing behaviour following the acquisition of new knowledge or experience. There is a long history of evidence for changes in associative learning (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="BX1">Boxes 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="BX2">2</xref>) under psychedelics; however, this has been largely unexplored in modern-era psychedelic research. The aim of this systematic review is to synthesise studies relating to the effect of psychedelic administration on learning, to understand whether this could be a putative mechanism (among others) of psychedelic action.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Systematic review protocol</title><p id="P10">This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Reporting of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Page et al., 2021</xref>).

The NMR is a blink reflex in rabbits, where the nictitating membrane (a third eyelid) contracts in response to an aversive US, such as an air puff or shock, with the learning being the conditioned association with a CS, such as an auditory tone or light.

Training schedules typically consisted of daily sessions, where the aversive stimulus was repeatedly presented with the neutral stimulus. Training took place daily for 10 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Gormezano and Harvey, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Gormezano et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Harvey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Schindler et al., 1986</xref>), or 8 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Romano et al., 2010</xref>), and one study investigated training for 5 or 10 days with equal numbers of stimulus pairings overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Welsh et al., 1998</xref>). Unfortunately, the effect of training intensity vs length was not analysed in this study.</p><p id="P25">In terms of stimuli, corneal air puffs were used in two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Welsh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Romano et al., 2010</xref>), electric shocks were used in three (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Gormezano and Harvey, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Harvey et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Schindler et al., 1986</xref>), and another used an appetitive stimulus (water) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Gormezano et al., 1980</xref>). Auditory conditioned cues were used in two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Romano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Harvey et al., 1988</xref>) and both visual and auditory in four (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Welsh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Schindler et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Gormezano and Harvey, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Gormezano et al., 1980</xref>). There was no clear difference in acquisition between the different stimuli, suggesting that the enhancement of conditioning is not dependent on the cue used.</p><p id="P26">Most studies used 30nmol/kg LSD with IV administration compared with vehicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Harvey et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Schindler et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Gormezano and Harvey, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Welsh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Gormezano et al., 1980</xref>) meaning it was not possible to examine dose-response relationships. The only study which used variable doses of LSD (doses 1, 3, 10, or 30nmol/kg), administered it intrahippocampally 20 minutes prior to each conditioning session. A small but significant dose-dependent acceleration of learning was observed in the LSD groups (for all doses other than the lowest) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Romano et al., 2010</xref>). An interesting temporal relationship was observed, with smaller doses corresponding with earlier accelerations in learning, and higher doses with later accelerations.</p><p id="P27">To investigate underlying mechanisms for the increased classical conditioning, the effect of LSD on sensitivity to both the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli was examined to understand whether LSD may be altering environmental or perceptual sensitivity. Two studies showed no difference in acquisition for varying US (shock) intensities; however, an enhancement of acquisition was observed for a greater range of tone (CS) intensities, with a lower acquisition threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Gormezano and Harvey, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Gormezano et al., 1980</xref>). This is suggestive of enhanced CS sensory processing driving enhanced classical conditioning. In contrast, another study found that LSD increased the amplitude of the NMR itself, with a lower shock threshold required to elicit this response, suggestive of an enhanced sensitivity to the shock (US) as well as the tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Harvey et al., 1988</xref>).</p><p id="P28">One study examined the effect of LSD on the maintenance and extinction of the conditioned response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Schindler et al., 1986</xref>). Again, enhanced acquisition of CRs to both tone and light CS was observed. Maintenance was tested for four days after conditioning with a switch in drug administration leaving four groups (LSD-LSD, vehicle-vehicle, LSD-vehicle, vehicle-LSD). Evidence of state-dependent learning was observed, with a maintenance in performance when the LSD group continued on LSD, and a drop in performance when the LSD group were switched to vehicle, implying that LSD-induced learning did not transfer to the drug-free state. When examining extinction, CRs acquired under LSD were more rapidly extinguished when LSD was continued during extinction training, but this was not the case when CRs were acquired after vehicle. This may reflect an enhanced adaptation to new contingencies under LSD, or alternatively, that material learnt under LSD is more vulnerable to extinction.</p><p id="P29">There was limited investigation into the underlying biological mechanisms. Ritanserin (5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> antagonist) dose-dependently blocked LSD-mediated enhancement in the acquisition of the CR, suggesting that these receptors are required for this enhancement in associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Welsh et al., 1998</xref>). Chronic LSD administration resulted in dose-dependent desensitisation of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor, as measured by a decrease in head bobs after post-study administration of DOI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Romano et al., 2010</xref>), which the authors speculate may explain the early acceleration and plateau in performance under lower dose LSD. However, this does not explain the later improvements observed in the high-dose LSD group, unless higher-dose LSD is driving performance via other mechanisms.</p><p id="P30">In summary, LSD appears to increase the acquisition of classically conditioned responses; however, several limitations were noted, including testing in a highly selective population (rabbits), being limited to only two reflexes, and while replicated several times, all studies appeared to come from the same research group. The repeated administration paradigms introduce uncertainty as to whether the observed effects are driven by acute learning changes under LSD, or whether they relate to post-acute cognitive or neuroplastic processes which may underwrite improved learning. Both hypotheses are supported by various results: that an enhancement was seen in some studies as early as the first conditioning session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Gormezano and Harvey, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Gormezano et al., 1980</xref>), and that learning was also enhanced later in training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Romano et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, the observed state-dependent learning suggests that material learnt while under LSD may not translate well to the non-drug state, which has clear implications for psychedelic use in humans.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Appetitive acquisition conditioning</title><p id="P31">The research on appetitive conditioning is more limited.

This study has been classified as a classical conditioning study because although it involves reward delivery, the primary measurement was dopamine (DA) transients to reward predictors, which can be considered an unconditioned response. The effect of DOI on nucleus accumbens (NAcc) phasic DA release (signalling prediction error) was measured using fibre optometry. After confirming that DA transients shifted during learning from the cue predicting immediate reward, to an earlier predicting cue (as typically occurs during learning, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>)), it was shown that DOI disrupted this effect. Dose-dependent increases in DA transients were observed to the cue predicting immediate reward, with no change to the earlier cue.

For the sCPP paradigm adult mice were conditioned to associate one type of bedding with socialising, and another with isolation. Psychedelic administration (ranging from 48 hours to 4 weeks before the task) led to a renewed preference for the social-associated environment. Notably, this behaviour is typically restricted to juvenile developmental windows. The behaviour was observed for weeks after psychedelic administration and was proportional to the length of subjective effects in humans for each drug tested. The paradigm design was such that the ‘test’ followed the isolation conditioning, raising doubt about whether the drugs may have been altering some other behavioural parameter such as an increased desire for novelty, an enhanced sense of boredom, or perhaps an altered sensitivity to rewards. However, the paradigm was also tested in juvenile mice (using MDMA), and there was no increase in the magnitude of social reward learning in this group. Using ex-vivo whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, the critical period was found to be underwritten by oxytocin-mediated long-term depression (LTD) in the nucleus accumbens, accompanied by transcriptional changes in extracellular matrix remodelling genes.</p><p id="P34">These studies provide plausible mechanisms whereby an enhancement of learning may be driven by an enhanced environmental sensitivity, by amplifying reward-prediction errors, or regression to a juvenile learning state (which itself would be consistent with an enhanced sense of novelty).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Extinction of classically conditioned response</title><p id="P35">Seven studies examined the effect of psychedelics on fear extinction (for an explanation of fear extinction, see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="BX2">Box 2</xref>).

While low-dose LSD may facilitate the acquisition of instrumental responding for rewards, higher doses impair task performance, suggesting an inverted-U or otherwise complex dose-response relationship, which is likely confounded by acute drug effects.

Interestingly, where an improvement in reversal learning was observed for LSD, it was not observed with 2-bromo-LSD (BOL-148), a non-psychoactive analogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">King et al., 1974</xref>).</p><p id="P62">Acute LSD (≥12.5 μg/kg) significantly improved reversal learning in rats in a light/dark discrimination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">King et al., 1974</xref>). This was observed for drug administration timings prior to the reversal, which ranged from 5 minutes to 90 minutes before. This was not replicated in another study which used a reversal learning paradigm with cues associated with both appetitive (food reward) and aversive (foot shock) outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Torrado Pacheco et al., 2023</xref>). Psilocybin 20 minutes before the reversal did not affect reversal learning, for either appetitive or aversive outcome. This study did, however, find that psilocybin improved set-shifting, although the influence of psychedelics on behavioural and cognitive flexibility is beyond the scope of this review.</p><p id="P63">Using an animal model of anorexia, an improvement in reversal learning after psilocybin administration was observed post-acutely using a paradigm requiring positional (left/right) nose pokes for reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Conn et al., 2024</xref>). Mice were initially trained on a fixed ratio schedule to receive rewards from either exclusively the left or right port (counterbalanced between animals). After training, psilocybin was administered, and 18 hours later the contingencies were reversed. Psilocybin vs vehicle enhanced reversal learning, measured by faster adaptation to the contingency reversal, reduced perseverative errors, and increased task engagement. This animal model is known to exhibit deficits in reversal learning and attentional set-shifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Huang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Allen et al., 2017</xref>), again suggestive of normalisation.</p><p id="P64">The effects of psychedelics on reversal learning are complex and seem to relate to multiple factors such as administration timings, task structure and baseline performance. One study adds a further layer of complexity, suggesting that psychedelics may enhance reversal learning, but that this is dependent on post-drug training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Šabanović et al., 2024</xref>). DOI improved adaptation to a novel transition reversal in a two-step probabilistic reversal learning task when the reversal was introduced a week, but not a day, after drug administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Šabanović et al., 2024</xref>). Furthermore, these improvements were dependent on task experience in the week after drug administration, with a lack of task experience in the ensuing week leading to significantly worse performance. This implies an interaction between the DOI and task experience in the post-acute phase. Interestingly, while DOI also appeared to improve adaptations to serial reversals, this was driven by a post-injection performance decline in the vehicle group exclusively. The pre-post measurements in the DOI group revealed no absolute improvements, which may reflect increased resilience to injection stress in the DOI group, again pointing to a possible role of psychedelics normalising deficient learning. Examination of choice behaviour following wins and losses revealed enhanced learning from reward omissions post DOI, with symmetric inference learning. This is a unique behavioural strategy not typically observed in mice which are normally driven by reward learning. An interpretation is DOI conferred an enhanced sensitivity to the environment, with previously overlooked cues now being incorporated into decision making.</p><p id="P65">Several studies examined the neurobiological effects underlying changes in reversal learning with variable approaches. Biochemical analysis indicated that LSD, but not BOL-148 (a non-psychoactive LSD analogue), increased brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels 45 minutes post-injection, with no significant effects on noradrenaline or dopamine, suggesting that LSD increased brain 5-HT levels, although this study did not investigate a causal relationship with reversal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">King et al., 1974</xref>). Psilocybin-induced improvements in reversal learning were blocked by 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, but not 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Conn et al., 2024</xref>). Ex-vivo MRI showed increased volumes in sensory and associative areas on the day following DOI administration, suggestive of rapid changes in structural plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Šabanović et al., 2024</xref>). However, there was a temporal disassociation between these structural changes and cognitive changes, which only emerged a week later. As structural changes were not compared between the group which received task experience and the group which had no task experience, it is not possible to infer directionality between learning and neuroplastic changes.</p><p id="P66">In summary, psychedelics may enhance reversal learning, though effects vary considerably depending on methodological factors such as timing, task structure, baseline performance, and drug-specific mechanisms. Psychedelics may exert these effects by normalising deficient learning, or enhancing sensitivity to previously overlooked environmental cues, likely mediated through serotonergic modulation and neuroplastic changes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Computational modelling of reversal learning</title><p id="P67">Computational modelling permits a richer characterisation of learning and decision-making. For example, reinforcement learning (RL) models describe how individuals incorporate feedback and uncertainty into learning strategies, using parameters such as the learning rate (how individuals update value representations in response to feedback), reward sensitivity and exploration parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Sutton and Barto, 1998</xref>). Two studies performed computational modelling to characterise learning changes, one in humans and one in mice.</p><p id="P68">To understand the effect of LSD on reinforcement learning in humans, a probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) task was completed during the acute drug phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Kanen et al., 2023</xref>). Whereas most of the previous paradigms involved drug administration prior to the reversal and after acquisition, this paradigm involved acquisition and reversal in one session. LSD increased the learning rate (LR) for both reward and punishment outcomes (and especially for rewards). In other words, LSD accelerated the updating of value representations, following a prediction error, especially for rewarding outcomes, conferring a greater sensitivity to reward prediction errors. Interestingly, while the reward LR was increased in both the acquisition and reversal phases, the punishment LR was increased only in the reversal phase, meaning that learning from negative feedback was only enhanced when the environment changed. Strikingly, a similar pattern was also observed in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Šabanović et al., 2024</xref>), where an increased learning from omissions was observed in the reversal phase only, however given methodological and species difference between studies, this link is made tentatively. Interestingly, under LSD, fewer errors in the acquisition phase predicted more perseverative errors in the reversal phase, suggesting that better initial learning resulted in greater subsequent perseveration. The authors speculate that this may relate to stronger learning under LSD, which is subsequently harder to shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Kanen et al., 2023</xref>). However, whether these enhancements in learning are observed in the post-acute phase are yet to be tested in humans.</p><p id="P69">One study examined the effect of psilocybin on reversal learning in rats post-acutely, using a two-armed bandit reversal learning task, where psilocybin was administered 24 hours before task onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Fisher et al., 2024</xref>). Task-engagement was optional for 3 hours each day for 2 weeks. While this study primarily measured task engagement, active inference (AI) modelling was used to characterise learning behaviour. Psilocybin increased the forgetting rates for rewards and reduced the forgetting rate for losses. In other words, when the psilocybin-treated rats received a reward, their prior belief was down-weighted compared with the control group. Conversely, the forgetting rate for losses decreased, meaning that experiencing a loss had a reduced influence on updating their priors. While this pattern was also observed in the control group, it was significantly enhanced in the psilocybin group. This is consistent with an optimism bias, where mice learn more from positive than negative outcomes, which may also explain increased task engagement.</p><p id="P70">Differences in the computational frameworks (reinforcement learning vs active inference) complicate direct comparisons between these studies. Whereas Kanen et al compared only RL models in model comparison, Fisher et al compared RL and AI models, with an AI best explaining the effect of psilocybin on choice behaviour, suggesting that AI modelling in humans may be a useful avenue for future research.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Probabilistic reinforcement learning</title><p id="P71">One study, conducted in healthy volunteers, examined the effect of psilocybin on the influence of conscious and subconscious cues (fearful or neutral faces presented before the stimulus) on probabilistic reward learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Casanova et al., 2024</xref>). Overall, acute psilocybin revealed no difference in reward learning vs placebo (measured by accuracy), however, this was driven by better learning in the 20mg group and worse learning in the 15mg group (vs placebo). Learning was impaired in the psilocybin vs placebo group when subconscious cues were presented. The authors speculate that a possible reduction in top-down processing under psychedelics leads to a reduction in automatic suppression of task-irrelevant stimuli, leading to a disruption in task performance. However, this interpretation does not account for why subconscious neutral but not subconscious fearful stimuli disrupted learning under psilocybin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Casanova et al., 2024</xref>). While there was a slight increase in switching behaviour under psilocybin, which they suggest may reflect higher exploratory behaviour, this was borderline significant. This is in agreement with the decreased stimulus stickiness parameter observed under LSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Kanen et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P72">The influence of psilocybin on probabilistic punishment learning was investigated using a chained operant reinforcement paradigm involving an escalating risk of foot-shock during reward-seeking actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Jacobs et al., 2024</xref>). The effect of psilocybin depended on the timing and the sex of the animal. When administered 15 minutes before initial punishment learning, punishment association learning was enhanced selectively in females (measured by increased behavioural suppression to punishment-associated actions). However, when given after learning, psilocybin reduced behavioural suppression in both sexes (meaning that rats became more likely to perform the risky action despite the threat of punishment), suggesting increased resistance to punishment. Psilocybin did not alter sensitivity to the shocks themselves, suggesting that this was not due to changes in pain perception. These findings indicate sex-specific effects of psilocybin on punishment learning. Notably, these effects were not observed with DOI, a 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor agonist.</p></sec><sec id="S31" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P73">This systematic review synthesised studies examining the effect of psychedelics on associative learning mechanisms. The evidence suggests that psychedelics may enhance classical conditioning, fear extinction, avoidance learning, and reversal learning; however, this is largely restricted to animal models. Mechanistically, these learning changes may be accompanied by an increased environmental sensitivity and increased sensitivity to prediction errors. The influence of psychedelics on associative learning may be conceptualised in terms of both the <underline>content</underline> of the associations formed and the <underline>process</underline> by which they are acquired. With respect to content, the studies reviewed indicate that psychedelics enhance associative learning for a range of stimuli. However, whether this generalises beyond the paradigms reviewed here, especially to complex human decision making, has yet to be tested. Enhancements were observed in classical, operant, and reversal paradigms, suggesting that this may be a general effect.</p><p id="P74">Various mechanisms were identified regarding how associative learning may be enhanced. There may be a normalisation effect of psychedelics, with some studies suggesting that only animals with learning deficits improve under psychedelics. At a receptor level, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors appear to be important, given the results of knockouts and antagonist studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Pędzich et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Welsh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Kelly et al., 2024</xref>). This is in line with findings showing a crucial role of serotonin modulation in associative learning, with 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors on thalamocortical synapses essential for associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Barre et al., 2016</xref>). Serotonin modulation also appears highly relevant to reversal learning specifically, with changes in reversal learning observed after pharmacological modulation of 5-HT<sub>2C/1A</sub> receptors, driven by altered sensitivity to positive and negative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Phillips et al., 2018</xref>), and a reduction in cognitive flexibility following prefrontal serotonin depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Clarke et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P75">Associative learning theories posit that learning is driven by prediction errors (PE), which are generated by unexpected outcomes, or unexpected omissions, and the size of the prediction error determines the magnitude of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Rescorla, 1972</xref>). Such error signals have been observed in dopamine neurons during reward learning in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Schultz et al., 2000</xref>) and in humans during Bayesian belief updating from priors to posteriors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Nour et al., 2018</xref>). As learning progresses, the dopamine neuron signals shift from firing to the unexpected outcome to the conditioned (predictive) stimulus. The finding that DOI leads to increased PE signals and dopamine transients for fully predictable rewards, akin to those seen in earlier learning stages, suggests that PE signals are present for well-established associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Martin et al., 2024</xref>). This may be explained by a reduction in prior expectation, consistent with the REBUS model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019</xref>). Alternatively, it may represent an amplified prediction error itself, perhaps due to an enhanced sense of novelty, consistent with the recently proposed Synthetic Surprise Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">De Filippo and Schmitz, 2024</xref>), or environmental salience. An enhanced PE is consistent with the observation that psychedelics enhance the learning rate in humans using reinforcement learning modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Kanen et al., 2023</xref>). A higher learning rate corresponds with a higher precision of the prediction error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Hohwy, 2017</xref>), which implies either a reduction in top-down expectation, or a greater influence of bottom-up information.</p><p id="P76">While these two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Kanen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Martin et al., 2024</xref>) examined the acute effects of a psychedelic, one study examined the post-acute effects in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Fisher et al., 2024</xref>). Active inference modelling revealed that forgetting rates were enhanced for rewards, consistent with down-weighting of priors for rewards, which again is suggestive of psychedelics enhancing belief updating, in this case in a manner which is consistent with an optimism bias. While this remains to be tested in humans, it implies that this enhancement of prediction error signalling may outlast the acute effects. Characterising this further will have important implications for understanding how learning may be enhanced in the post-acute phase. Furthermore, replicating changes in learning model parameters from animal models in humans will clarify translatability of animal models to humans.</p><p id="P77">If prediction errors are enhanced under psychedelics, this may explain a heightened sensitivity to the environment, which was suggested by this review. Studies showed an increased sensitivity to either conditioned or unconditioned stimuli in classical conditioning paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Gormezano and Harvey, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Gormezano et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Harvey et al., 1988</xref>). Fear extinction was reliably enhanced under psychedelics, which is known to be highly context sensitive. Furthermore, mice adopted an unusual behavioural strategy where they learnt from reward omissions, which were previously overlooked, again suggestive of enhanced environmental sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Šabanović et al., 2024</xref>). Crucially, this was observed in the post-acute phase, implying that this sensitivity may outlast the acute effects. An enhanced sensitivity to the environment could be explained by a number of mechanisms, including an enhanced sense of novelty, increased prediction errors, higher learning rates, and in turn reduced priors.</p><p id="P78">As well as being a potential driver of associative learning, it is possible that this environmental sensitivity could explain the context-dependent learning observed. In this review we reported evidence of state-dependent learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Schindler et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">Waser et al., 1976</xref>), where learning under LSD was not translated to a drug-free state, but upon re-administration of LSD, this was recovered. In this situation, the drug experience can be considered the ‘context’. One study did show translation of learning (fear extinction) to a novel environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">Woodburn et al., 2024</xref>). Context-dependent effects of psychedelics have been observed in humans, for example, the influence of natural surroundings during a psychedelic experience predicted later nature-relatedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Kettner et al., 2019</xref>), however, whether changes in associative learning under a psychedelic translate to a drug-free state in humans remains to be tested. Characterising this will enhance our understanding of how psychedelic insights may be incorporated into individuals’ lives.</p><p id="P79">Of critical relevance to humans and the psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy model is whether changes in learning outlast the acute effects. The earlier literature reviewed here was dominated by measuring learning under the acute effects of a psychedelic, often with repeated administration regimes, rendering interpretation of acute vs post-acute effects challenging. The post-acute period has been examined more recently, with mechanisms identified including the reopening of critical periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Nardou et al., 2023</xref>), increased avoidance learning in a deficit model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Buchborn et al., 2014</xref>), and enhanced fear extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Catlow et al., 2013</xref>), fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Favaro et al., 2015</xref>) and reversal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Conn et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Fisher et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Šabanović et al., 2024</xref>). For reversal learning, it is noteworthy that an interaction between the environment and the drug (DOI) was observed, meaning that only animals who were exposed to the task in the week after the drug showed any improvement in reversal learning. This suggests that behavioural changes may not be immediate, and may in fact develop during a window of enhanced learning. This is supported by the finding that there is a critical window of plasticity after a range of psychedelic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Nardou et al., 2023</xref>). It therefore seems possible that psychedelics may induce complementary mechanisms whereby an enhancement in learning is underwritten by a period of neuroplasticity, providing a catalyst to change behaviour.</p><p id="P80">Returning to the ‘content’ and ‘process’ of how psychedelics change associative learning, the present review suggests that associative learning may be enhanced by a range of psychedelics, and the limited but accumulating evidence suggests that this may be driven by changes to prediction error learning. The evidence also suggests that psychedelics may exhibit state-dependent learning, and further research is required to understand how translation of learning during psychedelic states to non-psychedelic states may occur.</p><p id="P81">There are several limitations to the presented evidence. Few (n=2) human studies were identified, and none that examined changes in learning in the post-acute phase, which is of critical importance when understanding sustained behavioural changes. While one study has examined post-acute cognitive changes in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">Wießner et al., 2022</xref>) none have been conducted for human learning. The reliance on animal models in tightly regulated contexts may not translate well into human experiences with dynamic contexts. There was considerable heterogeneity in study designs, particularly with variable dosing schedules, timings between learning and drug administrations, and training structures. Studies largely examined the acute effects of psychedelics on learning, which do not necessarily translate into a drug-free state. While there was evidence of an interaction between drug and task exposure in the post-acute phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Šabanović et al., 2024</xref>), this requires replication. While sex differences were observed in some studies, most studies used exclusively male subjects or did not examine differences. Finally, many classical conditioning studies used repeated dosing and administration paradigms, meaning that while the first session measures acute enhancements of learning, any improvement observed on subsequent days may be contributed to by post-acute drug effects from the previous day. Additionally, such a design does not permit distinction between an acute enhancement of conditioning, and/or an enhanced retrieval of learned associations.</p><p id="P82">In conclusion, psychedelics appear to enhance associative learning acutely, with some evidence suggesting that this may persist post-acutely. Various mechanisms were identified, including 5-HT<sub>1A/2A</sub> agonism, enhanced dopamine signalling for expected rewards, and enhanced reinforcement learning rates. It seems likely that various mechanisms work synergistically to provide an enhancement for learning, underwritten by a period of enhanced neuroplasticity. Further human research is required to understand whether such learning effects are observed post-acutely. Furthermore, the directionality of the interaction between neuroplasticity and learning remains unknown. Computational modelling is emerging as a useful tool to characterise such changes and may help understand the validity of existing animal models. Further research into the context-specificity of learning changes will help shed light on how insights gained during psychotherapy may be learnt and incorporated into individuals’ lives.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS207488-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d89aAcIbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S32"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Rita Moura for her thoughtful reading of the manuscript and her helpful feedback.</p><sec id="S33"><title>Funding statement</title><p>AC is a Wellcome Trust Doctoral Clinical Research Fellow (223486/Z/21/Z).</p></sec></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="con" id="FN1"><p id="P83"><bold>Author contributions:</bold></p><p id="P84">AC: conceptualisation, investigating, writing – original draft; LL: investigating, writing – reviewing and editing; FA: investigation, writing – review &amp; editing, CB: investigation, writing – review &amp; editing, AY: supervision, writing – review &amp; editing, MM: conceptualisation, writing – review &amp; editing</p></fn><fn id="FN2"><p id="P85"><bold>Statements and declarations</bold></p><p id="P86"><bold>Ethical considerations</bold></p><p id="P87">Ethical approval was not required.</p></fn><fn id="FN3"><p id="P88"><bold>Consent to participate</bold></p><p id="P89">Not applicable.</p></fn><fn id="FN4"><p id="P90"><bold>MConsent for publication</bold></p><p id="P91">Not applicable.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="FN5"><p id="P92"><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests</bold></p><p id="P93">AHY has received grant funding from LivaNova, Janssen, Compass Pathways Plc., Novartis, NIMH, CIHR, NARSAD, Stanley Medical Research Institute, MRC, Wellcome Trust.

orientation="portrait"><label>Box 1</label><caption><title>Associative learning – a background</title></caption><p>Associative learning is the cognitive process by which an individual forms associations between two stimuli, or between an action and its consequence, based on their co-occurrence (for review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Pearce and Bouton, 2001</xref>)). In practical, real-world contexts, associative learning simply involves linking one factor with another through an individual’s lived experiences, and is a key mechanism through which complex behaviour arises, with important implications for social development and future mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">Sheridan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Reeb-Sutherland et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Since the work of Pavlov and Thorndike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Thorndike, 1898</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Pavlov, 2010</xref>), the field has expanded to incorporate mathematical frameworks such as the Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Rescorla, 1972</xref>) to explain more complex learning processes. The RW model proposes that the strength of associative learning depends on the discrepancy between predicted and actual outcomes, known as prediction error or ‘surprise.’ As associations become stronger, surprise diminishes, correspondingly reducing the rate of learning. This has paved the way for more sophisticated frameworks such as reinforcement learning (RL) and active inference (AI) which are able to incorporate measures of uncertainty allowing for more flexible and adaptive learning in complex, dynamic environments. These advanced models not only account for prediction errors and reward maximization but also enable agents to build and update probabilistic models of their world, optimizing behaviour through continuous interaction and belief updating. This progression is reflected in the literature. Whereas earlier studies used simple task designs with fixed probabilities, newer studies have incorporated probabilistic task designs with computational modelling to characterise richer alterations in learning mechanisms in response to psychopharmacological manipulations.</p><p>The various types of associative learning are summarised in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="BX2">box 2</xref>, and may be broadly categorised as classical conditioning, or operant conditioning.</p></boxed-text><boxed-text id="BX2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Box 2</label><caption><title>Classical conditioning</title></caption><sec id="S34"><title>Acquisition</title><p>Classical conditioning acquisition involves associating a neutral stimulus (such as a tone) with an unconditioned stimulus (US) through repeated pairings. The US can be aversive (such as an electrical shock, or an air puff) or appetitive (such as a food reward), and naturally elicits an unconditioned response (UR). Over time, the neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus (CS), evoking a conditioned response (CR), which resembles the UR, even in the absence of the US. Most studies examining the effect of psychedelics on classical conditioning used an aversive unconditioned stimulus, eliciting a defensive response (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> for a methodological summary).</p></sec><sec id="S35"><title>Extinction</title><p>Extinction is the process of learning new associations which compete with the original associations (for reviews see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bouton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Myers and Davis, 2002</xref>)), and is known to be highly context dependent with limited translation from one context to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bouton, 2004</xref>). This is observed in fear extinction paradigms with expressions of fear renewal in novel contexts (for review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Maren et al., 2013</xref>)). The effect of psychedelics on extinction has primarily been studied using fear extinction paradigms.</p><p><bold>Fear extinction</bold> is the learning process whereby exposure to learnt fear-inducing cues, without co-presentation of the aversive stimulus, leads to a reduction in fear response. Fear conditioning paradigms involve co-presentation of a cue, such as a sound, or a particular environment, with an aversive stimulus. This leads to an expression of fear in response to the cue, measured by freezing behaviour. The learnt fear response can be extinguished by repeatedly presenting the conditioned stimulus (CS) without the aversive one, however this is not necessarily driven by forgetting the former association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Gale et al., 2004</xref>). Retention can subsequently be tested by measuring freezing behaviour in response to the conditioned stimulus (for review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Myers and Davis, 2007</xref>). Fear-conditioning is known to display context-dependence (for review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Maren et al., 2013</xref>)), and therefore, auditory fear conditioning paradigms often test fear extinction in a novel context, to control for the influence of context in initial fear associations.</p></sec></boxed-text><boxed-text id="BX3" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Box 3</label><caption><title>operant conditioning</title></caption><p>Operant learning is a form of associative learning in which the probability of a behaviour is modified by its consequences, where actions are reinforced when followed by rewards and diminished when followed by punishments or the absence of reinforcement. Unlike classical conditioning, where associations form between stimuli, operant learning is driven by voluntary behaviours and their outcomes.</p><sec id="S36"><title>Negative reinforcement</title><p>All studies examining negative reinforcement utilised avoidance learning paradigms, where animals learn to proactively avoid an aversive stimulus after forming an association with a predictive cue. Most studies used the shuttle box, a behavioural apparatus containing two compartments which the animal can move between. Following conditioning to associate an auditory tone (CS) with a shock (US), the animal can flee in response to the tone, known as the conditioned avoidance response (CAR). Six studies examined the effect of LSD on the CAR, by measuring the latency from CS presentation to the CAR, or the percentage of successful CARs.</p></sec><sec id="S37"><title>Positive reinforcement</title><p>Only one study examined positive reinforcement and used a Skinner box lever-pressing paradigm. In this paradigm, animals are placed in a chamber equipped with a lever, which they learn to press to receive a reward, such as a food pellet.</p></sec><sec id="S38"><title>Reversal learning</title><p>Reversal learning is a form of flexible learning that involves the ability to modify behaviour in response to changing reinforcement contingencies (for review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Izquierdo et al., 2017</xref>)). It requires the suppression of previously learnt associations and the acquisition of new stimulus-outcome or action-outcome associations. Reversal learning paradigms typically involve associating stimuli with rewards or punishments (which may be probabilistic themselves) before a rule change where these contingencies are reversed, known as the ‘reversal’.</p></sec></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>PRISMA flow diagram illustrating the process of selecting studies for the systematic review.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207488-f001"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>summary of studies investigating the effect of psychedelics on classical conditioning acquisition and extinction.
