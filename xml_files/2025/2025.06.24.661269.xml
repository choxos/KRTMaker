However, the molecular mechanisms allowing organisms to adapt to new telomeric sequences are difficult to gauge from extant species. Here, we reprogrammed multiple yeast lines to human-like telomeric repeats to unveil their molecular and fitness response to novel telomeres. Initially, the exchange of telomere sequences resulted in genome instability, proteome remodelling and severe fitness decline. However, adaptive evolution experiments selected for repeated mutations that drove adaptation to the humanized telomeres. These consisted of the recurrent amplification of the telomere-binding protein <italic>TBF1</italic>, by complex aneuploidies, or in repeated mutations that attenuate the DNA damage response. Overall, our results outline a response that defines the adaptive molecular landscape to novel telomeric sequences.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Teaser</title><p id="P3">Yeast cells adapt to novel telomeric variation through amplification of telomere-binding proteins and inactivation of a telomeric DNA damage response</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S2" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">The correct maintenance of the genome is of fundamental importance in order to prevent instability and degeneration. In most eukaryotes, the genome is organized in linear segments whose extremities are exposed to degradation and need to be protected. This function is performed by ribonucleoproteins called “telomeres”, consisting of a repeated DNA sequence and its associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Greider &amp; Blackburn, 1987</xref>). Telomeres are maintained via the specialised enzyme telomerase. This enzyme is a reverse transcriptase that synthesizes new repeats using a RNA moiety as template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chan &amp; Blackburn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">De Lange, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Greider &amp; Blackburn, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Lundblad &amp; Szostak, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Marcand et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Despite variations in their DNA sequence having occurred during evolution, the function of telomeres in genome maintenance is remarkably conserved across the tree of life. In fact, all telomeric DNA motifs share common characteristics, like being short, tandemly-repeated and G-rich, and the principles of telomere biology are widely conserved even among distant taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kupiec, 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, variations in both telomeric sequence and length occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Lyčka et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">Whittemore et al., 2019</xref>). The vertebrate-like TTAGGG (T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub>) repeat is the most widespread, being present in the majority of Metazoa, but also in some classes of protists, fungi and plants, and is thought to be the ancestral unit from which all the others evolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Fulnečková et al., 2013</xref>). Variations of this motif are observed in other taxa, like TTTAGGG in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Peska &amp; Garcia, 2020</xref>), TTAGG in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kuznetsova et al., 2020</xref>), TTAGGC in nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">Zetka &amp; Müller, 1996</xref>) and degenerate motifs in <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> yeasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Teixeira &amp; Gilson, 2005</xref>). In other organisms, telomeric repeat units can be very long and complex, like in species of the genus <italic>Candida</italic> or in fission yeasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Sepsiova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Peska et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, telomeric DNA sequences have changed at multiple times during evolution, but how organisms subsequently adapt to accomodate and capitalize on these changes remains uncharacterised.</p><p id="P6">Telomeric DNA varies in length with a difference of over two-orders of magnitude across species and extensive within-species variation. Telomere length ranges from 150-600 bp in budding yeasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">D’Angiolo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Garrido et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">O’Donnell et al., 2023</xref>), to 5-15 kb in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Karimian et al., 2024</xref>) and over 100 kb in some mice species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hemann &amp; Greider, 2000</xref>). The budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has been a leading model in telomere biology. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> telomeres are constituted by degenerate TG<sub>1-3</sub> repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Wellinger &amp; Zakian, 2012</xref>). Moreover, yeast telomeres are flanked by repetitive subtelomeric DNA like the X and Y′ elements, and interstitial telomeric sequences (ITS) that are often located between them, adding further complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Louis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Wellinger &amp; Zakian, 2012</xref>). <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells can survive for several cell divisions after the complete loss of telomerase, and often generate stable survivors that can replicate indefinitely thanks to recombination-based maintenance of telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Lundblad &amp; Blackburn, 1993</xref>). It is possible to generate yeasts with human-like T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> telomeres by engineering the telomerase RNA template encoded by the gene <italic>TLC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Henning et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Forstemann &amp; Lingner, 2001</xref>). Such a humanization of yeast telomeres entails a switch in telomere-binding proteins, in which Rap1p, originally bound to native TG<sub>1-3</sub> repeats, is replaced by Tbf1p, a regulatory factor known to bind TTAGGG repeats in the yeast genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brigati et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Koering et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Berthiau et al., 2006</xref>). Humanized telomeres are dysfunctional and show deregulation of their length and loss of subtelomeric transcriptional silencing. Furthermore, they trigger the activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) with consequent cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alexander &amp; Zakian, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Auriche et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bah et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bah et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Brevet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Di Domenico et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fukunaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Ribaud et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P7">In this study, we investigated the evolutionary response of yeast cells to a sudden reprogramming of all telomeres by propagating them over many mitotic generations through experimental evolution. Yeasts with humanized telomers showed a progressive fitness decay accompanied by genome instability and partial proteomic remodelling, but subsequently recovered near-wild-type fitness by amplifying <italic>TBF1</italic> or modulating the DNA damage response.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S4"><title>An evolutionary framework of novel telomeres</title><p id="P8">Previous work has shown that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> yeasts engineered to carry point mutations in the <italic>TLC1</italic>-encoded 16 nt telomerase RNA template have growth and chromosome segregation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lin et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that this motif is under strong evolutionary constraints that limit its freedom to vary in nature. To quantify these constraints, we examined the template and its flanking regions in 8 <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> species spanning nearly 20 MY of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Shen et al., 2018</xref>). Our multiple sequence alignment revealed that while flanking regions show variation that reflects the species evolutionary relationships the template region is extremely conserved, with only two variants: in the first and last nt positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We further analyzed intraspecific variation in <italic>TLC1</italic> in a collection of 3380 natural <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> isolates to explore recent mutations across the ecological and geographic range of this model species. We found two rare variants, again in the first or the last nt of the template, with minor allele frequencies of 0.002 and 0.0003 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Thus, purifying selection acting on the <italic>TLC1</italic> sequence in natural yeast lineages is remarkably strong.</p><p id="P9">In order to reconfigure <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> telomere repeats, we used a genetic system that generates isogenic strains with either wild-type or humanized telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bah et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bah et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). In brief, these two strains differ by a low-copy centromeric plasmid with either a native (p<italic>TLC1</italic>-y) or humanized (p<italic>TLC1</italic>-h) copy of <italic>TLC1</italic>, with the chromosomal <italic>TLC1</italic> having been deleted from its native locus. These strains contain an additional plasmid with a copy of <italic>TLC1</italic>-y (pAZ1) that serves as a back-up and pAZ1 loss can be controlled by plating cells in a selective medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Furthermore, in these strains, <italic>ADE2</italic> is inactivated by a loss-of-function mutation in its native locus and a functional copy is inserted into the right subtelomere of chrV and acts as subtelomeric transcriptional silencing reporter.</p><p id="P10">We initiated the telomere reprogramming by streaking the ancestors on 5-FOA for two single-cell bottlenecks (scb) to select for <italic>URA3</italic>-containing pAZ1 loss. We investigated the effect of pAZ1 loss on telomere DNA length and composition, as well as on mitotic cell growth and lifespan. First, we sequenced the ancestors’ genomes before (0 scb) and after pAZ1 loss (2 scb) to estimate telomere length and composition from short-read data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">D’Angiolo et al., 2023</xref>). The TG<sub>1-3</sub> telomere length decreased upon pAZ1 loss, for both the wild-type and humanized ancestor, consistent with telomere length being affected by the copy number of <italic>TLC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Zappulla &amp; Cech, 2004</xref>). The wild-type did not contain T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> repeats, while a small amount was detected (5% T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> reads) in the humanized ancestor at both timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Since both types of <italic>TLC1</italic> are present in the ancestor at 0 scb, this result indicates that telomerase infrequently uses the humanized version in p<italic>TLC1</italic>-h. The rare T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> telomeric repeats and the loss of pAZ1 did not immediately affect the cell’s doubling time across several conditions or chronological lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S5-7</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Next, we investigated the impact of pAZ1 loss on the global proteome, using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We only detected 4 differentially expressed proteins in the humanized ancestor at 0 scb as compared to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S11</xref>). However, we identified 14 differentially expressed proteins in the humanized ancestor at 2 scb. These were enriched for Rap1p targets (5/14, <italic>p</italic>=0.05), indicating that the early proteomic response to telomeric reconfiguration could be mediated by Rap1p release from humanized telomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Platt et al., 2013</xref>). In humanized yeasts, the replacement of Rap1p by Tbf1p results in transcriptional derepression of subtelomeric genes most likely due to the lack of the deacetylases Sir2-4 binding to the decreased number of telomeric Rap1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alexander &amp; Zakian, 2003</xref>) and/or the insulator activity of Tbf1p (Fourel et al., 1999). Consistent with an early loss of transcriptional silencing, we found Ade2p to be upregulated in yeast cells carrying the humanized <italic>TLC1</italic> at 2 scb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S12</xref>). Overall, we found the controlled loss of pAZ1 to initiate the telomeric replacement of yeast TG<sub>1-3</sub> with human T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> repeats and that this initiation coincided with modest proteomic remodelling. Thus we conclude that it can be used to study the long-term consequences of a telomeric repeat reprogramming.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Chromosome end structures of humanized yeasts</title><p id="P12">We induced the telomere reprogramming by evolving 16 clones from the wild-type and humanized ancestors for 100 scb through a mutation accumulation lines (MAL) protocol, which minimizes selective pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). During MAL, humanized yeasts’ TG<sub>1-3</sub> repeats are gradually replaced by T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> repeats, but they maintain a short centromere-proximal stretch of TG<sub>1-3</sub> repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Auriche et al., 2008</xref>). Five wild-type lines became “<italic>petites</italic>” (growth deficiency caused by mutation or loss of mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Vowinckel et al., 2021</xref>)) and were not further characterized. We estimated that the mutation accumulation lines underwent ~2140 and ~1640 generations for wild-type and humanized lines, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Several wild-type and humanized lines subsequently were used to inititate adaptive evolution lines to explore adaptation to new telomeric sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To characterize the telomere DNA upon reprogramming, we applied short-read and long-read technology to both MA and AE lines. Short-read sequencing confirmed the absence of T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> repeats in wild-types, while their amount increased in the humanized lines over mitotic generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). ITS content and Y’ copy number (CN) increased in humanized yeasts, a hallmark of type I survivors when cells overcome telomerase inactivation via recombination-mediated telomere lengthening. Humanized yeasts also carried ITS with T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> repeats suggesting telomere-subtelomere recombinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c-d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Long-read sequencing can resolve telomeres at single chromosome-end resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Karimian et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Sanchez et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Schmidt et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Sholes et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Tham et al., 2023</xref>). We thus applied Nanopore sequencing to the humanized ancestor at 2 scb, 4 MA lines and 2 single clones from the same AE line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). At 2 scb, three telomeres (chrVI_R, chrXI_L, chrXVI_L) contained small amounts of terminal T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> repeats, confirming that telomeric reprogramming starts at the first single-cell bottlenecks. At 100 scb, almost all telomeres are constituted by an internal TG<sub>1-3</sub> (median 45.5±23.3 bp) and a terminal T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> stretch (median 224±357.5 bp). While the TG<sub>1-3</sub> length is similar across telomeres, the T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> lengths show remarkable variation with the Hum15 line with ultra-long telomeres (&gt;3 kb in chrIV_R) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>).</p><p id="P15">ITS and Y’ elements consistently increased in MAL and AEL, with chrVIII_L and chrXVI_R being preferential sites for their amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). We confirmed the presence of T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> repeats at ITS, with 5 conformations, implying recombination between telomeres and ITS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2b-c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S3-4</xref>). In contrast, X elements were largely stable with 1 copy per chromosome-end, except for chrXVI_R that carried 2 copies and occasionally amplified on chrVIII_L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). Abundant chromosome size variations that are compatible with subtelomeric amplifications were also observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Discussion 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). These results raise the possibility that the amplification of subtelomeric ITS and Y’ elements compensates for the inadequate chromosome end protection in humanized yeasts. To further probe this hypothesis, we analyzed co-variation between telomere length, ITS and Y’ CN. Y’ and ITS CN were strongly correlated both in MAL and in AEL (<italic>r</italic>=0.96 and <italic>r</italic>=0.99, <italic>p</italic>&lt;2.2e<sup>-16</sup>). Instead, telomere length was inversely correlated with Y’ CN in AELs (<italic>r</italic>=-0.62, <italic>p</italic>=4.5e<sup>-7</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We investigated the impact of telomere humanization on proteins that directly bind telomeric repeats and the telomere silencing reporter through mass spectrometry.

We examined the proteomic profiles of humanized and wild-type yeasts and derived a list of 110 proteins whose abundance changed significantly in at least one evolution condition (MAL or AEL). We used hierarchical clustering to group proteins based on their log<sub>2</sub>FC co-variation, uncovering 8 major clusters. Clusters 1,2,3,5 contain proteins down-regulated in humanized yeasts, with an enrichment for the pentose phosphate pathway/NADPH regeneration, transport/localization, aminoacid metabolism, and stress response, respectively. Proteins in clusters 1,5 remained downregulated after AEL from 100 scb, while those in clusters 2,3 returned to normal abundance. Of note, proteins in cluster 3 exhibit opposite trends between MAL and AEL from 2 scb. Cluster 4 contains proteins up-regulated in humanized yeasts and is enriched for deoxyribonucleotides synthesis. Clusters 6,7 comprise proteins up- and downregulated in AELs from 2 scb, while cluster 8 contains proteins upregulated in all strains, with no functional enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S12</xref>). Proteomic profiles of humanized and wild-type yeasts were similar in AEL initiated from 2 scb., indicating that their differential protein abundance is mainly driven by growth advantage and faster metabolism, rather than telomere structure. This effect might underlie a common adaptation signature to the dropout medium through a modification of aminoacid metabolism. Furthermore, we performed Principal Component Analysis to group strains based on their proteomic profile and separated humanized and wild-type MAL. Humanized AEL from 100 scb clustered together with the wild type MALs and the ancestors, confirming that they recovered a proteomic profile similar to the wild types as they recovered their growth capacity.

All the AELs derived from ancestors at 2 scb, i.e. from before substantial telomere reprogramming, maintained their original ploidy and showed no major structural variants. In contrast, AELs derived from MALs at 100 scb and that had gained extra chromosomes during the MAL evolution, frequently lost the extra chromosomes during the adaptive evolution and thereby restored a balanced genome content. Humanized lines 2,8,3 lost their additional copies of chromosomes V, XI and XVI, respectively, while Hum11 revealed a mixed population of clones carrying different segments of the extra copy of chromosome XVI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S10</xref>). We isolated 8 single clones from this population and uncovered 4 distinct chromosome XVI conformations by qPCR and whole-genome sequencing. All the segments’ breakpoints were flanked by repetitive sequences such as Ty and long terminal repeats that likely mediated the recombination events. Notably, the region encompassing the <italic>TBF1</italic> gene remained duplicated in all conformations and included the centromere (CEN16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). We applied long-read sequencing to two of these clones to disentangle their chromosome XVI structure. Clone D carried almost the full version of duplicated chromosome XVI, except for a terminal segment, and the duplicated segment was stabilized by the duplication and translocation of chrVIII-R telomeres. Clone H carried only a central duplicated segment of chromosome XVI and this segment was circularized with the circularization likely mediated by Ty elements and stabilized by CEN16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). This circular structure is likely present in all conformations lacking terminal duplicated blocks (i.e. conformations 2,3,4) and has the advantage of not needing telomeres. We tested whether these segmental duplications resulted in a double amount of proteins. Proteomic profiles mirrored read coverage ones for the 4 chrXVI conformations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8c</xref>). However, the average abundance for proteins encoded by genes in these segments was less than 2-fold higher than that of other proteins, indicating a buffering effect.

Our results show that humanized yeasts promptly accumulate T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> repeats, and that this telomere sequence reprogramming impairs fitness and increases genome instability. This is in agreement with humanized telomeres inducing replication fork stalling and cell cycle delays, and being subject to a high repeat turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bah et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bah et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Di Domenico et al., 2009</xref>), thus explaining the need for massive subtelomeric amplifications of ITS and Y’ elements to prevent chromosome-end uncapping. Increased genome instability as a consequence of telomere dysfunction was already observed in humanized yeasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Di Domenico et al., 2013</xref>) and in telomerase-deficient <italic>est1Δ S. cerevisiae</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Hackett et al., 2001</xref>). However, this effect was restricted to chromosome-end regions, while our results show that telomere dysfunction increases mutation rates across the whole genome. After an initial decline, humanized yeasts recovered their fitness through two evolutionary routes: by acquiring mutations in components of the DNA damage response or by increasing the copy number of telomere-binding proteins. The mutations in DDR genes are likely partial or complete loss-of-functions, as their appearance coincides with a decreased expression of DDR targets like <italic>RNR</italic> genes, suggesting a release of cell-cycle blockage induced by telomere uncapping. Previous studies showed that DDR is mildly but chronically activated in humanized yeasts and causes a G<sub>2</sub>/M delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Di Domenico et al., 2009</xref>), while the deletion of the DDR mediator <italic>RAD9</italic> abolished DDR and the cell cycle delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bah et al., 2011</xref>), in line with our findings. While DDR inactivation relieves the cell cycle blockage and rescues growth, it also increases genome instability. Our humanized line 8, carrying a loss-of-function mutation in <italic>TEL1</italic>, exemplifies this tradeoff, as the appearance of the mutation is followed by complete growth recovery coupled with multiple chromosomal rearrangements, extensive subtelomeric amplifications and even whole-genome duplication. Given its important role in DNA repair, DDR inactivation likely constitutes a temporary solution while its long-term inactivation would probably lead to genomic melt-down. A more likely scenario of telomere sequence evolution might involve the transient inactivation of the DDR followed by the occurrence of compensatory mutations in telomere-binding proteins to adapt to their novel telomeric sequences.</p><p id="P32">The second route that humanized yeasts use to rescue their fitness passes through the duplication of chromosome XVI, ultimately to increase the abundance of Tbf1p, a T <sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brigati et al., 1993</xref>). While aneuploidy is generally considered detrimental, it can be beneficial under different environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gilchrist &amp; Stelkens, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Pavelka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Rancati et al., 2008</xref>). Our results are consistent with aneuploidy as a faster strategy to recover fitness, due to the high chromosome duplication rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Yona et al., 2012</xref>). Even though MALs are generally considered a close-to-neutral evolutionary scenario, adaptive aneuploidies have been previously observed in these settings, e.g. chromosome XII is frequently duplicated in MAL propagated under rapamycin treatment to maintain a balanced rDNA content after rapamycin-induced rDNA repeat contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Li et al., 2023</xref>). However, aneuploidy also entails a fitness cost due to the indiscriminate increase in expression of many genes and the stoichiometric imbalance of proteins involved in protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Papp et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, the ultimate evolutionary outcome is dictated by a tradeoff between the fitness costs and gains of the aneuploidy. Removing the parts of the duplicated chromosome that are not driving the fitness improvement constitutes a successful strategy, as exemplified in one of our AE lines where the clones with the shortest duplicated chromosome XVI segments were the fittest. The formation of extrachromosomal circles carrying duplicated genes, as well as other chromosomal rearrangements, has already been observed both in laboratory evolution and telomerase negative mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Liti &amp; Louis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hull et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Libuda &amp; Winston, 2006</xref>). Our results provide a temporal dynamic to the recent observation of complex aneuploidies associated with structural variations, showing that aneuploidies precede structural variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">O’Donnell et al., 2023</xref>). These results are also in line with a theoretical framework in which the fitness cost of an aneuploidy is directly proportional to the number of genes located on that chromosome and it is counterbalanced by the fitness benefit resulting from the dosage increase of specific genes (e.g. <italic>TBF1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Pompei &amp; Cosentino Lagomarsino, 2023</xref>). DDR mutations and <italic>TBF1</italic> duplication might ultimately impinge on the same outcome: the attenuation of the DDR and release of cell cycle blockage. In fact, the MRX complex binds critically short telomeres, recruits telomerase and activates the DDR through the downstream action of Tel1p. Artificially placing Tbf1p-bound T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> repeats in subtelomeric regions shortens the respective telomeres, as Tbf1p inhibits MRX binding of telomeres, thus preventing the initiation of the DDR, cell cycle blockage and telomerase recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Berthiau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fukunaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Ribaud et al., 2012</xref>). The inhibition of telomerase recruitment by Tbf1p also explains the shorter T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> tracts detected in humanized yeasts carrying two copies of chromosome XVI.</p><p id="P33">Overall, our results point to an evolutionary scenario in which aneuploidy of chromosome XVI and amplification of Tbf1p is the first adaptation to the modification of telomeric sequences, due to its high frequency. However, given its fitness cost, it is removed as soon as less burdening point mutations in the DDR and MRX complex appear. Instead, if the adaptive point mutations do not occur, another strategy is to remove the parts of the duplicated chromosome XVI that are not immediately useful, only retaining duplicated segments encompassing the <italic>TBF1</italic> gene. This scenario is in line with previous research showing that aneuploidy and copy number variations are quick responses to environmental stress whose role is to give time to the cells to develop more specific and losg-lasting genetic changes in the form of point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Yona et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P34">T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> repeats are thought to be the ancestral ones from which all the others evolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Fulnečková et al., 2013</xref>). Going back to an ancestral state might be easier than adapting to completely new challenges. This view is consistent with the fact that Tbf1p is functionally related to the telomere protective proteins TRFs in animals, and particularly in its DNA binding domain interacting specifically with T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> repeats (Bilaud et al., 1996). Therefore, yeasts might behave differently if evolved with other telomeric sequences and in different environmental conditions. Mutations in the telomerase RNA template cause growth defects and telomere length dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">McEachern &amp; Blackburn, 1995</xref>), but it is not known how these strains would survive and adapt when propagated under selection for a long time. Recently, a variant telomeric repeat has been identified in a human family and shown to be inherited across one generation, indicating that telomere sequence modification is possible even in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hinchie et al., 2024</xref>). Moreover, telomeric sequences can be introgressed from other species following horizontal gene transfer events, as exemplified by the discovery of mixed telomeric sequences in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> natural isolates, constituted by centromere-proximal <italic>Torulaspora</italic> telomeric repeats followed by native TG<sub>1-3</sub> telomeric repeats (O’ Donnell et al., 2023). Future studies investigating the long-term impact of other telomeric repeats, as well as their interactions with the external environment, will further elucidate how cells can evolve dysfunction in key cellular processes.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p id="P35">The two ancestor strains (one for the humanized and one for the wild-type lines) derive from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bah et al., 2004</xref>) and their genetic background is: RWY12 (BY4741 <italic>Mat</italic>a, <italic>ura3-52, lys2–801, ade2-101, trp1</italic>-Δ<italic>1, his3</italic>-Δ<italic>200, leu2</italic>-Δ<italic>1, tlc1</italic>Δ<italic>::LEU2</italic>, VR-<italic>ADE2</italic>-T) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dionne &amp; Wellinger, 1996</xref>).

Telomere length and ITS content were measured separately for the TG<sub>1-3</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> motifs. For TG<sub>1-3</sub> we used the published version of Y<sup>ea</sup>ISTY, while we developed a new version compatible with the T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> motif for this study. We used a threshold of 20 bp of telomeric repeats stretch length for TG<sub>1-3</sub>, and a threshold of 18 bp for T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub>. By comparing our results with the estimates derived from long-read genome assemblies, we determined that our lengths were underestimated and the underestimation was particularly pronounced for the T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> repeat. This is likely due to the fact that the T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> motif is longer and more complex than TG<sub>1-3</sub> and sequencing errors are more prone to disrupt the continuity of T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub> stretches. As a consequence, we avoid direct comparison of total telomere lengths (TG<sub>1-3</sub>+T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub>) between humanized and wild-type yeasts.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Chromosome-ends annotations from long-read genome assemblies</title><p id="P56">X and Y’ elements were annotated using LRSDAY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Yue &amp; Liti, 2018</xref>).
