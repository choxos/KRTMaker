Successful closure requires elongation and apical constriction of neuroepithelial cells. These critical behaviours have not been studied in human, patient-specific models. We characterise a human iPSC-derived neuroepithelial morphogenesis model which is highly reproducible between lines. Differentiated neuroepithelial cells actively undergo ROCK-dependent apical constriction. ROCK acts downstream of planar cell polarity/VANGL2 in other species. We find that VANGL2 is up-regulated and phosphorylated during iPSCs-to-neuroepithelial differentiation. The patient-identified <italic>VANGL2-R353C</italic> mutation does not alter its expression, localisation or phosphorylation, but reduces myosin-II phosphorylation and apical constriction relative to congenic control iPSCs. Non-congenic comparisons and forward genetic testing are also informative in this reproducible model. We compare lines reprogrammed from amniocytes of two patients with spina bifida, versus two controls. One patient-derived line forms a morphologically normal neuroepithelium, but fails to differentiate into neurons. The second fails to undergo apicobasal elongation, and harbours compound heterozygous mutations in the <italic>MED24</italic> gene previously implicated in neuroepithelial elongation in mice. Thus, iPSC-derived neuroepithelial modelling provides mechanistic insights into conserved cell behaviours, links genetically-impaired apical constriction with a human disease, and establishes patient-specific models which recapitulate failures of heterogenous neuroepithelial functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Neural tube defects</kwd><kwd>apical constriction</kwd><kwd>iPSC</kwd><kwd>planar cell polarity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Neural tube defects (NTDs), such as spina bifida and anencephaly, affect approximately 1:1,000 births globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. These severe neurodevelopmental malformations are caused by abnormal morphogenesis of the neural tube during embryonic development. The most severe NTDs result from failure of the physical process of neural tube closure, which in humans is completed by approximately 30 days gestation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Completion of this morphogenetic process during largely inaccessible stages of pregnancy has limited our ability to study it in humans. This challenge is compounded by the multigenic causation of NTDs, as well as interactions of both maternal and embryonic genetics with environmental factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Consequently, few patients receive an interpretable genetic diagnosis. Typically, patient-identified mutations have been functionally validated in transgenic animal models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Mice and other vertebrates have been invaluable models for understanding the process of neural tube closure. Both mice and humans close their open neural tube regions – called neuropores – through progressive elevation of neural folds which meet at the dorsal midline and zipper along the body axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The progression of closure requires the action of different cell types, particularly the surface ectoderm (future epidermis) and neuroepithelium (future brain and spinal cord)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. These cells coordinate multiple behaviours within and between each other: neuroepithelial cells thicken along their apicobasal axis as they differentiate into a pseudostratified epithelium which undergoes interkinetic nuclear migration synchronised with cell cycle progression, superimposed on active apical constriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Neuroepithelial apical constriction is an evolutionarily conserved force-generating mechanism which contributes to neural tube closure in chordates including amphibians, birds and mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. It requires targeted localisation and phosphorylation of non-muscle myosin II in the cell’s apical domain. Myosin binds filamentous (F-)actin, cross-linking filaments and generating contractile mechanical force through power strokes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Neuroepithelial apical enrichment of F-actin and phosphorylation of myosin both require Rho-associated kinase (ROCK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, which is in turn apically localised at least in part by signalling through the non-canonical wingless homology (Wnt)/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. PCP components promote neuroepithelial apical constriction in <italic>Xenopus</italic> frogs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, chickens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, but this pathway has been difficult to study in human epithelial models due to lack of quantifiable readouts relevant to this pathway’s functions <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P6">PCP was originally described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a regulator of polarised cell features such as hair cell bristle orientation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Pathway components were later shown to be conserved in vertebrates and contribute to neural tube closure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. The core PCP pathway involves signalling through asymmetric receptor complexes on adjacent cells, pairing van Gogh-like (VANGL) and Cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor (CELSR) proteins on one cell, with frizzled (FZD)/CELSR complexes on the adjacent cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Both VANGL and FZD branches of this pathway are involved in neural tube closure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, although the roles of VANGL2 are best understood in mice. VANGL2 can be activated through phosphorylation following binding of PCP Wnt ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">PCP signalling drives two functionally distinct processes in neuroepithelial cells essential for mammalian NT closure: early convergent extension and later apical constriction. Global genetic deletion of <italic>Vangl2</italic> precludes medial convergence and rostro-caudal elongation necessary to initiate neural tube closure in mouse embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, although this effect may be partly mediated by the adjacent mesoderm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. At later developmental stages, however, VANGL2 promotes cytoskeletal reorganisation involving F-actin planar polarisation and phosphorylation of non-muscle myosin IIB, likely by ROCK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. We previously reported that VANGL2-dependent enhancement of apical constriction increases apical tension required to elevate the neural folds in the spinal region of mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and others have implicated it in apical constriction of the anterior neuroepithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Mutations in PCP genes including <italic>VANGL2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> have been identified in patients who have NTDs and damaging variants in actomyosin-related cytoskeletal regulation are enriched in individuals with spina bifida<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. However, it has been challenging to study the regulation of apical constriction in human neuroepithelial cell models. A previous study described elegant modelling of neural tube closure by differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) on micropatterned surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. That model’s formation of neuroepithelium enveloped within a larger cyst limits access to its apical surface for functional measurements, such as inference of mechanical tension through laser ablation assays. Similarly, previous studies have demonstrated that disruption of actomyosin regulation dilates apical surfaces on the inside of human iPSC-derived neuroepithelial spheres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Several models have also been described which enable studies into later stages of neuroepithelial function as they differentiate into neural progenitors and then neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. While these neurogenesis models provide insights into later differentiation, they do not capture cell behaviours crucial for neural tube closure.</p><p id="P9">We previously characterised a minimal model of neuroepithelial morphogenesis in which a monolayer of cuboidal iPSCs apicobasally elongate into a complex, pseudostratified neuroepithelium with a planar morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Importantly, this model presents readily accessible neuroepithelial apical surfaces which are directly comparable in size with those of mouse embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Moreover, the same protocol can be extended to differentiate neuroepithelial cells into cortical neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. This enables sequential assessment of neuroepithelial functions relevant to generating mechanical deformations which close the neural tube and their subsequent differentiation which normally occurs after completion of closure. Here, we show that neuroepithelial development in this model is reproducible, even when comparing non-congenic iPSC lines. We validate use of the model to study PCP components including ROCK and VANGL2, finding that a <italic>VANGL2</italic> point mutation previously identified in a patient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> diminishes neuroepithelial apical constriction. Extension of the model to two iPSC lines derived from individuals who have spina bifida identifies line-specific deficiencies potentially relevant to their malformation. Strikingly, all three NTD-relevant lines – <italic>VANGL2</italic> point mutation and two patient-derived lines – present failures of distinct neuroepithelial functions, recapitulating the heterogeneity of these conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Lineage-specific marker expression precedes morphological changes during iPSC to neuroepithelium differentiation</title><p id="P10">Intra-line variability often limits the use of iPSCs to model multigenic diseases, such as NTDs, in which congenic controls are often impractical.

We illustrate this using three previously reported iPSC lines from healthy individuals, selected to represent different origins and reprogramming methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>).

Apicobasal elongation increases total epithelial volume, accommodating ongoing cell division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, yet the volume of individual cells decreases from 1,550 μm<sup>3</sup> at the start of differentiation to 500 μm<sup>3</sup> at the end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref>).

In contrast, the spina bifida line GOSB2 fails to apicobasally elongate as much as other lines and retains larger apical areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b-e</xref>). We consider this is unlikely to represent an apical constriction defect: laser ablation assays show comparable retraction in the GOSB2 line compared with the other lines tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). The epithelia they form include mitotic cells which are not apically-located, in contrast to all other cells studied which are pseudostratified and localise their mitoses apically (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>).

Each of resulting gene lists was then cross-referenced with the most current compilation of mouse models associated with NTDs, as documented in Lee and Gleeson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Two additional gene lists were generated based on searches in ClinVar database for entries linked to "Neural Tube Defect" and "Spina Bifida" (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Collectively, these identified a subset of variant genes associated with NTDs. These were subsequently filtered by sequency ontology severity score, and the allele frequencies of high impact variants was determined using gnomAD v4.1.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Statistical analysis and reproducibility</title><p id="P54">Comparisons between two groups were by Student’s t-test accounting for homogeneity of variance in SPSS (IBM Statistics 25). Comparison of multiple groups was first tested for normality and homogeneity of variance in Origin 2020 (Origin Labs). According to the result if samples were normally distributed an ANOVA test was performed, while for non-parametric datasets a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was used in Origin 2020 (Origin Labs). Post-hoc pairwise analysis was performed to determine the statistical significance. P values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. All graphs were generated in Origin 2020. Replicates were defined as technical replicates (same iPSC line cultured at the same time) or biological replicates (different iPSC lines or same line cultured independently). In the case of VANGL2 knock-in lines, two clones were compared with their congenic control line. To avoid bias, blinding and randomisation was performed were possible by asking a lab member to rename copied files, without disclosing cell line information prior to analysis. However, changes of neuroepithelial thickness across time points days was too dramatic to not know which day was analysed and morphological differences of GOSB3 also precluded blinding.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Table</label><media xlink:href="EMS205706-supplement-Supplementary_Table.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d14aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figures and Legends</label><media xlink:href="EMS205706-Supplementary_Figures_and_Legends.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d14aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Prof F Livesey and Dr F Paonessa for their assistance in establishing the dual-SMAD inhibition protocol in our lab and provision of SFC086-03-01 as a reference line.

Sub-confluent human iPSCs (in grey) are passaged and seeded at full confluency from the start of differentiation and cultured for eight days, until reaching neuroepithelial maturity. Further passage at this stage forms neural rosettes and allows further differentiation into post-mitotic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. <bold>b,</bold> Summary of control lines used to validate reproducibility of differentiation into neuroepithelial cells. <bold>c,d,</bold> Representative high-resolution confocal top-view (<bold>c</bold>) and cross-section (<bold>d</bold>) images of day 2-8 cultures fluorescently labelled to show F-actin with inverted gray LUT.
