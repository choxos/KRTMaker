The viral non-structural protein NS3 is a membrane-bound AAA+ ATPase of superfamily 3 (SF3) with multiple proposed roles in the norovirus replication cycle. However, the structure of NS3, and the mechanisms by which it contributes to genome replication and membrane remodeling, have remained unknown. We engineered a soluble, hexameric, and catalytically active form of NS3 and determined its cryo-EM structure in the presence of a nucleotide analogue at 2.9 Å resolution. The structure adopts a split lock-washer architecture characteristic of AAA+ motors that operate via a hand-over-hand translocation mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Modeling of the nucleotide-binding site reveals conserved features governing ATP binding and hydrolysis. Using integrative modeling with AlphaFold3, we generated a full-length, membrane-associated model of NS3, in which an N-terminal transmembrane domain, central helical bundle, and AAA+ motor form a continuous conduit. This model supports a role for NS3 as a candidate membrane-spanning RNA translocase that couples ATP hydrolysis to genome movement. This structural framework helps address long-standing gaps in our understanding of norovirus replication and establishes a basis for mechanistic studies and structure-guided antiviral design.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Norovirus</kwd><kwd>NTPase</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>AAA+ ATPase</kwd><kwd>Translocase</kwd><kwd>SF3 helicase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">HuNoVs pose a substantial health burden to society, contributing to ~700 million infections and over 200,000 annual deaths. These viruses are the primary cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis, often referred to as “stomach flu” or “stomach bug”, marked by symptoms such as sudden onset diarrhea and vomiting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Compounding this impact, the global economy suffers an approximate cost of €60 billion annually, encompassing expenses related to lost workdays and healthcare expenditures linked to these infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Transmission of the virus occurs primarily through the fecal-oral route, facilitated by contact with infected individuals or exposure to contaminated food, water, or infectious aerosols generated by vomiting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This high infectivity and efficient transmission give rise to the potential for newly emerging norovirus strains to spark worldwide epidemics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Notably, despite these risks, there are currently no approved vaccines or antiviral treatments targeting noroviruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Noroviruses are non-enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses classified within the genus <italic>Norovirus</italic> and the family <italic>Caliciviridae</italic>. Together with enteroviruses, another notable group of human pathogens, noroviruses belong to the order <italic>Picornavirales</italic>, a diverse assemblage of RNA viruses that infect animals, protists, and plants. Within the genomes of these viruses, there is a characteristic three-domain replication block (Hel-Pro-Pol), which comprises a putative <underline>hel</underline>icase belonging to the SF3 clade of AAA+ ATPases, a chymotrypsin-like <underline>pro</underline>teinase and a superfamily I RNA-dependent RNA <underline>pol</underline>ymerase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The norovirus protease and polymerase, NS6 and NS7, have been studied by X-ray crystallography and the molecular basis for their enzymatic activity is understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. However, no such information is available for the norovirus NS3, which has been implicated as having multiple functions within the norovirus replication cycle, including: i) ATP-dependent helicase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, ii) ATP-independent RNA chaperoning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, iii) rearrangement of intracellular membrane alterations during replication organelle formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, and iv) the induction of apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">SF3 helicases typically assemble into hexameric rings and couple ATP hydrolysis to conformational changes that generate mechanical force on nucleic acid substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. These enzymes possess three conserved motifs essential for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, Walker A, Walker B, and motif C, all of which are present in norovirus NS3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. In DNA viruses, SF3 proteins function as replicative helicases, and several oligomeric structures have been resolved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. However, no functional oligomeric assembly of an SF3 protein from an RNA virus has been structurally characterized to date, although crystal structures of picornaviral 2C AAA+ domains have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. This has left a gap in our mechanistic understanding of the replication machinery employed by positive-strand RNA viruses.</p><p id="P7">Here, we present the first structure of the norovirus NS3 protein in a nucleotide analog-bound state. Through integrative modeling, we propose that NS3 functions as a transmembrane RNA translocase, coupling membrane-associated genome replication to RNA transport. This insight may fundamentally reshape our understanding of SF3 protein function in positive-strand RNA viruses. Our findings not only open new avenues for exploring how noroviruses replicate and package their genomes, but also provide a structural blueprint for targeting NS3 in future antiviral strategies.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Engineering a soluble and enzymatically active NS3 hexamer</title><p id="P8">Sequence homology with known SF3 proteins and predictive modeling indicates that NS3 comprises an N-terminal membrane-binding domain (NTD), a helical bundle domain (HBD), and a C-terminal AAA+ ATPase domain containing the signature Walker A, Walker B, and motif C required for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Previous studies on homologous picornavirus 2C proteins have shown that their N-terminal amphipathic helix renders recombinant proteins poorly soluble but is necessary for efficient formation of enzymatically active hexamers; this requirement has thus far precluded structural studies of SF3 protein quaternary structures from RNA viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Previously, we demonstrated that enzymatic ATPase activity can be restored in picornaviral 2C protein when arranged in a hexameric complex by replacing the NTD with a synthetic hexamerization domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">To rationally engineer a soluble recombinant HuNoV NS3 construct that retains the ability to form functional oligomers, we first generated AlphaFold2 predictions of the hexameric complex for HuNoV. These models indicated a suitable truncation site between the NTD and HBD, resulting in a construct lacking the first 61 amino acids of NS3, annotated as ΔN61 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). We then inserted a soluble hexamerization domain, cc-hex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and a linker region before our ΔN61 NS3 construct. To facilitate expression and purification, we added an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag (His6) and an MBP-tag to the N-terminus of our hex-ΔN61-NS3 construct, separated by a 3C protease cleavage site (MBP-hex-NS3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). For comparison, we also generated the equivalent ΔN61 NS3 construct without the hexamerization domain (MBP-NS3).</p><p id="P10">Following expression in E. coli and purification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), we tested the ATPase activity of our MBP-tagged NS3 constructs using the malachite green assay, which detects free phosphate produced by nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis. To confirm NS3-specific ATP hydrolysis, we substituted the critical Walker B residue D213 with alanine, which abolished ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similarly, no detectable enzymatic activity was observed for the monomeric construct, highlighting the importance of oligomerization for nucleotide triphosphatase activity.</p><p id="P11">Subsequent removal of the MBP-tag demonstrated that both the monomeric and hexameric constructs remained soluble. To assess the oligomeric states of our NS3 constructs, we employed mass photometry and native mass spectrometry analyses. While NS3 in the absence of the cc-hex domain (33.6 kDa) was found to form primarily monomers and dimers, hex-NS3 (38.2 kDa) formed higher oligomers ranging from trimers to hexamers, highlighting the importance of the N-terminal region for oligomerization in NS3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). We then confirmed that the untagged hex-NS3 retains ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Due to its slightly higher activity and less involved purification protocol, the MBP-tagged construct was used for future NTPase assays described in this study.</p><p id="P12">The nucleotide specificity of NS3 was tested by providing different nucleoside triphosphates (ATP, GTP, CTP, TTP, and UTP) as substrates. NS3 exhibited a preference for ATP, followed by GTP, with ~3-fold lower activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Notably, this contrasts with earlier studies that reported minimal discrimination between nucleotides by NS3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. As a prelude to structural analysis, we assessed whether Adenosine 5′-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS) could compete for binding to the orthosteric site and thus serve as a suitable nucleotide analogue to capture the <italic>holo</italic> complex by cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM). Our results demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in ATP hydrolysis in the presence of increasing concentrations of ATPγS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>), underscoring its utility for structural studies.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cryo-EM analysis of the NS3 hexamer</title><p id="P13">To assess the suitability of our hex-NS3 construct for structural studies, we first evaluated sample quality using negative stain electron microscopy (EM). Prior to grid preparation, hex-NS3 was incubated with ATPγS to stabilize the nucleotide-bound state. Micrographs revealed monodisperse, ring-shaped particles consistent with a hexameric assembly. In addition, we infrequently observed filamentous structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). Subsequent 2D classification of the ATPγS-bound sample yielded class averages consistent with the expected oligomeric architecture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We next prepared cryo-EM grids and determined a three-dimensional reconstruction of the ATPγS-bound hex-NS3 complex at a global resolution of 2.9 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 5-6</xref>). The resulting structure shows that six copies of NS3 assemble into a funnel-shaped hexamer approximately 80 Å in height. The HBD and AAA+ ATPase domain form upper and lower tiers measuring ~70 Å and ~105 Å in diameter, respectively. Unlike the C6-symmetric model predicted by AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>), our cryo-EM reconstruction adopts a split lock-washer conformation, previously described in other AAA+ ATPases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The six subunits form a right-handed spiral with a rise of ~1.5 Å per protomer and a gap of ~6.5 Å between the topmost and bottommost subunits. Notably, the HBDs make minimal, if any, lateral contacts with each other.</p><p id="P15">Next, we generated an atomic model encompassing residues 64–363 across all six subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>), as well as 204 water molecules. At the tertiary structure level, our cryo-EM model agrees closely with AlphaFold2 predictions. The RMSD across all aligned atoms ranged from 3.2 to 5.4 Å, with even better agreement for the AAA+ domain alone (RMSD 0.9–1.2 Å). Structurally, the HBD adopts a four-helix bundle (residues 64–148), connected to the AAA+ domain by a five-residue linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). As expected, residues 154–363 form a canonical Rossmann fold, with all conserved SF3 motifs well-resolved. We also modelled two pore loops: residues 192–207 (pore loop 1) and residues 230–252 (pore loop 2).</p><p id="P16">Structural homology analysis using Foldseek and DALI confirmed strong similarity between the AAA+ domain and picornaviral 2C proteins, papillomaviral E1 helicases, and Rep helicases from single-stranded DNA viruses. For the NS3 HBD, AtBAG1, a BAG-family co-chaperone from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, was identified as the closest experimentally determined structural homolog<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. To further explore the evolutionary relationship between NS3 and other viral SF3 helicases, we conducted structure-based phylogenetic analysis using available high-resolution structures of AAA+ domains from SF3 helicases. This analysis showed that NS3 clusters closely with 2C proteins from members of the family <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 8</xref>), reinforcing their shared ancestry and structural conservation within the order <italic>Picornavirales</italic>.</p><p id="P17">Finally, RMSD calculations across all six protomers revealed only minor angular deviations in the HBD–AAA+ orientation for subunits A and F at the seam (0.4–0.8 Å), indicating minimal conformational variability within the hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The orientation of the HBD relative to the AAA+ domain appears to be stabilized by intramolecular salt bridges between D252 and two lysine residues, K95 and K99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Structural basis for ATP binding and hydrolysis</title><p id="P18">The catalytic site of SF3 ATPases is formed at the interface between two adjacent subunits. One subunit provides the cis-acting Walker A, Walker B, and motif C residues, while the neighboring subunit contributes the trans-acting arginine finger. In our NS3 cryo-EM reconstruction, clear density corresponding to ATPγS is visible in all six nucleotide-binding sites, although it is less well resolved in protomer F, which lies at the seam of the hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A–F</xref>). At each site, the triphosphate moiety of ATPγS is coordinated by the P-loop, with the β-phosphate forming interactions with the backbone amides of G165, G167, and K168 (Walker A). The lysine side chain is positioned to interact with both the β- and γ-phosphates. In five of the six sites, resolved to ~2 Å, we observed hexavalent coordination of a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion by the β- and γ-phosphates, the side chain of T169, and three water molecules. Solvent molecules in this primary hydration shell form hydrogen bonds with D213 (Walker B) and D231 (part of pore loop 2). A water molecule located between N259 and D213 in these five sites is likely positioned for nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-D</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Subunits A–E show the γ-phosphate interacting with R276 and R277 (arginine finger), as well as with N259 (motif C), supporting their classification as ATP-bound. In contrast, subunit F adopts an apo-like conformation, as the arginine finger is displaced across the seam and does not engage the bound nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Additional stabilizing interactions in the ATP-bound subunits include a hydrogen bond between the ribose 3′ hydroxyl of ATPγS and R154. At the base recognition level, the adenine ring is sandwiched between K170 and F307, stabilized through cation–π and π–π stacking interactions. A water molecule is also observed forming hydrogen bonds with the ATPγS imidazole ring, the backbone carbonyl of G167, and the side chain of H313. The nucleotide-binding pocket is further reinforced by a cation–π interaction between R293, located in a helix–turn–helix motif, and F332 in the neighboring protomer. Upstream, Q321 engages in hydrogen bonds with the backbone atoms of V278 and R276, helping to stabilize the helix that presents the arginine finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G–H</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Due to the unavailability of infectious clones for HuNoV, to validate the functional relevance of these residues, we introduced corresponding mutations into the NS3 protein of murine norovirus (MNV) and assessed viral infectivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). Mutations that disrupted the cation–π interaction or destabilized the helix–turn–helix motif resulted in complete loss of infectivity, consistent with the structural role these residues play in catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Architecture of the NS3 pore loops</title><p id="P21">Within our NS3 structure, we identified two pore loops, both of which were resolved at approximately 2–3 Å resolution in our cryo-EM reconstruction. These loops are located beneath a solvent-accessible chamber formed by the HBDs, with an estimated volume of 19,400 Å<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Pore loop 2 defines a central channel approximately 15 Å in diameter, sufficient to accommodate single-stranded RNA, into which the hydrophobic side chain of I242 projects. The two pore loops are stabilized by inter-protomer hydrogen bonding and packing of side chains W200, L237 and F249. At the subunit level, pore loops 1 and 2 are closely associated, forming an average interface area of approximately 420 Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). With the exception of subunits A and F, located at the seam of the hexamer, pore loops from adjacent subunits form inter-subunit contacts, averaging ~360 Å<sup>2</sup> in interface area. These contacts are mediated by electrostatic interactions between D240 and K245, as well as intermolecular hydrogen bonds involving the side chains of R194 and R241 with the backbone carbonyls of K245 and P245, which collectively help stabilize the central pore architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P22">To functionally validate the importance of these structural features, we introduced targeted mutations into the MNV NS3 pore loops. In line with our structural observations, most mutations completely abolished viral infectivity. Only upon mutation of K246 to an alanine or arginine, a small amount of infectious virus was recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). To further investigate the role of K245, we introduced K245A and K245E mutations into the recombinant HuNoV hex-NS3 construct and assessed their effects on ATPase activity. Both mutations impaired ATP hydrolysis, with the charge-reversing K245E mutation producing a more pronounced defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p id="P23">In five of the six ATP-binding sites, pore loop 2 residues D231 and S232 form solvent-mediated hydrogen bonds with the bound ATPγS molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F-G</xref>). In contrast, in subunit A, positioned at the top of the spiral near the seam, pore loop 2 is disengaged. This suggests it may be poised to sense the incoming ATP molecule in the adjacent subunit. Together, these observations indicate that coordination between the pore loops and the nucleotide-binding sites plays a central role in orchestrating sequential ATP hydrolysis across the hexamer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). Consistent with this model, mutations in key pore loop residues resulted in a complete loss of infectivity in the MNV system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>). Sequence analysis using ConSurf, based on 46 calicivirus NS3 sequences, revealed that these residues are highly conserved, highlighting their functional importance and potential as targets for pan-genotypic antiviral intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Comparison of NS3 to SF3 helicases from DNA viruses</title><p id="P24">Structural comparison of the NS3 complex with SF3 helicases from single- and double-stranded DNA viruses revealed several notable differences.

If NS3 indeed facilitates RNA translocation across membranes, it implies that genome synthesis may occur within a protected, membrane-bound compartment from which nascent RNA is exported for either translation or encapsidation. While such a luminal replication site has not yet been definitively identified, tomography studies of MNV and enterovirus-infected cells have identified single- and double-membrane compartments to accumulate in infected cells.

A total of 1,229,229 picked particles were extracted in a 76-pixel box. During extraction, particles were Fourier binned by a non-integer value, resulting in a final pixel size of 3.32 Å. A single round of two-dimensional (2D) classification was carried out, after which a subset of 2D classes containing 235,173 particles, corresponding to top and side views of the NS3 complex, were selected. Ab initio reconstruction with four classes generated one well-defined reconstruction of the NS3 hexamer and three junk classes. The resulting ab initio maps were then used as initial models for iterative rounds of heterogeneous refinement, where the particles belonging to the NS3 class were used as the input for subsequent rounds. To avoid missing NS3 particles that may have been removed during initial stringent selection of 2D classes, heterogeneous refinement was carried out on the initial particle stack of 1,229,229 particles. Five rounds of heterogeneous refinement yielded a well-defined reconstruction of the NS3 complex containing 123,643 particles. These were then re-extracted unbinned in a 300-pixel box, resulting in a final pixel size of 0.9 Å. Subsequently, non-uniform refinement was carried out on the extracted particles with C1 symmetry imposed, yielding a reconstruction with a global resolution of 2.9 Å. The gold standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) criterion (FSC = 0.143) was used for calculating all resolution estimates, and 3D-FSC plots were generated in the 3DFSC Processing Server<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>.

Each assay was performed once, and all measurements were acquired from that single experiment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206975-f005"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Proposed model for the full-length NS3 complex.</title><p>(A) Cartoon representation of residues 1–61 from the AlphaFold3 prediction of the full-length HuNoV NS3 hexamer in the presence of 50 oleic acid molecules. The model is colored by confidence score (predicted local distance difference test, pLDDT), with blue indicating high-confidence regions and yellow indicating low-confidence regions. (B) Cylindrical representation of the model shown in (A), with the two transmembrane helices labeled and colored by chain. (C) Surface representation of the NS3 transmembrane pore, colored according to hydrophobicity using the Kyte-Doolittle scale, shown in two orthogonal views. (D) As in (C) but colored by electrostatic surface potential. (E) Surface representation of an integrative model of the full-length NS3 complex embedded in a membrane bilayer (left), and a central cross-section (right) highlighting a putative RNA translocation pathway.
