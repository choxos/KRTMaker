Moving beyond fear conditioning, extinction and habits formed by associative learning, we consider conserved neuromodulatory mechanisms related to harm expectation, defensive mobilisation, and context (in)sensitivity. Our account of harm-mitigating, neurobehavioural responses furnishes a mechanistic understanding of maladaptive behaviour and impaired belief-updating, which are often underspecified in conceptual analyses. Grounded in neurobiological evidence, we specify PTSD-related impairment in terms of Bayesian belief-updating, and establish an adaptive/maladaptive boundary using active inference and simulation studies. The ensuing model plausibly illustrates PTSD pathogenesis, which remains understudied relative to aetiology. We locate pathogenesis in maladaptive precision following traumatic learning, characterised by aberrant Bayesian credit assignment. Future scientific and clinical studies can test the validity of these insights, which could underwrite our understanding of the phenomenology, diagnostics and ultimately treatment intervention in post-traumatic disorders.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">During traumatic experiences, the imperative to mitigate against severe harm requires an intense mobilisation of biological subsystems, an ‘emergency response mode’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> However, multiple factors involved in the traumatic experience, its traumatic memory and the experience-dependent plasticity of the traumatised person can lead this emergency response mode to become persistent, that is, maladaptive. Here, we focus on modelling post-traumatic pathogenesis as the process by which a trauma schema (or ‘mode’) becomes persistent and, in turn, causes a wide range of post-traumatic stress syndromes (PTSS), including those related to mental imagery (e.g., ‘flashbacks’). The modelling also illustrates the process of returning to a pre-traumatic response mode, to suggest how PTSS treatment interventions could target the root cause of symptoms. In contrast to reductionist accounts that can lead to over-medicalisation, this computational approach is consistent with a biopsychosocial understanding of post-traumatic disorders.</p><p id="P3">The present work models conserved neuromodulatory and sensorimotor mechanisms related to harm expectation, defensive mobilisation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and the associative learning of causes and consequences (model-based learning).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> The modelling remains compatible with multiple accounts of fear and extinction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> without relying on these constructs, by shifting the focus to the general construct of harm. Perceptibly harmful administrations of pain, electric shock, restraint, etc., are common to experimental paradigms of fear conditioning and extinction in (non-human) animals. A capacity for harm perception, expectation, and mitigation is necessarily evolutionarily conserved, as an abundance of harm negatively impacts the survival of individuals and species.</p><p id="P4">The notion of expectation has been readily operationalised using a range of comparable theories including Hebbian learning, spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), predictive coding, and embodied cognition frameworks broadly known under ‘Bayesian brain’ or ‘predictive processing’ descriptions, sometimes specified as active inference (applied here). These theoretical approaches relate to methodologies for understanding and measuring correspondences between neural substrates and behaviour. Computational psychiatry commonly incorporates these methodologies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> found in an emerging body of research on understanding traumatic experience and PTSS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">Neurobehavioural response patterns necessary for survival form the basis of our PTSD modelling. The sequence of agent-environment interactions engaging these neural mechanisms are: (1) learning about the sources of harm in multiple contexts; (2) learning when harm is probable; (3) making a (fallible) judgement about the likelihood of imminent harm; and (4) responding defensively only when harm is likely. Grounded in the anticipation of harm under varied conditions, the model remains consistent with experimental studies of fear conditioning and extinction in animal models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> in addition to observational and case studies of human PTSD and related clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> Nevertheless, we argue that probabilistic learning about contexts is central to understanding post-traumatic impairments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> beyond associative (model-free) mechanisms often used to describe traumatic learning.</p><p id="P6">From this perspective, there are extensive commonalities between non-traumatic and traumatic experiences. By drawing on the sciences of visual attention, multimodal perception, memory, and sleep, and combining them with neuromodulatory systems neuroscience, we articulate a general neuropsychological and neurobehavioral account that illustrates a putative pathogenesis of disorders related to sequelae of traumatic stress including PTSD and CPTSD. This account informs a novel neurocomputational model that highlights biopsychosocial dynamics relevant to diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Overview</title><p id="P7">A brief formulation of our analysis is linked below to modelling (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S3">Results</xref>) and background literature (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Online Methods</xref>). Throughout, we underscore contiguities between realistic experiential narratives and common experimental paradigms (e.g., psychophysics). This approach extends our theoretical account beyond neurobiology and facilitates future empirical testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup></p><p id="P8">From the standpoint of an individual in a new situation, there may be ambiguity as to whether the surrounding context is one in which harm is likely (harmful context) or unlikely (harmless context). Ordinarily, determinations of context (harmful vs. harmless) are made by gathering sensory evidence to reach a decision. The belief that I am in one context and not the other should ideally persist to some extent as a (contextual) prior belief, but should also decay, in order to strike a balance between (a) maintaining the belief that I am still in the same context and (b) re-assessing whether the context has changed.</p><p id="P9">Our theory describes PTSD pathogenesis as a process by which the balance between harmless and harmful contextual priors is lost. Here, the prior belief in a harmful context grows (in precision) beyond a critical tipping point. Once reached, the aforementioned decay rate is insufficient for rebalancing with contextual priors for harmless context.</p><p id="P10">Following traumatic exposure to a harmful context, the imbalance occurs depending on resilience or vulnerability. For a resilient phenotype, the learning rate for harmful context is sufficient to preclude an imbalance between contextual priors. In contrast, if prior beliefs about the presence of a harmful context become unduly strong, then opportunities for re-assessing context will be continually foregone. The foregoing of contextual re-assessment will persist for harmless contexts, due to the (false) belief they are harmful. Moreover, without re-assessment, a (false) conclusion that the context is harmful will in turn be (mis)counted as new (false) evidence that the context is indeed harmful – thus continually strengthening the false contextual belief in a positive feedback loop, a ‘vicious circle’. This miscounting can be described as part of a confirmation bias in perceptual decision-making modelled by hierarchical approximate inference.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup></p><p id="P11">If PTSD pathogenesis occurs, a possible treatment intervention relates to the provision of evidence that I am in a harmless context, rather than a harmful one as believed <italic>a priori</italic>. For the treatment to succeed, I must accumulate enough evidence to update my contextual priors. Only then can I seek out novel situations and determine their true context, rather than giving undue weight to the harmful prior.</p><p id="P12">Below, we introduce a neuromodulatory circuit for a mechanistic understanding of PTSD-related phenomena. We then illustrate PTSD pathogenesis and treatment in model-based simulation studies (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S3">Results</xref>). To draw on the literature that supports our account, we also present an interlinked cognitive psychological framing of processes and mechanisms related to context recognition (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Online Methods</xref>). Under this framing, we identify contextual interactions with what is widely understood as Visual Working Memory (VWM). We also cover contextual interactions between long-term memory (LTM) and task-related generalisation. Interested readers may wish to have this general cognitive psychological description in place first as a foundation.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Neuromodulatory circuits and PTSD pathogenesis</title><p id="P13">We first focus on putative functional neuroanatomy, to hypothesize the neural pathways that subserve the psychological, cognitive, and physiological processes involved in our account. As an initial step, we draw connections between PTSS and a pontine neuromodulatory subsystem. We then provide a schema that brings this subsystem into correspondence with non-pathological and pathological neurobehavioral dynamics and relate these to psychiatric diagnostic criteria. Finally, we elaborate a long-range circuit relevant to pathogenesis and treatment of PTSD.</p><p id="P14">The reticular activating system (RAS) in the brainstem, implicated in sleep-wake cycle regulation, is a neurobiological locus of a range of sleep disorders connected to psychiatric conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> Under typical functioning, excitatory cholinergic projections from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPtg) to the locus coeruleus (LC) stimulate an inhibitory noradrenergic projection from the LC to the PPtg. In this PPtg-LC (excitation-inhibition) interaction, acetylcholine (ACh) and noradrenaline (NA) are mutually stabilising, resulting in a balance characteristic of attentive wakefulness. At the initiation of sleep, the PPtg continues to emit ACh but temporarily ceases excitation of the LC, resulting in a marked rise in ACh and diminishment of NA. If, however, this pontine ACh/NA subsystem is at an (aberrant) elevated tonic level, one would expect sleep to involve vivid trauma replay nightmares (elevated ACh) and gross body movements (elevated NA), both of which are characteristic of PTSD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup></p><p id="P15">The elevated tonic level may be held over from an adaptive (i.e., situationally apt) phasic elevation during a wakeful traumatic experience. During such an event, phasic elevation would aid harm mitigation efforts by increasing ACh for selective sensory gain and increasing NA for rapid behavioural response. Known PTSS are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, in relation to ACh and NA levels.</p><p id="P16">Following such an event, phasic levels should fall ahead of healthy sleep, such that memory can be re-encoded and re-organised in relation to event boundaries. Future reactions to trauma cues in new contexts could deploy attention to the sensory periphery to update beliefs about the veridical context (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, boxes A and 4A). However, if the phasic increase has not subsided prior to sleep, then disrupted sleep can hinder memory re-encoding and reorganisation, resulting in stronger subsequent activation during traumatic recall. This overly strong reactivation can provide sufficient evidence for a false context such that belief-updating about veridical conditions is hindered by peripheral sensory attenuation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, boxes B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, and 4B). If the phasic elevation endures, it can become effectively a new elevated tonic baseline, with wakeful hypervigilance and hyperarousal. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> illustrates how phasic elevation can become tonic elevation, and relates this to PTSD diagnostic criteria.</p><p id="P17">One ‘upstream’ reason the pontine ACh-NA subsystem may be disordered in wake and sleep is reduced activation of the serotonergic (5HT) inhibitory ‘brake’ from the Dorsal Raphe Nucleus (DRN). The inhibition and disinhibition emerges through a complex interplay of GABA and glutamate (Glu.) from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), limbic systems (LS), and basal ganglia (BG).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> Notably, altered GABA and Glu. levels and ratios have been found in PTSD impairment in contrast to unimpaired controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> Taken together, these findings suggest a long-range circuit, by which forebrain interactions across the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) can dampen DRN activity, thereby reducing the inhibitory influence of 5HT on pontine subsystems including the RAS, and especially the PPtg and LC. The PPtg and LC neuronal populations are the primary emitters of ACh and NA, respectively, with innervation throughout the brain in addition to reciprocal projections.</p><p id="P18">Excessive strength of the initial encoding of a traumatic experience is suggested by the increase in cholinergic stimulation from the PPtg to the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and Substantia Nigra (SN). This ACh stimulation in turn stimulates a dopaminergic (DA) pathway to the forebrain (PFC, LS, and other parts of the BG). A DA surge is known to increase memory plasticity and encoding strength, especially during emotionally significant experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> The full circuit is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>.</p><p id="P19">PTSD pathogenesis can be understood in relation to the circuit diagram as follows. A current or recalled traumatic experience releases the DRN ‘brake’ to raise ACh/NA for enhanced harm-mitigation (defensive response). A current harmful context will be strongly encoded with the potential to be easily cued. Later on, however, a resilient individual may experience cued traumatic recall, but with insufficient strength to resolve uncertainty about the present. This leads to peripheral sensory sampling, belief-updating about the veridical present, and subsequent applying of the DRN ‘brake’ to lower ACh/NA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P20">In a vulnerable individual, the overly strong recall of a harmful context may cascade through elevated ACh/NA, stimulated forebrain Glu. perfusion, and increased top-down excitement of VWM. Blending present visual sensation and recalled imagery in VWM (as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Online Methods</xref>) can lead to false contextual inference with rapidly evinced behaviours that an agent (falsely) believes are contextually apt. Thus, instead of an exploratory policy to resolve uncertainty about context, an exploitation policy is selected; namely, peripheral sensory attenuation and vigorous defence (e.g., fight or flight). This is consistent with a role for ACh enhancing attention to significant cues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> amounting to hypervigilance (readily cuing harmful context), while NA simultaneously enhances motor responsivity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> amounting to hyperarousal (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S4"><title>Neurocomputational simulations</title><p id="P21">We developed a neurocomputational model of interacting systems perspectives schematised here (see above and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Online Methods</xref>): the <italic>neurocognition of trauma associations</italic> including learning, memory, and context; the <italic>phenomenology and symptoms of PTSD</italic> and their relation to treatment intervention; and the <italic>neurobehavioural dynamics of</italic> and a <italic>neuromodulatory circuit for</italic> defensive mobilisation. We show that our neurocomputational implementation explains (i) natural waning of PTSS in resilient individuals under conditions of ordinary stress, (ii) persistence of such symptoms in predisposed individuals in similar conditions, (iii) recovery of context disambiguation through a learning-based intervention, and (iv) the limited role of symptom reduction through monoaminergic therapy on its own.</p><p id="P22">We simulated PTSD pathogenesis and treatment intervention based on a generative model that refines, extends, and operationalises previous work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> The simulation studies use a generative model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) to reproduce the pathogenesis of PTSD following a traumatic encounter and a successful and unsuccessful intervention. The learning and behavioural dynamics of the system are driven by uncertainty resolution (implemented as free energy minimisation).</p><p id="P23">In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, the contextual priors (labelled <bold>D</bold>) condition the initial state, which generates a contextually ambiguous observation (triangle). During the initial traumatic experience, the system advances along the horizontal arrow from the initial state to the second state. The state sequence is controlled by an exploratory scene sampling policy (‘two eyes’ pictogram) to resolve uncertainty about the context. This second state generates adverse (surprising) observations that can include a range of ‘harmful’ sensations, among them pain (e.g., being struck by shrapnel) and visual scenes that inflict moral injury (e.g., bearing witness to extreme suffering). The observation allows for a veridical contextual inference, updating the prior probability (red <bold>D</bold>) that one is in the harmful context.</p><p id="P24">Following the harmful traumatic experience, in a new harmless context, one begins in the initial state conditioned by the green <bold>D</bold>. This start state also generates a contextually ambiguous observation (triangle). In other words, the initial observation (triangle) is insufficient to disambiguate between the two alternative start states. The exploratory policy would progress the state sequence along the horizontal line to generate context-specific observations (squares). This disambiguates the two contexts, leading to a veridical inference of the harmless context.</p><p id="P25">However, if one begins in the ‘squares’ initial state (conditioned by the green <bold>D</bold>), and the contextual prior of the past (traumatic) context is unduly precise, it is sufficient to resolve the uncertainty about the context, such that the exploratory policy is not selected (it is falsely believed to be uninformative due to overly informative prior beliefs). This results in false contextual inference and selection of the (peripheral) sensory attenuation policy (‘partly covered eyes’ pictogram). We emphasise that this form of sensory attenuation is consistent with hypervigilance, amounting to rapid shifting of foreground focus without resolving contextual uncertainty.</p><p id="P26">From a first-person perspective, there is enough information that one is in the harmful context, even though from a third-person perspective, one is in the harmless context. Moreover, under the sensory attenuation policy, the foreground focus state (‘magnifying glass’ pictogram) generates the same observation irrespective of context. Like the initial observation, the focal observation is insufficient to disambiguate context, so the agent never learns they are in the harmless context. As long as the sensory attenuation policy is selected, no amount of observations will render prior beliefs obsolete, as in typical Bayesian learning. In past work, we proposed that in vulnerable brains, Bayesian learning ‘breaks’ because of an impairment in the ability to accumulate evidence that a context is benign (counterfactual blocking). Our simulation studies suggest that the specific weights of learning and forgetting, through which the memories of encounters with harmful and harmless contexts accumulate, interact with learning history to stabilise the inappropriate beliefs (see below and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="P27">A second aspect of the generative model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) does not drive the simulation dynamics but is included to illustrate a secondary process important for re-experiencing symptoms. It emerges from policy selection under the core model definition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). In this secondary process, high precision on a contextual prior can lead to a blend of sensation and imagery in VWM indicative of flashback phenomenology. A trauma-associated cue (triangle) can elicit multiple contexts (harmful and harmless) without sufficient information to disambiguate them. Under relatively balanced priors, the exploratory policy is selected (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> boxes 4A and A). High sensory precision can be allocated to the periphery, even when there is sparse contextual information (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> box 3). This allows for ‘bottom up’ sensory evidence accumulation about the present harmless context. Under highly imbalanced priors, with undue precision on the harmful context, the sensory attenuation policy is selected. This places low sensory precision on the periphery, allowing for VWM to be partly excited by ‘top down’ recalled imagery, i.e., from the past harmful context (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> boxes 4B and B<sub>1-2</sub>). In other words, a focal visual sensation would be congruent with focal mental imagery; this congruency combined with peripheral sensory attenuation and strong contextual imagery could meet a subjective ‘reality threshold’, amenable to experimental study in a reality testing paradigm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup></p><p id="P28">In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, we see the evolution of contextual priors in a resilient (left) and vulnerable (right) system. Each system starts with two attractor basins that represent the initial priors <bold>D</bold>, with harmless (left) and harmful (right). Following a short sequence of harmful trials (that represent a traumatic experience) – followed by an extended sequence of randomly allocated harmful and harmless trials (50/50) – we see how the resilient system is able to garner veridical contextual information and update its priors. This leads to balanced priors that bias the system towards the exploratory policy for learning the true state of the world. In the vulnerable system, we see what amounts to a ‘vicious circle’ that characterises PTSD and related stress disorders: the sensory attenuation policy prevents learning about the harmless context, which biases the system towards the sensory attenuation policy, and so on, in a self-reinforcing loop.</p><p id="P29">The resulting landscapes at the conclusion of both the resilient and vulnerable processes are consistent with recent neural recordings of macaque perceptual decision-making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> In the macaque study, neurons accumulate evidence for two alternative visual fixation target options preceding a saccade-to-target action. When there is ambiguity between the targets, decision time is longer, as sensory evidence accumulates to resolve the ambiguity. When there is bias towards one option, the decision time to reach a commitment (action) is faster, and the bias functions as greater ‘pre-accumulated’, or notional, evidence.</p><p id="P30">Our case is not about alternative perceptual targets, but the interpretation is similar.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> Following a cue (triangle) common to two contexts (squares and crosses), if there is insufficient evidence to resolve which context is present, then more evidence accumulation is required to resolve the ambiguity (higher decision time to commit). In our model, this is achieved by an additional timestep of peripheral sensory sampling, to accumulate contextual evidence for either squares or crosses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, boxes 4A and A). However, if there is a strong bias for one context (crosses), the contextual inference for crosses is made immediately, even if this amounts to committing to the incorrect decision when the true context is otherwise, i.e., false inference (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, boxes 4B and B<sub>1-2</sub>).</p><p id="P31">In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, the basin shape represents the contextual priors. The decision trajectory for resolving ambiguity must either continue to sensory sampling given the decision manifold under insufficient prior evidence (unstable equilibrium) or can forgo further sensory evidence due to a collapse into a single stable basin. The basins are illustrative data visualisations based on plots of the Dirichlet distribution <bold>D</bold>; they can be interpreted formally as the (free) energy landscape of a combined integration and decision-making network.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup></p><p id="P32">In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, we show that a successful intervention is one that restores context-sensitivity to behaviour, which facilitates the rebalancing of prior probabilities. This success may be facilitated with or without psychopharmacological support. For example, SSRIs may be used therapeutically to improve the potential for new learning.</p><p id="P33">However, psychotropic drugs (including SSRIs, benzodiazepines, or excessive alcohol consumption) can also show illusory success when they blunt context-sensitivity in ways that reduce PTSS, without new learning. Interventions of this sort are modelled via changing the precision of the likelihood mappings (representing sensory precision) and transition priors (representing prior precision). Numerically, these interventions were simulated by lowering precision in the corresponding <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold> tensors (under a generative model based upon a partially observed Markov decision process).</p><p id="P34">The disappearance of symptoms in the absence of context-sensitivity is insufficient to rebalance priors, leading symptomatic behaviour to return at equal or greater strength upon cessation of chemical intake. Conversely, cessation of (e.g.) a psychotherapeutic treatment that has restored context-sensitivity even before priors are fully rebalanced has the potential to lead eventually to rebalanced priors. This contrast between successful and unsuccessful PTSD treatment closely matches randomised controlled trial (RCT) results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup></p><boxed-text id="BX1" position="anchor"><p id="P35">Each diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7a-e</xref> can be interpreted as follows:</p><list list-type="bullet" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P36">The numbers along the bottom axis indicate the trial number in blocks of 60, comprising two alternative sequences of 180 trials (3 blocks of 60 each).

In this work, context refers to elements of the sensory or cognitive periphery that provide evidence for the states of affairs prior to belief-updating. Belief-updating here refers to inferring – and learning about – the causes of sensations through neuronal message passing and experience-dependent plasticity, respectively. Our simulations demonstrate the interdependence between inference and learning, and how biased inference can lead to aberrant learning and a failure to recognise changes in context. It is this failure we associate with the psychopathology of PTSD. Biased inference in this instance manifests as a failure of responding to epistemic affordances that leads to a failure to recognise the context has changed.</p><p id="P40">This kind of failure sits on a critical tipping point, leading to a phenomenal description of the ensuing inferences in terms of bistability, that can be related to the notion of canalisation in psychopathology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> While attractor basins are used in different ways to indicate neuronal dynamics, here, we have shown that plasticity can create unstable basins that bias the system toward sensory evidence accumulation to resolve ambiguity about the causes of sensations. In contrast, a collapse or canalisation into a single basin can cause a trajectory initiated by a sensory cue to become inescapably bound by the basin; resolving uncertainty through precise – but false – beliefs about the causes of sensations. Crucially, this resolution is self-maintaining because it precludes epistemic foraging or information seeking; thereby instantiating a vicious circle of confirmation bias. Restoring plasticity can make the system amenable to new learning, thus rebalancing priors and restoring the collapsed basin. The saddle point between basins corresponds to a reinstatement of context-sensitivity.</p><p id="P41">In a context where harm is highly likely, such as a combat zone, it is adaptive to have elevated ACh and NA, to remain vigilant against possible harm, and rapidly mobilize a defensive response for mitigating harm. Essentially, it is context-sensitive to be in a heightened alert state, ‘better safe than sorry’. After a transition into a context where harm is unlikely, it does not mean harm is impossible. A home neighbourhood may be largely harmless, but occasionally harms can arise. Thus, context-sensitivity requires sensory disambiguation on a case-by-case basis, as a tap on the shoulder could be from a friend or foe. It would be maladaptive to immediately respond to a shoulder tap with a vigorous fight/flight response, as this would be unwarranted if it were a friend. Yet, it would also be maladaptive to be ‘fearless’ and disregard learning whether the tap is indeed from a foe, which warrants self-protection.</p><p id="P42">We have provided modelling-informed analysis of PTSD pathogenesis and related sequelae of traumatic stress and their relationship to diagnostic criteria in terms of vulnerability and resilience. Our key hypothesis is that the balance of plasticity-enhancement and plasticity-decay for aversive events is greater in the vulnerable. We have also provided several novel auxiliary hypotheses that can be tested in controlled experiments (see above and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Online Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P43">Our analysis also provides a way to understand learning-based treatment mechanisms and how they might relate to (e.g.) monoaminergic interventions and substance abuse. Specifically, pharmacological interventions may enhance psychotherapies that support learning contextual disambiguation, through allocating attention to evidence for benign causes of current events, including aversive ones. This is a putative mechanism of action of entactogen-assisted psychotherapy. The combination of psychotherapy and psycho-pharmacology may be indispensable in some cases (e.g., due to TBI-related structural damage). At the same time, our account is consistent with the position that in other cases, psychotherapy could provide sufficient PTSD treatment on its own.</p><p id="P44">For onset prevention, the model suggests that arbitrary aspects of the environment during the post-traumatic period could hinder or induce impairment, depending on how strongly and/or frequently sensory cues mobilise a defensive response. For example, immediate debriefing following a traumatic experience could unduly remobilise a defensive response and strengthen memory of the adverse context. Social factors (e.g., support groups, transition homes) would have the potential to counterbalance adverse cued responses by strengthening the inference of a present harmless context. Overall, our analysis lends support to biopsychosocial approaches to diagnosing and treating PTSD, or preventing its onset.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Online Methods</title><p id="P45">The foregoing account is interlinked with cognitive psychology concepts and supporting literature here. We use example scenarios for thematic organisation. Subsections progress through contextual mechanisms and processes, visual working memory (VWM), long-term memory (LTM) and generalisation, traumatic memory, and sleep.</p><sec id="S7"><title>Recognition dynamics involving foreground and background elements</title><p id="P46">Consider the example of being in a room with red wallpaper and a table with a deck of playing cards on it. This example can be linked to disparate literature using several terminological variations; namely, the room and wallpaper properties can be understood variously as context, background, scene, sensory periphery and/or global visual field. When interacting with the deck of cards, the deck can be considered a foreground or salient element, an object of attentional or sensory focus and/or part of the local visual field. In what follows, we treat the terms within each set as synonymous, acknowledging that some research operationalises distinctions internal to each set.</p><p id="P47">In an ordinary setting, relative to an agent’s attentional focus and interaction, there are often focal elements that are salient (i.e., foreground) and surrounding scene components that can be categorized as ‘context’ (i.e., background). In any such event, there also may be experiential and affective relationships between the agent and salient elements (e.g., the cards were a gift from a friend). How agent-environment interactions during an event unfold in perception will impinge on how they are encoded in memory, including salient foreground, contextual background, affective, and goal-direct aspects (e.g., implicit or explicit reward). In turn, how they are recalled from memory will also differ according to these encoded aspects and the recall circumstances.</p><p id="P48">Experimental studies often manipulate foreground and background elements as stimulus and context, to investigate neuropsychological processes – for example, by displaying sequences of images to isolate a phenomenon of interest. One finding is that recognition of a paired object and scene mutually reinforce each other.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> A pairing can be learned by repeated exposure to examples (‘training’), such as a red room with a deck of cards and a blue room with a large matchbox. After training, seeing a deck of cards will lead to fast recognition of the red room (inference from object to context), and vice versa, from room colour to table contents (inference from context to object).</p><p id="P49">It is also the case that scenes can be recognised based on global texture. For example, the red room may be full of round tables and chairs, while the blue room has rows of theatre seats. These scenes not only have dimensional features (red vs. blue) with recognisable objects (table seating vs. rows), but also a global textural stimulus array that combines into a gestalt and facilitates rapid recognition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> Global context also can be multimodal, such that different ambient sounds in each room (auditory background), once learned, facilitate faster visual recognition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup></p><p id="P50">All of the above forms of recognition (stimulus-context associations) can be recast as disambiguation in probabilistic inference. On-going predictions govern visual scanning (sensory sampling) to accumulate evidence that lowers the uncertainty about a given hypothesis. This describes the unimpaired ‘machinery’ that gives rise to PTSD when deployed suboptimally.</p><p id="P51">Continuing with the unimpaired scenario, when there is an element in common across multiple contexts, such as a curtain hanging in both the red and blue rooms, visually focussing on the curtain provides an ambiguous indication of what room I am in. If I hypothesise that I am in the blue room, I predict I will see rows of seats when I scan the room. Seeing round tables violates my prediction and resolves my uncertainty. I now infer I am in the red room.

For this figure, it is stipulated that the veridical match is between panels 1 and 3. Even if panel 3 is predicted to match panel 2, attention can be directed to the periphery for sensory sampling (illustrated in panel 4A), to accumulate evidence about the veridical context. Once sensory evidence at the periphery is accumulated, it resolves the ambiguity of the background scene, leading to the inference that panel 3 context matches panel 1. A combination of sensory attenuation at the periphery with sensory focus on foreground, and high precision on recall of panel 2 – illustrated in panel 4B – can inform context disambiguation in favour of a false inference that panel 3 matches panel 2.

Seeing an approaching object that looks as if it will soon hit me may coactivate the tactile sensation of being hit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> Thus, visual recognition is not limited to a purely abstract mental activity, but can be continuous with overt behaviours embedded in a context. For example, in a park, a defensive posture may be apt to protect oneself from being harmed by an apparently approaching ball initially seen at a distance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> Yet an equivalent visual sensation may cause an inapt defensive ‘flinch’ response during an immersive sports videogame when there will be no tactile impact.</p><p id="P54">This scenario also describes the unimpaired ‘machinery’ that gives rise to PTSD when it is impaired. A defensive reaction to current conditions can be understood as a consequence of prediction under a probabilistic (generative) model, as opposed to a stimulus-response account.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> Under the active inference formulation, one is effectively working backwards from a future time point of feeling tactile pain to the current time point of an approaching projectile. Inferences are made about the underlying (hidden) states that generate the sequence of sensations (e.g., the projectile approach will appear as a growing ball and lead to damaging impact causing pain). On this basis, an action is selected that has the best chance of preventing a surprising outcome, i.e., being hit by a ball.</p><p id="P55">The context of the park vs. the videogame is relevant to the learned state sequence and resulting sensory outcome. When playing the videogame, what appears to be an incoming ball is a foreground cue that can lead to a false inference about the background context. If I (falsely) infer I am in the park, I expect the ball will hit me and cause a painful outcome. Thus, from a first-person perspective, a defensive flinch is apt (Bayes optimal), even though it is inapt to an observer who (correctly) infers I am playing a videogame.</p><p id="P56">Technically, this can be understood in terms of the complete class theorem;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> namely, for every pair of behaviours and loss functions there are some prior beliefs that render my behaviour Bayes optimal.

However, preferred (i.e., familiar or unsurprising) objects may remain undiminished despite clutter,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> which can explain a ‘pop-out’ effect when scanning a crowd and spotting a familiar face. This preferential recognition occurs in the ventral stream, which has been found to be impaired in PTSD, resulting in a form of sensory attenuation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> A puzzle about sensory attenuation in PTSD is how it might relate to hypervigilance, a form of sensory hyperactivity. This puzzle can be solved from the account we elucidate here.</p><p id="P58">Psychology and neuroimaging studies operationalise various load concepts (attentional, perceptual, cognitive, working memory) to focus on specific differences (e.g., visual pathways vs. attention networks). Yet the common ground among them is a resource model that can be mapped to neuronal populations with biophysical limits. For example, all neurons within a population can be tuned to a single stimulus, or a subset is tuned to (e.g.) another stimulus.</p><p id="P59">From a technical perspective, this resource allocation is an emergent property of active inference in the following sense: the objective of active inference is to maximise the evidence for generative models of the lived world. Evidence (a.k.a., marginal likelihood) can be decomposed into accuracy and complexity. Therefore, model selection necessarily entails a minimisation of complexity, which can be read as minimising the degrees of freedom used to provide an accurate account of the sensorium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> This minimisation can be read as complying with Occam’s principle and manifests as an apparent constraint on the allocation of representational resources (e.g., the quantisation of representations, implicit in receptive fields). Our current modelling does not aim to disentangle different aspects of resource allocation within active inference. For our purposes, it suffices to say that mitigating harm in a traumatic encounter commonly requires visuospatial attention and sensorimotor coordination; namely, efficient active vision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup></p><p id="P60">Visual working memory (VWM) is a useful construct for centring on load-limited interactions related to visuospatial sensorimotor task demands.

In turn, a behavioural response is elicited that would be appropriate to a repeat traumatic encounter, but is inappropriate to the veridical conditions. This formulation of sensory attenuation theory thus provides a testable hypothesis for the neurocognitive machinery of ‘flashback’ phenomenology, in that cued traumatic recall is predicted to attenuate peripheral sensing more than focal sensing (e.g., in a target/distractor paradigm). The theory also provides a testable hypothesis related to another common PTSD symptom, the exaggerated startle response (ESR); namely, that alternatively valenced contexts for the same probe stimulus should differentially affect startle parameters for PTSD-impaired individuals to a lesser degree than those without.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Between past and present: From memory to generalisation</title><p id="P66">An encounter with a hostile person or adverse place would be important to remember for harm mitigation in a subsequent encounter.

(Our computational model does not distinguish between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> box B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub>, but future work could illustrate the relevant hippocampal differences.)</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Traumatic memory and sleep</title><p id="P78">Our analysis and modelling provides fresh insight into the finding that dysregulated sleep following traumatic experience predicts the development of PTSD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref></sup> As described above, stressful recall results in the maintenance of a wakeful trauma experience memory trace that is reactivated on recall but not re-encoded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref></sup> There is another opportunity for re-encoding during sleep. Successful re-encoding facilitates a closed event boundary with selected associations neuronally linked across events (for instance, the jacket from the above example; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> box A and B<sub>1</sub>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref></sup> However, if following a traumatic experience, subsequent sleep is disrupted, then the original traumatic memory trace may continue to be maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> box B<sub>2</sub>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup></p><p id="P79">In a healthy scenario, memories are repeatedly re-activated (‘retrieved’) and re-encoded in a new set of synaptic connections that are activated when recalling the original event.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref></sup> The healthy progression depends upon unstressed retrieval and sufficient NREM sleep, both of which may face interference following acute or extended traumatic experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref></sup> For example, early life stress can lead to a memory trace (neuronal ensemble) being preferentially re-activated during related adult stress,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref></sup> suggesting a contributing factor to CPTSD.</p><p id="P80">In the initial days following an event, some elements of the event-correlated neuronal ensemble overlap between its initial encoding and subsequent re-encoding. In a healthy progression, the re-encoded ensemble eliminates overlap with the originally encoded ensemble. This process can be understood formally as information compression or model reduction to minimise complexity (i.e., maximise model evidence in the absence of sensory input),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup> differentially driven by time and experiential learning factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref></sup> These factors are captured indirectly (abstractly) by our modelling: the time factor can be understood as a decay rate which is potentially too low in a person vulnerable to post-traumatic syndromes. If there is insufficient decay over time, alternative synaptic weights can be strengthened by learning (e.g., in treatment intervention). In principle, this learning could reduce excessive re-activation of the original ensemble, which may subsequently support its re-encoding.</p><p id="P81">A single nightmare or even a period of nightmares (e.g., following a bereavement) is not necessarily pathological, but may contribute to a period of intrusive cued re-activations in a manner suggested by our model. While our framing and modelling deliberately excludes fear and extinction, related work analyses nightmares in terms of fear extinction linked to ‘decontextualization’ and ‘recontextualization”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref></sup> These terms can be re-interpreted using our model as follows. If there is a cue in common to multiple memories, an overly precise contextual prior for ‘harmful’ may preferentially activate a traumatic memory that gives rise to a nightmare. Weakening the prior (synaptic strength) may reduce cued re-activation of that memory, akin to decontextualization of the cue. Strengthening a competing contextual prior for ‘harmless’ may then allow preferential activation of non-traumatic memories, akin to recontextualization of the cue.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS207112-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d5aAcKbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S12"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>AL received research funding support from the Open University School of Computing &amp; Communications, and was hosted during manuscript editing by the Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution &amp; Cognition Research.

How long it takes a defensive mobilisation to fully subside will depend on the elicited response (i) strength and (ii) the rate of response decay following a transition from a high to low probability of harm. An additional factor is (iii) the baseline immediately preceding the response, a local rather than global minimum (‘pre-response baseline’). If defences are already partly mobilised, as when on high alert, the distance between the pre-response baseline and peak mobilisation will be reduced (upper right arrows).</p><p>For a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the prototypical disorder of its kind, symptoms must last “longer than a month” according to the DSM-5 but “at least several weeks” according to the ICD-11. From a computational point of view, the optimal decay rate should be determined by the persistence of high probability of harm. If, say, serious harm is likely to occur within three weeks, high alert should not stop within one week. Hence, we must not pathologize the initial occurrence of PTSD symptoms, but focus on how their nature increases the risk of unwarranted, maladaptive persistence.</p><p>We postulate a critical relationship between a ‘return slope’ (B) and its intercepting a threshold separating extreme from ordinary arousal. This intercept characterises the transition out of PTSS – the time axis would be set differently in different diagnostic classifications and related to different neurobiological indicators (e.g., neurochemical and connectome properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>). Resilience can then be related to the ability to clearly infer that one no longer faces an increased likelihood of harm, and rapidly return to the psychophysiological baseline if so (ability to ‘bounce back’). A vulnerability to PTSS can be characterised with an inappropriately sluggish decay of arousal. Vulnerability factors may include genetic predispositions and lifespan events such as earlier psychological trauma or physical traumatic brain injury (TBI).</p><p>The wide arrows indicate neuromodulatory responses as temporal increases and decreases in pontine acetylcholine (ACh) and noradrenaline (NA) levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> for corresponding symptoms and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> for the circuit that controls these changes). Behaviourally, the responses relate to a naturalistic account of tasks (the term ‘task’ is used to link to experimental studies), divided into conventional tasks (e.g., securing food to satisfy hunger) and ‘extreme’ tasks (e.g., protecting oneself from serious harm). Following an extreme task (e.g., surviving a life-threatening encounter), defences may persist in a mobilised state (red, ‘elevated range’). Subsequent conventional tasks that would not have elicited a peak response when initiated at a low pre-response baseline instead elicit a peak response, as they are continually initiated at a high pre-response baseline (upper right arrows). The high pre-response baseline will be maintained continuously given a slow decay rate (‘vulnerable’) and subsequent encounters with relevant sensory cues (described below). Thus, responses in conventional situations may frequently reach peak defensive mobilisation, constituting PTSS.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207112-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Neuromodulatory circuit.</title><p>The neuromodulators noradrenaline (NA) and acetylcholine (Ach) are emitted in the pons. Cholinergic neuronal pathways from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPtg) produce ACh and also have an excitatory connection to the locus coeruleus (LC). LC excitation produces NA that in turn has an inhibitory effect on the PPtg. This reciprocal relationship in the pons stabilises the ratio of NA and ACh perfusing the forebrain while awake. When asleep, the PPtg ceases excitation of the LC, allowing NA levels to drop and ACh to rise (‘sleep ‘switch”).</p><p>With a stabilised ratio of NA to ACh, their baseline levels rise and fall jointly. The joint levels are modulated by the serotonergic projection from the midbrain dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) to the pons. Increased serotonin (5HT) inhibits the pontine subsystem activity, thereby reducing its NA and ACh output. Conversely, decreased 5HT from the DRN disinhibits the pontine subsystem activity, allowing NA and ACh levels to rise.</p><p>The DRN is excited or inhibited by the interaction between glutamate (Glu.) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), via glutamatergic and GABAergic projections from a richly interconnected network situated primarily in the forebrain. This forebrain network (with some outer nodes) is comprised of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), limbic system (LS), and the basal ganglia (BG), and also includes the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (unlabelled). When a harmless context is inferred via the forebrain network, the DRN ‘brake’ is applied; its serotonergic projections increase the 5HT input to the pons, inhibiting NA and ACh levels. When a harmful context is inferred, the DRN is inhibited (the ‘brake’ is released). In turn, the decreased 5HT input disinhibits the pontine subsystem, leading NA and ACh levels to rise.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207112-f003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>See main text for description.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207112-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>See main text for description.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207112-f005"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>See main text for description.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207112-f006"/></fig><fig-group id="F7" position="float"><fig id="F01" position="float"><label>Figure 7a</label><caption><p>Initial sequence of trials.
