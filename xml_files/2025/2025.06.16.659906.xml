organisms in cell biology for their large and transparent cell structure. However, their robust silica cell wall renders diatoms impermeable to many dyes and antibodies, and complicates the intracellular delivery of gene editing tools - driving in part the eventual decline of diatoms as mainstream model species despite their unique cellular physiology and remarkable ecological success. Here, we demonstrate that cryo-fixation combined with ultrastructural expansion microscopy (cryo-ExM) can overcome the silica barrier across diverse diatom species spanning over 80 million years of evolutionary time. We illustrate the potential of cryo-ExM to provide scalable, cost-effective volumetric imaging of diatom ultrastructure in laboratory cultures, as well as field-collected samples from the pan-European TREC expedition. We first reveal striking similarities in interphase microtubule organization across diverse diatom species by characterizing cytoskeletal arrangements throughout cell cycles and populations, uniting both pennate and centric morphologies under shared principles. We further unveil diatom photosynthetic diversity through qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis of chloroplast and pyrenoid morphologies, demonstrating that each diatom species architects unique photosynthetic machinery. Using cryo-ExM on environmental samples further exposes intricate diatom symbioses, revealing tight spatial organisation of ecological interactions. This methodology makes diatoms more accessible for modern and comparative cell biology research, providing new opportunities to investigate the cellular mechanisms of one of Earth’s most successful photosynthetic groups.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>diatoms</kwd><kwd>cryo-expansion microscopy</kwd><kwd>cell biology</kwd><kwd>ecology</kwd><kwd>immunofluorescence</kwd><kwd>ultrastructure</kwd><kwd>pyrenoid</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>MTOC</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Diatoms are aquatic photosynthetic microeukaryotes responsible for 20% of annual primary productivity and the cornerstone of marine ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Field et al., 1998</xref>). They supply large amounts of dissolved oxygen to marine life, support the entire food chain as pasture of the sea and export carbon to the bottom of the ocean through aggregation and sinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Armbrust, 2009</xref>). Diatoms are considered one of the most successful groups of eukaryotic microalgae on Earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Malviya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Pierella Karlusich et al., 2025</xref>), with tens of thousands of described species that have colonized both freshwater and marine aquatic environments, sediments, and even soils. Yet, our knowledge of diatom cell biology remains restricted to a handful of cultivated species, despite unique biological features shared by almost all species in the clade, such as their sturdy and characteristic silica cell wall or size-induced sexual reproduction.</p><p id="P3">Diatoms were amongst the first model organisms used to study cell biology in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, because their large, clear cells made them ideal for early light microscopic observations, especially for dynamic processes like cell division, migration and photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cande &amp; McDonald, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lauterborn, 1896</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">J. Pickett-Heaps, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">J. D. Pickett-Heaps &amp; Tippit, 1978</xref>). For instance, early studies revealed the presence of a multi-layered acentriolar microtubule-organising centre (MTOC), but the molecular composition, duplication cycle and precise role of this structure in orchestrating mitotic spindle dynamics remain unknown to date. Immunofluorescence and light microscopy were used to study the role of kinesin motors in <italic>Cylindrotheca fusiformis</italic> cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hogan et al., 1993</xref>) as well as the function of cell surface proteoglycans in <italic>Stauroneis decipiens</italic> gliding motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Lind et al., 1997</xref>). Live-cell imaging with endogenous and overexpressed GFP-tagged and YFP-tagged proteins has been used to study silica morphogenesis in <italic>Thalassiosira pseudonana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Scheffel et al., 2011</xref>), gliding in <italic>Craspedostauros australis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Poulsen et al., 2023</xref>) and cell division in <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Tanaka et al., 2015</xref>). Later on, and to gain higher spatial resolution, antibody labelling was coupled to electron microscopy to study photosynthesis, and localize protein complexes such as photosystems in thylakoid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Flori et al., 2017</xref>). More recently, the visualisation of small sections of native, frozen cells at near-atomic resolution using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has led to the discovery of a protein shell localized in the chloroplast and surrounding the pyrenoid (the “PyShell”), that plays a critical role in carbon concentrating mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Nam et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Shimakawa et al., 2024</xref>). Despite these noteworthy successes in probing diatom cell biology with imaging, the field faces a critical limitation: the robust silica cell wall of diatoms presents a significant barrier to the penetration of most antibodies and dyes. Consequently, while diatoms remained valuable for research areas like biomineralization or ecology, their use in mainstream cell biology declined as more tractable systems like yeast, mammalian cells, and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> came to dominate the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">De Martino et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Here, we unlock the potential of diatom cell biology research with ultrastructural expansion microscopy (U-ExM) across lab- and field-based samples. U-ExM is a super-resolution imaging technique that physically enlarges cells and tissues within a swellable hydrogel to achieve nanoscale resolution using conventional light microscopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gambarotto et al., 2019</xref>). While U-ExM has worked on a variety of species including cell walled ones, allowing for immunolabeling where previously unfeasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Mikus et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Olivetta et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Shah et al., 2024</xref>), diatoms have so far resisted attempts to expand. Combining cryo-fixation with U-ExM, protocol named cryo-ExM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Laporte et al., 2022</xref>), we establish a working expansion protocol effective across diatom cultured species that diverged 80 million years ago, achieving an expansion factor of roughly 4-fold and targeting proteins essential to the cell cycle and host photosynthetic machinery. By performing cryo-ExM on diatoms collected during the pan-European expedition TREC, we successfully preserve potential symbiotic associations that often underlie diatom interactions with their environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Vincent &amp; Bowler, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">2022</xref>). We expose hidden cytoskeletal unity across diatom diversity by mapping microtubule organization throughout cell cycles and populations, discovering shared interphase principles that bridge pennate and centric morphologies. Our comprehensive morphological analysis then reveals how each diatom species crafts specialized photosynthetic machinery through distinct chloroplast and pyrenoid architectures. Taken together, the application of cryo-ExM to diatoms offers unprecedented opportunities to dive into the cellular underpinnings of one of the most successful groups of photosynthetic organisms on the planet.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cryo-expansion microscopy enables robust immunofluorescence analysis in diverse diatoms from cultures and environmental samples</title><p id="P5">The ornamented silica cell wall of diatoms, called the frustule, is at the basis of diatom taxonomy, separating them into centric (circular symmetry) and pennate (bilateral symmetry) species. However, this rigid sturdy material also complicates the applicability of many immunofluorescence techniques that often rely on the penetration of antibodies, including standard, proteinase K based ExM protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we decided to use the alternative U-ExM protocol, which allows for immunofluorescence after sample expansion, combined with the cryo-ExM approach that replaces chemical fixation with vitrification via plunge freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Laporte et al., 2022</xref>). We used NHS ester, which preferentially labels dense proteinaceous structures, as a general ultrastructural marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">M’Saad &amp; Bewersdorf, 2020</xref>). We show that labelling and resolution obtained using standard confocal systems improves significantly post-expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). When comparing cells before and after expansion we obtained an expansion factor of 4.3-fold for <italic>Coscinodiscus granii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) and 4.1-fold for <italic>Chaetoceros neogracilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1 A,B</xref>). This is in line with previously reported expansion factors across multiple systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hinterndorfer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Langner et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Liffner et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Mikus et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The NHS ester labelling in <italic>C. granii</italic>, first allowed for an overall understanding of protein distribution in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <bold>NHS</bold>). In particular, dense triangular shapes were identified as pyrenoids, specialized organelles that enhance carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) fixation by concentrating RuBisCO, the protein that catalyses the reaction through which inorganic carbon enters the biosphere during photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ellis, 1979</xref>). The identity of the pyrenoid was further confirmed by direct staining of RuBisCO using a specific antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Rao et al., 2025</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2A</xref>). While DAPI primarily stains for nucleic acids, unspecific staining was also detected on the fractured silica cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <bold>white arrows</bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Movie 1</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Vitrification likely creates microfractures in the frustule, facilitating expansion, additionally improving the preservation of many cellular features and epitopes leading to superior staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hinterndorfer et al., 2022</xref>). By using antibodies targeting tubulin, we aimed at visualising the microtubule network which lends structural support to cells and facilitates intracellular transport, frustule formation, and organelle positioning throughout the cell cycle. Within the same cell, we observed microtubule filaments and bundles along the periphery of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <bold>TUB</bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Movie 1</xref>) as well as a cage-like structure of microtubules along the nucleus which form the cortical network, opposite of the polar microtubule organising centre (MTOC) proximal to the nucleus. Notably, diatom MTOCs appear to be acentriolar in line with previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">De Martino et al., 2009</xref>) featuring a prominent absence of microtubules-based cylindrical structure within their centre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <bold>TUB</bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Movie 1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We then stained thylakoids, which are membranes within chloroplasts, by targeting PsbA or D1 protein, the core subunit of the PSII complex which provides electrons for all oxygenic photosynthesis to happen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Giordano et al., 2005</xref>), and thereafter named PSII. PSII fully surrounds the pyrenoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <bold>PSII</bold>), and while most chloroplasts were localised regularly spaced along the periphery of the cell, they were excluded from the central area of both the epitheca and hypotheca (the upper and lower halves of the diatom silica cell wall), close to the nuclear interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <bold>PSII</bold>). In some, but not all doublets, an exception was noted with individual chloroplast found at the MTOC of postmitotic cell doublets, close to the hypotheca, while the majority localises at the cell periphery of the epitheca (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P9">This may represent a stage in the cell cycle ensuring even distribution of organelles during division. Differential intensity in PSII staining could be due to one side of the cell being closer to the coverslip, generating brighter signal due to light refraction with increasing depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <bold>PSII</bold>).</p><p id="P10">To generalize the applicability of cryo-ExM to diatoms, we further expanded diverse cultures as well as environmental samples. Cultures of the pennate diatoms <italic>Pleurosigma sp</italic>., <italic>Cylindrotheca sp</italic>., the centric diatoms <italic>Odontella sinensis</italic> and <italic>Chaetoceros neogracilis</italic> and the three morphotypes of the model diatom <italic>Phaeodactulym tricornutum</italic> were successfully labelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C,E-H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2,4</xref>). These species diverged millions of years ago, with <italic>Chaetoceros</italic> having a more ancient origin (130 million years ago) compared to the relatively recent <italic>Odontella</italic> (35 million years ago) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Nakov et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Gel expansion was consistent across species of pennate and centric diatoms imaged here, however population level comparisons of cells pre- and post-expansion show slight variations in the level of expansion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Büttner et al., 2021</xref>). We then tested the applicability of cryo-ExM on diatoms taken from their natural environment. We took advantage of the pan-European TREC expedition and the Advanced Mobile Laboratory, a fully equipped molecular lab outfitted with cutting-edge instrumentation for in-depth biological analysis, in particular a plunge freezer for on-site vitrification. Planktonic communities collected and fixed in Tallinn (Estonia) and Plentzia (Spain) were expanded, stained, and imaged after having been stored in liquid nitrogen for several months. Remarkably, environmental samples expanded well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I,J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 1C-F</xref>) showing that this state-of-the-art imaging approach can be relatively easily applied to complex environmental samples. On top, cryo-ExM can also successfully preserve cell-cell interactions that occur in environmental samples: bacteria were observed all along a <italic>Chaetoceros</italic> chain populating the extracellular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Movie 2</xref>), though the exact nature of the symbiosis - either mutualistic or parasitic - cannot be deciphered here. Surprisingly, bacteria seem to be organized along both longitudinal and lateral axes of the diatom chain, but not populating the setae, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 5</xref>), suggesting some form of specific colonization pattern, perhaps driven by fucose glycoconjugates as shown in other diatom species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Tran et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Furthermore, small flagellated cells containing two chloroplasts and pyrenoids each were detected in close proximity to <italic>Chaetoceros</italic> chains from another species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1F</xref>), recapitulating an interaction previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Colin et al., 2017</xref>). Together, this demonstrates that cryo-ExM successfully overcomes diatom frustule barriers to achieve roughly 4-fold expansion across evolutionarily diverse species from both laboratory cultures and environmental samples, enabling detailed visualization of cellular structures while preserving ecological interactions.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Systematic investigation of microtubule organisation across freely cycling diatom species</title><p id="P12">Diatoms are one of the earliest models for studying cell division due to their ease of culturing and their clear frustules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cande &amp; McDonald, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lauterborn, 1896</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">J. Pickett-Heaps, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">J. D. Pickett-Heaps &amp; Tippit, 1978</xref>). Given the crucial role of microtubules in cell division and mitosis, both the organisation of microtubules and their roles in these functions have been explored across many diatom species. Previous descriptions of microtubule organisation in diatoms describe the localization of microtubules in interphase cells as extending from the MTOC near the nucleus towards the frustules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Tesson &amp; Hildebrand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Tippit &amp; Pickett-Heaps, 1977</xref>). It has been reported that as diatom cells enter mitosis, a polar complex (PC) appears outside the nucleus in pre-mitotic cells, a structure independent of the MTOC. The MTOC then disappears, and the PC later becomes the poles of the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">De Martino et al., 2009</xref>). After mitosis, the microtubules in a few diatom species have been shown to reorganize and expand, aiding in the positioning of silica deposition vesicles (SDVs) as a new valve forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Tesson &amp; Hildebrand, 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Furthermore, cryo-ET studies of <italic>C. tenuissimus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mayzel et al., 2021</xref>) suggest that the microtubules can even extend into setae. Although actin was previously thought to be the cytoskeletal filament responsible for setae tip growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">J. D.

D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Pickett-Heaps, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Tesson &amp; Hildebrand, 2010</xref>). Despite the presence of these results, it is still difficult to make comparisons between species, and even between different cell cycle stages in the same species due to the variability in techniques and nomenclature.</p><p id="P14">Additionally, there is a heavy bias in the literature towards pennate diatoms as one of the model diatom species most amenable currently to genetic manipulations is <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>, a pennate diatom. Here we use cryo-ExM to move past this barrier, and to highlight its potential as a tool for making qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the cytoskeleton throughout diatoms, even across pennate and centric species.</p><p id="P15">We compared interphase MTOC organisation across species spanning both centric (<italic>C. neogracilis and C. granii</italic>) and pennate (<italic>Cylindrotheca sp. and E. clementina</italic>) diatoms, and observed that the microtubules mirror the cell’s symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 6</xref>). This is particularly striking in the centric <italic>C. granii</italic> and pennate <italic>Cylindrotheca sp</italic>. which display radial and bilateral symmetry respectively in both cell and microtubule organisation. We also observed a higher density of microtubules around the nucleus, as well as the localization of the MTOC on one side of the nucleus with microtubules extending from the MTOC towards the edges of the cell in all species we imaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). This suggests that diatoms share an interphase MTOC organisation despite their morphological diversity, and confirms previous results locating the MTOC as near the nucleus with microtubules extending towards the frustules. Furthermore, in the cultured <italic>C. decipiens</italic> and <italic>C. neogracilis</italic>, the microtubules extend to the corners and into the setae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>) as suggested in cryo-ET studies of <italic>C. tenuissimus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mayzel et al., 2021</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that microtubules play a role in setae tip growth.</p><p id="P16">Cryo-ExM also allows us to qualitatively and quantitatively make comparisons across different stages of the cell cycle. We focus on one species, <italic>C. decipiens</italic>, a centric diatom whose mitotic spindle had been previously observed (J. D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Pickett-Heaps, 1998a</xref>), but whose microtubule organisation throughout the other stages of the cell cycle has not previously been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Darley &amp; Volcani, 1971</xref>). In the interphase of <italic>C. decipiens</italic> cells, microtubules originate from a ring-shaped microtubule organising center (MTOC) near the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). This is similar both to the literature and to our observations of the MTOC in interphase of <italic>C. granii</italic> and <italic>Cylindrotheca sp</italic>. cells. As cells progress from interphase to early prophase, two MTOCs become visible in <italic>C. decipiens</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Just after cytokinesis, the two MTOCs remain at the plane of division, and later are observed closer to the centre of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). The localization of the MTOCs post-cytokinesis to the plane of division, where the new frustule will have to form, further implicates microtubules in the valve formation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Tesson &amp; Hildebrand, 2010</xref>). Throughout all these stages, the MTOCs are consistently localized to one side of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-D</xref>). These results vary from previous literature, which has shown that the MTOC disappears and reforms after mitosis, and has not previously suggested that the MTOC duplicates prior to mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">De Martino et al., 2009</xref>). Although we cannot discount that the MTOC may still disappear and reform after mitosis, the presence of two MTOCs prior to mitosis and near the plane of division post cytokinesis suggests that this may not be the case, however further studies of the other stages of mitosis both in <italic>C. decipiens</italic> and in other diatom species would be needed to further answer this question.</p><p id="P17">Characterizing the stages of the cell cycle through microtubule organisation in <italic>C. decipiens</italic> allows us to understand how cell division varies not only across species or across cell cycle stages, but across cells in a community. Diatoms in culture are not naturally synchronised, although they can be synchronised through silicon starvation or light starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Darley &amp; Volcani, 1971</xref>). However, diatoms in chains have been shown to have synchronized divisions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">J. D. Pickett-Heaps, 1998a</xref>). These contradicting results can be further explored, even in cells sampled from natural populations, using the higher throughput and more systematic approach of cryo-ExM. We established this by expanding an environmentally sampled <italic>Chaetoceros</italic> chain from Plentzia, Spain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Movie 3,4</xref>), which contains, from right to left, four cells in interphase (iii-vi), a cell which has recently undergone mitosis and has just undergone cytokinesis (ii), and a cell which has recently divided and physically separated the MTOCs of the daughter cells towards the centre of each cell (i). The microtubules of each of these cells extend to the corner of the cell and into the setae when the setae are present, as observed in cultures. The presence of cells which have recently divided next to each other suggests that division in chains, especially those from natural samples as opposed to cultures, may not be as synchronised as was previously reported. However, this does not rule out the effect of abiotic factors on the level of synchrony within a chain or within a population, as was suggested by the synchronised culture studies. A larger scale study of microtubule organisation on natural populations of cells in an environment with changing abiotic conditions could answer this question, and is now possible given cryo-ExM. The ability to now target specific structures in order to characterize and identify different stages of the cell cycle is extremely valuable, especially in natural samples. Identifying stages in the cell cycle in environmental cells provides a method to understand the molecular mechanisms behind synchronization, timescales of division, and diversity of cellular division apparatuses across species in their natural habitats.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Plasticity of chloroplast and pyrenoid architectures within and across diatom species</title><p id="P18">The chloroplast is the organelle responsible for fine tuning key essential processes in diatoms such as photosynthesis and photoprotection, which occur in the thylakoid membranes, as well as carbon fixation and CO<sub>2</sub> Concentrating Mechanisms (CCMs), which takes place in the pyrenoid. While chloroplasts and pyrenoids ultrastructure may reflect certain ecological niches and vary among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Barrett et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bedoshvili et al., 2009</xref>), they may also provide clues on the physiological state of the cells and how the surrounding environment affects them through reduced or enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> availability or luminous stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Broderson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Polukhina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Wood et al., 2019</xref>). Studying functional plasticity in fluctuating environments can be extremely challenging especially in non-model organisms. So far, structural visualization of both photosynthetic membranes and pyrenoids was possible through high-resolution albeit low-throughput electron microscopy (EM), Focus-Ions Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and a direct morphological investigation, using light microscopy, had not been attempted in diatoms. Taking advantage of cryo-ExM’s improved spatial resolution, we acquired z-stack from PSII and NHS, segmenting chloroplasts and pyrenoids volumes in both cultured and environmental species, centric and pennate diatoms to better capture phenotypic plasticity of their photosynthetic machinery.</p><p id="P19">Our comparative analysis of chloroplasts and pyrenoids morphologies across species shows that characteristic shapes are unique to each diatom. In the large centric diatom <italic>C. granii</italic>, multiple oval-shaped chloroplasts surround the entire cell and the pyrenoids possess a pyramidal shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Movie 1</xref>).

Finally, the raphid pennate diatom <italic>Cylindrotheca sp</italic>. displayed two large elongated chloroplasts and two pyrenoids with a lenticular shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). We further quantified surface/volume ratios in chloroplasts and pyrenoids to investigate individual shape distribution and variability among different species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Despite their differences in shape, the pyrenoid surface/volumes ratios were surprisingly similar in <italic>C. granii</italic> cultures and the <italic>Chaetoceros sp</italic>. cryo-fixed in Plentzia, Spain (1.22 ± 0.1; 0.93 ± 0.14, respectively).

In two different <italic>C. granii</italic> cells, the pyrenoid/chloroplast ratio was 5.9% (n=27) and 6.5% (n=17); in two two-celled chains of <italic>C. neogracilis</italic> the ratio was 11.2% (n=2) and 11.7% (n=2), in two different <italic>Cylindrotheca sp</italic>. cells the ratio was 11.3% (n=2) and 7.4% (n=2). In the environmental <italic>Chaetoceros sp</italic>. chain composed of six cells, the pyrenoid/chloroplast ratio was 9.1% (n=24).

We characterize microtubule organisation across the cell cycle of individual species, and across cells within a population, and reveal similarities in interphase microtubule organisation across many species of diatoms which includes both pennate and centric morphologies. Furthermore, the comparative analysis of chloroplasts and pyrenoids morphologies across species provides qualitative and quantitative insights on photosynthetic diversity, suggesting that photosynthetic architectures are peculiar to each diatom.</p><p id="P23">Based on this study, many exciting perspectives can be outlined to advance cell biology in diatoms.

This work presents promising results, but is constrained by the necessity of genetic transformation which is limited in diatoms. Staining for proposed PyShell proteins with generated antibodies may now be possible across a range of diatoms and immediately provide higher resolution data to better understand pyrenoid shape-shifting in different diatom species and under different environmental conditions. Localizing proteins involved in silica cell wall formation such as silicic acid transporters (SITs), localized to the plasma membrane and potentially other intracellular membranes, could improve our understanding of the uptake of silicic acid necessary for cell wall synthesis. Additionally, silaffins are central to silica polymerization and are embedded in specific regions of the biosilica, such as the valve region. Precise localization of silaffins like Silaffin-3 (tpSil3) in <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> revealed distinct accumulation areas within the biosilica, crucial for understanding frustule morphogenesis, and could here be visualized across different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gröger et al., 2016</xref>). Beyond protein labelling, coupling of cryo-ExM with mRNA and rRNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization could open opportunities for further genotype to phenotype mapping.</p><p id="P24">Beyond its potential in unravelling key aspects of diatom cell biology, cryo-ExM could contribute to shedding more light on diatom ecology and evolution. For instance, the localization of proteins involved in growth limiting iron uptake such as phyto transferrin (ISIP2A) could be investigated in cells with specific morphological features (such as <italic>Chaetoceros</italic> setae) or diatom biofilms to see if some regions specialise in nutrient uptake more than others. Triose phosphate translocators (TPTs) are localized in specific membranes of the complex plastid envelope, mediating carbohydrate exchange between the endosymbiont (plastid) and the host cytosol. Their correct localization is fundamental for establishing and maintaining the metabolic connection between host and endosymbiont, a key evolutionary innovation in diatoms that has so far been investigated in a handful of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Moog et al., 2015</xref>). Antioxidant proteins such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) need to be localized near sites of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, such as chloroplasts or mitochondria, to effectively mitigate oxidative stress induced by abiotic changes such as salinity and could be studied within euryhaline diatoms such as <italic>Cyclotella</italic>, that can tolerate and grow across a wide range of habitats, from nearly freshwater to hypersaline conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Downey et al., 2023</xref>).

Briefly, cells were incubated in 0.1% tannic acid and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in acetone for 92 h at 90°C in an automatic freeze substitution machine (Leica EM AFS). Cells were then washed five times with anhydrous acetone. Subsequently cells were incubated with a 2% OsO4 solution in acetone for 32 h at 90°C. The temperature was then raised over the course of 14 h to -20°C and kept for 16 h. Next, the temperature was raised over 4 h to 4°C and the OsO4 solution was removed by washing five times with anhydrous acetone. After warming up to room temperature (20°C), cells were infiltrated with 25%, 50% and 75% epoxy resin (EPON 812, Serva) in acetone (without the accelerator), 2 h each. After a 100% epoxy resin infiltration overnight, cells were embedded in a 100% fresh solution of epoxy resin for 68 h (both without the accelerator). Then cells were incubated three times (3 h/each) and once (overnight) with 100% epoxy resin (containing the accelerator, DMP-30). Resin embedded cells were then polymerized at 60°C for 48 h.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Ultramicrotomy and imaging</title><p id="P38">Ultrathin sections (70 nm) of the resin embedded <italic>C. granii</italic> were obtained with an ultramicrotome (Leica EM UC7) and a 35° diamond knife (Diatome) and collected on 3 mm copper slot grids (Agar Scientific) coated with 1% formvar in chloroform.

(B) Measurements of the diameter of <italic>C. granii</italic> cells before and after expansion (n=37 and 13, respectively). The mean expansion factor was determined to be 4.3-fold. (C) Phylogenetic relation of diatom species used here indicated on the phylogram, adapted from (Medlin &amp; and Kaczmarska, 2004). Clade colours are kept throughout the image. (D) Immunostaining for microtubules (magenta) and PSII combined with NHS ester pan-labelling (grey) and DAPI (blue) labelling the DNA and fragmented frustule (white arrow) of <italic>C. granii</italic>. Maximum intensity projections are shown spanning half a cell (i) and the central section (ii) allowing for a clear distinction of the MTOC (black arrow) and a microtubule cage spanning the nucleus in addition to the cortical bundles. NHS ester staining preferentially labels the triangular pyrenoid sitting roughly central in the manyfold chloroplasts which are found along the periphery and, in doublets, as single plastids in close proximity to the MTOC.

All reconstructions show segmented microtubules (magenta), chloroplasts (green) and nuclei (blue). The microtubules in each are localized to the side of the nucleus and extend to the edges of the cell. From left to right: expanded scale bars are 20 μm, 50 μm, 50 μm, 10 μm, and biological scale bars are 4.91 μm, 11.52 μm, 11.52 μm, 3.72 μm.

The MTOC is located to the side of the nucleus (blue), and the chloroplasts (green) are distributed throughout the cell. Expanded scale bar 50 μm, biological scale bar 9.45 μm. The inset below of the microtubules in greyscale shows the ring-like structure of the MTOC. Expanded scale bar of the inset is 10 μm and the biological scale bar of the inset is 1.89 μm. (C) The next image is of a cell in early prophase. The microtubules now form two MTOCs, which the greyscale inset of microtubules is showing. The nucleus (blue) is located in the centre of the cell, and the chloroplasts (green) are still distributed throughout the cell. Expanded scale bar 50 μm, biological scale bar 9.45 μm for the top, composite image, and expanded scale bar 10 μm, biological scale bar 1.89 μm for the bottom greyscale image. (D) The top images are two cells which have just undergone cytokinesis. The MTOC is located near the plane of division in the top cell and left greyscale inset. In the bottom image and right inset, the MTOCs (purple and grey, respectively) are located further from the plane of division and closer to the centre of each of the daughter cells. The nucleus in both post-cytokinesis cells are still located near the plane of division and have not yet moved towards the centre of the cell. Expanded scale bar 50 μm, biological scale bar 13.05 μm for the composite panel and expanded scale bar 10 μm, biological scale bar 2.62 μm for tubulin-only greyscale panel. (E) The top panel is an environmentally sampled chain from Plentzia, Spain. The nucleus (blue), chloroplasts (green) and microtubules (magenta) are all useful for identifying which stages of the cell cycle each cell in the chain is in. The microtubules are shown in the middle panel in grey scale to highlight the MTOCs and reach of the microtubules in the different cells. The bottom panel shows a 3D reconstruction of the same chain. The two left cells in the chain (i-ii) have recently divided, with the second cell (ii) more recently having undergone cytokinesis. The cells on the right (iii-vi) are all in interphase.
