The NOD-like receptor NLRP3 senses a variety of danger signals and environmental insults, resulting in pro-inflammatory response, inflammasome formation and pyroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Its aberrant activation has been linked to many acute and chronic diseases ranging from atherosclerosis to Alzheimer’s disease and cancer, making NLRP3 an attractive therapeutic target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Here we report the discovery, characterization, and structure of an indazole-based NLRP3 antagonist, BAL-1516, which potently inhibits inflammasome formation in monocytes and microglia. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of BAL-1516 bound to NLRP3 reveals a previously undescribed compound binding site at a surface groove of the nucleotide-binding domain with contacts to the FISNA and WHD subdomains. The characteristic feature of BAL compound binding is the formation of three hydrogen bonds to the peripheral β-strand of the triple-ATPase; two from the indazole’s nitrogen atoms and a third from the compounds’ linker region. Additional phenyl and thiazole moieties render the compound hydrophobic, allowing excellent blood-brain barrier penetration. The compound binding site is highly specific for NOD-like receptors, and the optimized compound BAL-1516 is able to directly bind mouse NLRP3 despite two conservative residue changes in the binding interface. The BAL compounds represent a first-in-class family of NLRP3 inhibitors, providing a broad design space, including covalent and degradative properties, for the development of NLRP3-directed therapeutics.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The innate immune system contains cytosolic proteins that sense cellular stress caused by bacterial, viral and fungal infections or sterile inflammation, to control cellular integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. NLRP3 is a well-studied member of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) that is involved in the activation of the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that mediates inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Upon detection of stress or pathogen-associated signals, NLRP3 triggers the activation of caspase-1, which leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, driving inflammatory responses and ultimately pyroptotic cell death. In the context of neuroinflammation, NLRP3 plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Research into targeting NLRP3 signalling with CNS-penetrating molecules holds potential for developing therapeutic strategies to alleviate neuroinflammatory conditions and to slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p id="P3">Small molecule inhibitors targeting NLRP3 have been described including the sulfonylurea compound MCC950, also known as CRID3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. MCC950 was developed based on early observations from cell-based screens that identified diarylsulfonylureas, such as glyburide, as inhibitors of NLRP3 signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography structures revealed the binding specificity of this compound, targeting a deep crevice in between the regulatory NACHT domain and the sensory leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, with the sulfonylurea being sandwiched between two opposing arginines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Inactive, human NLRP3 was shown to form a spherical ‘cage’ structure made of ten subunits, where the effector Pyrin domain (PYD) is shielded inside, preventing its interaction with the downstream ASC protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Activation of NLRP3 requires disassembly of the cage, possibly mediated by the NEK7 kinase, and a ~90° rotation of the subdomains within the NACHT. This allows formation of a ‘disc’-like structure and exposure of the PYDs, which act as nucleation seed for ASC filament elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The conformational change is catalysed by the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), a member of the triple ATPase family, accompanied by an ADP-to-ATP exchange. Multiple autosomal mutations of the <italic>NLRP3</italic> gene have been associated with constitutively active protein variants, leading to chronic inflammation summarized as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), which destabilise the inactive conformation and are therefore less susceptible to MCC950 binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Today, MCC950 derivatives optimized for stability and tolerability are in multiple clinical trials with indications ranging from CAPS syndromes to osteoarthritis, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and Parkinson’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Here we report the development and structure of a highly potent inhibitor based on an indazole scaffold that targets NLRP3 at a site adjacent to the central β-sheet of the triple ATPase but different from the sulfonylurea binding site.</p><sec id="S1"><title>BAL-1516 binds to NLRP3 at a site different from MCC950</title><p id="P5">The lead compound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, BAL-0028, has been optimised through several rounds of modification to BAL-1516 to achieve higher affinity, specificity, and the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. To accomplish this, a 4-methylthiazole replaces the 3-fluorophenyl subunit at the western side, while the eastern indazole moiety is modified to 5-azaindazole extended with a 4-methyl substituent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In addition, a chiral centre is introduced at the azaindazole benzylic site connecting it to the methyl-amino-carbonyl moiety. We characterized the interaction of BAL compounds with NLRP3 by thermal stability measurements using dynamic light scattering (DLS). For comparison, a derivative lacking the chiral centre, BAL-0898, and MCC950 were included in these measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). To 3 μM full length, wild-type NLRP3 protein in the ADP-bound decamer conformation, 10 μM compound was added and the hydrodynamic radius measured upon increasing temperature as an indicator of protein unfolding and aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b,c</xref>). The addition of MCC950 did not result in significant protein stabilization, whereas BAL-0898 and BAL-1516 stabilized NLRP3 unfolding by more than 2.5 degrees Celsius over the DMSO control, indicating that the BAL binding site is readily accessible even in the preformed, intact decamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed to determine the binding affinity of BAL compounds to NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). Using the single cycle kinetics mode with immobilized protein, BAL-1516 showed a dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) of 14.2 ± 2.5 nM to the NACHT domain of NLRP3. This indicates an 8-fold increase compared to the lead compound BAL-0028 (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 110 ± 6 nM), and an affinity almost twice that of MCC950 (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 23.7 ± 3.4 nM). In comparison, the (<italic>S</italic>)-enantiomer, BAL-1939, of the chiral centre connecting the phenyl ring with the indazole moiety revealed a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 4.4 ± 2.1 μM; more than two orders of magnitude weaker binding than the eutomer. Using the A–B–A titration cycle with MCC950 (reservoir A) and BAL-1516 (reservoir B) we performed binning experiments of the compound binding site. The addition of BAL-1516 to pre-loaded MCC950 showed an increase in response units, indicating additive binding behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). In comparison, addition of MCC950 in the second cycle as a control showed no spectroscopic change. Reversing the compound titration scheme with BAL-1516 administered first followed by the addition of MCC950 resulted in a similar additive protein targeting behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1f</xref>). The effect of BAL compounds on the intrinsic ATP-hydrolysis activity of NLRP3 was measured in HPLC multi-turnover assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Here, BAL-0898 and BAL-1516 did not affect nucleotide hydrolysis, indicating that the catalytic activity of NLRP3 remains unchanged by the compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1g</xref>). These data show that BAL-1516 binds with high affinity to NLRP3 at a site different from MCC950 without affecting ATP-hydrolysis activity, and in a specific configuration determined by the compound’s chiral centre.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Structure of the NLRP3–BAL-1516 complex</title><p id="P7">Recombinant, full-length human NLRP3 (residues 3-1036) elutes in size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) experiments in two fractions: one of a high-molecular-weight assembly and one at the defined size of a decamer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. To investigate the effect of BAL-1516 on NLRP3 assembly, we added the compound either during the expression and gel filtration process or throughout the protein purification. Both procedures did not alter the elution profiles, indicating that the compound neither leads to aggregation nor disassembly of the protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). Multiangle light scattering (MALS) combined with SEC at 280 and 325 nm wavelength confirmed the presence of the compound in the decamer assembly when adding the compound to the homogeneous sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). A cryo-EM dataset of 6,106 micrographs was recorded on a Titan Krios microscope equipped with a Gatan K3 direct electron detector, imaging 1,739,268 particles. Multiple rounds of 2D classifications and refinements led to the selection of 765,958 particles for refinements (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>). The NLRP3 decamer was reconstructed at an overall resolution of 3.7 Å in D5 symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Focused refinement with a monomer mask in C1 symmetry led to a resolution of 3.06 Å for a single subunit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>). Initial model building was performed with chain A of the human NLRP3 complex structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. A continuous amino acid chain was built from residues 133-1036, except for the acidic loop (686-725) and two gaps (178-199; 541-549) in the FISNA and HD2 subdomains. The N-terminal PYD effector domain was not resolved in the reconstructions.</p><p id="P8">The density of the BAL-1516 compound with a molecular mass of 435.6 Da was identified on the surface of NLRP3 in the nucleotide binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). It is located at a site adjacent to the AAA+ ATPase defining β-sheet and opposite the bound ADP nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>). The binding site covers a buried surface area of 620 Å<sup>2</sup> of BAL-1516, which corresponds to 94% of its accessible surface area. Most direct interactions of NLRP3 to the compound are mediated by the NBD (19 out of 26 interacting residues according to PDBePISA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>), with minor contributions from the FISNA and WHD subdomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The binding site for MCC950 instead is empty, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>). Two cysteines are in the immediate vicinity to the BAL compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>). The first is C279, whose sulphate atom is in 3.5–3.6 Å distance to both a carbon of the ethoxy group and the methyl group of the central amino-carbonyl linker. The second is C514, which is at the tip of the hairpin loop of the antiparallel β-strands in the WHD and in about 13 Å distance to the methyl group of the chiral centre.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>BAL-1516 interacts with the triple-ATPase β-sheet</title><p id="P9">The characteristic feature of BAL compound binding to NLRP3 is the formation of three hydrogen-bonds to the terminal β2 strand of the nucleotide-binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Here, the 1<italic>H</italic>-indazole moiety interacts with the main chain atoms of Y258, while the carbonyl group in the compounds’ linker region forms a hydrogen bond with H260. This alternating acceptor–donor–acceptor pattern at ideal distances of 2.8–3.3 Å to the backbone atoms of NLRP3 is reminiscent of the formation of an antiparallel β-strand. The hydrophobic thiazole-phenyl ring system on the western side of the compound is framed by an extended loop between residues E263 and C279 of NLRP3 and contacts the central β-sheet of the NBD from behind the side of the ADP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The ethoxy group at the para-position of the phenyl ring sticks into a hydrophobic core formed by F257, I259 and F299 of the β-strands β2 and β3, and complemented by L272 and I276 from helix α2, which sits as a lid on top of the compound. The thiazole ring is rotated about 22° relative to the phenyl ring and is embedded by the side chains of residues V264, L331, L332, L335, L272, L275, F299 and I259, forming a hydrophobic cleft. The space to accommodate the 4-methyl group of the thiazole is provided by G328 at the beginning of helix α4. The chiral centre of BAL-1516 induces a kink between the indazole and the methyl-aminocarbonyl group, so that the compound with (<italic>R</italic>)-configuration fits precisely into the binding site on the surface of NLRP3. This observation could explain the about 300-fold higher affinity of BAL-1516 to NLRP3 compared to its (<italic>S</italic>)-enantiomer BAL-1939. The methyl group at the chiral centre points towards the surface of the protein-compound complex, providing an exit vector for molecule extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>). The binding site appears rather uncharged in the surface display of the electrostatic potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), underlining the hydrophobic nature of the CNS-penetrating compound. In the decamer assembly of inactive NLRP3, the BAL-1516 interaction site is close to the apical axis in direct proximity to the basic cluster (131-147) of the FISNA, yet readily accessible from the bulk solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3e</xref>). A schematic of the interactions is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>BAL compound binding to mouse NLRP3 variants</title><p id="P10">Our initial studies with the lead compound BAL-0028 showed low efficacy for NLRP3 in mice, which severely limits its experimental potential for characterisations in aging and Alzheimer’s disease models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Seven different species were tested, showing that mouse, rat, dog and rabbit NLRP3 had reduced susceptibility to BAL-0028 inhibition compared to cynomolgus, AGM and human. Knowing the binding site of the BAL compound, we identified two directly interacting residues that differ from their human counterparts; histidine at the position of Y143 and phenylalanine at the position of Y258 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). A third alteration is the C280 change to tryptophan in mouse and rat NLRP3. Although at an indirect position, the significant change in size may impact the loops’ conformation and the preceding residue C279, which largely contributes to compound binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). We performed single, double and triple mutations of these three sites in mouse NLRP3 to generate gain-of-function mutations for BAL compound binding. SPR analysis showed that BAL-1516 binds to the wild-type mouse NLRP3 NACHT protein with a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 200 nM, which is approximately one order of magnitude tighter than the binding of BAL-0028 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). However, of the proposed gain-of-function mutants, only mouse W276C and the double mutant F254Y, W276C showed improved binding behaviour, whereas all mutant proteins containing the H139Y exchange appeared to be instable.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>BAL-1516 is a potent inflammasome inhibitor with CNS penetrance</title><p id="P11">The inhibitory potential of BAL-1516 on NLRP3-mediated inflammasomes was tested in HEK293T cells, monocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and microglia. First, we used HEK293T cells stably expressing BFP-ASC and doxycycline-inducible NLRP3 to monitor ASC specks by flow cytometry. Upon nigericin stimulation, a significant increase in ASC specks is observed, which is dose-dependently inhibited by BAL-1516, BAL-0898 and MCC950 with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 14.5, 122 and 69 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We tested the synergy of BAL compounds and MCC950 in NLRP3 inhibition by comparing the composition of half the concentration of each compound with the use of either compound at full concentration. Three concentrations were analysed and BAL-0898 was used due to its better solubility. The reduction of ASC specks indicates similar apparent IC<sub>50</sub> values, revealing an additive effect of both compounds with no significant influence on the binding affinity of the other antagonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This observation agrees with the titration experiments by SPR and reflects the different binding sites of each compound class on the structure of NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), showing that neither over-additive effects due to increased binding affinity nor destructive effects due to decreased binding affinity of the other antagonist prevail.</p><p id="P12">We compared BAL-0028 and BAL-0898 with MCC950 inhibition of NLRP3 activity in primary human monocytes and PBMCs. BAL-0028 and BAL-0898 show higher potency than MCC950 in inhibiting pyroptosis in LPS-primed monocytes treated with nigericin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>), as well as IL-1β and IL-18 secretion in LPS-primed PBMCs treated with nigericin or monosodium urate crystals (MSU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4b-e</xref>). We further evaluated BAL-1516 in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia (iCell microglia) analysing the release of IL-1β and IL-18. BAL-1516 consistently inhibited LPS primed and nigericin stimulated iCell microglia in a dose-dependent manner for both cytokines at a higher potency than its BAL-1939 enantiomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). IC<sub>50</sub> values of 11 and 673 nM were determined for BAL-1516 and BAL-1939, respectively, for the reduction of IL-1β release compared to 59 nM for MCC950, and similar values were obtained for the inhibition of IL-18 release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). The cytotoxicity of BAL-1516 and BAL-1939 and their influence on cell viability was tested in iCell microglia in the same concentration range, showing no significant divergences in LDH release and cell functionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5c,d</xref>). The ability for CNS penetration of BAL-1516 was analysed in mice by determining the absolute values of compound concentration in blood plasma and brain tissue over a time course of 22 hours after dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). The <italic>K</italic><sub>p</sub> coefficient as a measure for total brain concentration to total plasma concentration decreases from 0.3 to 0.1 from the first to the twelfth hour indicating excellent blood-brain barrier penetration and stability in tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). These data confirm that BAL-1516 inhibits NLRP3 in microglia and exhibits CNS persistence.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P13">Here we identify a yet unexplored targeting site on NLRP3 that allows for small molecular compound binding and highly potent inhibition of inflammasome formation. The binding site is located on the surface of the NACHT domain, primarily formed by the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), with contributions from the FISNA and WHD subdomains. Moreover, the site is readily accessible in both, the spherical ‘cage’ structure and the concentrical ‘disc-like’ structure of the NLRP3 decamer. The compound targeting this site is built of an indazole linked to a hydrophobic biphenyl moiety and constitutes a chemical scaffold different from the sulfonylurea entity found in MCC950, in line with their different binding sites in NLRP3. Its hydrophobic nature allows excellent blood-brain barrier penetration, opening an avenue for the targeting of neuroinflammation related diseases.</p><p id="P14">Indazoles are rare in nature and considered a privileged scaffold in drug design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The formation of three hydrogen-bonds, two from the indazoles’ nitrogen atoms and one following a chiral centre, is the key asset of BAL compound binding to NLRP3. In addition, the chiral centre contributes significantly to the compounds’ recognition specificity as the affinity of the corresponding enantiomer is more than 300-fold weaker. The chiral centre offers also an exit vector for the generation of degraders or fluorescently labelled compounds due to its solvent exposure and accessibility. The interaction to the peripheral β-strand of the triple-ATPase β-sheet delineates a unique binding site, also known as ‘Glu-switch’, as it provides a link between ATPase activity and ligand binding in AAA+ proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In circular assemblies such as the chaperone p97 hexamer, the DNA clamp loader or the 26S proteasome, the Glu-switch mediates interaction to the neighbouring subunit, linking conformational changes to nucleotide turnover of the ATPase motor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, the formation of ‘disc-like’ structures for active NLRP3 or NLRC4 is mediated by the FISNA subdomain, rather than the β-sheet of the NBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. While a similar binding site as for the BAL compounds in NLRP3 should be present in all NLRs, the primary sequence to its closest homologue, NLRP12, already differs in eight of 26 residues, resulting in no detectable interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Ext. Data Figs. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">7</xref>). Recent advances to depart from the sulfonylurea class for better brain penetrability are NT-0796, an ester substituted carbamate derivative that acts as a pro-drug, or the pyridazine-based scaffolds NP3-253 and ASP0965, and a bicyclic variant thereof, which, however, all target the MCC950 binding site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P15">The structure of the NLRP3–BAL-1516 complex provides initial insights into its mode of action as an inflammasome antagonist.

Further global refinements with C1 symmetry yielded a 3.66 Å resolution map. Focusing mask was applied on one monomer for a local refinement, which improved the resolution to 3.06 Å. This local refinement map was further improved with DeepEMhancer (highRes). For the composite map of the decamer, D5 symmetry was imposed in the non-uniform global refinement job.
