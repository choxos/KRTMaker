Here, we investigated how CRISPR-Cas targeting affects mating and gene exchange in the halophilic archaeon <italic>Haloferax volcanii.</italic> Surprisingly, we found that CRISPR-Cas targeting significantly increased mating efficiency between members of the same species, in contrast to its previously documented role in reducing inter-species mating. This enhanced mating efficiency was dependent on the Cas3 nuclease/helicase and extended beyond the targeted genomic regions. Further analysis revealed that CRISPR-Cas targeting promoted biased recombination in favour of the targeting strain during mating, resulting in an increased proportion of recombinant progeny that are positive for CRISPR-Cas. To test whether an increase in recombination is sufficient to increase mating efficiency, we tested whether strains lacking the MRE11-RAD50 complex, which are known to have elevated recombination activity, also exhibited higher mating success. Indeed, these strains showed higher mating, as did cells that were exposed to DNA damage using methyl methanesulfonate. These findings suggest that CRISPR-Cas systems may contribute to speciation by facilitating within-species gene exchange while limiting between-species genetic transfer, thereby maintaining species boundaries.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Haloarchaea</italic></kwd><kwd>CRISPR-Cas</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>speciation</kwd><kwd>horizontal gene transfer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)-Cas (CRISPR-associated genes) systems are now recognized as a predominant anti-viral defense that provides bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity against mobile genetic elements (MGEs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> during infection, CRISPR-Cas systems target foreign DNA and acquire short sequences, called spacers, from invading genomes.

After the initial mating event, heterozygous cells are initially formed, containing genetic material from both parents. This stage can later lead to the formation of two different types of progeny: recombinant cells, with chromosomal loci from both parental strains, and cells that may segregate and revert to the original (parental) genotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. To study mating frequency, selection for mating products is applied such that heterozygous cells will be able to grow, as well as recombinants with a favourable combination that contains the markers that are selected for, while cells that revert to the parental genotypes will be unable to grow.</p><p id="P4">Previous mating experiments between different species of the halophilic archeon <italic>Haloferax</italic> have shown that when the CRISPR-Cas systems of one species targets that of another, the efficiency of productive mating events is reduced compared to non-targeting mating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. This raised the possibility that CRISPR-mediated degradation may cause mating cells to detach from their "offensive" mating partner prematurely, reducing the opportunity for gene exchange. Conversely, CRISPR-Cas mediated genome cleavage could actually stimulate homologous recombination (HR) during mating, because due to activity of the Cas3 nuclease/helicase of type I-B CRISPR-Cas systems (the most common system in halophilic archaea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.

Our results demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas targeting increases the frequency of gene exchange by influencing the mating process. Furthermore, we show that CRISPR-Cas targeting biased the recombination in favour of the targeting strain during mating, which could benefit CRISPR-Cas containing strains of Haloferax species, in which CRISPR-Cas is plasmid-encoded rather than ancestral. Importantly, CRISPR-Cas targeting can increase gene exchange within-species, while reducing between-species exchange, making these systems a factor that contributes to speciation.</p><sec id="S2"><title>Within-species mating is increased by CRISPR-Cas targeting</title><p id="P6">Halophilic archaea can form cytoplasmic bridges that facilitate cell-to-cell contact, enabling genetic material transfer through a process called mating, which promotes horizontal gene transfer (HGT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.

To further understand CRISPR-Cas role in gene exchange among halophilic archaea, we investigated its effect on within-species mating.</p><p id="P7">We inserted a 40 bp spacer sequence into the <italic>H. volcanii</italic> genome. This sequence is targeted by a type I-B CRISPR-Cas system spacer that mediates DNA cleavage, known as interference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> ). We then introduced this sequence into a strain lacking CRISPR-Cas genes to prevent self-targeting and autoimmunity. Next, we conducted mating experiments using WR532 (<italic>ΔpyrE2</italic>) that has the wild type CRISPR-Cas system and two <italic>H.</italic> <italic>volcanii</italic> strains, either UG633 (<italic>ΔhdrB, ΔtrpA, Δcas</italic> genes, containing the target spacer inside <italic>ΔtrpA</italic>) or UG634 (<italic>ΔhdrB, ΔtrpA, cas+</italic>) as a non-targeted control strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We conducted another mating experiment using two of the previously described strains: UG633 (<italic>ΔhdrB, ΔtrpA, Δcas</italic> genes, containing the target of the spacer inside <italic>ΔtrpA</italic>) and WR532 (<italic>ΔpyrE2</italic>) with an active CRISPR-Cas system: for this experiment, we used <italic>H. volcanii</italic> UG444 (<italic>ΔhdrB, Δcas</italic>) as a non-targeted control strain lacking the CRISPR-Cas system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>).

Mating experiments were conducted between UG633 (<italic>ΔhdrB, ΔtrpA, Δcas</italic> genes, with the target spacer inserted in <italic>ΔtrpA</italic>) and WR532 (<italic>ΔpyrE2</italic>) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure1A</xref>. After mating, we first plated the culture on a medium containing thymidine and lacking tryptophan to select for cells containing the <italic>trpA+</italic> marker. Interestingly, when we selected for tryptophan marker, we observed high mating efficiency in CRISPR-Cas targeting compared to the non-targeted control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To test whether the effect of CRISPR-Cas targeting extends beyond the targeted region, we plated the culture on a medium that selects for the <italic>hdrB+</italic> marker (using a medium containing tryptophan but lacks thymidine). <bold>Surprisingly,</bold> CRISPR-Cas targeting still resulted in high mating efficiency compared to the non-targeted control, although this efficiency was <bold>approximately half</bold> of what was observed with the <italic>trpA</italic>-based selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C &amp;D</xref>). The increased mating efficiency was not limited to the region directly affected by CRISPR-Cas targeting (<italic>trpA+</italic>), suggesting that CRISPR-Cas targeting may globally enhance gene exchange.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cas3 is required for increased mating in the targeted strain</title><p id="P11">Cas3 is one of the most prominent CRISPR-associated proteins found in all Type I CRISPR-Cas systems, where it exhibits both helicase and nuclease activity. Upon the invasion of foreign DNA, Cas3 is recruited by Cascade and cleaves spacer-matching DNA sequences through its endonuclease activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. We tested whether Cas3 is required for the increased mating observed under targeted conditions. Specifically, if the increased mating is due to CRISPR-Cas interference, then deleting Cas3 in a mating partner with a CRISPR-Cas system that interferes with the target should reverse the increased mating phenotype.</p><p id="P12">To test this, we chose a strain with a <italic>cas3</italic> deletion (but all other cas genes remain intact) and conducted a mating experiment between two sets of strains: UG633 (<italic>ΔhdrB, ΔtrpA, Δcas</italic> genes, which also contains the target of the spacer within <italic>ΔtrpA</italic>) and UG610 (<italic>ΔpyrE, Δcas3</italic>). A non-targeted strain, UG444 (<italic>ΔhdrB, Δcas</italic>), was used as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). After mating, the cells were plated on Hv-Ca plates, and unlike the previous experiment, no difference in mating was observed in the targeted strain UG633, compared with the non-targeted control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). These findings suggest that the increased mating observed under targeted conditions is due to CRISPR-Cas-mediated interference and is dependent on Cas3 proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>CRISPR-Cas systems drive biased recombination in favour of the targeting strain</title><p id="P13">CRISPR-induced genome cleavage has long been known to promote recombination between homologous chromosome arms and initiate homologous recombination (HR) in genome editing applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. As we have observed that CRISPR-Cas targeting increases within-species mating efficiency, it is plausible that this change in mating efficiency could be a result of an increased recombination rate. This is because presumably cells can enter a mating state and then this state can be disrupted, but if recombination has already taken place, segregation will still result in the marker combination that is later selected for. However, CRISPR targeting may bias recombination because one mating partner cuts the genome of the other.</p><p id="P14">To determine whether CRISPR targeting indeed biases recombination, we took 30-50 colonies (mating products) of the experiments described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A &amp; B</xref>), which were selected for the thymidine marker gene (from Hv-Ca +tryptophan plates). Screening by PCR for the trpA gene which was not selected for, indicated that all mating products were recombinant rather than heterozygous, since either the trpA- band or the trpA+ band were obtained but never both (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S2</xref>). These recombinant mating products can be either WR532 cells that obtained the <italic>pyrE</italic> gene or UG633 cells that obtained the <italic>hdrB</italic> gene. We then performed replica plating onto Hv-Ca plates without additional supplementation on which only the former cells can grow because they are trpA (the trpA gene is located 801881 bp away from the <italic>hdrB</italic> gene so for the UG633 to recombine both is far less likely). Approximately 80% of colonies from the targeted mating experiment grew on Hv-Ca plates, whereas only 30%of colonies from the control plate grew on Hv-Ca plates across all biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), indicating that CRISPR targeting biases recombination, and favours gene acquisition by WR532.</p><p id="P15">Furthermore, when we took 50 colonies from the plate selected for the tryptophan marker from Hv-Ca +Thymidine plates (containing the target spacer inserted into <italic>ΔtrpA</italic>) and performed replica plating on Hv-Ca plates, bias was even stronger and, all colonies grew on the Hv-Ca plates, probably because UG633 cells whose genome was cut by CRISPR-Cas in the trpA locus failed to acquire the trpA gene from WR532 cells. We conclude that CRISPR targeting between strains results in a genetic antagonism where the mating partner being can provide genetic material to the "cutter" much more than vice versa, therefore benefitting strains that have CRISPR-Cas function.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Disruption of <italic>MRE11</italic> and <italic>RAD50</italic> leads to increased mating efficiency in <italic>H. volcanii.</italic></title><p id="P16">A likely explanation for the increase in mating success is an increase in recombination. However, this effect of increased HR on mating success has never been examined. We therefore tested whether an <italic>mre11-rad50</italic> knock-out strain, known to have higher homologous recombination activity than the wild type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, will also show higher mating efficiency. We compared the mating efficiency of strain UG634 (<italic>ΔhdrB, ΔtrpA</italic>) with either strain UG60 (<italic>Δmre11, Δrad50, ΔpyrE</italic>) or strain UG532 (<italic>ΔpyrE</italic>) that has wild-type mrelland <italic>rad50.</italic> As expected, we observed higher mating efficiency when the mating partner was deleted for <italic>mre11</italic> and <italic>rad50.</italic> This supports the central role of homologous recombination in determining archaeal mating success (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). We were then curious to investigate whether inducing double-strand DNA breaks using methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) could promote recombination in lab strains of haloarchaea. To address this hypothesis, we conducted a mating experiment (cultures were incubated during fusion stage on YPC+MMS plates and YPC plates as a control for 24 hours) comparing strains with and without previous exposure to MMS. Our results revealed that MMS exposure increased mating events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">HGT is considered a crucial driver of microbial evolution. Previous studies have indicated that CRISPR-Cas systems limit HGT through mechanisms such as conjugation and plasmid transformation, due to their ability to defend against foreign DNA acquisition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Previous work from our lab showed that CRISPR-Cas targeting can restrict gene exchange during inter- species mating between <italic>H. volcanii</italic> and <italic>Haloferax mediterranei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</italic> However, the molecular mechanisms driving the interaction between CRISPR-Cas targeting and HGT within the same species have not been fully understood.</p><p id="P18">In this study, we demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas targeting significantly <italic>increased</italic> within-species mating efficiency in <italic>H. volcanii.</italic> This elevation of mating efficiency can be attributed to increased HR stimulated by CRISPR-Cas activity. Indeed, when we used a genetic background (mutated in <italic>mre11</italic> and <italic>rad50</italic>) known to have higher HR rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. this resulted in higher mating efficiency. The direct association between higher HR and higher mating can also explain the seeming contradiction between the results presented here and our previous work, where CRISPR-Cas targeting <italic>reduced</italic> inter-species mating efficiency between genetically distant <italic>H. volcanii</italic> and <italic>H. mediterranei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</italic> This discrepancy can be explained by the chances of successful HR being much higher when there is high sequence identity (within-species), as is long known for bacteria, eukaryotes and archaea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">Mechanistically, the increase in mating and recombination frequency was probably stimulated by the breaks that Cas3 generates during CRISPR-Cas-mediated DNA cleavage. This increase was dependent on the presence of Cas3 and a targeting CRISPR spacer. In agreement with a CRISPR-Cas stimulated process, recombination favoured integration of genetic material from the genome that was cut into that of the mating partner doing the cutting. Mechanistically this is likely to be driven by a single strand of DNA from the lesion generated by Cas3 helicase-nuclease activity that invades the dsDNA of the CRISPR-positive mating partner.</p><p id="P20">The bias in recombination observed during targeting conditions is particularly intriguing. Our results show that CRISPR-Cas targeting leads to preferential gene flow from the targeted strain to the targeting strain. This genetic antagonism could provide a competitive advantage to strains possessing active CRISPR-Cas systems, as they can acquire beneficial genetic material from related strains while limiting the reciprocal exchange. This asymmetric gene flow could affect adaptation and evolution within archaeal populations.</p><p id="P21">The fact that DNA cleavage increased overall mating rates prompted us to investigate whether less-specific DNA damage will also increase mating frequency. Indeed, exposure of <italic>H. volcanii</italic> to the DNA alkylating agent MMS in cells with intact <italic>mre11-rad50</italic> also increased mating frequency, but only slightly. This is perhaps to be expected, since in <italic>H. volcanii</italic> break repair is done primarily by micro-homology mediated end-joining and not homologous recombination, in the presence of wild-type <italic>mre11-rad50</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). DNA repair by HR with an intact DNA template was also previously shown in the Sulfolobales, where UV exposure induced pili-mediated aggregation and subsequent genomic DNA exchange by the Ced system<sup>22-24</sup>, a process somewhat analogous to haloarchaeal mating, though different mechanistically.</p><p id="P22">In summary, the study presents strong evidence that CRISPR-Cas targeting boosts within-species mating efficiency in <italic>H. volcanii</italic> by enhancing HR rates. Since CRISPR-Cas targeting between different species was shown to have the opposite effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, it therefore follows that CRISPR-Cas systems help maintain species barriers in halophilic archaea.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Culture conditions</title><p id="P23">The wild-type <italic>Haloferax</italic> strains were routinely cultured at 45°C in either Hv-YPC or Hv-Ca medium. <italic>H. volcanii</italic> transformants were selected and grown in either Hv-Ca or Hv-Enhanced Ca (Hv-ECa) medium.
