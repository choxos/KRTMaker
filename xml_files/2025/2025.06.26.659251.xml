One proposed mechanism is the release of bioactive molecules into the interstitium and systemic circulation during exercise, which may act directly on precancerous or tumour cells to suppress DNA damage, inhibit proliferation, and preserve genomic stability. Here, we evaluated the effects of exercise-conditioned human serum on DNA damage kinetics and transcriptomic signatures in colon cancer cells. Blood samples were collected from 30 participants (age 50–78 years, body mass index ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) before and immediately after a maximal incremental cycling test. LoVo cells were exposed to pre- or post-exercise serum, treated with 2 Gy irradiation, and assessed for γ-H2AX foci over 24 hours. Compared to pre-exercise serum, post-exercise serum significantly reduced γ-H2AX foci at 6 hours (<italic>p</italic>=0.024) and decreased the area under the curve (AUC, <italic>p</italic>=0.014), indicating accelerated DNA repair. Post-exercise serum also increased expression of the DNA repair protein <italic>PNKP</italic> in LoVo cells, both with and without irradiation (<italic>p</italic>=0.007 and <italic>p</italic>=0.029, respectively). Transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism and downregulation of cell cycle and proteasome-related pathways. These findings suggest that acute exercise elicits systemic responses that enhance DNA repair and shift colon cancer cells towards a less proliferative transcriptomic state under sublethal genotoxic stress, offering a potential mechanistic explanation for the protective effects of exercise against colorectal carcinogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>radiation</kwd><kwd>colon cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Regular exercise suppresses colon cancer progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> Supervised exercise following adjuvant chemotherapy improves disease-free survival,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and voluntary exercise reduces chemically-induced intestinal tumours in preclinical models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> Putative biological mechanisms include enhanced immunosurveillance and reduced chronic inflammation and insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.

Acute exercise triggers widespread changes in circulating proteins, metabolites, and nucleic acids that could influence DNA repair via metabolic, inflammatory, or regenerative pathways. However, as the serum metabolomic and proteomic responses to acute exercise are well characterised,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> further serum profiling was not pursued in this study.</p><p id="P25">In conclusion, exercise-conditioned serum enhanced DSB repair, upregulated <italic>PNKP</italic>, and induced transcriptional changes that reflect improved mitochondrial metabolism and reduced proliferation in colon cancer cells. These findings point to exercise-induced regulation of DNA repair as a potential mechanistic link between acute exercise and the suppression of colorectal carcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Table S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS207033-supplement-Table_S1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d50aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Anna Turnbull, Aidan Perry, and Rosie Glossop for assisting with the exercise trials.

were quantified at 5 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, and 24 hours post-irradiation as a marker of DNA double-strand breaks. Data are expressed as a percentage of γ-H2AX foci relative to the 5-minute time point. Post-exercise serum significantly reduced γ-H2AX foci at 6 hours and decreased the area under the curve (AUC), indicating accelerated DNA damage repair. *p &lt; 0.05.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207033-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Exercise serum induces transcriptional signatures of enhanced bioenergetics and proteostasis and upregulates the DNA repair gene <italic>PNKP</italic> in colon cancer cells.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of genes upregulated in LoVo cells stimulated with post-exercise serum revealed over-representation of biological processes related to protein synthesis and mitochondrial energy metabolism and downregulation of cell cycle and proteasome-related pathways <bold>(B)</bold> Principal component analysis (PCA) of the top differentially expressed genes demonstrated clear separation between LoVo cells stimulated with pre- vs post-exercise serum, indicating distinct transcriptional profiles. <bold>(C)</bold> qPCR validation confirmed that post-exercise serum significantly upregulated <italic>PNKP</italic>, a key gene involved in DNA repair via base excision repair. <bold>(D–E)</bold> qPCR did not confirm differential expression of <italic>PSME4</italic> or <italic>NEIL1</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207033-f002"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Participant characteristics</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top"/><th align="right" valign="top">Total (n=30)</th><th align="right" valign="top">Male (n=18)</th><th align="right" valign="top">Female (n=12)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Age (years)</td><td align="right" valign="top">64.1 ± 8.4</td><td align="right" valign="top">65.3 ± 7.1</td><td align="right" valign="top">64.3 ± 7.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Ethnicity</td><td align="right" valign="top"/><td align="right" valign="top"/><td align="right" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">  White British</td><td align="right" valign="top">29 (97%)</td><td align="right" valign="top">17 (94%)</td><td align="right" valign="top">12 (100%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">  Multiple ethnic groups</td><td align="right" valign="top">1 (3%)</td><td align="right" valign="top">1 (6%)</td><td align="right" valign="top">0 (0%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">V□O<sub>2</sub>peak (ml.kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup>)</td><td align="right" valign="top">27.2 ± 6.7</td><td align="right" valign="top">29.7 ± 7.4</td><td align="right" valign="top">23.5 ± 2.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Body mass (kg)</td><td align="right" valign="top">85.7 ± 11.0</td><td align="right" valign="top">90.3 ± 8.4</td><td align="right" valign="top">78.8 ± 11.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="right" valign="top">29.6 ± 2.9</td><td align="right" valign="top">29.5 ± 2.2</td><td align="right" valign="top">29.7 ± 3.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Waist circumference (cm)</td><td align="right" valign="top">98.9 ± 8.8</td><td align="right" valign="top">102 ± 6.7</td><td align="right" valign="top">93.2 ± 9.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Body fat (%)<sup>a</sup></td><td align="right" valign="top">35.5 ± 6.9</td><td align="right" valign="top">30.5 ± 3.2</td><td align="right" valign="top">43.1 ± 2.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Fat-free mass (%)<sup>a</sup></td><td align="right" valign="top">64.5 ± 6.8</td><td align="right" valign="top">69.5 ± 3.2</td><td align="right" valign="top">57.1 ± 2.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Skeletal muscle mass (%)<sup>a</sup></td><td align="right" valign="top">29.3 ± 8.9</td><td align="right" valign="top">34.4 ± 2.3</td><td align="right" valign="top">22.6 ± 10.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Fasting BG (mmol/L)</td><td align="right" valign="top">4.7 ± 0.8</td><td align="right" valign="top">4.7 ± 0.9</td><td align="right" valign="top">4.8 ± 0.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Peak expiratory flow (L/min)</td><td align="right" valign="top">462 ± 120</td><td align="right" valign="top">536 ± 91.9</td><td align="right" valign="top">350 ± 50.8</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TFN1"><p id="P41">Data presented as mean ± SD or number (%)</p><p id="P42">BG = blood glucose; BMI = body mass index; V□O<sub>2</sub>peak = peak oxygen consumption.</p><p id="P43">n=15 due to bioelectrical impedance analysis not being available for all participants.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
