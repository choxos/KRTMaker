However, the involvement of a particular layer in learning, especially from a cortex-wide perspective, is relatively unknown. Using wide-field calcium imaging in mice as they learn a whisker-based go/no-go task, we tracked activity in layers 2/3 or 5 (L2/3 or L5) across 25 cortical areas. A surprising initial effect of learning was that activity in L5 but not in L2/3 was globally suppressed at auditory cue onset. As the texture comes into touch, we found that L2/3 displayed learning-related enhancements in higher order association areas rostrolateral (RL) and secondary somatosensory (S2), whereas L5 in these areas oppositely decreased. During texture touch, the barrel cortex (BC) displayed similar learning-related enhancement in both layers. As sensory information is transformed into a motor action, there was a frontal/posterior divergence that emerges after learning, in which L5 was enhanced in the frontal cortex and L2/3 was suppressed in the posterior cortex. In general, learning related correlations were often stronger between distant cortical layers than within the same column, suggesting that learning drives laminar interactions that transcend traditional columnar organization. Together, these results reveal that learning orchestrates a dynamic interplay of activity across space, time and cortical layers. Our findings emphasize the critical role of laminar architecture in shaping cortical plasticity and support the view that layer-specific circuits are fundamental to sensorimotor learning.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Numerous forms of learning, memory and plasticity exist. A well-studied type of learning is associative learning, in which a stimulus is associated with a reward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. In associative learning paradigms, the subject is usually (or often) required to integrate an incoming sensory stimulus, associate it with a future outcome and act appropriately in order to receive the reward. Thus, learning a new task requires precise coordination and sensorimotor integration mediated by the neocortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Learning involves large-scale modulations across the cortex, including enhancement of relevant stimuli in primary sensory cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, dynamic reorganization and refinement of higher-order areas such as secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), association cortices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> and frontal motor cortices such as secondary motor cortex (M2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Learning-related modulations emerge during the association of sensory stimuli with actions and during the pre-stimulus period associated with cognitive functions such as attention and prior experience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. While much is known about how learning changes activity patterns in classes of neurons, very little is known about how the flow of activity changes across the brain for the two major classes of pyramidal neurons, the layer 2/3 (L2/3) and layer 5 (L5) neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Traditionally, L2/3 is considered the integrative layer both locally and between cortical areas, whereas L5 is considered the output layer, conveying information to subcortical areas along with motor information via the pyramidal tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. But recent work shows that these distinctions are oversimplifications, L2/3 neurons across many cortical areas strongly encode movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, L5 neurons encode stimulus properties and higher-order cognitive information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. In addition, the flow of activity can be local within a cortical column<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> or global in which a specific layer in a specific cortical area project directly to another cortical layer in a different cortical area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Locally, interactions between L2/3 and L5 can be excitatory or inhibitory, depend on the context, recording area and other parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Globally, feedforward inputs, originating from lower-order sensory areas and the thalamus, ascend through the cortical hierarchy, targeting the middle layers, conveying external information relevant to the current task. In contrast, feedback signals, arising from higher-order or associative areas, descend to targeted superficial and deep layers, embedding prior knowledge, context, and predictions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Two recent studies have addressed cortex-wide dynamics of different excitatory neuronal subtypes (primarily L2/3 vs. L5) and found diverse functionality across cortex especially in the frontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. These studies suggest that cortical decision-making emerges from the balance and integration of feedforward evidence, feedback modulation, and local recurrent computations within the laminar architecture.</p><p id="P4">Despite the extensive work on cortex-wide dynamics during learning, the specific contributions of neurons in individual layers are not known. Earlier work has shown that during motor learning, L5 neurons in primary motor cortex (M1) showed increased prediction accuracy, while L2/3 neurons maintained stable levels across learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. In barrel cortex (BC), a subpopulation of L5 neurons became more responsive as mice learned to associate a certain stimulus with a reward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> and learning enhanced selectivity in L5 apical dendrites for both rewarded and non-rewarded whisker deflections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, learning-related modulations in L5 neurons outside primary areas and at a more global scale are relatively unknown. In our previous work, we have imaged cortex wide L2/3 dynamics as mice use their whiskers to learn a go/no-go task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. We found a sequential increase in activity and correlation in BC and rostrolateral (RL) as a function of learning, whereas activity in other areas was suppressed. Here, we use a similar approach and compare cortex-wide L2/3 and L5 dynamics in 25 different cortical areas during learning. We find that some areas such as the BC display similar learning-related profiles in both layers, whereas other higher-order cortical areas including RL, S2 and posterior lateral cortex (PL) display opposing dynamics. In general, we find that as mice learn the task, L5 activity is globally suppressed at cue onset, followed by specific enhancements in L2/3 of task-related areas, which lead to widespread enhancements in L5 frontal cortex.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Learning dynamics and behavioral parameters are similar in L2/3 and L5 transgenic mice</title><p id="P5">To compare learning-related dynamics at the cortex-wide level, we trained transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6f in L2/3 (Rasgrf-cre) or L5 (RBP4-cre) across the whole cortex on a whisker-based go/no-go texture discrimination task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. In short, two types of sandpaper were presented to the mice's whiskers, and they were required to associate one of them (go texture) with a reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In ‘Hit’ trials, the mice were rewarded for correctly licking in response to the go texture. They were punished with white noise for incorrectly licking in response to the no-go texture (‘false alarm’ trials, FA), and neither rewarded nor punished when they withheld licking for the go and no-go textures (‘Miss’ and ‘correct-rejection’, CR, trials, respectively). As mice learned to discriminate between the two textures, we used wide-field calcium imaging to measure cortex-wide neuronal population dynamics, in either L2/3 or L5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, along with concurrent video monitoring of whisking and body movements (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). In total, we imaged seven mice for each layer (L5 or L2/3) over 5–8 consecutive days (ranging from 1223 to 2494 trials per mouse).</p><p id="P6">Cortex-wide dynamics were aligned together across days and registered onto the 2D top view Allen reference atlas, 25 cortical areas were defined and divided into four general groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> (Motor, Somatosensory + V1, Association and Auditory, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>). The trial was initiated with an auditory cue, which signaled the approach of a texture within whisker touch for a duration of 2 seconds. Then, the texture moved out of position and a report window of 2 seconds started (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). We defined four discrete time periods in the trial: the ‘cue-period’, which began just after the auditory cue associated with the texture starting to move towards the whiskers (2 to 0.7 s before the texture stop); the ‘pre-period’ (1.1 to 0.7 s before the texture stopped) as the texture approached the whiskers; the ‘early-stim period’ (0.4 to 0 s before the texture stopped), which includes the epoch when the whiskers touched the texture, and the ‘late-stim period’ (1 to 1.4 s after the texture stopped) when the mouse transforms its sensation into an action plan (in Hit trials). The trial structure remained constant across learning.</p><p id="P7">All mice increased performance with training (5–8 days; ~400 trials/day) and eventually reached expert performance (d′ within 30-trial bins; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref> for individual mice; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Importantly, the learning profile of L2/3 and L5 mice are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref> for individual mice). For each mouse, we defined the ‘learning threshold’ by crossing a d′ of 1.5, and the ‘naïve’ and ‘expert’ phases as 300 trials, approximately 150 trials before and after the crossing point, respectively. The learning threshold is not significantly different between L2/3 and L5 mice (p &gt; 0.05; Rank-sum test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Next, we quantified the body movement of the mice as a function of learning, which was shown to have a profound effect on cortex-wide neuronal dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. To do this, for each trial, we extracted forelimb and back movements from the body camera and calculated a binary movement vector by choosing a fixed threshold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> (30-trial bins; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). An example of a 2D movement probability (only Hit trials across learning) reveals that as mice gained expertise, they exert increased body movement, which initiated earlier, as texture approach the whiskers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Importantly, L2/3 and L5 mice exhibit insignificant differences in movement probability along the trial in both naïve and expert cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>; p &gt; 0.05; Rank-sum test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref> for individual). In summary, L5 and L2/3 mice display similar learning profiles along with similar movement strategies, enabling us to compare learning-related cortex-wide dynamics between layers.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Learning-related laminar divergence during sensorimotor integration</title><p id="P9">We analyzed spatiotemporal dynamics of L2/3 and L5 cortical activity across learning, as revealed by wide-field calcium imaging. Here, we focused on Hit trials, in which probabilities were relatively high across learning and similar across layers. In general, both L2/3 and L5 display similar temporal dynamics during the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), in which RL association cortex is activated as the texture approaches the whiskers and precede the BC, which is mainly activated during the texture touch (early-stim period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>). When comparing activity maps between naïve and expert mice within a specific layer, we observe several distinguishing features within each time period across L2/3 and L5. For example, during the cue-period, L5 naïve activity map shows widespread responses that are less evident in the expert map. This change is not evident in the L2/3 maps.</p><p id="P10">To highlight how activity patterns change with learning, we chose five cortical areas that captured the main learning-related modulations across layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). For each cortical area, we show a 2D response plot of trial vs. learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2bi</xref>; temporal profile of the trial on the x axis; learning profile in the y axis); trial responses during naïve and expert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2bii</xref>); learning response during a specific trial period, what we term as a "learning curve" (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2biii</xref>); and an average response during each epoch, in naïve and expert animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2biv</xref>). These analyses show: first, that in both L2/3 and L5, BC displays similar and significant learning-related enhancement during the early-stim period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> left; p &lt; 0.05; Signed-rank test). In contrast, activity in RL is significantly enhanced in L2/3 across learning but significantly decreases in L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> second from left; L5 shows significance slightly earlier in the cue-period; p &lt; 0.05; Signed-rank test). A frame-by-frame statistical analysis is displayed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>, which shows that suppression in L5 occurs slightly earlier than the enhancement in L2/3. The third area, S2, displays a similar laminar divergence to RL, with an emphasis on strong suppression specifically in L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> middle). In the fourth area, PL, we focused on the late-stim period, in which the mouse has already transformed the sensory information into motor output. During the late-stim period, PL in L5 is significantly increased across learning, whereas in L2/3 it is significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> second from right; p &lt; 0.05; Signed-rank test). The fifth area, M1, during the late-stim period, displays a significant increase across learning in L5 (p &lt; 0.05; Signed-rank test) but not in L2/3 (p &gt; 0.05; Signed-rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> right).</p><p id="P11">Next, we expanded our analysis to all 25 cortical areas and analyzed the mean response during each time period in naïve and expert phases for L2/3 and L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We highlight several learning-related modulations at a global scale: (1) A large-scale, learning-related suppression during the cue-period is evident in L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>, Cue epoch). This effect is not observed in L2/3, which later shows enhanced activity in task-related areas during the pre-period, an effect not seen in L5. (2) During the late-stim period, L5 displays a widespread increase in expert animals, especially in the frontal cortex (i.e., M1, M2 etc.), whereas L2/3 activity, specifically in the posterior cortex, is suppressed and further decreases as mice become experts. These dynamics emphasize that as the mouse learns to transform sensory information into a motor response, L5 and L2/3 are dynamically and distinctly modulated.</p><p id="P12">To further investigate the interaction between learning dynamics and cortical activity, we defined a ‘Learning map’ for each time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The learning curve (i.e., d′ as a function of trials) was correlated (using Pearson's correlation, r) with the response profile (i.e., ΔF/F as a function of trials), for each pixel in the imaging area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). A positive correlation value indicates that the response within the given pixel is correlated with learning, i.e., increases with learning. A negative correlation value indicates that the response within the given pixel decreases with learning. This analysis shows how the activity map in L2/3 and L5 changes progressively as mice learn. Example learning maps for one L2/3 and one L5 mouse show that during the cue-period, L5 is negatively correlated with learning across the whole cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary video 2</xref>). During the pre-period, L2/3 somatosensory and association area RL, are positively correlated with learning, whereas L5 activity across the majority of cortex remains negatively correlated. During the early-stim period, many sensory and motor areas including BC exhibit strong positive correlations with learning in both layers. During the late-stim period, L5 activity is positively correlated with learning across most of the cortex, whereas during this epoch, positive correlations for L2/3 are confined to the frontal cortex and negative correlations to the posterior cortex.</p><p id="P13">Next, we examined the five representative cortical areas (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) and calculated their correlation with learning for each time frame separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). BC displayed significant positive correlations in both layers during the early-stim period (p &lt; 0.05; Signed-rank test), with no significant difference between L2/3 and L5 (p &gt; 0.05; Rank-sum test). In RL and S2 there is a divergence between layers: L5 is significantly negatively correlated with learning during the cue-period whereas L2/3 displays a significant positive correlation with learning at slightly later time points in the pre-period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). In PL and M1, positive correlations are evident in L5 during the late-stim period. In this epoch, L2/3 in PL is significantly negatively correlated with learning, and M1 has no significant correlation with learning. A frame-by-frame statistical analysis between layers is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>.</p><p id="P14">Analysis across all 25 cortical areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), highlights the general negative correlation with learning in L5 during the cue-period. RL and S2 are two representative cortical areas that are differentially correlated, with a significant negative correlation in L5 during this epoch, and a significant positive correlation in L2/3 during the following pre-period. In the early-stim epoch, both L2/3 and L5 are similarly positively correlated with learning in somatosensory and motor areas. In the late-stim epoch, there is a significant positive correlation in L5, which is less pronounced in L2/3 anterior cortex and entirely absent in L2/3 posterior cortex, which displays negative correlations.</p><p id="P15">These results motivated us to develop a ‘Layer similarity index’ that could be used to quantify whether activity in each layer and each brain area changes similarly with learning. To do this, we defined a layer similarity index as the correlation of the learning traces with L2/3 and L5 in each cortical area were correlated to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>; values range from -1 to 1). A positive layer similarity index (r &gt; 0) indicates that L2/3 and L5 display similar dynamics with regards to learning. A weak layer similarity index (r ~ 0) indicates that L2/3 and L5 display different dynamics with regards to learning. A negative layer similarity index (r &lt; 0) indicates that L2/3 and L5 display opposite dynamics with regards to learning. This analysis shows that the anterior sensory and motor areas: motor M2, ALM, and Somatosensory Mo, No, FL, HL, BC, and Trunk cortex changes similarly. Even some association areas (AM and RD) are modulated similarly during learning in L2/3 and L5 (further analyses to show the similar dynamics in M2 and RD between L2/3 and L5 are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). In contrast, posterior lateral association areas (LM, LI, PL and PR) and V1, have negative layer similarity indices, i.e., opposing relations to learning for L2/3 and L5. M1, S2 and RL display a near zero index, i.e., different relations to learning for L2/3 and L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b; 4c</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that L2/3 and L5 can have similar or different dynamics with regards to learning, depending on the cortical area.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>L5 temporal activity is strongly associated with task execution</title><p id="P16">Next, we analyzed the correlation between cortex-wide dynamics in L2/3 or L5 and movement. First, we defined a ‘Movement map’ by correlating the body movement trace with the response trace of each pixel in the imaged area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Data from each trial in naïve and expert cases for L2/3 and L5 were separately averaged. A positive value (r) indicates similar dynamics between the body movement and the response in a given pixel. A negative value indicates that body movement and the response in a given pixel had opposing dynamics. A movement map from a single animal reveal that in naïve L2/3 animals, there is a positive correlation between movement and pixel responses in frontal sensory and motor areas. This correlation for frontal areas becomes slightly stronger after learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). In naïve animals, the correlation to movement is weaker in posterior areas, and after learning, they are negatively correlated to movement. In L5, on the other hand, there is a positive correlation to movement throughout the cortex. This correlation further strengthens after learning, in the expert animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p><p id="P17">The average correlation maps between movement and activity across all 25 areas show a frontal/posterior dissociation for L2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). As the mice learn, the posterior cortex, excluding RD, becomes negatively correlated with movement. In L5, no such frontal/posterior divergence is observed. The correlation with movement is significantly higher in expert mice compared to naïve mice across all areas, with strong effect in the frontal cortex. This frontal/posterior divergence is also evident in the grouped data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>; Motor, Somatosensory + V1, Association and auditory cortex). Expert L5 mice display a positive correlation, particularly in the frontal cortex, whereas expert L2/3 mice exhibit a negative correlation with movement in posterior areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>; p &lt; 0.05; n=7 mice; Signed-rank test). Taken together, these results indicate that, with learning, L2/3 and L5 exhibit distinct cortex-wide dynamics in relation to body movement, in a lamina specific manner: L5 shows a positive movement correlation in frontal areas, while L2/3 shows a negative movement correlation in posterior cortex.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Functional correlations between layers across temporal periods</title><p id="P18">Given this unique dataset of learning-related cortical dynamics across both layers, we aimed to assess the direct relationship between learning-related dynamics across layers. Specifically, we were interested in examining the link between the learning profile in one layer during a specific time period and the learning profile in another layer in a subsequent time period. To do this, we first defined a ‘ROI seed map’, in which we correlated the response learning curve (ΔF/F as a function of learning) in a cortical area, the seed area, with the response learning curve of each pixel across the 25 imaged areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Positive correlation values indicate that, during learning, this pixel is modulated similarly to the seed area. Negative correlation values indicate that the pixel is modulated in the opposite direction to the seed area. This analysis can be performed for each layer individually, or by using an area in one layer (e.g., L5), it is possible to generate a map of activity in the other layer (e.g., L2/3). Additionally, this analysis can be performed for specific time epochs, for example, using the cue-period in the seed area and relating it to a different time period in the map, such as the subsequent pre-period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>).</p><p id="P19"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref> illustrates specific relationships that are performed in this analysis. First, we calculated the relationship between the learning curve in S2 L5 during the cue-period and the activity map of L2/3 or L5 during the subsequent pre-period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c-d</xref>). This analysis reveals that during the cue-period, activity in S2 L5 is negatively correlated with most of the somatosensory cortex in L2/3 during the pre-period, and to a lesser extent, with L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c, d</xref>). Quantification across the 25 cortical areas and four areal groups in each layer highlights the negative values in L2/3 somatosensory areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>; p&lt;0.05; Signed-rank test). A seed analysis with each time frame instead of a specific epoch, as well as using S2 L2/3 as the seed area, is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 5a-c</xref>. These results suggest that as mice become experts, reduced activity in L5 of several cortical areas (including S2) during the cue-period leads to learning-related enhancement in L2/3 of task-related somatosensory areas (and RL).</p><p id="P20">To examine whether RL change in activity plays a role during the early-stim period as the texture approaches the whiskers, we repeated a similar analysis. We correlated the learning curve in RL L2/3 during the pre-period with activity maps of L2/3 or L5 during the subsequent early-stim period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e-f</xref>). During the pre-period, RL L2/3 activity is positively correlated with motor and somatosensory regions in both L2/3 and L5, and with association areas in L2/3 but not in L5 during the early-stim period (p &lt; 0.05; Signed-rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>). A seed analysis with each time frame, as well as one using RL L5 as the seed area, is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 5d-f</xref>. These relationships between suggest that as the texture approaches the whiskers, a specific learning-related enhancement in RL opens a temporal window for subsequent sensory processing in somatosensory and motor cortex in both layers.</p><p id="P21">Next, we correlated the learning curve of BC during the early-stim period (either L2/3 or L5) with the activity maps of L2/3 or L5 during the late-stim period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g-h</xref>). BC L2/3 activity during the early-stim period is positively correlated with L2/3 motor areas and significantly negatively correlated in lateral posterior areas during late-stim period (PL, PR, LM and LI; p &lt; 0.05; Signed-rank test). In contrast, BC L5 activity during the early-stim period is positively correlated with the entire dorsal L5 cortex during the late-stim period (p &lt; 0.05; Signed-rank test). A frame-by-frame analysis highlights this divergence between layers, specifically during the late-stim period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 5g</xref>). A complementary cross-layers analysis, switching between seed layers, reveals similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 5h-i</xref>). These analyses suggest that BC increased activity during the early-stim period, integrating sensory information and transforming it into action. L5 population across the cortex is recruited during the late-stim period to execute the motor plan. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6i</xref> summarizes our findings and highlights the main interlaminar interactions across the temporal profile of a Hit trial.

However, these analyses do not indicate whether activity in a certain cortical area discriminates between texture types. Does the discriminative power differ between L2/3 and L5? To address these questions, we computed the discrimination power between Hit and CR trials using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, with the area under the curve (AUC) representing discrimination power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). AUC values range between 0 and 1, where extreme values of 0 or 1 indicate high levels of discriminative power. Here, we focused only on the expert case, due to the low probability in CR and Hit trials in the naïve case. In the current dataset, responses in Hit and CR trials during expert phase are relatively similar, with a tendency for higher responses in Hit trials emerging during the pre-period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 6a-b</xref>). We applied this method to compute an AUC map for specific time periods, starting from the end of the cue-period to the end of the pre-period. The AUC maps from one example mouse of L2/3 and L5 reveal that the AUC first increases in BC and motor areas in L5 (-1.4 s, cue-pre) and only later becomes prominent in L2/3 (-1.0 s, pre-period; Fig.7a). We calculated the AUC for each time frame and grouped the AUC values into four regions. L5 exhibits a significant increase in AUC across all regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>; p&lt;0.05; Signed-rank test compared to 0.5). This change in AUC values preceded increases in L2/3, motor, somatosensory, and auditory areas. The peak of the AUC curve occurs earlier in L5 compared to L2/3 in motor and somatosensory areas (p&lt;0.05; Rank-sum test). Averaging AUC values within specific time windows reveals significant AUC values (different than 0.5) in all regions between the cue and the pre periods (cue-pre) in L5 but not in L2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>; p &lt; 0.05; Signed-rank test). Later, during the pre-period, L2/3 joins L5 and develop significant AUC values in motor and somatosensory areas (p &lt; 0.05; Signed-rank test). Taken together, both layers display discriminative power of choice (i.e., Hit vs. CR), with L5 slightly preceding L2/3 and exhibiting a more widespread discriminative capacity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">Here, we find that learning induces widespread, spatiotemporally complex changes in both L2/3 and L5. Surprisingly, learning-related dynamics were not always similar between layers and even displayed opposing dynamics in several higher-order cortical areas. Our main takeaway is that during learning, L5 plays a general role in suppressing cortex-wide responses before sensation and enhancing responses, particularly in frontal regions, after sensation during motor execution. In contrast, L2/3 contributes with local enhancement in task-related areas (in our case, RL and BC) just before and during sensation, thus enabling the optimal association of a certain stimulus with a reward.</p><sec id="S9"><title>Laminar relationships within and across cortical areas</title><p id="P24">A widely accepted local organization is the cortical column which is considered a functional unit of information processing, having denser connections within the cortical column than between columns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Whether different layers within a given cortical column change similarly or differently over days, as animals learn has been examined in very few contexts, especially for higher-order cortical areas. When observing the gradual modulation across the learning profile (i.e., across days), our results indicate inter-layer similarities or differences depending on the cortical area and the time along the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). For example, BC during the early sensation period and also M2 and RD, displayed similar learning-related dynamics in both L2/3 and L5. In contrast, several higher-order areas such as RL, S2 and PL display opposite learning dynamics across layers, in some cases L2/3 is enhanced and L5 is suppressed (e.g., RL and S2 during the pre-period) and vice versa in other cases (e.g., PL in late-stim period).</p><p id="P25">Our work suggests an update of the classical model of the canonical cortical circuit (L4 → L2/3 → L5/6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> and the possible participation of other classes of local and global interactions.

Taken together, one or more of these circuit motifs might change gradually in the course of learning and modify activity in each cortical area in a unique fashion depending on task demands.</p><p id="P26">The exact balance between layers may be largely affected by diverse inputs from long-range cortical areas (e.g., S2, M1) subcortical areas (e.g., thalamus) and the neuromodulatory systems (e.g., cholinergic and adrenergic)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. Our work provides a global, cortex-wide window into activity in each pyramidal layer individually and their coactivation across cortical areas. We find strong extra-columnar interactions within and between L2/3 and L5 with a focus on subsequent time periods, e.g., from the cue to pre-period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c-d</xref>). As mice learn, activity in L5 of many cortical areas are negatively correlated with the learning profile of task-relevant somatosensory areas in L2/3 (during the pre-period). Another example, RL cortex in L2/3 (during pre-period) is positively correlated with the frontal cortex of L5 (during early-stim, but also in L2/3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e-f</xref>). Our results indicate that extra-columnar interactions can be stronger than within columnar interactions, emphasizing the importance of global laminar dynamics during learning. Indeed, several studies have highlighted the important roles of long-range projections from and onto specific layers, emphasizing top-down control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>.

In summary, we find complex inter-laminar dynamics both locally (intra-columnar) and globally (extra-columnar) that may together promote learning.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Global and local laminar dynamics underlying sensorimotor integration</title><p id="P27">In the current study mice learned to discriminate between two textures (sensed by their whiskers) and associate each one of them with a different outcome, reward or punishment. In rewarded trials, mice transformed the sensory information and association of each texture into a motor action (i.e., licking in Hit trials) in order to receive a reward. Furthermore, mice learned sensorimotor pattern is embedded within a fixed trial structure, starting with an auditory cue, followed by the texture approaching after which a texture moved into whisker touch and finally an auditory cue signaling the availability of reward (in response to a licking action). In a more general sense, mice learned to perform a sensorimotor integration within a fixed trial structure.</p><p id="P28">We find that both L2/3 and L5 population display similar sequential dynamics starting with a typical response in RL as the texture comes in, followed by BC activation during early sensation and ending with frontal cortex activity during motor execution (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Nevertheless, learning-related modulations within the general trial structure and along the learning profile dramatically differ between L2/3 and L5. As the auditory is sounded, mice learn to link the cue with an incoming reward-related stimulus which requires sensory integration and discrimination (between go and no-go textures). In response to the cue, L5 populations decrease activity in a global manner with emphasis in RL, S2 and frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). In contrast, L2/3 displays minor learning-related suppression with local decreases in medial association areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Although movement probability is only ~20% (of all Hit trials) during the cue-period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>), mice (both L2/3 and L5) significantly decrease their movement after learning, indicating that the cue leads to quiescence in anticipation for the texture. Thus, global suppression in L5 may mediate a behavioral state of arousal in which motor planning and execution is diminished.</p><p id="P29">The laminar dynamics as a function of learning continue to change along the trial structure, as time goes by. As the texture comes into touch, learning-related modulation are transferred from global L5 suppression to local L2/3 enhancement, specifically in association area RL. RL enhancement in L2/3 just prior to sensation may convey task-related information such as attention and task history-related signals to Barrel cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. This top-down projection (specifically from L2/3) of higher-order information may make it possible for expert animals to optimally locate and discriminate between sensory stimuli. Sensory integration in BC occurs in both L2/3 and L5 and is likely to be related to a decision to lick or not, indicating that BC may be a key location in which sensation and action are associated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). If the mouse decides to lick (i.e., execution), learning-related modulations are transformed from BC (presumably from L5) into a global signal in which L5 activity enhanced especially in the frontal cortex, whereas L2/3 is mostly suppressed in the posterior cortex. Taken together, these results highlight a sensorimotor pattern of activity that starts with global L5 suppression (in anticipation of an incoming sensation) followed by local sensory-related L2/3 enhancement (responsible for sensory integration) which is then transformed into global L5 enhancement (which represent a motor execution).

L5 frontal enhancement may represent the planning and execution of a motor action whereas L2/3 posterior suppression may indicate the active blocking of any additional incoming sensory information which may perturb the already ongoing sensorimotor integration.

Thus, as learning occurs, top-down inhibition may undergo plastic modulation and initiate as L5 frontal neurons become active during motor execution. Another mechanistic explanation for frontal/posterior divergence is the heterogenous effect of different neuromodulators, e.g., acetylcholine (ACh)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref></sup>. ACh has been linked to aroused states and displays a frontal to posterior gradient across the dorsal cortex with optimal representation in the frontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref></sup>.

Taken together, we propose that learning to transform a sensation into action promotes an ACh-mediated frontal motor cortex activation in L5 which projects back to posterior sensory cortex and suppresses L2/3 populations via local inhibitory circuits. These sequential dynamics (from frontal to posterior) could also explain the higher and earlier discrimination power in L5 compared to L2/3, implying that choice encoding may first emerge in deeper layers in the frontal cortex (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p id="P31">In summary, our work highlights how activity throughout cortex changes as animals learn a sensory motor task.

All mice were continuously imaged during learning (5–8 days). Wide-field fluorescence images were downsampled down to 256×256 pixels, and pixels outside the imaging area were discarded. This resulted in a spatial resolution of ~40 µm/pixel, which was sufficient to determine cortical borders in both L2/3 and L5, despite further scattering of emitted light through the tissue and skull. Using an interleaved imaging protocol, we first extracted signal to 470 nm and 405 nm traces. Next, for each trace, each pixel and each trial were normalized to the baseline from several frames before the stimulus cue (frame 0 division). Next, the 405 nm normalized traces were subtracted from the 473 nm normalized trace<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. We report that this correction resulted in a minor modulation, mainly in reducing post-activation dips in the signal, but results were largely similar to those of mice imaged with only the 473 nm light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P40">To define regions of interests (ROIs), the activation maps within each mouse were aligned together across days based on a semi-automatic protocol using blood vessel patterns to choose 5-7 points (cpselect function in MATLAB) and use them for transformation (cp2tform in MATLAB). Next, aligned activation maps were further registered onto the Allen atlas based on skull coordinates and functional patches (©2004 Allen Institute for Brain Science<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mouse.brainmap.org/">http://mouse.brainmap.org/</ext-link>). Within the atlas borders, we defined 25 areas of interest, with some manual modifications within these borders to fit the functional activity for each mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Motor cortex areas were defined based on stereotaxic coordinates and functional patches for each mouse (see below). Thus, all mice had similar regions of interest that were comparable within and across mice. Although the top 2D view for L5 may be slightly more condensed in lateral areas, we did not correct for this since we did not feel that L2/3 and L5 were substantially different (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary video 1</xref>). We further grouped these 25 areas into motor (orange), somatosensory + V1 (purple), association (green), and auditory (blue) areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). <bold>Motor areas:</bold> whisker-related primary motor cortex (M1; 1.5 anterior and 1 mm lateral from bregma, corresponding to the whisker evoked activation patch in M1 from the mapping session), anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM; 2.5 anterior and 1.5 mm lateral from bregma) and secondary motor cortex (M2); 1.5 anterior and 0.5 mm lateral from bregma corresponding. <bold>Sensory areas:</bold> somatosensory mouth (Mo), somatosensory nose (No), somatosensory hindlimb (HL), somatosensory forelimb (FL), barrel cortex (BC; primary somatosensory whisker); secondary somatosensory whisker (S2), somatosensory trunk (Tr), and primary visual cortex (V1). <bold>Association cortex:</bold> rostrolateral (RL), anterior (A), anterior lateral (AL), anterior medial (AM), posterior medial (PM), lateral medial (LM), lateral intermediate (LI), posterior lateral (PL), post-rhinal (PR), retrosplenial dorsal (RD), and retrosplenial angular (RA). <bold>Auditory areas:</bold> primary auditory (A1), auditory dorsal (AD), and temporal association area (TEA).</p><p id="P41">Within the temporal trial structure, we defined four time periods: cue (2 to 1.6 s before the texture stop) pre (1.1 to 0.7 s before the texture stop); early-stim (0.4 to 0 s before the texture stop); late-stim (1 to 1.4 s after the texture stop). Naïve and expert phases were defined in a window of 300 trials, approximately 150 trials before and after crossing the learning threshold.</p><p id="P42">The dataset consists of cortex-wide activation maps along the time course of a trial (7 seconds), repeated over the time course of learning (several days, hundreds of trials). This was collected for seven L2/3 mice and seven L5 mice. This three-dimensional dataset (brain x trial x learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>) can be presented in several ways: (1) Activity map (ΔF/F) averaged during a specific time period within a trial (i.e., cue, pre, early-stim or late-stim) and during expert or naïve cases (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>); (2) 2D plot of response in a certain cortical area where the x-axis is the trial structure and the y-axis is the learning profile (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2bi</xref>); (3) A response curve across learning (i.e., a learning curve) during a specific time period within a trial for a certain brain area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2biii</xref>); (4) A response during the trial averaged during naïve or expert cases for a certain brain area (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2bii</xref>).

Next, each behavioral learning curve was fitted with a sigmoid function (sigmfit function in MATLAB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>). A d′ = 1.5 was defined as the threshold for becoming expert (i.e. learning threshold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Learning maps and correlation with learning</title><p id="P44">To study the relationship between the behavioral learning curve and cortex-wide dynamics (either L2/3 or L5) across learning, we calculated a ‘Learning map’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). This was done by calculating the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between the behavioral learning curve of the mouse and the corresponding learning curve (i.e., response curve (ΔF/F) across learning) for each pixel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The r values were calculated for all pixels in the imaged area and can be presented as a map in which this is done for a specific time period (i.e. cue, pre, early-stim or late-stim period; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary video 2</xref>) or for each time frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Positive r values depict similar dynamics in a given brain area to the behavioral performance of the mouse. Negative r values depict opposing dynamics in a given brain area to the behavioral performance of the mouse (i.e., a decrease in activity along the learning profile). To quantify similarities and differences between L2/3 and L5 with relation to learning, we defined a ‘Layer similarity index’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The layer similarity index was defined as the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between L2/3 and L5 correlations with learning traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). A positive layer similarity index (r &gt; 0) indicates that L2/3 and L5 display similar dynamics with regard to learning. A negative layer similarity index (r &lt; 0) indicates that L2/3 and L5 display different dynamics with regard to learning. The above analyses were done for each mouse separately and then averaged across either L2/3 or L5 mice.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Movement maps and correlation with movement</title><p id="P45">To study the relationship between the body movement of mice and the accompanying cortex-wide dynamics in L2/3 and L5, we calculated a ‘Movement map’. This was done by calculating the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between the behavioral movement vector (along the trial) of the mouse and the neuronal response (along the trial) in each pixel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). This was done for each trial and then can be averaged within the naïve and expert phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Positive r values depict similar dynamics between the body movement and the response in a given pixel along the trial. Negative r values depict opposing dynamics between the body movement and the response in a given pixel along the trial. The r values can then be averaged into 25 areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>) or into four general regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Regions of interests seed maps across layers and across time periods</title><p id="P46">To study the relationship between the learning curves of different layers and different time periods, we calculated a ‘ROI seed map’. In general, a ROI seed map calculates the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between the learning curve (i.e., the response across the learning profile) of a certain area (i.e., seed region of interest) and the learning curve of each pixel in the imaged area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Positive r values indicate similar learning-related response dynamics between the seed areas and the given pixel. Negative r values indicate opposing learning-related response dynamics between the seed areas and the given pixel. Next, ROI seed maps can be calculated across different layers, for example the seed learning curve from L5 with the map (i.e., pixels) from L2/3. In addition, a ROI seed map can be taken from different time periods within the trial, for example, the seed learning curve can be during the cue-period and the map can be from the pre-period. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref> displays the different types of ROI seed maps that are presented in this study, with emphasis on studying cross-layer interactions along subsequent time periods. To achieve a statistical comparison between layers, the learning curve of a seed ROI in a certain layer was correlated with the map of each mouse in the other layer, thus achieving n = 7 mice, which was used for statistical comparison.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Discrimination power between Hit and CR trials in different layers</title><p id="P47">To measure how well neuronal populations could discriminate between Hit and CR trials during the expert phase, we calculated a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve between the response in Hit trials and CR trials (ΔF/F) and calculated its area under the curve (AUC) to determine the accuracy of the classifier. AUC values range from 0 to 1, where values around 0.5 indicate no discrimination power and extreme values (near 1 or 0) indicate high discriminative power. This analysis was done for each pixel in the imaging area (averaged during a specific time period), thus, obtaining an AUC map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). In addition, AUC can be calculated for each time frame separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>) and averaged for each cortical area or general region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P48">In general, non-parametric two-tailed statistical tests were used: Rank-sum test to compare the medians of two populations, or the Signed-rank test to compare a population’s median to zero (or between two paired populations).
