It applies opposing selection pressures to enhance activity and switchability of phage-encoded effectors and leverages retron-based recombineering to broadly explore fitness landscapes, covering point mutations, insertions and deletions. Applying our pipeline to the transcription factor AraC yielded optogenetic variants with light-controlled activity spanning ~1000-fold dynamic range.

A defining feature of many proteins is <italic>allostery</italic>, i.e. the ability to transmit local conformational changes across distant sites to modulate protein activity in response to environmental or cellular cues. This regulatory principle, termed the ‘second secret of life’ by Monod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), underpins diverse biological processes, from gene regulation to metabolism and sensory perception, and serves as a fundamental mechanism for information processing and signal transmission in cells.</p><p id="P3">Technologies based on synthetic allosteric proteins seek to harness this regulatory mechanism for remote control of biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Optogenetics, for instance, repurposes naturally light-sensitive proteins to regulate processes such as neuronal action potential firing with precise spatial and temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). A more modular strategy involves inserting light-sensitive domains - such as light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domains - into allosteric surface sites of unrelated effectors to render their activity input-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). While the transformative potential of “synthetic allostery” is widely appreciated, engineering allosteric proteins is challenging. The key difficulty lies in establishing reliable communication between sensor and effector domains so that input-dependent structural changes elicit the desired functional output. Advances in molecular modeling and machine learning have improved predictions of permissive sensor-effector fusion sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) but fall short of capturing the energetic couplings and conformational dynamics that govern the complex allosteric networks required for effective switching. These limitations highlight a core challenge of synthetic allostery: its governing principles are often emergent, encoded not in isolated residues but in distributed, nonlinear interactions.</p><p id="P4">Rather than solving this complexity through rational design, nature navigates it through variation and selection, thereby gradually tuning allosteric behavior by sampling and amplifying useful configurations across generations. When selection pressures change frequently as it is the case for environmental cues, cellular states, or signaling rhythms, the optimal activity of a protein depends on its current environmental context. Over evolutionary timescales, proteins respond to such pressures by acquiring new domains, accumulating mutations, and reorganizing structural elements to enable context-specific control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The evolutionary success of an organism can therefore hinge on the emergence of proteins that toggle between functional states in response to certain inputs. A canonical example is the circadian clock, which evolved independently across life forms to track the day-night cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), often through light-dependent allostery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). Similar regulatory architectures emerge in systems responsive to ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), redox state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), or mechanical force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), allowing proteins to adapt their activity to diverse and dynamic conditions. In such systems, evolution effectively see-saws proteins across distinct fitness landscapes, enriching mutations that optimize function under alternating conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Taking inspiration from natural systems, we hypothesized that directed evolution under dynamic selection regimes could provide a powerful means to explore the complex fitness landscapes of allosteric protein behavior and uncover the context-dependent sequence-function relationships that lie beyond the reach of rational design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). To test this, we turned to phage-assisted evolution, a platform that links effector protein function to M13 phage propagation in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). By pairing the rapid generation time of M13 phage with an immensely scalable, <italic>in vivo</italic> selection architecture, phage-assisted evolution has proven effective for solving a wide range of challenging protein engineering tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). However, existing phage-assisted evolution systems focus on optimizing a selected activity under more or less static conditions, rendering them ill-suited for evolving proteins that must switch between distinct functional states in response a defined input.</p><p id="P6">Here we present POGO-PANCE (Protein-switch On/Off Gene Optimization using Phage-Assisted Non-Continuous Evolution), a directed evolution strategy inspired by the emergence of allosteric regulation in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). POGO-PANCE cyclically “bounces” evolving proteins between alternating selection steps corresponding to the presence and absence of a defined input signal, thereby co-navigating two alternating sequence fitness landscapes simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). This design enforces the emergence of effector protein variants that are both highly active and responsive to a chosen input.</p><p id="P7">A critical determinant of directed evolution success is the diversity of the genetic pool subjected to selection. In standard phage-assisted evolution systems, mutagenesis plasmids (MPs) increase point mutation rates by perturbing DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). However, they introduce strong mutational biases and cannot generate insertions or deletions (InDels), significantly limiting the accessible protein sequence space. We therefore developed RAMPhaGE (<italic>Recombitron-Assisted Multiplexed Phage Gene Evolution</italic>), a retron-based <italic>in vivo</italic> diversification method capable of introducing point mutations and InDels at tunable frequencies, thus unlocking regions of the protein sequence space previously inaccessible to phage assisted evolution.</p><p id="P8">To demonstrate our novel concepts, we applied POGO-PANCE and RAMPhaGE to the arabinose-responsive transcription factor AraC, a well-characterized bacterial effector protein. Through iterative evolution cycles, we obtained light-responsive AraC variants with almost binary switch-like behavior and dynamic control spanning over three orders of magnitude. Tracking evolving phage pools via short- and long-read sequencing revealed key adaptive trajectories and pinpointed structural features and epistatic interactions that underlie effective allosteric switching. Together, POGO-PANCE and RAMPhaGE not only enable evolution of programmable molecular switches, but also open a window into the emergence and architecture of allosteric networks.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Conceptualization of POGO-PANCE to evolve allosteric switches</title><p id="P9">To mimic natural dynamic selection regimes as required to evolve switchable proteins, POGO-PANCE alternates between temporally separated positive and negative selection steps, each aligned to the presence or absence of a defined input, such as light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). In positive selection, as in conventional Phage-Assisted Non-Continuous Evolution (PANCE), effector activity promotes expression of M13 gene III (gIII), encoding an essential phage coat protein (pIII), from an accessory plasmid (AP) in trans, thereby enabling phage propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). In contrast, during negative selection, the same regulatory circuit is inverted such that effector protein activity drives expression of a dominant-negative gIII variant (gIII-Neg), which is incorporated into assembling phage particles and blocks their release from the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). To enable selective propagation of inactive variants during this step, wild-type (WT) gIII is provided at low levels from a separate AP. Because the input states and circuit logic are mutually exclusive, selections are performed in batch culture sequentially, where environmental conditions can be precisely toggled. As input, POGO-PANCE requires phages encoding an effector with at least minimal stimulus responsiveness, e.g. from rational design or screening. For evolution of trigger-activated effectors, the input is present during positive selection and absent during negative selection; for trigger-inhibited effectors, the inverse applies. By iteratively applying diversification (e.g. via mutagenesis plasmids), negative and positive selection, each time toggling the input accordingly, POGO-PANCE recapitulates dynamic evolutionary pressures analogous to those found in nature, such as the day-night cycles that shaped circadian clocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A and D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Evolution of highly active AraC variants that are independent of arabinose</title><p id="P10">Having conceptualized the POGO-PANCE approach, we applied it to the evolution of optogenetic effector proteins. Light, as an input, offers superior spatiotemporal precision compared to chemical control, and it can be readily added or removed in a PANCE setup. As candidate effector, we selected the <italic>E. coli</italic> transcription factor AraC, a canonical genetic switch widely used in microbiology for L-arabinose inducible gene expression via the pBAD promoter. AraC has a well-characterized dual role as a genetic regulator, switching from a repressive to an activating state in response to its native ligand, L-arabinose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig S1A</xref>), and is known for its high evolvability, capable of adapting to novel inducers or acquiring constitutive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Given that previous studies have demonstrated its ability to accommodate light-responsive domain insertions at specific sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), AraC appears as an ideal candidate to explore the POGO-PANCE concept. However, because its activity depends on the presence of arabinose, we first sought to eliminate this dependency in order to reprogram its regulatory logic for non-native input.</p><p id="P11">To this end, we designed a PANCE circuit that separates evolution into distinct mutagenesis and selection phases. For mutagenesis, we adapted the previously published drift plasmid 6 (DP6; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>)) for IPTG-inducible mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) and anhydrotetracycline-dependent gIII expression. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). For positive selection, we constructed an AP encoding gIII under the control of the pBAD promoter and confirmed that it enables propagation of active AraC variant–encoding phages, supporting approximately 20-fold higher propagation in the presence versus absence of arabinose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S1B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Next, to evolve constitutive AraC, we applied two distinct selection regimes (R) across three independent evolution pools each to promote diverse adaptive trajectories. In one condition set, phages were selected entirely in the absence of arabinose (R1-R3), while in the other, arabinose levels were incrementally reduced over five passages (100 μM to 0 μM, R4-R6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>). To maintain selective pressure without population saturation, we imposed sequential bottlenecks between mutagenesis and selection by controlling input phage levels (see Methods).</p><p id="P13">Over five rounds of mutagenesis and selection, phage output titers remained high (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S1C</xref>) throughout the experiment, with progressively increased propagation observed after each round (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S1D</xref>). This suggested the emergence of strong constitutive activity. Phage pool sequencing, i.e. sanger-sequencing of the AraC PCR amplicons derived from the evolved phage pool, indicated diverse evolutionary lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). We selected one representative variant from each of the six pools (R1-R6) for further testing using a plasmid-based reporter assay <italic>in E. coli</italic>, in which AraC activates a pBAD-driven red fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S1E</xref>). To our surprise, overnight cultures not induced with arabinose or IPTG (which controls AraC expression via a LacI-regulated promoter) appeared in dark red for five of the six AraC variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). This striking phenotype indicated high constitutive activity, even at low expression levels driven solely by leaky transcription from the lac promoter.</p><p id="P14">To facilitate quantitative comparisons between evolved variants, we introduced a substantially weaker ribosome binding site (RBS) upstream of AraC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Under these conditions, all six evolved variants induced higher reporter levels than WT AraC in the presence of arabinose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). In line with the observed red culture coloring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>), five of the six variants exhibited constitutive activity in the absence of arabinose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Moreover, both R2 and R5 even surpassed the output of fully induced WT AraC, indicating that accumulated mutations conferred potent ligand-independent function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S2</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To understand the molecular basis of the observed activity gains, we examined mutations in the evolved AraC variants based on its structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Recurrent substitutions at A152 and R251, jointly present in the potent R2 variant (A152T, R251L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>)), have been previously linked to enhanced transcriptional activity, likely by destabilizing inhibitory interdomain contacts and shifting the conformational equilibrium toward the active state. Several mutations also mapped to the N-terminal arm of AraC (e.g., A2E, E3K, A4T, S14I), a region known to enforce repression in the absence of arabinose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Disruption of this arm has similarly been associated with constitutive AraC activity, suggesting that both mutation classes act through complementary mechanisms that weaken repressive intramolecular interactions. In R5, the L156I and R251H combination appeared to form an alternative strong activator; although L156 was not recurrent across variants, it has previously been linked to altered ligand specificity, possibly tuning allosteric responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Together, these mutational patterns highlight diverse, mechanistically convergent routes to constitutive activation and underscore the power of experimental evolution to uncover functionally optimized protein states.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>POGO-PANCE yields potent optogenetic switches and probes allosteric networks</title><p id="P16">Having created particularly strong, constitutive AraC variants as evolutionary stepping stones, we next assembled circuits to implement the full POGO-PANCE pipeline for evolving light-switchable AraC variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C and D</xref>). We constructed an accessory plasmid (AP<sub>Neg</sub>) in which a dominant-negative gIII variant (gIII-neg) is expressed under control of the pBAD promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>), and co-transformed this plasmid with AP<sub>Prop</sub> (Accessory Plasmid for Propagation), a LacI-IPTG controlled circuit for tunable gIII expression, into S2060 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). This configuration enables tunable negative selection against AraC activity, with IPTG induction modulating basal phage propagation rates.</p><p id="P17">To validate the negative selection host cells, we ran experiments in which phages encoding WT AraC or the evolved, hyperactive R2 or R5 variants were propagated under mild IPTG induction (25 μM) and in absence or presence of arabinose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S3B</xref>). As expected, WT AraC phages showed a clear arabinose-mediated propagation deficit, as did the R5 variant. R2-encoding phages showed minimal propagation on negative selection hosts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S3B</xref>), even in the absence of arabinose, consistent with the very strong constitutive activity conferred by this AraC variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Finally, mixing WT AraC encoding phage with R2 or R5 phage in equal quantities resulted in arabinose-dependent propagation again (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S3B</xref>). Importantly, sequencing five single phage plagues from the mixed WT AraC:R5 group without arabinose revealed that all were of WT AraC background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S3C</xref>), indicating strong selection against constitutively active variants. These results confirm that the negative selection regime effectively enriches for phages encoding inactive AraC.</p><p id="P18">To explore whether evolved AraC variants could serve as a foundation for light-switchable gene expression control, we inserted the blue light-responsive LOV2 domain from <italic>Avena sativa</italic> phototropin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) into each of the six variants at a previously established allosteric site immediately following residue S170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), flanked by SG and GS linkers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S4A</xref>). Light-induced unfolding of LOV2 terminal α-helices is a well-established mechanism, commonly harnessed in synthetic allostery for generating local disorder and conveying an allosteric signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). However, existing AraC-LOV hybrids have shown limited dynamic range and compromised activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). We first evaluated the newly generated R2-LOV and R5-LOV constructs by quantifying phage propagation under dark and blue light conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S4B-E</xref>). However, these phages showed minimal or no light-dependent propagation and markedly reduced propagation overall, suggesting that LOV2 insertion disrupted AraC function or failed to confer robust photoswitching under the selection conditions.</p><p id="P19">We therefore returned to assessing all R1-R6 LOV hybrid variants in a plasmid-based mRFP reporter assay using the same expression conditions as the original constructs. Under uninduced conditions (no IPTG), none of the AraC-LOV variants produced measurable reporter output in either light or dark, indicating that LOV2 insertion severely impaired Arabinose-independent transcriptional activation from the pBAD promoter (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S4F</xref>). Heavily overexpressing the constructs with 400 μM IPTG, however, restored detectable reporter activity in the dark for four of the six variants (R1, R2, R4 and R5 LOV hybrids), with a consistent reduction in activity upon blue light exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S4G</xref>). While the switching dynamic range was limited, these results indicated that residual light-dependency could be uncovered at elevated expression levels. Given that the R2-LOV and R5-LOV variants have non-overlapping AraC mutational backgrounds and were, in principle, capable of propagating in the phage context, we selected these variants as starting points for optimization using the POGO-PANCE approach.</p><p id="P20">We next evolved both variants using three distinct selection strategies, each run in duplicate pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S5</xref>). The first POGO-PANCE regime (P1) consisted of three cycles of the following steps: (1) mutagenesis, (2) negative selection under blue light to eliminate leaky or constitutive variants, enriching those with low activity in the presence of the trigger, and (3) positive selection to favor variants that exhibit potent activity in the dark, thus promoting switch-like behavior. The second regime (P2) began with two cycles of (1) mutagenesis and (2) positive selection to maximize activity, followed by two cycles of (1) mutagenesis, (2) negative selection in presence of light and (3) positive selection in absence of light. The third regime (P3) was identical to the first, but reversed the light conditions during selection and served as a control with non-aligned input. Between steps, phages were diluted ~1:100, to preserve gene pool diversity (see Methods). Of note, a recombination event overtook one R2 pool in condition P3 and one R5 pool in conditions P2 and P3, eliminating these three pools from further consideration (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Discussion</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Upon completion of the evolution regimes, we assessed the mutational landscape at the end-point for the nine remaining pools (see Methods for details; note that for LOV2, residue numbers correspond to the full-length phototropin-1). While mutations were rather broadly distributed across the AraC-LOV fusion protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S6</xref>), indicating the LOV2 and AraC domain parts co-evolved, AraC residues E144, R146, V223 and S225 as well as LOV2 residues, D501, E541 and A543 emerged as recurrent mutational hot-spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), with specific combinations favorably co-occurring (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S7</xref>). Importantly, apart from mutations of residue 146 in R5-LOV, which was associated with increased constitutive activity in the constitutive R2 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), none of the observed mutations in AraC-LOV variants had occurred in the prior PANCE evolution in any pool. This mutational divergence implies distinct, context-dependent mechanisms, potentially enhancing domain insertion compatibility or enabling light-dependent allosteric switching.</p><p id="P22">Regarding the newly mutated sites in AraC, E144 and R146 are positioned near the arabinose-binding pocket and are directly involved in ligand recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), making them key nodes in AraC’s allosteric network. V223 and S225 lie in the C-terminal DNA-binding domain, specifically within the second helix-turn-helix motif that recognizes the I1 and I2 half-sites of the pBAD promoter and were previously shown to lie directly adjacent to a highly dynamic AraC region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). In LOV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>),. D501 is located near the FMN chromophore and participates in the hydrogen-bonding network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) that stabilizes the chromophore binding pocket. E541 and A543 are situated in the C-terminal Jα helix, a key structural element that undocks from the LOV2 core upon light activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Also, in conjunction with residue serine in the right linker (SRL2) at the AraC-LOV boundary, E541 and A543 are part of a key junction between the AraC and LOV protein parts.</p><p id="P23">To dissect the evolutionary trajectories underlying switch optimization, we performed long-read sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) across all mutagenesis and selection steps of one evolution pool (P1.2, R2-LOV variant; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Distinct mutational patterns emerged by the second cycle; Across cycles 2 and 3, mutations were differentially enriched or depleted depending on the selection step, underscoring the complementary roles of opposing selection pressures in shaping sequence space. Mapping mutation frequencies after each evolution cycle onto the AraC-LOV structure revealed a variety of mutational hotspots scattered across both domains and affecting all types of secondary structure elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>). Together, these observations suggest a distributed allosteric network, which coordinates signal transmission from the LOV2 photosensor to AraC’s functional domains.</p><p id="P24">Next, we isolated four phages from each pool and cloned the corresponding AraC-LOV fusion variants into expression vectors. Sanger sequencing revealed a total of 28 genetically unique variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), with mutational patterns aligning well with the long-read sequencing data (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Interestingly, several mutations preferentially co-occurred, albeit located far-apart in the AraC structure, e.g. E144K and V223M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Vice versa, several mutations were mutually exclusive, e.g. V223M and S225R, suggesting distinct sequence fitness maxima.</p><p id="P25">Subsequent plate reader assays of RFP plasmid reporter activity showed that the majority of R2-LOV and R5-LOV variants derived from P1 and P2 pools exhibited strong dark-state activity and, in several cases, highly potent response to blue light, far exceeding that of the non-evolved benchmarks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Closer investigation of two particularly promising R2-LOV variants, namely clone 3 from each, the P1.1 and P2.1 pools, by flow cytometry confirmed high dark-state activity and exceptionally strong photoswitching, with median fluorescence shifting by about three orders of magnitude upon illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). This indicated that the mutations that emerged during POGO-PANCE substantially improved allosteric switching.</p><p id="P26">In contrast, the control evolution condition (P3) predominantly yielded either recombination events (cheaters, see above) or variants with abolished or constitutive activity, underscoring that aligning the light input with the appropriate selection step, i.e. negative selection for off-switches, was critical for successful evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A,B</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Collectively, these data indicate that POGO-PANCE is a highly effective approach for evolving optogenetic proteins with exceptional performance. Beyond allosteric switch engineering, POGO-PANCE also provides a powerful lens to observe and interrogate allosteric networks by evolving them in real time, revealing how effective communication and signal relay emerges across protein domains from a network of seemingly unrelated residues.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>RAMPhaGE: A highly effective, targeted gene diversification strategy for PANCE</title><p id="P28">Mutagenesis plasmids such as MP6 and DP6 are widely used to diversify transgenes and generate gene pools for phage-assisted evolution. However, this diversification strategy presents significant limitations that constrain access to broad protein sequence landscapes. First and foremost, mutagenesis plasmids are restricted to point mutations and cannot introduce InDels. However, InDels may be particularly important in the context of allosteric switch engineering, where fine-tuning lengths, relative orientation of, and distances between (communicating) structural elements is likely critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Second, the mutations MPs/DPs generate are highly biased toward specific base changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), thus sampling only a narrow portion of the sequence landscape.</p><p id="P29">To overcome these limitations, we set out to develop a versatile <italic>in vivo</italic> transgene diversification strategy based on retron-mediated recombineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), a genome editing method capable of introducing targeted substitutions, insertions, and deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Retrons encode an RNA template and a reverse transcriptase that together produce intracellular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which serves as a recombination donor during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). In contrast to conventional recombineering, retrons generate these donors autonomously and continuously from a plasmid, eliminating the need for external ssDNA supply. To turn retrons into a targeted <italic>in vivo</italic> diversification strategy of M13 phage carried transgenes, we used a Recombitron: a fully genetically encoded operon combining a retron, single-stranded annealing protein (CspRecT), and <italic>mutL</italic>, a dominant-negative variant of the <italic>E. coli</italic> mismatch repair suppression protein <italic>mutS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p><p id="P30">While Recombitrons have been shown to mediate efficient genome editing in dsDNA phages, their compatibility with ssDNA phages such as M13 has not been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Thus, to validate this concept, we created an IPTG-inducible Recombitron carrying a 90-nt Eco1 retron encoding a silent single-nucleotide substitution in the AraC-LOV transgene. We then expressed the Recombitron in <italic>E. coli</italic> S2060 and propagated AraC-LOV encoding M13 phages on these hosts overnight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Stunningly, pooled sanger sequencing of an AraC-LOV PCR amplicon derived from ~10,000 phages revealed precise, 100% editing of the target site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S8</xref>). In contrast, no editing was observed in controls carrying either (i) a non-targeting retron, (ii) the Recombitron with the reverse transcriptase (RT) disabled by mutation or (iii) a functional Recombitron with a retron encoding the WT variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S8</xref>), indicating that editing was dependent on the presence of all key Recombitron components. Of note, we observed that phage titers in the targeting retron group remained at input levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S8A</xref>). This effect was not seen in non-targeting retrons with active reverse transcriptase, indicating that neither ssDNA production nor metabolic burden alone explained the reduced phage propagation.</p><p id="P31">To assess compatibility of retron editing with library-scale evolution, we repeated the above experiment, this time using 10<sup>10</sup> pfu/mL input phage titer, and found &gt;70% editing efficiency at the targeted site as revealed by long-read sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S8C</xref>). These findings demonstrate that while Recombitron induction can transiently constrain phage amplification, this issue is easily overcome by increasing input phage titers.</p><p id="P32">To realize the potential of retron-based editing for phage assisted evolution workflows, we next adapted the Recombitron system for the generation of complex, targeted mutational libraries. We first engineered a Golden Gate-compatible recombineering plasmid (RP) featuring a ccdB dropout cassette, enabling efficient insertion of retron-encoding DNA libraries. To facilitate library design, we developed a custom software tool that automates the generation of barcoded retron templates, enabling direct oligo pool synthesis with precise control over mutation identity and distribution across M13-encoded transgenes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S9</xref> and Methods). Using this framework (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), we constructed two specialized libraries. The first, a deep mutational scanning (DMS) library, encoded all (2,820) possible single amino acid substitutions across the LOV2 domain in AraC-LOV using <italic>E. coli</italic> preferred codons for uniform representation. This provides a direct comparison to DP6-based “random” point mutagenesis. The second library mediated insertions, deletions and residue alterations at the sensor-effector junctions of AraC-LOV fusions (“linker library”), thus highly diversifying the elements particularly critical for allosteric signal relay.</p><p id="P33">To assess editing efficiency and mutational outcomes, we propagated AraC-LOV-encoding phages overnight on the DMS library hosts followed by short- and long-read deep sequencing. As comparison, we also propagated the same phage on pLlacO1-DP6-transformed cells. Retron-based editing produced high frequency of programmed mutations, with &gt;40% of reads containing programmed DMS library mutations overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Further analysis revealed that the average mutation rate per retron-targeted position was ~0.4% - more than triple of that achieved with pLlacO1-DP6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S10A</xref>).</p><p id="P34">In stark contrast to the highly biased mutational profile generated by pLlacO1-DP6, the DMS library yielded broad and relatively uniform coverage across the full spectrum of encoded amino acid and codon substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S10B and C</xref>). Variant frequencies in the DMS phage library closely matched those in the retron-encoding plasmid library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S10D</xref>; Spearman r = 0.77; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>, top). Because codon substitutions require between one and three mutations, we expected a dependence of editing efficiency on substitution size. As expected, single-base codon edits occurred at approximately twice the rate of double or triple substitutions, consistent with known recombination biases favoring smaller InDels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S10E</xref>). Off-target mutation rates outside the retron-targeted LOV2 region were minimal, as confirmed by short-read sequencing at the AraC-LOV2 junction and long-read analysis of the full transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S11</xref>).</p><p id="P35">Excitingly, the linker library introduced not only a diverse spectrum of amino acid substitutions but also a broad range of insertions and deletions that span up to five amino acids - demonstrating that even &gt;15 bp changes within the 90 nt retron payload could be efficiently installed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S12A</xref>). Variant frequencies in plasmid input and phage output libraries were again correlated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S12B</xref>; Spearman r of 0.79 and 0.41 for the left and right AraC-LOV junction), and editing rates depended on the encoded InDel size as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S12A</xref>). Interestingly, after a single round of overnight propagation on Recombitron-expressing hosts, mutations were typically confined to one junction (either left or right), while double-mutants were rare (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S12C</xref>). This is consistent with the biology of M13 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>); at the chosen input levels, host cells are likely infected immediately, rendering them immune to subsequent infection by newly edited phage.</p><p id="P36">That said, retron libraries enable sequential, layered mutagenesis on demand. To demonstrate this, we first introduced DMS edits within the LOV2 coding region by overnight phage propagation on host cells expressing the DMS retron library. The resulting phage progeny were then transferred to hosts carrying the InDel library to diversify the AraC-LOV junctions. This two-step protocol yielded cumulative editing, with widespread point mutations across LOV2 and substantial linker diversification at the insertion boundaries after propagation on both host libraries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S12D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p><p id="P37">We refer to this strategy as RAMPhaGE (Recombitron-Assisted Multiplexed Phage Gene Evolution), an M13-based transgene diversification platform that merges the precision of retron-guided editing with the scalability of <italic>in vivo</italic> phage-assisted evolution.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Integrating RAMPhaGE and POGO-PANCE to evolve sensor-effector junctions for enhanced allosteric coupling</title><p id="P38">Sensor-effector junctions are key determinants of allosteric communication and switch fidelity in chimeric proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). It is thus no surprise that these regions were also prime targets for evolution in POGO-PANCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Building on this observation, we integrated RAMPhaGE into the POGO-PANCE framework for targeted evolution of linker regions flanking the LOV2 insertion in AraC. As a starting point, we therefore returned to the unevolved R2-LOV variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S4F,G</xref>), providing a suitable effector background for probing how junction composition influences allosteric coupling. Using the retron linker library, we generated a diverse phage population encoding systematic modifications to the LOV2-flanking linkers, including flexible glycine-serine motifs, rigid proline-rich sequences, and all possible single-residue substitutions. Deep sequencing of the gene pool after RAMPhaGE mutagenesis confirmed broad coverage of the linker library, with all designed variants represented, albeit at variable frequencies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S12A,B</xref>).</p><p id="P39">Next, the resulting phage library was split into two replicate pools and subjected to one round of negative selection under blue light to remove leaky variants, followed by two rounds of positive selection in the dark to enrich for constructs with high activity in absence of the trigger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S14A-B</xref>). Following POGO-PANCE selection, a distinct enrichment pattern emerged, indicating strong selective pressure favoring specific linker compositions - consistently observed across both replicate pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S13C-D</xref>). Over 90% of enriched variants carried mutations in at least one linker, with pronounced asymmetry between the two junctions. The N-terminal (left) linker exhibited a strong bias toward single-residue deletions, particularly replacement of the original GS motif with a single lysine, which accounted for over 40% of the selected variants. In contrast, C-terminal (right) linker mutations were less common, appearing in only ~17% of sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">fig. 5G,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S13C-E</xref>).</p><p id="P40">Sequencing of individual plaques confirmed the enrichment trends observed by deep sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S13C</xref>), revealing a striking convergence on specific amino acid substitutions within the left linker. Arginine (R), lysine (K), glutamine (Q), and asparagine (N) consistently replaced the original serine-glycine motif, suggesting selective pressure for side chains with hydrogen-bonding or helix-stabilizing potential. Structural predictions using AlphaFold3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) suggested that the lysine substitution extends the left linker into a continuous α-helix that seamlessly connects LOV2 to the AraC effector domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5I</xref>). The observed helix extension likely enhances allosteric transmission in a particularly dynamic protein region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) by minimizing structural discontinuities at the sensor-effector interface. Thus, the accompanying single-residue deletion is plausibly required to align helical registers, providing a mechanistic rationale for the strong enrichment of these left linker variants during selection. Finally, to directly assess the impact of linker optimization on allosteric coupling, we cloned five highly enriched variants into an IPTG-inducible plasmid with a weak ribosome binding site as done before. All variants showed very strong activity in the dark and practically digital switching upon illumination, consistent with improved transmission of conformational signals from the LOV2 domain to AraC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5J</xref>).</p><p id="P41">In summary, by combining RAMPhaGE with POGO-PANCE, we establish a powerful evolutionary strategy to selectively optimize switchable proteins and uncover latent design principles that illuminate and advance the engineering of synthetic allostery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P42">Allosteric regulation enables proteins to dynamically couple spatially distant sites, including functionally distinct domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). However, the diffuse, epistatic nature of the underlying residue networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) makes rational engineering of allosteric behavior extremely challenging. Here, we introduced POGO-PANCE, a phage-assisted evolution platform that builds upon principles of natural protein switch evolution by applying alternating selection regimes aligned to a defined stimulus. By iteratively selecting for both high activity and tight regulation across two environmental contexts, POGO-PANCE effectively navigates dual fitness landscapes, a critical requirement for evolving switchable protein function. We demonstrate this by converting a poorly active, modestly photoswitchable AraC-LOV hybrid into a potent optogenetic transcription factor exhibiting light-regulated control over gene expression spanning more than three orders of magnitude. The success of this transformation underscores the necessity of aligning selection regimes with functional goals, which previously was observed to be highly challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Indeed, pools evolved under mismatched regimes failed to yield useful switches and were taken over by “cheater” phages, while those exposed to appropriately toggled selection pressures converged on high-performance variants.</p><p id="P43">By integrating deep sequencing into POGO-PANCE, as previously shown for evolution of static protein features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), we gained insight into how adaptive trajectories unfold under opposing selection pressures, offering a unique, empirical access to how allosteric communication networks are built and/or refined. Traditional approaches, including rational design and structure prediction tools, remain limited by static models and typically fail to capture the conformational ensembles or context-specific dependencies that underlie allosteric regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). By contrast, POGO-PANCE evolves and observes allosteric systems as they adapt over time, under defined environmental constraints. The resulting observations highlight the role of epistasis and environmental context in shaping the allosteric landscape. For example, mutations at E144K and V223M emerged in POGO-PANCE performed on AraC-LOV fusions and not the prior conventional PANCE of AraC alone, suggesting context-dependent adaptation and underscoring that combinations of mutations that may not be immediately obvious are often required for optimal function.</p><p id="P44">Crucially, traditional mutagenesis approaches fall short in exploring the structural plasticity required for tuning allosteric coupling, particularly at sensor-effector junctions. To address this, we developed RAMPhaGE, a retron-based diversification platform that enables precise, programmable introduction of substitutions, insertions, and deletions. This capability is particularly important for engineering allosteric proteins, where signal transmission often hinges on subtle geometric features, such as precise length of structural elements, helix phasing, or domain orientation, that lie beyond the reach of simple point mutagenesis. In our evolved AraC-LOV constructs, for example, a consistently enriched single-residue deletion at the sensor-effector junction was predicted to extend a continuous α-helix across the interface, likely enhancing allosteric signal relay. These findings illustrate the utility of InDel mutagenesis in modulating geometric parameters that are otherwise inaccessible via point mutations alone. More broadly, RAMPhaGE opens access to regions of sequence space previously obscured in phage-assisted evolution.</p><p id="P45">Conceptually, POGO-PANCE and RAMPhaGE should be compatible for studying and evolving allostery for a broad range of effector domains as well as inputs, including chemicals, pH or redox state. This opens a path to wide future exploration: Evolving various effectors for trigger-responsive behavior could not only feed various applications in biotechnology and biomedicine, but eventually reveal fundamental principles of allostery as such. Finally, our platform may open a path toward the <italic>de novo</italic> evolution of switchable proteins. While this remains a formidable challenge, analogous to how nature repeatedly evolved photosensitive proteins from unrelated scaffolds, POGO-PANCE provides the evolutionary infrastructure for similar efforts in the lab.</p><p id="P46">In summary, the combined POGO-PANCE and RAMPhaGE framework enables not only the directed evolution of powerful protein switches, but allows us to spy into the evolutionary trajectories that yield well-orchestrated allosteric networks. Together, they provide a powerful foundation for both practical applications of and fundamental insights into allostery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Data S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS206476-supplement-Data_S1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d56aAcDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Data S2</label><media xlink:href="EMS206476-supplement-Data_S2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d56aAcDcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS206476-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d56aAcDdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S9"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the Niopek and Mathony labs, as well as the thesis advisory committee to N.S., Seth Shipman, UCSF and Kerstin Göpfrich, Heidelberg University for helpful discussions.
