Immune responses against dengue viruses have been studied in blood samples of dengue patients. However, dengue virus infection first occurs in the skin following the bite of an infected <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito, and immune responses are initiated within this site. In this study, we investigated the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional profiles of skin and blood T-cell responses and their role in immunity in 73 dengue patients and 10 healthy volunteers. We show that the skin T-cell compartment undergoes dramatic reshaping compared to the blood of dengue patients. CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses were highly enriched in the skin compared to the blood of the same patients, and skin-based T-cells expressed markers associated with tissue-resident T (T<sub>RM</sub>) cells. While the magnitude of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response in the skin was independent to that in the blood, CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses in skin and blood were positively correlated. Activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in the skin expressed a core transcriptional signature of T<sub>RM</sub> cells, further supporting their differentiation to the T<sub>RM</sub> lineage during infection. The magnitude of both skin and blood CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses was associated with protection from hospitalization in this cohort. These data collectively support a protective role of skin-resident and circulating CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in dengue and provide insights into the biology of T<sub>RM</sub> cells in human infection. Our findings warrant evaluation of vaccination strategies that induce T<sub>RM</sub> cells in the skin to enhance protection against dengue.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Dengue is caused by dengue virus (DENV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus estimated to infect 390 million people, causing 300,000 severe dengue cases and 20,000 deaths per year(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Urbanization and human mobility, both of which are now further complicated by climate change, have driven a rapid, approximately 10-fold increase in dengue cases in the last 20 years(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). DENV co-circulates as four genetically distinct infectious serotypes (DENV 1-4); infection with any DENV serotype may be asymptomatic or cause a range of clinical manifestations from a self-limiting febrile illness to severe dengue characterised by hypovolemic shock from uncontrolled plasma leakage, internal haemorrhage, and organ dysfunction(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The pathogenesis of dengue is multifactorial and poorly understood, although altered host immune responses are believed to play key roles(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). No licensed therapy exists for dengue. There are two licensed dengue vaccines which show unbalanced protection towards DENV1-4 despite their ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies against all four DENV serotypes, thus highlighting our incomplete understanding of the immune correlates of protection for dengue(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). In particular, the contribution of T-cells for protective immunity to DENV remains unclear. Studies to date have focused on analyses of T-cells in the blood of dengue patients which may not be representative of T-cell responses occurring within tissues where the majority of T-cell responses occur during infection.</p><p id="P3">T-cell responses initiate in the skin following the bite of a DENV-infected <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito. We and others have shown that T-cell priming in dengue occurs in the skin/skin-draining lymph-nodes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), where DENV-specific T-cells acquire expression of the skin-homing receptor cutaneous leukocyte-associated antigen (CLA)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). CLA binds to E-selectin (CD62E) expressed on dermal endothelial cells and facilitates T-cell homing to the skin(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). It remains unknown whether DENV-specific T-cells in the skin differentiate into tissue-resident T-cells (T<sub>RM</sub>) and whether these play a role in protective immunity to dengue.</p><p id="P4">T<sub>RM</sub> cells were identified a decade ago as specialised T-cell subsets located within tissues, which display superior protective efficacy towards pathogens compared to their circulating counterparts(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). T<sub>RM</sub> cells clear virus-infected cells through release of cytotoxic granules and cytokines/chemokines, the latter also acting as signals to recruit other leukocytes to the tissue(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In mice, T<sub>RM</sub> cells were shown to have a key protective role against herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the skin, and influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) in the lungs, with dispensable roles of circulating T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The role of T<sub>RM</sub> cells in human infection remains less clear due to the difficulties in accessing the human tissues where these cells reside. T<sub>RM</sub> cells were detected in human acute and chronic viral infections (Influenza, RSV, Hepatitis B and Human Immunodeficiency viruses)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), with some studies reporting an association of T<sub>RM</sub> cell frequencies with enhanced viral control(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Understanding the contribution of T<sub>RM</sub> cells to protective immunity is critical for evaluation of vaccine delivery routes that could improve vaccine efficacy by boosting generation of protective T-cell subsets.</p><p id="P5">In this study, using a skin-blister induction model we established for dengue(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), we investigated the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional signatures of T-cells in matched skin and blood samples from 73 adult dengue patients and 10 healthy volunteers. We found that CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses to DENV infection were highly enriched in the skin compared to the matched blood compartment. Activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in the skin displayed phenotypic and transcriptional features of T<sub>RM</sub> cells including expression of the core gene signature of human T<sub>RM</sub> cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), supporting their differentiation into T<sub>RM</sub> cells. The magnitude of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response in the skin positively correlated with that present in the blood of the same patients, and both responses associated with protection from hospitalization in this cohort. These data provide novel insights into the biology and differentiation kinetics of T<sub>RM</sub> cells in a human virus infection, and support a protective role of skin-resident and circulating CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in dengue, with implications for vaccine design.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Activated and proliferating T-cells are enriched in the skin in dengue</title><p id="P6">To investigate T-cell responses in matched skin and blood compartments during DENV infection we recruited 83 adult study participants, including 73 patients with confirmed dengue (40 ± 13 years; mean age ± SD) and 10 healthy volunteers with no serological evidence of prior DENV infection (42 ± 17 years; mean age ± SD; participant details in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table I</xref>). Study participants donated blood and skin samples for research purposes at two timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>): Visit 1 timepoint (days 3-5 from fever onset), was chosen to differentiate primary from secondary DENV infection based on DENV IgG titres, as described previously(27) and for identification of the DENV serotype of infection; visit 2 timepoint (days 7-10 from fever onset), which captured the peak of the T-cell response in dengue(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), was chosen for blood and skin T-cell analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Skin T-cells were obtained from skin suction blisters induced using a clinical grade pump as described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). On the following day, the fluid accumulated in the skin blister was collected and centrifuged to separate cell pellet from supernatant, both used for downstream analyses. The immune cells accumulating in the skin blister are derived from the underlying skin tissue as confirmed by their high expression of the skin-homing marker CLA compared to matched blood T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). These data confirmed that the utilised skin suction blister method allows isolation of T-cells from the skin with minimal contamination of blood T-cells.</p><p id="P7">We first investigated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell activation and proliferation within the skin and blood compartments of 49 participants (39 dengue patients and 10 healthy volunteers) and asked whether skin T-cells possessed distinct phenotypic and functional features compared to their circulating counterparts. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cells from the skin blister aspirates, defined hereinafter as “blood” and “skin” cells, were analysed by flow cytometry for expression of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell markers of activation and proliferation (HLA-DR, CD38, CD69, PD-1, Ki-67), tissue residence (CD69, CD103, CLA), differentiation (CCR7, CD45RA) and cytotoxicity (granzyme B, GPR56). In contrast to the healthy volunteers, dengue patients displayed higher CD4<sup>+</sup>:CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell ratios in blood compared to skin, consistent with an expansion or influx of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells into the skin compartment during DENV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Furthermore, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in the skin of dengue patients displayed increased activation and proliferation compared to their blood counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-E; 2G-I</xref>). Low levels of activated and proliferating T-cells could be detected in the skin but not in the blood of healthy volunteers, suggesting that T-cells in the skin may undergo turnover in steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G-I</xref>). The frequencies of PD-1<sup>+</sup> T-cells were also significantly higher in the skin compared to the blood of healthy volunteers, in line with previous reports(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>). In dengue patients but not in healthy volunteers, skin CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells contained higher frequencies of granzyme B<sup>+</sup> cells compared to their blood counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J</xref>). GPR56, a G protein-coupled receptor described to mark blood cytotoxic T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) was expressed at higher levels in blood compared to skin CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells of dengue patients, while expression was similar across these two compartments in T-cells from healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K</xref>). Skin CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells from both dengue patients and healthy volunteers expressed significantly higher levels of CD69 compared to their blood counterparts, with a proportion of skin CD69<sup>+</sup> cells co-expressing CD103 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2L-M</xref>). CD69<sup>+</sup> and CD69<sup>+</sup> CD103<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells were increased in the blood of dengue patients compared to that of healthy volunteers, although their levels were lower compared to those of their skin counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2L-M</xref>). In dengue patients, skin CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells were mainly CCR7<sup>-</sup>CD45RA<sup>-</sup> (T effector memory; T<sub>EM</sub>) followed by CCR7<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>-</sup> (T central memory cells; T<sub>CM</sub>). In contrast, blood contained CCR7<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>+</sup> (naïve; T<sub>N</sub>), T<sub>CM</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and CD45RA<sup>+</sup> (T effector memory RA re-expressing; T<sub>EMRA</sub>) CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2N, O</xref>). Similarly, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in the skin of healthy volunteers comprised respectively of T<sub>EM</sub> and T<sub>CM</sub> cells, as well as T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells for CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A-B</xref>). In summary, our data demonstrate that activated and proliferating T-cells expressing high levels of granzyme B were highly enriched in the skin compared to the blood of dengue patients, suggesting that the skin is a key site for T-cell immunosurveillance of DENV during acute infection.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Dramatic reshaping of the skin T-cell compartment in dengue</title><p id="P8">To investigate the phenotypic and functional features of skin and blood T-cells, we performed unsupervised analyses using dimensionality reduction algorithms. To this end, we selected flow cytometry standard (FCS) files from 54 matched skin and blood samples derived from 17 dengue patients and 10 healthy volunteers, which had been analysed using identical flow cytometer settings. These files were downsampled to the same number of cells, concatenated and analysed using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and Phenograph cluster analysis to identify T-cell populations enriched within blood or skin compartments. Our findings show that blood and skin CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells mapped to distinct areas of the UMAP plots in both dengue patients and healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). A partial overlap of skin and blood CLA<sup>+</sup> Ki-67<sup>+</sup> T-cells was observed in dengue patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, B</xref>), suggesting that these cells recirculate between the two compartments during infection. Phenograph analyses identified 14 different CD3<sup>+</sup> T-cell clusters, which included 5 CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell and 7 of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell clusters (respectively clusters 1, 3, 4, 7, 9 and 2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) as well as 2 clusters with low CD4 and CD8 expression (clusters 12 and 13; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). The frequencies of T-cells within these clusters and the relative mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) expression of the markers analysed are summarized in a heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). These 14 clusters largely distinguished blood T-cells from their skin counterparts, albeit with some clusters being shared between the two compartments. Skin T-cells from healthy volunteers mapped predominantly within clusters 1 and 5, followed by cluster 10 and were largely non-overlapping with their blood counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). In contrast, skin T-cells from dengue patients largely localized within clusters 2 and 9, which comprise respectively of CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells that are highly activated and proliferating, display cytotoxic capacity (granzyme B<sup>high</sup>), and high expression of CLA and CD69, but low expression of CD103 and CCR7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). These cells were enriched in the skin of dengue patients, were present albeit at lower frequencies in their blood counterparts and were largely absent in healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). The phenotypic/functional features of these cells (CLA<sup>+</sup>, PD-1<sup>+</sup>, Ki-67<sup>high</sup>, CD69<sup>+</sup>, granzyme B<sup>high</sup>) strongly resembled those of DENV-specific T-cells detected in the blood of dengue patients using DENV peptide-HLA class-I tetramers at day 7-10 of illness(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), which were shown to be distinct to that of “bystander activated” T-cells in dengue that lack expression of CLA and are specific for antigens unrelated to DENV(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Based on these considerations, these cells may represent <italic>bona fide</italic> DENV-specific T-cells and are herein named “responding T-cells”.</p><p id="P9">Dengue patients’ blood T-cells mapped predominately within clusters 3, 4, 6 and 8 followed by cluster 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D, F</xref>). The two most abundant clusters of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells (clusters 3 and 4) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells (clusters 6 and 8) in the blood of dengue patients displayed lower expression of HLA-DR, CD38, granzyme B, Ki-67 and CLA compared to T-cells enriched in the skin. Cluster 11 containing PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> CD45RA<sup>+</sup> CCR7<sup>-</sup> (T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells) with high cytotoxic potential (granzyme B<sup>+</sup> GPR56<sup>+</sup>) was present in the blood and skin of dengue patients but largely absent in both compartments of healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). In contrast, clusters 1 and 10 containing respectively CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells expressing CLA, PD-1 and CD69 but lacking expression of activation and proliferating markers were present in the skin of both healthy volunteers and dengue patients, although frequencies were higher in the former (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D, E</xref>). These cells may be resting skin resident T-cells. Overall, skin T-cells in dengue patients differed substantially from those in healthy volunteers, while blood T-cells looked more similar between dengue patients and healthy volunteers.</p><p id="P10">In summary, unsupervised analyses show that blood and skin T-cells were largely phenotypically distinct in steady state and during DENV infection. In dengue patients, skin T-cells were dramatically distinct from both their blood counterparts and skin T-cells of healthy volunteers, suggesting that the skin compartment undergoes extensive reshaping during DENV infection.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Skin and blood DENV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells display similar features</title><p id="P11">As blood and skin T-cells appeared to be largely distinct populations of cells, we next asked whether the features of DENV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells are distinct in these two compartments. DENV-specific T-cells were analysed using peptide-HLA class I pentamers directly <italic>ex vivo</italic>. We previously showed that DENV NS3 and NS5 are the major targets of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), with NS3<sub>1608-1617</sub> and NS5<sub>2610-2618</sub> epitopes being the most frequently recognised epitopes restricted to HLA-A*11:01, a commonly expressed HLA-type in the Singapore population(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Here, we identified 8 HLA-A*1101<sup>+</sup> dengue patients within our cohort whose CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells responded with detectable frequencies to at least one of these epitopes, and analysed their blood and skin cells by flow cytometry using HLA-A*11:01-NS3<sub>1608-1617</sub> and NS5<sub>2610-2618</sub> pentamers matched to the DENV serotype of infection for each patient. To evaluate the features of the DENV-specific T-cells, cells were co-stained with HLA-A*11:01 pentamers and antibodies targeting phenotypic and functional T-cell markers. The frequencies of CD8<sup>+</sup> HLA-A*11:01-NS3<sub>1608-1617</sub>/NS5<sub>2610-2618</sub> pentamer<sup>+</sup> cells varied between patients but were consistently higher in the skin compared to the blood in 6 out of 8 patients, supporting our above findings of a more robust T-cell response in the skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 A, B</xref>). For 2 of these patients, we obtained a sufficient number of events to allow a more in-depth UMAP and Phenograph cluster analyses of pentamer<sup>+</sup> skin versus blood CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Interestingly, in both patients, the manually gated pentamer<sup>+</sup> cells mapped to a single overlapping cluster of the UMAP and Phenograph plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, D</xref>: cluster in green/cluster 2 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). The proportions of pentamer<sup>+</sup> skin CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells were on average approximately 10-fold higher compared to those in the blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>: cluster 2, 25.1% versus 2.24%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Cells in cluster 2 displayed a phenotype which is characteristic of DENV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, namely CD45RA<sup>+</sup> CCR7<sup>low</sup> and with high expression of Ki-67, CLA, CD69, CD38, HLA-DR, PD-1 and granzyme B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Our previous work using DENV peptide-HLA class-I tetramers showed that CLA and Ki-67 can be used to identify <italic>bona fide</italic> DENV-specific T-cells that are responding to DENV(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). To analyse the broader pool of responding T-cells, we therefore analysed the features of Ki-67<sup>+</sup> CLA<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and Ki-67<sup>+</sup> CLA<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Ki-67<sup>+</sup> CLA<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells mapped to 3 distinct clusters, cluster 2 which contained the pentamer<sup>+</sup> cells and clusters 1 and 8 which were adjacently located and contained CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells expressing similar phenotypic and functional markers, except for HLA-DR which showed decreased expression in cluster 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D, E</xref>).

Skin CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells expressed transcriptional signatures of human T<sub>RM</sub> cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), supporting their differentiation into T<sub>RM</sub> cells during acute infection. The magnitude of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses in the skin mirrored that of their blood counterparts, while skin CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell frequencies were independent from those of matched blood CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, suggesting a differential regulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses between these compartments. Outpatients, who did not require hospitalization, displayed a higher magnitude of skin and blood CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses and increased expression of skin T-cell related cytokines compared to inpatients. This study provides novel insights into the biology and dynamics of T<sub>RM</sub> cells in a human acute viral infection and suggests a protective role of both skin and blood CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in dengue.</p><p id="P22">We previously showed in dengue patients that circulating DENV-specific T-cells express high levels of CLA while human cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T-cells that are “bystander activated” during DENV infection lack expression of CLA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). These studies showed that co-expression of Ki-67 and CLA distinguishes circulating DENV-specific T-cells from bystander activated T-cells. From these studies it remained unclear whether Ki-67<sup>+</sup> CLA<sup>+</sup> DENV-specific T-cells differentiate into T<sub>RM</sub> cells in the skin and whether T-cells responding in the skin and blood are phenotypically and functionally distinct.</p><p id="P23">Here we show that CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> Ki-67<sup>+</sup> CLA<sup>+</sup> T-cells are highly enriched in the skin compared to the blood compartment, suggesting their preferential localization within this site. At days 7-10 from illness onset (corresponding approximately to days 11-14 from infection), responding CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in the skin displayed transcriptional and phenotypic features of T<sub>RM</sub> cells. These cells expressed a core T<sub>RM</sub> gene signature which includes: upregulation of CD69 and downregulation of S1PR1 and KLF2 which collectively lead to T-cell retention within tissues; upregulation of adhesion molecules (CD103, CD49a) and PD-1; modulation of chemokine receptor expression (CXCR6, CX3CR1) and downregulation of transcriptional factors Eomes and T-bet(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Skin CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells displayed increased expression of genes encoding for granzyme B, perforin and granulysin. Consistently, flow cytometry analyses showed strikingly higher frequencies of granzyme B<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in the skin compared to those in the blood of the same patients, supporting a strong cytotoxic capacity of skin T-cells in DENV infection. These data are consistent with previous studies in healthy individuals showing that despite the low expression of perforin and granzymes by skin CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> cells in steady state, these cells can efficiently induce expression of these molecules upon cytokine or TCR stimulation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Previous studies in mice showed that virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells are highly polyclonal with &gt;1000 different clonotypes responding to a single immunodominant virus epitope(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). This polyclonal response, which comprises of T-cells with differing levels of TCR avidity, ensures protection towards potential pathogen escape mutants(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).

Here we show that the clonotype diversity of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in DENV infection was low/moderate and similar in skin and blood compartments, with approximately 150-350 unique clonotypes identified per patient sample. Patient 2 displayed the lowest clonotype diversity and was experiencing a secondary DENV infection, while patients 1 and 3 were primary dengue cases. While a lower clonotype diversity in secondary DENV infection is consistent with a preferential reactivation of memory T-cells generated in the primary infection, further studies on a higher number of patients are needed to study clonotypic diversity in primary and secondary DENV infection and address potential links with disease outcomes. In patients 2 and 3 we detected some clonotype sharing between skin and blood (approximately 7%), suggesting recirculation of responding CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells between these two compartments. However, the limited proportion of clonotype sharing between skin and blood suggests some degree of compartmentalization of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response and independent priming of these cells at different sites.

The 45 unique DNA barcode sequences were then amplified by PCR before being quantified using the Olink Signature Q100.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing</title><p id="P38">CD8<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>+</sup> HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells from matched PBMCs and skin blister cells of dengue patients were sorted into AIM-V + 2% Human Serum on the BD FACSAria™ III Sorter following staining with antibodies targeting surface markers. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the sorted cells was carried out according to the 10X Genomics’ Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5' Reagent Kits v2 protocol. Briefly, sorted cells were mixed with 10x barcoded gel beads and loaded onto Chromium Next GEM Chip K, after which the assembled chip was run on the Chromium Controller X to generate GEMs (1000263 Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ Kit v2, 1000286 Chromium Next GEM Chip K Single Cell Kit &amp; 1000190 Library Construction Kit, 10X Genomics). Post GEM-RT cleanup was then carried out, followed by cDNA amplification according to manufacturer’s protocol. Subsequently, V(D)J amplification from cDNA, V(D)J library construction as well as 5’ gene expression library construction were carried out according to manufacturer’s protocol (1000252 Chromium Single Cell Human TCR Amplification Kit, 10X Genomics). Quality control was performed on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer G2938C. Libraries were sequenced paired-end 150 base pairs on the Illumina HiSeq X System (20,000 read pairs per cell).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Single cell RNA-seq data processing and analysis</title><p id="P39">Raw sequencing data were processed using the Cell Ranger multi pipeline (v7.1.0, 10x Genomics). The filtered gene-barcode matrix of unique molecular identifiers (UMI) counts was then analyzed with Seurat V3(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) for quality control, normalization, dimensional reduction, integration, clustering, and visualization. Quality control criteria were: (1) total UMI count between 3,000 and 30,000, (2) minimal number of detected genes &gt; 1000, (3) mitochondrial gene percentage &lt;15% and (4) number of cells expressing a gene &gt; 8. The count matrix was log-normalized, and the top 2,000 most variable genes were identified for dimensional reduction.</p><p id="P40">The count matrix was scaled and the top 20 dimensions from the principal component analysis (PCA) were used for the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). The top PCs were chosen using the Elbow plot method. Cell clusters were identified by the shared nearest neighbor (SNN) method using the Louvain algorithm with the resolution of 1.2 and the top 20 PCA dimensions. Cell clusters of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells were annotated using known markers of T-cells as well as referencing cell clustered annotated using SingleR, which compared the transcriptome of each cell cluster to various reference datasets (Human primary cell atlas, Database Immune Cell Expression Data and Monaco immune data). For the final analysis, cell clusters were merged into six groups (Naïve, Cell cycle, Blood, Skin, Mait-like and Memory-like).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>scTCR-seq data processing and analysis</title><p id="P41">Sequencing data were processed using the Cell Ranger VDJ pipeline (v7.1.0, 10x Genomics) with default settings.
