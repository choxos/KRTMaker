An array of parasites with similar genomes produces varied disease outcomes in different hosts. Here, we isolate and characterize <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> strains that show marked differences in virulence and persistence in mice. Taking advantage of the sexual lifecycle of this eukaryotic pathogen, we use genetic crosses to discover the underlying chromosomal loci. Whole-genome sequencing and bulk segregant analysis of infection selected progeny mapped three loci on chromosomes 2, 6, and 7 associated with the ability to colonize and persist in mice and the positions of drug resistance genes. The chromosome 6 locus encodes the hyper-polymorphic surface glycoprotein GP60. Reverse genetic studies in both parental strains demonstrate that GP60 controls parasite burden and virulence, but not persistence, and reveal the dominance of the less virulent allele, suggesting it restricts virulence.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The individual outcomes of infectious diseases are highly variable and can range from fatal illness to the absence of notable signs and symptoms. While the basis of this variability is not always understood, multiple and at times interacting contributions of host, pathogen, and environment have been reported. This is also the case for infection with the single celled eukaryotic parasite <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>. <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> is a leading cause of diarrheal disease and early childhood morbidity and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Infection occurs around the world and under a variety of epidemiological scenarios. Transmission can be linked to drinking or recreational water contact, direct human to human spread, or zoonotic spillover from a variety of domesticated animals. Environmental factors control the endurance and transmissive capacity of the infectious oocyst stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, and abundance or lack of nutrition dramatically impacts the course of infection in children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Host genetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, immune status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and co-infection and microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> status are similarly important. Individuals who lack T cell function, either from birth or due HIV-AIDS or immunosuppressive treatment are highly susceptible to severe cryptosporidiosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, while humans and animals exposed to repeated infection develop non-sterile immunity that protects them from disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Many species and strains of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> have been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and numerous recent reports highlight strain specific (and thus likely pathogen-mediated) differences in host range, transmissibility and virulence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>; however, the underlying molecules and mechanisms remain largely unknown.</p><p id="P3">As typical for apicomplexan parasites, the <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> lifecycle features phases of asexual and sexual replication, however, in this parasite both phases occur in the same single host. Recent studies have demonstrated that progression from the initial asexual phase to sexual reproduction is obligate, occurs roughly every 48 hours, and that this progression and the resulting sex is essential to continuous infection of the host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Remarkably, <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> will thus experience significant genome recombination and meiotic segregation numerous times over the course of a single infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. We take advantage of this unique sexual lifecycle to associate specific parasite genes with the traits of virulence and persistence through genetic crosses and linkage analysis. Genetic crosses have been transformational to the understanding of drug resistance and virulence in the apicomplexan parasites <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. We recently developed a crossing model for <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> in mice, where selection for dual drug resistance is used to isolate recombinant progeny to the exclusion of selfing parental types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Crosses were feasible within and between species of diverging host speficity. However, while pairing <italic>C. parvum</italic> and <italic>C. tyzzeri</italic> offered significant phenotypic differences and numerous SNPs for mapping, the overall efficiency of mating was low, resulting in modest genomic recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Here we establish a system within the species of <italic>C. parvum</italic> that balances significant genomic and phenotypic diversity with high mating efficiency to build a powerful forward genetic model to disect host parasite interaction.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Collection and genome sequencing of <italic>C. parvum</italic> strains</title><p id="P4">To enable efficient genetic mapping of virulence within the species of <italic>C. parvum,</italic> we collected <italic>C. parvum</italic> strains previously isolated from cattle in the United States and Europe (generously shared with us by Drs.

Feces from lambs in Israel were collected and tested for the presence of parasites by PCR. Ocysts were isolated from positive samples, and parasites were amplified in <italic>Ifnγ</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (see Methods section for further detail, all mice used in this study were of C57BL/6 background). All parasite strains were subjected to whole genome sequencing, followed by allignment to the most recent telomere to telomere assembly of the <italic>C. parvum</italic> Iowa II reference genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, and SNP calling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Analysis of the diagnositic GP60 locus showed strain KVI to be a IId genotype and all others to be IIa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). The KVI genome showed the largest number of SNPs (5166) when compared to the <italic>C. parvum</italic> Iowa II reference genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, and 1C</xref> show the SNP distribution highlighting areas of high (pink) and low (blue) density). We generated both Illumina short reads and Nanopore long reads, which was then used for <italic>de novo</italic> genome assembly.

Based on the number of distinguishing SNPs and previous reports of phenotypic difference between parasites of IIa and IId background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> <italic>we</italic> chose to pursue Iowa II (Bunchgrass Farms) and KVI as a mating pair to map loci underlying host pathogen interaction.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Iowa II and KVI show marked differences in virulence and persistence during mouse infection</title><p id="P5">To facilitate rigorous side-by-side comparison, we engineered the KVI strain to express nanoluciferase (Nluc, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>) to match Iowa II reporter parasites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> already in hand. We integrated a cassette encoding Nluc as well the tdNeonGreen fluorescent protein into the phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase locus selecting for resistance to BRD7929<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Age and sex matched C57BL/6 wildtype mice were infected with 20,000 oocysts per mouse of either transgenic Iowa II or KVI, and parasite shedding was measured following luciferase activity in the feces. Both parasite strains produced brief infection of modest burden as typical for <italic>C. parvum</italic> in immunocompetent adult mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, with KVI exceeding the burden of Iowa II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Next we infected <italic>Infγ</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with 10,000 oocysts per mouse, which revealed pronounced strain differences. Iowa II resulted in a self-limiting two week course of infection peaking at the level previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. By contrast, KVI infection peaked 100-fold higher and remained continuously and robustly patent to the latest time point we measured, day 112 of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). 25-50% of <italic>Infγ</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice infected with KVI died by day 14, the peak of parasite burden, while all Iowa II infected mice survived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). This difference in severity was also apparent when following the weight of infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). While Iowa II infected mice showed only a brief and moderate weight loss, those mice infected with KVI lost weight to a nadir at day 14. Mice that survived regained weight afterwards despite continued high infecton. Lastly, we measured growth of both strains <italic>in vitro</italic> using a luciferase assay in human HCT-8 cell cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Over 48h of growth KVI was significanty, yet moderately elevated when compated to Iowa II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Genetic cross of Iowa II and KVI parasites</title><p id="P6">To discover the genes that underlie the difference in mouse infection between the two parasite strains we conducted genetic crosses. <italic>Ifnγ</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were each infected with 8000 oocysts per mouse of the less virulent Iowa II and 2000 oocysts per mouse of the KVI strain and subjected to dual drug selection with BRD7929 and paromomycin from day 4 to 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A-C</xref>, cross 1-3). We also conducted crosses in which mice were left untreated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4D-E</xref>, cross 4-5). Fecal luciferase activity was recorded to track parasite burden throughout the infections and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> (drug treated) and 2C (untreated) show measurements for both types of experiments. Parasite burden was slightly higher in experiments that used drug treatment. This likely reflects the effect of the antibiotic paromomycin on the bacterial microbiome which is known to enhance parasite infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. We observed sustained infection in all experiments suggesting selection for the superior ability of the KVI parental strain to colonize and persist in mice. We collected oocysts for DNA sequencing across the infection and into the persistence phase and specific time windows for each collection pool are indicated by grey boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>. Genomic DNA was extracted from 1 to 5 million purified oocysts of each pool. We conducted whole genome Illumina sequencing and variants were called (SNP loci with coverage below 30-fold in either of the compared pools were excluded from analysis).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Drug resistance loci are readily identified by bulk segregant analysis</title><p id="P7">Genetic crosses in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> traditionally relied on the isolation of clonal lines of recombinant progeny and assessed genotype and phenotype individually for each clone to establish linkage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Here we turned to bulk segregant analysis as a method that uses progeny populations instead of clones to conduct genetic mapping (for a broader conceptual review of this approach see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>). The key element of bulk segregant analysis is selection; by comparing allele frequencies across the entire genome among progeny exposed to different selective pressures, we can identify loci for which inheritance from one parent appears enriched or depleted in response to pressure. This is well suited for <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> where we can collect parasites across the course of in vivo infections with ease but lack a continuous tissue culture system required for cloning.</p><p id="P8">We first asked whether our crosses might identify the positions of the marker transgenes used. We compared three paromomycin/BRD7929 treated, and two untreated crosses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>), using the genome sequences of the first oocyst pool collected in each experiment. Visual inspection of the aligned Illumina reads showed loss of the wildtype sequence, and fixation of the resistance genes in the <italic>pheRS</italic> and <italic>TK</italic> loci in all drug-selected pools (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). Next, we counted reads corresponding to the genotypes of each parent, and calculated allele frequencies for all variable SNPs. These frequencies were then used for bulk segregant analysis. We identified two quantitative trait loci (QTL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) on chromosome three and five, respectively, each characterized by very high G values (G values represent the level of statistical support at each individual SNP, G’ curves average across multiple neighbouring SNPs). Zoomed in views of the allele distribution of these chromosomes show them to be inherited in equal measure from each parent in the absence of drugs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 3B and C</xref>, blue shades), but to be highly selected upon drug treatment for the parent that carried the respective marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B and C</xref>, red shades). We found the insertion sites at or in close vicinity of the highest confidence SNP. We noted a difference in the shape of the allele frequency and G’-value curve for the markers. While the <italic>TK</italic> locus was found in the middle of the overall peak and the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile confidence interval, <italic>PheRS</italic> was located outside that interval, and right at the transition between plateau and slope of a broader peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D and 3E</xref>). We conclude that <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> crosses combined with bulk segregant analysis readily identify genes under drug selection with high confidence. The results of the crosses are highly reproducible upon multiple repeats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6 and S7</xref>), and SNP-by-SNP analysis may be superior to reliance on broad, weighted moving averages to identify linked genes.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Loci on chromosomes 2,6, and 7 are linked to virulence and/or persistence</title><p id="P9">We hypothesized that analogous to drug treatment, we might be able to use the host to impose selection suitable to mapping by bulk segregant analysis. We considered that such selection may act immediately, based on differences in the ability to colonize a specific host species, or only unfold over time, reflecting differences in parasite persistence or interactions with the host’s developing adaptive immunity. To account for these scenarios, we followed the progeny through infection and sampled and whole-genome sequenced longitudinally at multiple points of infection for 40-49 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). We observed three QTL on chromosome 2, 6, and 7, with marked changes in allele frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7 and Table S1</xref> for an overview of G- and G’-values of all five crosses). These changes occurred regardless of whether parasites were subjected to drug treatment or not, and all three reflected preferential inheritance of the KVI genome. Bulk segregant analysis identified highly significant QTL for these positions, however there were kinetic differences. While the locus on chromosome 6 showed almost immediate impact and reached significance at 11-14 days, the two other loci produced shifts in allele frequences and significant QTLs only after the infections proceeded to later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, C-D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>The locus on chromosome 7 contains dense granule proteins, one of which is required for high parasite burden</title><p id="P10">The QTL peak on chromosome 7 encompasses multiple genes including three presumptive secretory proteins and two ABC transporters. Measurements of mRNA abundance comparing the two parental strains found no significant differences for any of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Three genes cgd7_4490, cgd_4500, and cgd_4530 were predicted to likely encode dense granule proteins in a recent spatial proteomic study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> with cgd7_4500 showing the highest degree of polymorphism and a dN/dS ratio of 2.93 across the sequences currently available on the CryptoDB database. We began analysis by introducing sequences encoding a C-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope into cgd7_4490 and cgd_4500 in the KVI strain background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). Immunofluorescence assays using anti-HA antibodies using expansion microscopy confirmed that both proteins localize to the dense granule compartment in sporozoites and we will thus refer to the proteins as dense granule protein DG5 and DG6, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>). Following secretion during invasion, DG5 is found in the parasitophorous vacuole surrounding the intracellular parasite, while DG6 localized to the host parasite interface. Next, we targeted each locus in the KVI strain by introducing a Nluc/Neo marker that disrupted the coding sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). Drug resistant parasites were recovered in both cases, albeit with pronounced delay for DG6. Uniform disruption was confirmed by PCR mapping of the loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). In side-by-side infection experiments in <italic>Infγ</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice we noted a ~30-fold reduction of peak parasite burden for the ΔDG6 mutant, while deletion of DG5 had comparatively little impact on infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D and 5E</xref>). Consistent with reduced parasite burden, mice infected with ΔDG6 mutants showed less weight loss when compared to those infected with KVI wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). In HCT-8 tissue culture experiments <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of the ΔDG6 mutant was found to be indistinguishable from KVI wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). To rigorously control whether the observed burden reduction was due to modification of the target locus alone, we next complemented the mutant. We reintroduced the gene amplified from either the Iowa II or the KVI strain as a transgene 3’ to the PheRS locus using BRD7929 selection, including the respective 5’ and 3’ sequences from each allele type to ensure native levels of expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>). Parasite burden in both complemented strains rebounded to levels comparable to KVI wild type while the ΔDG6 mutant again showed lower infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We conclude that while DG5 is dispensable under the conditions tested, loss of DG6 results in reduced infection <italic>in vivo</italic> but not <italic>in vitro</italic>, and this is rescued by complementation. We observed that sequences from either parent provided similar levels of complementation, suggesting the strain specific difference responsible for the QTL to reside within a different gene.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>GP60 controls parasite burden and virulence but not persistence</title><p id="P12"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref> shows a closer inspection of the QTL on chromosome 6, plotting average SNP G-values for bins of 1000 bp, along with annotated gene models (all individual G-values are found in Table S1). The peak falls into gene <italic>cgd6_1080</italic> which encodes glycoprotein (GP) 60, a polymorphic gene that is frequently used to type <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>°. GP60 has been suspected to be linked to virulence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, and a recent study has explored its contributions to host infectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. When comparing the GP60 gene between the parental Iowa II and KVI strains we noted 149 SNPs and 3 indels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8A</xref>), and found that the selected progeny largely carries the KVI allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Both alleles encode an N-terminal signal peptide, a C-terminal glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor signal, numerous potential O-glycosylation sites, and a single potential N-linked glycosylation site, albeit not at the same position in the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8B</xref> shows an annotated sequence alignment). The QTL includes 5’ upstream regions with the presumptive promoter, and we thus considered that KVI and Iowa II might express GP60 at different levels as previously noted for ROP18 alleles in <italic>T gondii</italic> strains that differ in virulence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. However, qPCR analysis of both parents showed similar GP60 mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Next, we used reverse genetic engineering to test the impact of GP60 in isolation. We considered that GP60 from the more virulent KVI strain might be a dominant factor conferring virulence. We introduced KVI GP60 along with its 5’ and 3’ regulatory sequences as a transgene into the dispensable thymidine kinase locus of Iowa II parasites (this also introduced a Nluc reporter, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>). When we infected <italic>Infβ<sup>/-</sup></italic> mice with the resulting stable transgenic parasites we found, to our surprise, the resulting infection to be moderate and similar to Iowa II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Hypothesizing that alternatively, the low virulence Iowa II allele might be dominant, we next disrupted the coding sequence of the endogenous GP60 gene by insertion of a PheRS marker cassette in the bi-allelic strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>). This resulted in a marked increase in parasite burden in side-by-side infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). We also engineered reciprocal modifications in the highly virulent KVI parent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>). Expressing Iowa II GP60 as a transgene decreased KVI parasite burden, again suggesting the dominance of this allele in reducing virulence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). We also considered that expression of two distinct alleles of GP60 might have a dominant negative effect limiting parasite growth in a way unrelated to virulence. To control for this, we ablated the original KVI gene in the pseudo diploid strain leaving only the single Iowa II allele behind. This did not change parasite burden, which remained low, arguing that parasite growth <italic>in vivo</italic> is not impeded by the expression of two alleles of GP60 but by the presence of the Iowa II allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). We monitored the weight of all infected mice as a measure of virulence. Removing Iowa II GP60 in Iowa II alone was not sufficient to cause enhanced weight loss, and this might be linked to the fact that while parasite burden increased dramatically the duration of the infection remained short (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>). Expression of Iowa II GP60 prevented the substantial weight loss associated with KVI infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H</xref>). When these replacement mutants were used to infect HCT-8 cultures we observed that replacing GP60 in the Iowa II strain with the KVI allele enhanced growth, while exchange of GP60 in the KVI strain reduced growth when compared to the respective parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6I and J</xref>). We were unable to ablate GP60 completely in the strains we studied. We conclude that bulk segregant analysis correctly mapped and identified GP60 as a major strain-specific contributor to virulence. Interestingly, reverse genetic analysis in both parental backgrounds suggests that Iowa II GP60 moderates virulence in a dominant fashion. While changes in GP60 changed virulence they had no impact on persistence, Iowa II did not gain persistence, and KVI did not lose it when the gene was replaced.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P13">Sexual recombination has been hypothesized to be critical for the ability of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> to adapt to opportunity and challenge through rapid evolution of complex traits. Recent studies have highlighted the likely role of sex in the emergence of enhanced transmissibility, resulting in an epidemiological sweep of <italic>C. hominis</italic> strain IfA12G1R5 across the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Recombination was similarly documented in studies of <italic>C. hominis</italic> across the African continent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Increased host specialization resulting in narrowing adaptation to humans has been noted in the typically more broadly zoonotic <italic>C. parvum</italic>, and this has been discussed as the potential result of sex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the overall rate of such genomic exchange appears higher in recent human history, likely reflecting increased long-distance travel of both humans and domestic animals enhancing mating opportunities of geographically separated parasite strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. In this study we show through controlled laboratory experimentation that sex indeed allows parasites to recombine and rapidly select beneficial traits including drug resistance and superior colonization ability. We also show that this can be exploited to discover parasite gene function in forward genetic mapping experiments.</p><p id="P14">While <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> is not amenable to mapping based on the isolation and study of individual progeny clones, it proves well suited for bulk segregant analysis, which identified the loci of the drug resistance markers used with high statistical support. We noted relatively broad G’ linkage peaks that contain one or multiple much more narrow peaks when considering the G-values of individual SNPs. This could indicate multiple loci to contribute to the overall QTL, however, this was also observed for the PheRS drug resistance locus where a single gene drives selection. For most organisms, crosses involve a single round of recombination, and the progeny thus represent the F1 generation. However, <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> experiences continuous mating among the progeny as sex occurs every third day of an ongoing infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. We note that mapping was successful even in the absence of dual drug selection to enforce mating. This suggest an overall high rate of recombination and that crosses with unmarked strains, e.g. for species not amenable to transfection, are likely feasible. Using marker genes biases selection for their loci, this may fix chromosomes limiting resolution. By the same token, careful placement of markers could enhance segregation of loci difficult to resolve.</p><p id="P15">Several additional factors likely influence the resolution of genetic mapping including the specific biology of the trait under selection, the number of recombination events between the strains used, and the chromosomal location of the genes to be distinguished. One obvious factor is the number of SNPs that discern the parents. Higher SNP density improves the ability to pinpoint the position of selected genes, as seen in the highly polymorphic GP60 locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), while low density diminishes precision. The remarkable similarity of <italic>C. parvum</italic> IIa strains even when isolated from different continents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) thus was an early impediment to our efforts. IIa strains are highly prevalent in cattle, and parasite uniformity may reflect host uniformity due to the global distribution and dominance of certain highly productive cattle breeds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Isolation of IId parasites from lambs was important to success, and other studies have noted more pronounced differences between IIa and IId strains as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Future sampling of diverse hosts could yield diverse parasites and further improve mapping resolution and provide insight into the mechanistic basis of host specificity. Another factor to consider is the strength of the selection applied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. The highly potent BRD7929 kills parasites fast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> and the rigorous selection imposed may have resulted in rapid fixation of a large chromosomal segment, while the less potent drug paromomycin provided slower selection, and thus added opportunity for recombination and resolution. Lastly, time itself is important, and the chronic nature of KVI infection in the mouse model chosen here offered the opportunity for longitudinal evaluation. Two of the three QTLs only rose to significance over time, suggesting that they are required for chronic persistence but not initial colonisation.</p><p id="P16">More work is needed to understand the specific mechanisms by which these loci impact persistence. However, we note the presence of polymorphic secretory proteins, in particular dense granule proteins, a subset of proteins that in <italic>T. gondii</italic> was shown to contribute to immune evasion by manipulating host defense pathways and their transcriptional and regulatory circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. The late emergence of these loci might suggest their dependence on selection imposed by the development of adaptive immunity. Crosses in hosts with varied immune competence may provide differentiating selection to link loci to the evasion of specific restriction mechanisms or may yield additional loci only revealed by the change of selection applied. The advanced tools accumulated for the study of immunity in mice offer a multitude of genetic backgrounds and reagents to remove or add specific elements of the immune system. We and others have shown <italic>C. parvum</italic> to be highly sensitive to such manipulations (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>). This breadth of selection systems combined with the relative ease of the population-based crossing model developed in this study holds significant promise for future of forward genetic analysis of host pathogen interaction in <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>.</p><p id="P17">GP60 stands out as the most significantly selected locus in our experiments leading to rapid fixation of the KVI allele indicating that it exerts a profound influence on the ability of <italic>C. parvum</italic> to colonize mice, reach high parasite burdens, and to cause disease as measured by weight loss and mortality. Reverse genetic analysis rigorously validated this finding – replacing the GP60 locus alone changes parasite load and virulence in both parental genomes as background. The well acknowledged high degree of polymorphism of this locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> suggests that it is under significant diversifying selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, a hallmark of rapid host-pathogen coevolution. GP60 is proteolytically processed into GP40 and 15 which remain associated following cleavage and membrane bound due to a GPI anchor on GP15<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. GP40 is particularly variable and heavily glycosylated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>). The protein has been localized to the surface of extra and intracellular parasite stages, and this localization depends on the presence of signal peptides for ER insertion and GPI anchor addition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. GP60 has been suggested to play a role in host cell invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, however, its specific molecular function remains to be revealed. Li and colleagues found that replacing GP60 in a IId strain with a IIa allele resulted in less virulent parasites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We engineered replacement mutants in IIa and IId parental backgrounds along with intermediate pseudo-diploid strains expressing both alleles. Phenotypic analysis of these mutants demonstrated dominance of the less virulent Iowa IIa allele, in both parental backgrounds virulence was restricted by the presence of the Iowa II allele, rather than the KVI allele enhancing virulence. This is intriguing, and the mechanism underlying this dominance is still unknown. Different GP60 allele might impact on the parasite’s ability to invade and grow. While the strain difference was noticeable in tissue culture, the effect was much more pronounced in animals, particularly in those lacking IFNγ. Overall, this may suggest that GP60 is recognized by the host as a trigger for immune restriction, and that the IIa allele produce a stronger response in mice. Such a scenario underlies the relative burden of <italic>T. gondii</italic> in different rat hosts. Dense granule proteins secreted by the parasite trigger a potent inflammasome response restricting the pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. <italic>C. parvum</italic> activates a range of innate mechanisms through the NLRP6 inflammasome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, a subset of toll like receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, and likely additional pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. GP60 is also a target of adaptive immunity and a prominent antigen recognized by antibody and cell mediated responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Genetic mapping studies in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> have identified strain specific antigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Exploring the impact of GP60 alleles in the context of mouse mutants lacking specific restriction pathways will be helpful to further distinguish these models.</p><p id="P18">The crosses reveal the amplitude of parasite burden and the persistence of parasite presence as distinct strain specific traits governing <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> infection. GP60 controls parasite burden in the mouse model but it does not impact on persistence. Switching the GP60 allele to KVI in the Iowa parent, parasites did not gain persistence, nor did the KVI parent lose persistence in the reverse swap. Additional loci on chromosomes 2 and 7 were significantly selected in chronic infection suggesting that they may harbour persistence conferring genes. Initial studies on two genes encoding dense granule proteins demonstrated one of them, DG6 to be important for high parasite burden <italic>in vivo</italic> but not <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, complementation studies argue against a strain specific function of this factor, making additional genes in this locus high value candidates to be pursued in future studies. Importantly, both high burden and longer persistence were required for the KVI strain to cause severe life-threatening disease.</p><p id="P19">Our experimentation shows that forward genetic studies in <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> are feasible, and with the help of bulk segregant analysis highly capable to discover the genomic location of genes associated with drug resistance and virulence. Continued recombination and continued selection yields linkage of different parasite genes to different phases of the infection. Varying the specific circumstance under which host, and parasite encounter each other will tune the selection pressure, and is likely to reveal different aspects of interaction and the numerous parasite factors that modulate such interaction. The small genome size of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> and the ability to use mice to conduct crosses makes this a straightforward discovery model to understand how host restriction and parasite evasion govern parasite infection and the evolution of host specificity.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Resource availability</title><sec id="S12"><title>Lead contact</title><p id="P20">For access to reagents or parasite strains used in this study please contact the lead contact, Boris Striepen (<email>striepen@upenn.edu</email>).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Materials availability</title><p id="P21">All unique/stable reagents generated in this study are available from the lead contact with a completed Materials Transfer Agreement.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="S15"><title>Mouse models of infection</title><p id="P22">All parasites were maintained in 6- to 8-wk-old male and female C57BL/6 <italic>Ifnγ<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (Jackson Laboratory stock no. 002287) mice bred in-house.

The regions with low SNP density include: chr 1: 390kb-700kb (310kb), chr 2: 345kb-559kb (214kb), chr 4: 199kb-530kb (331kb), and chr 7: 387kb-530kb (143kb). Similar high SNP density distribution patterns were observed in population data at the same locations<sup>71</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that these are common hypervariable regions in <italic>C. parvum</italic>. However, no regions with extremely low SNP density were identified in the currently published population data.</p></sec><sec id="S39"><title>Bulk segregant analysis</title><p id="P47">SNP loci with coverage below 30× in either of the compared pools were excluded from each bulk segregant analysis. At each variable locus, we counted reads corresponding to the genotypes of each parent and calculated allele frequencies. Iowa II allele frequencies were plotted across the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>), and outliers were removed using Hampel’s rule with a window size of 100 loci. Bulk segregant analysis was performed using the R package <italic>QTLseqr</italic>. Extreme QTLs were defined as loci with false discovery rates (FDRs, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted <italic>p</italic>-values) below 0.01. Once a QTL was detected, a 95% confidence interval was estimated using Li’s method to localize causative genes<sup>72</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S40"><title>Automated bulk segregant analysis</title><p id="P48">We also developed an Automated Bulk Segregant Analysis (ABSA) pipeline implemented in Python (v3.10.12) to streamline the workflow. This links the software needed: raw reads are quality-trimmed using Trim Galore, aligned to a reference genome with BWA, processed using SAMTools, and variants are called with GATK4 (v4.6.1.0) and filtered via vcffilter. Downstream analyses and visualization are performed in R. ABSA supports both manual installation and containerized deployment via Singularity, with a provided Singularity definition file based on Ubuntu 24.04 that bundles all required dependencies into a single, reproducible image.
