To this end, we contrasted <italic>non-dysplastic metaplasia</italic> of BE patients, captured when they did not progress (non-progressors), did subsequently, but had not yet progressed (pre-progressors) or had already progressed to EAC (progressors). Using spatial multiplexed 56-protein analysis, serial laser capture microdissection (LCM) RNAseq and shallow whole genome sequencing, we identified prooncogenic immune neighbourhoods and dysregulated immune cell populations predictive of subsequent progression to EAC. Indeed, spatial analysis revealed that M1 macrophages, regulatory natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils and altered ratios of intraepithelial CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes typify tumor microenvironmental (TME) changes associated with cancer initiation. Spatially derived cell-to-cell interactions revealed progression-specific immune cell interaction signatures predominantly involving M1 macrophages NK cells and plasma cells. Furthermore, LCM RNAseq analysis identified gene expression ‘hot’ signatures enriched in pre-progression and progression samples. Notably, we also observed a correlation between immune cells and copy number alterations in progressor metaplasia.

Despite the known role of chronic inflammation in tumorigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, how the interplay of its cellular components, notably the interactions between stromal and immune cells, drive progression of metaplastic epithelial cells to cancer, remains elusive. In this case, chronic inflammation may not reflect a failure of immune cells to repair damaged tissue but rather their inability to resolve inflammation, leading to persistent remodeling. This sustained dysregulation causes immunosuppression, resulting in immune escape of altered cells, as well as cellular stress responses which predispose to neoplastic transformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is an example of a metaplastic state and is the only known precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Ulceration due to exposure of the esophageal squamous epithelium to acid and bile reflux triggers a repair response from the adjacent gastric epithelium, which promotes metaplasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The genetic hallmarks of BE progression have been extensively studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, demonstrating that progressive, yet non-dysplastic BE contains a higher diversity of copy number variations (CNVs). However, despite high mutation rates, no consistent driver mutations, aside from those affecting <italic>TP53</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, have been reported in Barrett’s.</p><p id="P5">Relatively little is known about how the immune response and stroma change during the progression of metaplastic BE cells to cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Non-progressive BE has been associated with a Th2-dominant immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> which appears to shift to a Th1-like profile as BE progresses to EAC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Moreover, an increase in FOXP3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD163<sup>+</sup> myelomonocytic cells has been observed in BE progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Other studies, all with a focus on the transition from BE to dysplasia and cancer, have shown a loss of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Our own previous scRNAseq studies are consistent with these published studies and, additionally, have shown that metaplasia is also marked by the appearance of fibroblasts with gastric identities and characteristics reminiscent of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. What is unclear is whether these changes in the metaplastic environment can already be detected in those patients prior to progression to dysplasia and cancer, key information which could then be used as a prognostic biomarker in surveillance.</p><p id="P6">Our primary aim in this work was to investigate how the stromal landscape in BE metaplastic lesions change before and at the time of cancer development. Our findings identify specific signatures for BE patients that are at risk of progressing to EAC. Defining microenvironments that promote progression of BE to cancer is critical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. To date, studies on prospective progressor (pre-progressor, where patient samples were taken years prior to cancer development) non-dysplastic BE (NDBE) have primarily focused on the genomic landscape which has revealed altered genotypes in patients, years before progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Here, we take advantage of a unique sample set afforded by surveillance program NDBE of demonstrated non-progressor, pre-progressor and proven progressor (non-dysplastic metaplasia from patients with diagnosed cancer or dysplasia) patients, to investigate combining transcriptomic, proteomic and genomic approaches, a strategy that allow us, for the first time, to ascertain the actual contribution and timeline of alterations of the stromal landscape associated with progression of NDBE to cancer.</p><p id="P7">Our data shows that an increase in immunoregulatory NK cells, neutrophils and M1 macrophages along with their spatial relationships with other immune cells such as Tregs and plasma cells represent an important immunological event in the progression to EAC. Additionally, altered ratios of CD4 to CD8 T cells in the BE epithelium is dependent on whether a BE patient will progress. Our work suggests that early changes in this tissue at the metaplastic stage may stratify risk of progression for BE patients, discriminating those patients likely to remain non-dysplastic from those that will progress. The early reprogramming of the immune and stromal compartments in metaplasia likely opens new avenues for risk stratification tools and potential therapeutic targets for preventing malignancy.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Patient Biopsies</title><p id="P8">Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archival biopsies were collected from three cohorts of BE patients for this study: (i) <italic>NP:</italic> Non-progressors (n=48), defined as patients who have no history of previous dysplasia or cancer for 7 years prior to the date of the study and have undergone at least 3 endoscopies; (ii) <italic>PP:</italic> Pre-progressors (n=26), defined as patients who have undergone at least two dysplasia/cancer-free endoscopies over a period of at least 7 years, the latest endoscopy being performed at least 2 years prior to the development of dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC); (iii) <italic>P:</italic> Progressors (n=27), defined as patients who have developed EAC but whose histology revealed adjacent areas of NDBE.

Only a <italic>portion</italic> of patient samples were used for each technique, and these are detailed later. Patient biopsies were sourced from tissue banks and hospital pathology archives (Barts Health Foundation Trust, University College Hospitals London Foundation Trust, Grampian NHS Trust) under ethical approval from Stanmore Research Ethics Committee 11/LO/1613 or East London Research Ethics committee 15/LO/1217. Patient biopsies were also collected from McGill University Health Centre (Montreal, Canada) under approval REB# 2007-856.

For the PP cohort, only tissue sections were available for each patient and TMAs could not be constructed. Instead, a maximal number of “virtual” cores were taken on the entire section using a custom interactive web application developed with Shiny<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, incorporating the Plotly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, ggforce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, and ggplot2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> R packages. To enable direct comparison with tissue microarray (TMA) cores, which have a diameter of 0.6 mm, the virtual core radius was set to 0.6 mm, based on a pixel-to-millimeter conversion rate of 0.5 μm/pixel. This approach ensured consistency in core size and scale, facilitating direct histological comparison between the virtual tissue section cores and traditional TMA cores. Virtual cores were representative of the metaplastic regions of physical cores as defined by the presence of NDBE. Overall, cell content of virtual cores between non-progressors and pre-progressors at the metaplastic stage was not found to be significantly different from physical cores (data not shown), thus ensuring the legitimacy of comparing virtual and physical cores.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) Antibody Conjugation and Panel Creation</title><p id="P10">CODEX (now Phenocycler, Akoya Biosciences, UK) multiplexed imaging was executed according to the staining and imaging protocol previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.

Each antibody was conjugated to a unique oligonucleotide barcode, after which the tissues were stained with the antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates and validated so that staining patterns matched expected patterns already established for IHC within positive control tissues of the esophagus or tonsil. Similarly, Hematoxylin and Eosin morphology staining were used to confirm the location of marker staining.

These datasets underwent batch correction using the Batchelor R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> to achieve uniformity across samples. For dimension reduction and display, the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis was performed utilizing the scater<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> package, based on z-score normalized intensities. This method facilitated the evaluation of phenotypic consistency across the distinct experimental groups. A comprehensive analysis of the marker landscape within the phenotyped cell populations was conducted, elucidating the complex relationships between multiple markers. The proportion of each cell type and the mean signal intensity of individual markers were calculated and depicted using a dot plot (ggplot2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>), offering an integrative perspective on marker expression across the different cell populations.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Cell Type Quantification and Distribution</title><p id="P15">Cellular populations within each tissue core were quantified and normalized to the total cell count, encompassing both epithelial and stromal cells. The data are presented as the percentage of each cell type of the entire immune cell population. During spatial point pattern analysis, cells within the glandular space were isolated, with intra-epithelial lymphocytes identified as the immune component specific to this space. These lymphocytes were quantified and expressed as the number of immune cells per 100 glandular epithelial cells. Immune cells located outside of the Barrett’s glands were categorized as lamina propria immune cells. The distribution of these cell types across various stages of disease progression was illustrated using boxplots generated by the ggplot2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> package. To evaluate the independence of cell type distributions among non-progressor, pre-progressor, and progressor biopsy samples, a two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test was conducted using the rstatix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> package, with statistical significance defined as p &lt; 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Immune Neighborhood Analysis</title><p id="P16">The immune neighborhood analysis was conducted following previously established protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. A systematic approach was employed, wherein a window comprising 10 cells was systematically chosen across the entire immune cell-type map of all cores. Each immune cell served as the central point (index cell) for its respective window during the analysis. Within each window, the number of each cell type among the nine nearest neighboring cells was calculated relative to the total number of cells within the window. The resulting data were organized in a matrix format, with each row representing an index cell and each column indicating the frequency of the corresponding cell type in the neighboring cells. To identify clusters of index cells with similar distributions of neighboring cell types, a mini-batch K-means clustering algorithm was employed. This method facilitated the grouping of index cells based on shared patterns of neighboring cell types, referred to as cellular neighborhoods (CNs). Following the clustering analysis, each index cell was assigned to the specific neighborhood to which it belonged.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Spatial Point Patterns Analysis</title><p id="P17">The interactions between cell-cell and neighborhood-neighborhood were investigated using spatial point pattern analysis, which employed the x and y coordinates of various cell types or CNs as well as custom histological annotations.

However, this comparative analysis showed that the dynamics of these immune cell types shifted in metaplasia as progression occurred. Thus, plasma cells (specifically CD138<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>hi</sup> long-lived plasma cells), were reduced in progressor metaplasia compared with non-progressor metaplasia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">Figure S4A-D</xref>).

To determine which immune cell pairs that showed attraction to or repulsion from each other, we calculated Ripley L values (transformed from K values) over all distance from each index cell to their comparator cells and plotted these against a complete spatial randomness null-model (CSR, simulated 39 times). An L value greater than CSR indicates pairwise attraction (e.g., CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and plasma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>)), while a value below indicates repulsion (e.g., CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs and dendritic cells (DCs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>)) and any value that lies within the minimum and maximum CSR values represented a random association.

Conversely, NK cells did not interact with many of the immunoregulatory cells (FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs, M2 macrophages) and this was unchanged from pre-progressors to progressor samples.

CNs were also identified through combining all three patient data sets then performing clustering using a mini-batch K-means clustering algorithm (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">methods</xref>) to enable comparison of common CNs.</p><p id="P55">A total of eight CNs were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) that represented CNs with either a high density of single cell types or those that were more mixed. We observed regional clusters of CNs from the same neighborhood as we would expect based on local microenvironments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-G</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref> illustrates the cellular component characteristics of all identified CNs all three NDBE progression cohorts. Two major plasma cell CNs (CN3 &amp; CN7) were identified with the first (CN7) almost exclusively composed of plasma cells. Plasma 2 CN (CN3) was also composed primarily of plasma cells but also contained CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and M1 macrophages. One CN predominantly consisted of M1 macrophages (CN4) while another macrophage-enriched CN (CN0) consisted of an equivalent number of M1 macrophages and plasma cells. Three complex CNs were identified that either contained mainly dendritic cells (CN1), CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CN2) or M2 macrophages (CN6), respectively. A CN that was almost entirely composed of B cells (CN5) was also detected but only a few cores presented with this CN. While the cell composition of CNs was consistent across NDBE progression, NK cells and neutrophils appeared to be present in nearly all pre- and progressor CNs with their frequency increasing in a linear manner across progression. This suggested that NK cell and neutrophil presence was independent of CNs. The cellular complexity of CNs also appears altered with progression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD18">Figure S9</xref>). We observed an increased Shannon diversity in CN1 and CN6 in pre-progressor samples, and an increase in CN0, CN2, CN4 and CN6 in progressor samples suggesting that the changes in cellular diversity observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref> are tied to specific neighborhoods. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S10A</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">E</xref> show the individual core neighborhood maps for all samples.</p><p id="P56">We observed significant alterations in CN frequency and composition as metaplasia progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>). Pre-progressors exhibited marked reduction in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell CN (CN2) and an increase in the number of cores containing M2 macrophages/CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (CN6) and dendritic cell CNs (CN1) compared with non-progressor CNs respectively. Progressor CNs appeared most altered compared with non-progressor CNs. A decrease of plasma 1 (CN3) and plasma 2 (CN7) CN correlated with an overall decrease of plasma cells in progressor samples described above suggesting that plasma cells, in spatial isolation from other cells, were lost. An increase in the proportion of CN0 plasma cell/ M1 macrophage neighborhood was observed in progressors compared to non-progressors. Plasm cells contained within CN0 were predominantly CD38<sup>hi</sup> CD138<sup>+</sup> (long lived) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD19">Figures S11A &amp; B</xref>). This suggests that while overall numbers of plasma cells decreased as the lesion progressed, those that remained were highly active (likely producing Ig mRNA, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">Figure S6</xref>).</p><p id="P57">Interestingly, despite an overall reduction in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells among progressor patients, the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-enriched CN (CN2) was found to be increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>). This CN included a wide range of cell types, suggesting a more heterogeneous immune microenvironment in progressors. In contrast, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-enriched CN (CN6) appeared to mirror the elevated presence of CD8+ T cells in the stromal regions of progressor samples. Notably, the ratio of CD8<sup>+</sup> to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-enriched CNs (CN2 and CN6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>) corresponded closely to the relative abundance of these cells in the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G&amp;H</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that the cellular composition of CNs—especially those involving plasma cells and M1 macrophages—undergoes marked remodelling in NDBE as patients progress toward EAC.</p><p id="P58">Previous studies have shown a spatial relationship between distinct CNs in EAC epithelium <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.

In a similar fashion, to explore whether CN-CN relationships are affected by NDBE progression, we applied Ripley’s K function analysis to assess the spatial pairwise association of CNs in all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4l-K</xref>). This enables investigation of CNs that may share borders.</p><p id="P59">While most CNs exist in isolation from each other, which is expected because they are likely self-contained neighborhoods, plasma cell CNs (CN0, 3 &amp; 7) exhibited significant spatial clustering together across all 3 cohorts. Interestingly, we observed no significant alterations in interactions between CNs in non-progressor and pre-progressor samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>). However, in progressor samples we observed a significant shift from isolated CNs towards a more random distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4J&amp;K</xref>). A loss of organized CNs in progressor samples and the changes in immune cell distributions, coupled with an increase in cellular diversity suggests that the pro-oncogenic immune environment becomes more disorganized, with many cell types interacting with each other at increased levels in pre- and progressors compared to non-progressors.

Dimensionality reduction tSNE maps did not reveal robust clusters associated with progression status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>) but revealed three distinct clusters of gene expression in k-means clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Frequency analysis of each individual library showed that there was a significant enrichment for pre-progressor and progressor patients in cluster Kmeans1(K1) compared with clusters K2 and K3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). Each cluster is illustrated as a supervised heatmap of the 500 most variable genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>). GSVA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>) revealed that K1 showed highly enriched gene expression in multiple pathways, including inflammatory (IFNγ response, TNFα signaling, inflammatory response and IL-2/Stat5 signaling Hallmark gene set pathways) and cancer-related (EMT, KRAS signaling, P53 pathway Hallmark gene set pathways). By contrast, cluster K2 exhibited intermediate levels of gene expression, and cluster K3 showed minimal or ‘cold’ expression for these pathways.</p><p id="P61">Applying the approach described in Bagaev et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5J</xref>), we observed an immune cold cluster (cluster 1) enriched for non-progressors and K3 samples that expressed a Th2 cytokine signature. An additional cluster (cluster 2) also enriched for non-progressors/K3 samples showed an immune cold environment but also a high Th1 signature. Pre- and progressor/K1 samples were enriched in an immune hot cluster that lost Th2 cytokines but expressed Th1 cytokines (cluster 3). A fourth cluster (4) was evenly distributed across all 3 patient cohorts. Interestingly, K1 was associated with both an anti- and pro-immune signatures, providing further evidence for a heterogenous immune response with components that appear to counterbalance each other.</p><p id="P62">To better understand the relationship between gene expression changes and progression, we performed weighted correlation network analysis (WCGNA), linking gene expression patterns with specific traits such as K means, progression status, future pathology (pathology at final known timepoint) and time to last known outcome (e.g., at last endoscopy). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5K</xref> confirmed the strong correlation with K means clustering (illustrated as MeBlue and MeGrey); while a weaker, yet significant correlation with progression was observed (illustrated as MeBrown, MeTurqoise and MeYellow). Future pathology (that observed at the time point of progression or last endoscopy) also showed a weak, but significant association with endpoint histology similar to progression status, but no clear differences between endpoint pathology could be discerned. Biopsy time (TPLS) before endpoint did not show any relationship.</p><p id="P63">Individual gene expression changes across the transcriptome were visualized by volcano plots for both progression status and the K means clusters. Interestingly, we observed a large group of differentially expressed genes between non-progressors and pre-progressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5L</xref>) and, also between non-progressors and progressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5M</xref>) that concords with the pathways described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5I&amp;J</xref>. Unexpectedly, comparing pre-progressors and progressors yielded almost no significantly differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5N</xref>). Volcano plots confirmed the significant gene expression changes between the K means clustered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5O-Q</xref>). In summary, the stromal gene expression profiles of pre- and progressor samples were very similar, in that the stroma of pre-progressors already reflected a progressor state, an important observation noted in our previous publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Potential role for other stromal cells in regulating the BE microenvironment</title><p id="P64">Analysis of stromal signatures using WCGNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5K</xref>) revealed that one module (MeYellow) was particularly enriched for extracellular matrix genes in pre-progressor samples.

These data provided a potential explanation for how increase in MMP9 occurred in neutrophils, although we cannot ascertain that PDPN+ cells are exclusively fibroblasts from our dataset.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Copy number variations (CNVs) of metaplastic epithelial cells correlate with specific immune cell distributions</title><p id="P66">Our analysis suggests the important role of immune cell composition and organization with progression. Therefore, we hypothesized that we should also identify relationships between immune cell composition and epithelial copy number variations which have been reported to exhibit a strong association with progression to dysplasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.

We therefore performed shallow pass whole genome sequencing (sWGS) on LCM-isolated epithelium from serial sections taken from the cores subjected to CODEX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD20">Figure S12A-H</xref> for representative sWGS plots) and then correlated copy number changes with immune cell frequency in an unsupervised fashion. We did not expect to encompass the full spectrum of CNVs previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> but rather to credential the association of pro-tumorigenic immune cell profiles in stroma adjacent to epithelial lesions bearing such CNVs in our cohort(s). Two major clusters were identified that strongly separated progressor and non-progressor NDBE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Samples displaying diploid genomes were most common. However, chr18p amplicons, chr9 deletions and p53 loss (determined by sWGS and CODEX respectively) were observed. Chr18 amplicons were detected exclusively in progressor epithelium and chr9 deletions were almost always detected in non-progressor epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). p53 expression loss as measured by CODEX, strongly associated with progressor samples; conversely, one non-progressor showed high expression of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Additionally, one progressor case had both a Chr18 amplicon and a chr9 deletion. Other cases contained CNVs that were restricted to a single sample, such cases being grouped together as ‘CNVs’.</p><p id="P67">Unsupervised clustering of cellular expression with CNVs showed a strong correlation between Chr18 amplifications and enrichment in NK cells and neutrophils, whereas such correlations were not observed when contrasting CNV-bearing epithelium with M1 macrophage, plasma cell, CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Moreover, there was a correlation between NK and neutrophil cell frequency and other CNVs but this association was not seen for other immune cells except for rare, uncharacterized HLADR<sup>+</sup> or CD45<sup>+</sup> lin<sup>-</sup> cells that we could not further characterize from our CODEX panel. This does not discount the possibility that correlation of CNVs and immune cell changes arise independently of each other. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref> shows the frequency of all CNVs and their respective genomic segment sizes showing no apparent difference. From these data, we infer that NK cells and neutrophils are strongly associated with Chr18 amplifications and M1 and plasma cells are likely to be independent of Chr18 amplification because they are frequent in the non-progressor NBDE. These data suggest that there is a strong relationship between specific immune cells and the generation of specific epithelial CNVs in progressive BE.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S29" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P68">This study highlights significant changes in the spatial organization and immune cell composition of the premalignant metaplastic stroma and how this integrates with gene expression prior and during carcinogenesis. Particularly, we investigated how the immune landscape in Barrett’s esophagus metaplastic lesions develops during this process.</p><p id="P69">Gaining a detailed understanding of the alterations of cellular interactions and organization across BE will eventually improve our ability to predict which BE patients are at higher risk of progressing to EAC. To begin to understand this process defining the microenvironment that associates with the progressor NDBE is critical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. To date, studies on pre-progressor NDBE have focused on the genomic landscape which has revealed altered genotypes in patients, years before progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Here, we are the first study to investigate how the immune response changes in NDBE as the risk of cancer progression increases.</p><p id="P70">One of our most surprising findings is that there is an equilibrium between pro-inflammatory and counter immunoregulatory programs in the context of NDBE, which is altered in the evolution of non-progressor to pre-progressor to progressor states. The non-progressor immune landscape is rich in M2 immunomodulatory macrophages, plasma cells and dendritic cells that appear to show a strong reciprocal attraction to one another and maintain specific plasma cell-enriched neighborhoods. The pre-progressor stroma is characterized by an increased number of immunoregulatory cells such as M2 macrophages and immunoregulatory NK cells, which contrasts with an increase in neutrophils. We observed a loss of immune organization in pre-progressor cell interactions with a significant drift to random spatial distribution between M1 macrophages and most other immune cells except for dendritic cells which maintain interactions with M1 macrophages and CD4+ T cells. These changes appear in the setting of increased collagen and MMP2 gene expression. The progressive NDBE displays a further significant increase in regulatory NK cells, countered by a concomitant increase in pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and neutrophils. Interestingly, there is a switch to an immune hot environment where M1 macrophages strongly interact with most other immune cells. This is counteracted by regulatory NK cells, despite being a minority population in progressive NDBE, as these NK cells are strongly attracted to most other immune cells with the exception of neutrophils. The diversity of the immune repertoire in BE may reflect the complex interplay between pro-inflammatory signaling driven initially by acidic reflux and subsequent anti-inflammatory responses by the BE epithelium and stroma. Cellular diversity is a known cancer risk factor, in Barrett’s we have previously shown gland epithelial phenotype diversity is increased prior to cancer progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> and others have shown that genomic diversity follows a similar path<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that in this dysregulated microenvironment, the resulting impaired immune surveillance allows for the propagation of deleterious genomic aberrations (such as Chr18 amplifications) and eventual development of dysplasia and cancer.</p><p id="P71">Strikingly, NK cells were extremely rare in non-progressor patients, almost to the point where they were exclusive to pre-progressor and progressor patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Such a stark signature constitutes a very promising basis for a meaningful clinical test for risk stratification at early stages of BE. NK cells appear to play an important role in the pre- and progressive NDBE immune landscape showing strong attraction to most other immune cells. They appear as regulatory NK cells (lacking CD3 and expressing CD56<sup>hi</sup>, P63, CD11b and Annexin Al)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Regulatory NK cells are known to express non-classical MHC class I molecules such as HLA-A, -B, - and -E<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>, an increase in expression of these genes was confirmed in our RNAseq data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD21">Figure S13A</xref>). NK cells appear to encroach into most CNs suggesting a broad repertoire of function. The mode of action of NK cells on the immune response in NDBE is not known but published evidence suggest that they can produce TGFβ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> and IL-10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> immune suppressive cytokines – notably, we observe an increase in the TGFβ signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>) and in TGFβ, TGFβl, TGFβR1/2/3 gene expression in both pre-progressors and progressors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD21">Figure S13B</xref>). Additionally, NK cells are known to compete for binding to MHC class II antigens, thus preventing immune activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> and even showing the ability to kill CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>; however, such a killing activity would likely be dependent on the expression of perforin which we did not detect in our study. The exact nature of the role of NK cells in BE progression therefore emerges as an important area of future research and clinical applications.</p><p id="P72">The role of intraepithelial immune cells in BE has never been studied. Yet, they represent an important immune sensing population of cells that are known to maintain homeostasis in the intestine. They are common in the small intestine (1 IEL per 10 epithelial cells) and the majority are CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>, however IELs are rarer in NDBE (2-3 cells per 100 epithelial cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) in all three cohorts studied. We also detected intraepithelial CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells, NK cells and M1 macrophages, suggesting that the epithelial layer is an active immune site hitherto unappreciated. Intraepithelial CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were found in similar numbers in non-progressive NDBE but significantly more CD8<sup>+</sup> IELs compared to CD4<sup>+</sup> IELS were observed in pre-progressor and progressor NDBE samples. The ratio of CD8:CD4 IELs is therefore a strong indicator of patients on the pathway to cancer progression. The biological effect of altered T cell IEL ratios is unknown, but IELs are known to act as tumor suppressor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> and their dysregulation may play an important role in susceptibility to progression.</p><p id="P73">We demonstrated a strong positive correlation with Chr18 amplifications and a negative correlation with chr9 deletions in progressor NDBE. While genomic alterations are well characterized in Barrett’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, their association with the immune system is not. We observed an association between an increase in NK cells and neutrophil density and Chr18 amplifications, even if a chr9 deletion is present. M1 macrophages and plasma cells on the other hand did not show the same association, indeed appeared randomly distributed with Chr18 and ch9 alterations. This suggests that the spread of genetic abnormalities occurs later than M1 macrophage/plasma cell mediated inflammation. NK cells and neutrophils likely accrue in the progressor NDBE mucosa and are either precursors to genomic damage or accumulate as a result of it. The precise timeline of immune: genomic evolution cannot be determined here, but our data suggests they are dependent on each other.</p><p id="P74">Overall, our data demonstrate that the stromal-immune response alters prior to the development of overt cancer and is likely to play an important part in this process. More investigation into the timing of inflammation and the spread of genetic abnormalities in Barrett’s esophagus is required.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"
