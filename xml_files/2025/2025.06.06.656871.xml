Some antibiotics have the potential to mediate interference competition by triggering a bacterial stress response that subsequently activates endogenous viruses integrated in bacterial genomes (prophages). Canonically, this activation is regulated by the SOS response upon DNA damage. Here we show that a metabolite produced by natural isolates of <italic>Vibrio ordalii</italic> circumvents the SOS response by directly triggering prophage induction in other <italic>Vibrio</italic> species, co-occurring in the same environment. While the metabolite was previously classified as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, we observe how it acts as a peptide deformylase inhibitor that specifically induces certain prophages, even when target bacterial cells carry multiple other prophages. Its biosynthetic gene cluster, or <italic>ord</italic> cluster, also encodes its own peptide deformylase (OrdE) which provides self-immunity to producer strains. Likewise, among natural <italic>Vibrio</italic> isolates that carry similar prophages, resistance against the <italic>ord</italic> metabolite was found in those that had acquired a divergent second peptide deformylase. Finally, we show that prophage induction by the <italic>ord</italic> cluster prevents slower-growing producer strains from being outcompeted by their otherwise fast-growing competitors if they carry an inducible prophage. Thus, we demonstrate how natural products play additional impactful roles in communities beyond antibiotic activity and that prophage induction serves as an interference competition strategy, sustaining community diversity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Prophages are highly abundant mobile genetic elements (MGEs) found within bacterial genomes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). When dormant, these viruses passively proliferate with the host genome, even endowing the host with superinfection exclusion/immunity proteins, or additional metabolic functions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Still, prophages present risks to their hosts as timebombs that can destroy the cell when they are induced to replicate. Such induction may be triggered remotely by natural compounds produced by other microbes, making prophages a powerful target for interference competition (in contrast to the indirect inhibition by consumption of shared resources). Prophage induction has been linked to the SOS stress response system where the SOS system is activated in response to DNA damage. The host RecA protein then also stimulates the autoproteolysis of the phage cI repressor, resulting in host machinery being co-opted by the phage through prophage induction(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). In fact, the primary approach to prophage discovery has been to treat cells with high concentrations of potent DNA damaging agents like Mitomycin C (MMC) or ciprofloxacin that are known to activate the SOS system. Cases of prophage induction by environmental competitors have also been linked to the SOS response via the production of hydrogen peroxide or colibactin(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). However, it is now clear that DNA damage does not encompass the diversity of induction cues in nature, and that induction screens relying on DNA damaging agents do not capture all inducible prophages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Recent examples support the existence of SOS-independent mechanisms of prophage induction by exogenous chemicals including direct induction by autoinducers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), the signaling molecule in quorum sensing, and pyocyanin(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), a redox-active phenazine pigment, further demonstrating the potential of non-canonical inducing agents and pathways. Based on this evidence, we reasoned that a broad screen for interference competition, designed to detect phage-mediated cell lysis between natural isolates, may reveal additional mechanisms of prophage induction.</p><p id="P3">To discover cases of prophage induction triggered by other bacteria, we developed a high-throughput combinatorial microfluidic screening pipeline aimed at first detecting cell lysis when bacteria are co-cultured and then verifying which of such cases are associated with prophage induction. Our screening focused on a collection of 110 bacterial strains of the genus <italic>Vibrio</italic> all isolated from the same coastal marine environment in Massachusetts. Using subsets of our collection, previous studies have demonstrated antagonism mediated by secondary metabolites, interactions between MGEs/phages and their hosts, as well as prophage diversity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). We further interrogated putative cases of prophage induction in screened co-cultures using a combination of molecular genetics and comparative genomics, leading to the characterization of an antagonistic interaction mediated by SOS-independent, selective prophage induction exhibited by a pair of isolates had displayed the highest lysis and viral induction levels. We found that induction was controlled by a metabolite that acts as a peptide deformylase inhibitor. We also showed that the host can be rescued from lysis by prophage induction upon the expression of a horizontally acquired peptide deformylase with low similarity to the genomic peptide deformylase.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Antagonism screen for prophage induction</title><p id="P4">To maximise throughput of our pairwise antagonism screen, we implemented the kChip - a droplet microfluidics screening platform that enables the massively parallel assembly and measurement of combinations of isolates(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). The kChip allowed us to perform 120,000 pairwise microscale co-cultures in parallel per device, including controls. Thus, we were able to assay 5,995 unique isolate pairs covered by 24,530 conditions (four relative abundance ratios per co-culture and the respective monocultures, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Materials and Methods</xref>), powered to a median of 14 replicate co-cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S1A</xref>). To detect cellular lysis during co-culture, we implemented a fluorescence-based time course assay in the kChip using the non-toxic dye SYTOX Green which intercalates DNA but cannot permeate intact cell envelopes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S1B-D</xref>). To confidently score lysis due to interactions, we calculated lysis scores by comparing the signal from co-culture to that of a baseline comprising the combined respective monocultures, then scaling the resulting “lysis scores” from -1 to 1 where positive scores denote co-cultures with signals greater than the respective monocultures (Materials and Methods). The utility of this lysis assay was confirmed by comparing it to the traditional Burkholder plate-based assay using isolates known to induce lysis during co-culture(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S1E-F</xref>). We recapitulated the co-cultures that displayed high lysis in the kChip (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Materials and Methods</xref>) using a similar fluorescence assay in microtitre plates. Co-cultures exhibiting lysis at both assay scales were then evaluated for prophage induction by sequencing pooled samples and searching for an increase in coverage in genomic regions that exhibited sequence characteristics consistent with prophages (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Materials and Methods</xref>). These cases were verified by quantifying phage production with phage-specific qPCR assays (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Our screen found that 2.9% (172 of 5,995) of all unique pairwise co-cultures lead to lysis by antagonism with the distribution skewed towards six strains that were involved in lytic interactions with ≥25% of the collection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">data file S1</xref>). From these 172 co-cultures, our sequencing-based screen identified ten putatively induced phages from eight isolates; these phages were also all part of the 107 independently and bioinformatically predicted prophages within our 110-isolate collection (Materials and Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">data file S2</xref>). To delineate spontaneous induction from direct induction by a specific isolate, we individually co-cultured each of these eight hosts with each isolate that led to a positive lysis score, then measured induction by comparing viral loads using phage-specific qPCR between co-cultures and their corresponding host monocultures. Altogether, three phages reached high titres relative to monoculture, prompting us to hypothesize that induction occurred due to antagonism for: phage 41 in <italic>Vibrio cyclitrophicus</italic> 1F-97, phage 5.64 in <italic>Vibrio tasmaniensis</italic> FF-266, and phage 6.141 in <italic>Vibrio ordalii</italic> FF-93, while the remainder displayed high spontaneous induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">data file S1</xref>). All three phages are found in polylysogenic strains and have small genomes (33.6 kbp - 37.5 kbp), where phage 41 additionally appears to be a circular, episomal prophage with an estimated four copies per host genome. The three phages also varied in the number of bacterial isolates that triggered their induction in co-culture, the genetic distances between these isolates, as well as the degree of induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S3</xref>). Our study focuses on the induction of phage 41 which displayed the highest lysis and relative viral load in our screen when its host, <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> 1F-97, was specifically co-cultured with <italic>V. ordalii</italic> isolates 12-B09 or FS-144, whereas the other <italic>V. ordalii</italic> strains did not induce lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig. 1A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S4A</xref>). Using 12-B09 as a model hereon, we confirmed the directionality of the interaction with the Burkholder assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S4B</xref>). With the strong response of phage 41 in <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> 1F-97 confirmed, we sought to determine the mechanism of induction.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>SOS-independent induction of phage 41</title><p id="P6">First, we evaluated whether the antagonism by <italic>V. ordalii</italic> 12-B09 and FS-144 is contact-dependent or -independent. To that end, we asked whether induction is effected by a secreted metabolite by treating 1F-97 with nutrient-supplemented spent media from both inducing and non-inducing <italic>V. ordalii</italic> isolates. Similarly to the co-culture experiments, induction was only observed with 12-B09 and FS-144 spent media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig. 1C</xref>). This suggests that induction is neither contact-dependent, nor due to compounds generally present in spent media, but rather is due to a specifically secreted product likely encoded by a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) unique to 12-B09 and FS-144.</p><p id="P7"><italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> 1F-97 is a polylysogenic strain containing two previously described prophages: an SOS-responsive phage (phage 38) and a putatively dual SOS and quorum-sensing responsive phage (phage 43)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), and also a third prophage which is our focus here (phage 41). Intriguingly, we observed that <italic>V. ordalii</italic> isolates 12-B09 and FS-144 triggered the nearly exclusive induction of phage 41 in an SOS-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig. 1D</xref>). To understand the differences in induction between these three prophages, we compared the relative phage population levels across various inducer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig. 1D</xref>). While all three prophages are induced when exposed to the DNA damaging agent Mitomycin C (MMC), phage 38 dominates the other two by up to an order of magnitude. In contrast, only phage 41 is induced when 1F-97 is co-cultured with 12-B09 or FS-144, while the other two prophages were close to background induction levels. To confirm whether the induction of phage 41 is independent of the canonical stress response, we constructed a <italic>recA</italic> null mutant in 1F-97 that abolishes the SOS response. Despite the loss of the RecA-dependent SOS system, 12-B09 spent media could induce phage 41, while induction was lost upon MMC treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig. 1E</xref>). Furthermore, the lack of observable phage 41 induction in pure 1F-97 culture suggests that spontaneous induction is low (raw reads deposited on Zenodo, see Data and materials availability). Altogether, the specific and SOS-independent induction of phage 41 in 1F-97 can be triggered by select <italic>V. ordalii</italic> strains or their spent media, raising further questions about a potentially novel class of prophage inducers.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>A hybrid NRPS/PKS cluster elicits induction</title><p id="P8">Because only 12-B09 and FS-144 elicited lysis and prophage induction among the five <italic>V. ordalii</italic> strains in our collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">fig. 1A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S4A</xref>), we were able to identify one putative biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) specific to the inducing strains using bacterial antiSMASH (v7.0)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S4C</xref>). This BGC constitutes a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)/polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster - hereon the <italic>ord</italic> cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2A</xref>). In total, the <italic>ord</italic> cluster comprises genes encoding a 4-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (<italic>ordA</italic>), two nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs; <italic>ordB, ordD</italic>), a polyketide synthase (PKS; <italic>ordC</italic>), a peptide deformylase (<italic>ordE</italic>), and a SAM-dependent methyltransferase (<italic>ordF</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2A</xref>). We leveraged the NRPS and PKS domain and substrate predictions to propose structural elements and a putative biosynthetic pathway for the <italic>ord</italic> metabolite using a combination of bioinformatic tools (antiSMASH, PRISM, and University of Maryland NRPS predictor, see Materials and Methods)(<italic>23</italic>–<italic>28</italic>). These analyses suggested that the metabolite is a nonribosomal peptide-polyketide product beginning with two L-valine residues loaded by OrdD, followed by an L-leucine or L-isoleucine residue incorporated by OrdB, and ending with the addition of one unit of malonyl-CoA by OrdC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">tables S1-3</xref>). The ketoreductase and terminal reductase domains of OrdC indicate the likely reduction of the β-ketone of the initial PKS elongation product to a secondary alcohol and generation of an aldehyde or alcohol at the terminal carbon atom of the natural product. Sequence and structural analysis of the OrdC thiolation and reductase domains revealed conserved catalytic residues suggesting functional domains in contrast to the incomplete domains predicted by antiSMASH(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S5B-E</xref>). Finally, interrogation of OrdF’s sequence resemblance to known methyltransferases suggested its role as an <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase, rather than an <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase; however, bioinformatic analyses alone could not definitively predict the chemoselectivity of this enzyme. In contrast, while OrdE was annotated as a peptide deformylase, its role in biosynthesis could not be immediately linked. Interestingly, a previous study identified this same BGC in 12-B09 as responsible for the ability to kill a broad diversity of <italic>Vibrio</italic> in a strikingly similar skewed distribution to our screen (&lt;5% of strains inhibited &gt;25% of their tested strains)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that the <italic>ord</italic> cluster encodes the prophage inducer.</p><p id="P9">We confirmed that the <italic>ord</italic> cluster controls prophage activity by using a 12-B09Δ<italic>ordD</italic> mutant, where production of the metabolite is disrupted by deleting the central NRPS gene <italic>ordD</italic> (previously 12-B09 HW44 null mutant(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>)). In contrast to wild-type 12-B09, 12-B09Δ<italic>ordD</italic> did not elicit lysis when co-cultured with 1F-97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2B</xref>) and induction of phage 41 both in co-culture and by spent media declined severely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2C</xref>). Together, these data not only suggest that the <italic>ord</italic> cluster is primarily responsible for the induction of phage 41, but also that lysis by prophage induction appears to be the primary means for antagonism against 1F-97. To further assess whether lysis (proxy for antagonism) occurs exclusively due to prophage induction, we cured phage 41 from 1F-97. Similarly to the effects by 12-B09Δ<italic>ordD</italic>, co-culturing 1F-97Δphage 41 with wild-type 12-B09 results in a complete loss of lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2D</xref>). Furthermore, loss of phage 41 does not cause growth defects to 1F-97 in monoculture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">fig. 2E</xref>), supporting the interpretation that 12-B09 antagonises 1F-97 exclusively through eliciting the induction of phage 41 with this hybrid NRPS/PKS product.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Induction by peptide deformylase inhibition</title><p id="P10">We noticed that the <italic>ord</italic> cluster encodes a peptide deformylase (<italic>ordE</italic>) that did not have an apparent function in light of the proposed biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S5A</xref>) - for example, the BGC does not also encode a formylase. Given that resistance genes often appear in BGCs, we hypothesized that the product of the <italic>ord</italic> cluster is a peptide deformylase inhibitor (PDI) of the highly conserved <italic>N</italic>-formylmethionine peptide deformylase (<italic>def</italic> gene or PDF product) and that OrdE was its resistance gene. In bacterial translation, formylated methionines are added as the first residue of every peptide, but their retention leads to the degradation of the nascent polypeptide(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Thus, peptide deformylases must outcompete the degradation machinery to remove the formyl group soon after the nascent polypeptide is exposed at the exit tunnel of the ribosome. Furthermore, PDF is an essential gene, canonically encoded as one chromosomal copy upstream of the transformylase gene <italic>fmt</italic><italic>(29)</italic>. Given its importance for successful translation, inhibition of this process could plausibly serve as an SOS-independent stress signal prophages would be advantaged to detect and respond to. Notably, the previous study that had identified <italic>V. ordalii</italic> 12-B09 as a “superkiller” (capable of antagonising &gt;25% of other <italic>Vibrio</italic> isolates) attributed its killing activity also to the <italic>ord</italic> locus(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Without characterizing its mechanism, the killing was assumed to be by broad-spectrum antibiotic activity, potentially lysing cells by membrane disruption based on the biosynthetic gene cluster annotations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Here, we posit that the production of the <italic>ord</italic> metabolite could mediate killing by inhibiting the deformylation of nascent peptides, thus triggering induction in lysogens at otherwise sublethal concentrations to prophage-free cells. To that end, we first titrated actinonin - a commercial PDI(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), to observe whether it has activity against wild-type 1F-97 and whether the activity concentration differs from the concentration required to kill 1F-97Δphage 41. Lysis occurred in wild-type 1F-97 when treated with as low as 250 nM actinonin whereas lysis was only observed beginning at 2.5 μM in 1F-97Δphage 41 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig. 3A</xref>). Furthermore, of the three prophages in 1F-97, only phage 41 was robustly induced by actinonin, optimally at 1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig. 3B</xref>). Together with the presence of <italic>ordE</italic> in the BGC, the shared capability to specifically induce phage 41 suggests that the <italic>ord</italic> metabolite acts by a similar mechanism to actinonin, that is PDF inhibition.</p><p id="P11">Next, to evaluate if <italic>ordE</italic> is indeed the resistance gene of the <italic>ord</italic> cluster, we assessed whether heterologously expressing <italic>ordE</italic> conferred resistance against peptide deformylase inhibitors. Upon its expression in 1F-97 from its native promoter, we did not observe growth defects in the absence of induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S6</xref>).

Altogether, we demonstrated that <italic>ordE</italic> sufficiently rescues 1F-97 from induction by both the <italic>ord</italic> metabolite and actinonin, thus concluding that <italic>ordE</italic> is encoded in the <italic>ord</italic> cluster as its resistance gene.</p><p id="P12">To test how broadly the <italic>ord</italic> metabolite can lead to prophage induction in additional strains, we bioinformatically identified prophages similar to phage 41, yet observed that some hosts were resistant to experimental induction in co-culture. Among the ten additional prophages found in nine <italic>Vibrio</italic> hosts, 12-B09 only displayed activity against four additional strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig. 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Materials and Methods</xref>). Phage 41 and all ten relatives form their own family in the <italic>Caudoviricetes</italic> together with other Vibriophages. In this family, phage 3 of 10N.286.46.A11 forms its own new genus, but the remaining nine belong to another new genus comprising eight new species (the relative in 10N.286.46.A12 and phage 1 of 10N.286.46.A11 were deemed the same) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S7</xref>). Given the high degree of genetic similarity and synteny between these phages, but the absence of uniquely shared genes by the non-sensitive phages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S8A</xref>), we speculated either that resistance was a host property rather than encoded in the phages, or that the prophages had become cryptic (i.e. lost induction capacity). Pointing to resistance being a host property, given how the <italic>ord</italic> cluster encodes its own peptide deformylase OrdE, we discovered that three out of four resistant hosts contained a second PDF gene (PDF2), while inducible strains only carried the canonical PDF (PDF1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig. 3E</xref>). PDF1 and 2 represent divergent protein clusters (up to 50.9% amino acid identity), while being highly similar within a cluster (97-100% identity) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">data file S2</xref>). Moreover, OrdE only shared up to 48.5% and 61.5% identity with PDF1 and 2, respectively. Despite the low sequence similarity, all three PDF clusters maintain the three conserved motifs around the catalytic site (G43XGXAAXQ, E88GCLS, and H132EXXH)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) and share structural similarities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the resistant strains horizontally acquired a second copy of PDF to protect against such antagonistic interactions.</p><p id="P13">Finally, to test whether PDF2 confers resistance against the <italic>ord</italic> metabolite, we heterologously expressed PDF2 (encoded by <italic>Vibrio lentus</italic> 10N.286.48.F9) in 1F-97. Similarly to OrdE, expressing PDF2 from its native promoter reduced lysis and phage 41 induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig. 3F-G</xref>), but unlike OrdE, it did not protect 1F-97 from 1 μM actinonin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig.

S8E-F</xref>), suggesting that PDF2 may have diverged to specifically prevent binding to the <italic>ord</italic> metabolite (and related compounds), while OrdE became more generally resistant (preventing the binding of both the <italic>ord</italic> metabolite and actinonin). Taken together, these data suggest that the <italic>ord</italic> metabolite triggers prophage induction at sublethal concentrations as a PDI, and that natural isolates have evolved resistance against the <italic>ord</italic> metabolite through alternative PDF2 genes.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Prophage induction as competitive interference</title><p id="P14">The presence of resistance factors against the <italic>ord</italic> metabolite in natural isolates (PDF2) suggests that similar interactions occur in the wild and impact population dynamics. We therefore asked how prophage induction affects the coexistence of the 12-B09 producer and 1F-97 lysogen by comparing the growth of each in mono- and co-culture using isolate-specific qPCR. If interactions were solely determined by competition for resources, we would expect 1F-97 to have a fitness advantage given its faster growth rate in monoculture compared to 12-B09 (growth rates of 0.9 h<sup>-1</sup> and 0.8 h<sup>-1</sup> respectively, and 12-B09 having a lag phase around 5 hours longer, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Materials and Methods</xref>). Indeed, both wild-type and 1F-97Δphage 41 strains dominated the culture when grown with 12-B09Δ<italic>ordD</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">fig. 4</xref>). Likewise, 1F-97Δphage 41 grew similarly when grown with wild-type 12-B09, likely due to the absence of prophage induction. However, when both wild-types competed, 1F-97 began to plateau around 12-h, presumably because prophage induction limited the abundance of 1F-97, while 12-B09 continued to grow. As further confirmation, we tested these four pairs by Burkholder assay and observed that only wild-type 12-B09 can cause clearance on wild-type 1F-97 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S9A</xref>). These data validate the dependence of 12-B09 on induction by the <italic>ord</italic> metabolite for its ability to successfully compete with prophage-carrying strains. Finally, we asked whether the induction of phage 41 led to a subsequently detrimental infection of 12-B09. Upon screening 12-B09 colonies (n=44) for the presence of phage 41 by qPCR post co-culturing with 1F-97, the colonies resembled the negative control, suggesting that phage 41 does not lysogenize 12-B09 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig.

Together, these results describe how antagonism driven by prophage induction may serve as a successful form of interference competition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">While genome mining discovers an abundance of biosynthetic gene clusters, bioinformatic analyses alone typically cannot accurately ascribe the mechanisms of actions to their products.

However, despite no semblance to known inducing agents, we demonstrate that the <italic>ord</italic> metabolite can directly induce prophages. Moreover, this metabolite links translational stress to prophage induction which, to our knowledge, has not been previously described. Together with autoinducers, there now appears to be a diversity of SOS-independent prophage inducers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), suggesting that additional classes and mechanisms of inducing compounds likely remain to be discovered.</p><p id="P16">By further broadening the types of compounds capable of inducing prophages, we begin to see differences in responses by prophages. Similarly discussed in other studies about polylysogenic strains(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), the selective induction by the <italic>ord</italic> metabolite suggests that prophages respond to multiple, distinct, induction cues. While the widespread SOS-responsivity may result in a race for host resources between competing prophages, uniquely responding to a specific cue, such as peptide deformylase inhibition, provides additional selective advantage under certain environmental conditions, which may partially explain how the coexistence of multiple prophages can be evolutionarily maintained in a single host.</p><p id="P17">Notably, because the mechanism of action was unknown, the previous antagonism study not only mistook the <italic>ord</italic> metabolite solely as an antibiotic, but also did not identify the resistance gene for the <italic>ord</italic> cluster with traditional genetic methods despite how immunity is typically encoded within a BGC(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).

While lack of initial formylation to methionine shares similar genetic logic to redundant function by a second PDF, mutants lacking a functional methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase tend to be fairly sick, explaining why the primary method employed, transposon-mutagenesis, had struggled to characterize the mechanism in the past study(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Moreover, recent work elsewhere revealed that nearly 50% of available bacterial genomes encode additional predicted PDFs, often within the mobilome, highlighting a potentially widespread yet previously unrecognized resistance mechanism(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).

In contrast, our work demonstrated how this antibiotic instead unconventionally and sufficiently kills at low concentrations in certain lysogenic strains. Furthermore, it has already been posited that many antibiotics may exhibit non-antibiotic functions at their natural production level, especially when the high concentrations necessary for antibiotic activity are rarely achieved under physiological conditions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>).

Pre-cultures were diluted in M9G+ at low and high OD<sub>600</sub> (0.02 and 0.1, twice the final inocula for t<sub>0</sub> prior to droplet merging), supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (SeraCare) which helps retain hydrophobic small molecules in droplets (e.g. barcoding dyes). The volumes of pre-culture used for these dilutions were determined by the OD<sub>600</sub> measurement of 1F-97 and applied uniformly to all cultures. A final concentration of 5-μM SYTOX Green (Invitrogen) and 20-μM of the respective dye barcode (a unique ratio of Alexa Fluor 555, Alexa Fluor 594, and Alexa Fluor 647; Invitrogen #A33080, #A33082, #A33084) were added to the cultures. Cultures were dropletized using the BioRad QX200 Droplet Generator in a fluorocarbon oil (3M Novec 7500 with 2% 008-fluorosurfactant, RAN Biotechnologies). Emulsifications for each input were combined at equal volume and 800-μL of a uniform mixture was loaded onto the kChip, sealed with an optically clear PCR film (Applied Biosystems), wetted with 7500 oil. To map strain members to each co-culture assay, the kChip was first imaged at 1X magnification to record the barcoding dyes using the Nikon Ti-2 inverted fluorescence microscope (equipped with a Lumencor Sola light-emitting diode illuminator, Iris 9 camera, Nikon 1X Plan Achromat Microscope objective, and the filter cubes: Semrock SpGold-B, Semrock 3FF03-575/25–25 + FF01-615/24–25, Semrock LF635-B, and Semrock GFP-1828A). Droplets were then merged within their microwells with brief exposure to a corona treater (4.5 MHz, 10,000-45,000 volts; Electro-Technic Products, Model BD-20), bringing cultures to their final inocula and initiating the co-culture. The kChip was then imaged, again with all four channels, every 30 minutes for 24 hours (1X magnification). An all-by-all pilot kChip experiment (included in total dataset) involving 32 of the 110 <italic>Vibrio</italic> collection was first performed and used to select a positive control, which coincidentally was the 1F-97 x 12-B09 co-culture (0.05 x 0.05). Thus this pair was represented on and used for quality assurance for every kChip included in the screen dataset.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>kChip data analysis</title><p id="P31">Image analysis was performed using adapted, but previously published custom Python scripts(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>). In summary, the combinations found in each microwell were decoded from the premerge images through the positioning of unique ratios of fluorescent barcode dyes for each input. This positioning was then mapped onto the respective merged images to associate the fluorescent lysis signal with the culture.</p><p id="P32">To estimate lysis from the kChip dataset, the median fluorescence was taken for each combination at each time point to produce empirical lysis scores (SYTOX Green lysis described above in “Assays measuring interactions” and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig.

We then calculated the standard error per time point using the standard deviation of the distribution. Our empirical lysis score was then error-adjusted by accounting the standard errors of the respective curves (i.e. subtracted the error from the co-culture median fluorescence or added the error to the respective monoculture median fluorescence, then re-calculated the AUCs/lysis score). Using the 1,000 iterations for each component in calculating a lysis score, we also computed a distribution of 1,000 lysis scores for each combination. Here, an estimated lysis score was derived from the mean of this distribution. From this point, all chips were processed as a single batch. To determine the significance of each score, we first standardized the estimated lysis score with its standard error (standard deviation of the score distribution) as <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mtable columnalign="left" equalrows="true" equalcolumns="true"><mml:mtr columnalign="left"><mml:mtd columnalign="left"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi/><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula>. Benjamini-Hochberg-corrected p-values (q-values) were then calculated from these standardized scores using a nonparametric right-tailed test against the bootstrapped (10,000 iterations) null distribution which comprises the standardized scores of all “self co-cultures” (e.g. strain A<sub>low</sub>/strain A<sub>high</sub>). We reasoned that these cultures would not display antagonism while also better representing the resource use from the range of inocula in the dataset. In total, a combination would pass if the error-adjusted empirical lysis score ≥ 0.1, the FDR-corrected p-value ≤ 0.05, and the combination passed on at least two kChips. Finally, hits were binarized where a unique pair is called if at least one of the four ratios (combinations) passed the selection criteria. The best lysis score was that of the inocula ratio with the highest mean lysis score (calculated only from passing combinations).</p><p id="P33">To ensure the kChip dataset comprised only of chips with suitable effect sizes, chips were assessed by calculating Z-prime values, using <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mfenced><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced close="|" open="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and bootstrapping (1,000 iterations) similarly as above to compute standard errors (<italic>s</italic>).

For pooled sequencing, cultures were pooled in equal volumes on ice after 24-h growth. Non-pooled cultures were grown in 25-mL. To obtain phage DNA, both pooled and unpooled cultures were extracted as follows. Cultures were centrifuged at 4°C for 15 min at 5250 g. To remove residual bacterial debris, the recovered supernatants were centrifuged again under the same conditions, then passed through 0.2 μm PES Stericup filters (Corning). Phage particles were further concentrated by PEG precipitation as follows. Filtered supernatants were incubated overnight (typically 16 - 18-h, up to 24-h) at 4°C at 4:1 of supernatant to 5X PEG solution (0.2 g/mL PEG-8000, 0.15 g/mL NaCl), then centrifuged at 15000 g for 30 min at 4°C. The recovered pellets were resuspended in TBS (8.8 μg/mL NaCl, 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) to achieve the desired concentration (up to 100X), incubated on ice for 30 min to help dissolve the pellets as needed. To remove contaminating bacterial DNA, the phage resuspensions were treated with TURBO DNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and RNAse A (Qiagen) at 3 U and 300 mg per 100 μL phage resuspension, respectively, for 2-h hours at 37°C, or until bacterial DNA was visibly absent via 1% agarose gel, then inactivated with 2 mM EDTA at ambient temperature for 10 min, followed by 75°C for 20 min. To release phage DNA from capsids, samples were treated 10:1 with 2.5% SDS (buffered with 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 9) at 75°C for 10 min, then brought to 55°C before digesting further with Proteinase K (Qiagen; at 0.2 mg/mL) at 55°C for 20 min, inactivating Proteinase K at 95°C for 10 min. DNA was extracted from cooled samples using 0.5X AMPure XP beads (Beckman) to avoid extracting small, residual bacterial fragments, then resuspended in ddH<sub>2</sub>O to achieve at least 500X concentration of the supernatant volume. Finally, libraries were prepared using the NEB Ultra FS II Library Prep Kit (typically input normalization to 0.2 ng/μL with 1 min fragmentation and 1/250 adaptor concentration, then amplified with 12 cycles) and loaded onto an Illumina NextSeq 500 (300 cycles), at approximately 0.5 M reads per condition in a pool and approximately 3 M reads per non-pooled samples.</p><p id="P37">After demultiplexing and conversion to fastq files (bcl2fastq2 v2.20.0), reads were mapped with Bowtie2 v2.3.4.3(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>) against the respective host genome or a concatenated reference of all host genomes in a pool of samples. Briefly, the custom code called cases of prophage induction as follows. Sequencing depth was first calculated using samtools depth -a -H, including unpaired mates in the calculation. Next, we assumed that a phage is ≥10-kbp and reaches ≥10X coverage upon induction (median background-subtracted), thus a phage-containing contig would have a depth sum of ≥100,000 (the threshold is based on the sum basepair coverage of a 10-kbp region with exactly 10X coverage). To loosen the initial hit calling, contigs were filtered to have a depth sum of ≥50,000. To identify the borders of putative, enriched prophages, the contig was scanned for the first non-zero position whereby the following 50-bp contain fewer than 20% zero-coverage positions. To check whether it was a random patch of non-zero reads, the following 500-bp also required a minimum median coverage of 10X for the position to be considered an end coordinate. Finally, the spanning region was called an enriched prophage region if the median coverage had ≥ 10X coverage, its total length was ≥ 8,000-kbp (a looser cutoff than the assumed minimum 10-kbp phage genome length), and no more than 20% zero-coverage positions. However, to check whether a contig holds multiple phages and otherwise missed by the above cutoffs, we also manually checked the coverage using IGV v2.16.0(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>) for contigs over 100-kbp with proposed start and stop coordinates.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>qPCR to measure relative viral load or interpolate growth</title><p id="P38">A list of all primers used in this study are found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">data file S2</xref>.

To remove bacterial DNA, the filtered supernatants were treated with TURBO DNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 2U per 10-μL of supernatant for 1-h, then inactivated with EDTA as in “Detection of prophage induction by NGS”, which subsequently contributes to releasing phage DNA from capsids for template. The relative viral load was measured by using the difference in quantification cycles (ΔC<sub>q</sub>) between the condition (co-culture, Mitomycin C, spent media etc.) and the uninduced monoculture of the host.
