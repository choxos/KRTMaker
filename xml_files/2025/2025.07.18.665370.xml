In addition, injury to myelin prompts a regenerative response that leads to the formation of new myelin sheaths. However, the signals regulating effective remyelination by oligodendrocytes are still not completely understood. Here, we report that oligodendrocytes can internalize exogenous myelin both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, which leads to an increase in their proliferation and differentiation when their functions are not compromised. RNA sequencing reveals that myelin debris alters oligodendrocyte transcriptional profile, suppressing immune-related pathways and <italic>de novo</italic> cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, while inducing lipid droplet formation to store and process internalized myelin particles. As a result, progression of the oligodendroglial lineage is enhanced in primary cell cultures, as shown by increased viability, proliferation and differentiation. Oligodendrocytes also acquire a more differentiated phenotype, with larger cell areas, a more complex morphology and myelination of synthetic nanofibers. Stereotaxic injection of fluorescent myelin into mouse cortex shows internalization by microglia and, to a lesser extent, by oligodendroglia. Notably, in the zebrafish model, ventricular injections of myelin also increase the number of ventral oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord, further supporting that myelin can promote lineage progression. These findings challenge the classical view that myelin debris intrinsically inhibits oligodendrocyte proliferation, suggesting instead that oligodendrocytes can use myelin to support self-renewal and maturation, acting as a trophic factor in the absence of pathological cues. <fig id="F7" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="EMS207530-f007"/></fig></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are a highly specialised class of glial cells of central nervous system (CNS), best known for their role in producing myelin sheaths following their differentiation from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bradl and Lassmann 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Emery 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Nave and Werner 2014</xref>). Myelin is a multilamellar, lipid-rich structure composed of approximately 70–80% lipids, 20% proteins and a small fraction of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Simons and Nave 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Stadelmann et al. 2019</xref>). Traditionally, OLs were considered primarily responsible for axonal myelination, a process that enables saltatory conduction, in which electrical impulses jump between nodes of Ranvier along the axon, allowing rapid propagation of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bradl and Lassmann 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Nave and Werner 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Simons and Nave 2016</xref>). However, research over the last decades has expanded this view, revealing additional mechanisms through which OLs contribute to the maintenance of neuronal function.</p><p id="P3">Beyond their role in myelination, OLs also play a key role in the metabolic support of axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Nave, Asadollahi, and Sasmita 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Philips and Rothstein 2017</xref>). Neurons have high energy demands due to constant ATP-dependant activity of ion pumps, synaptic vesicle recycling and generation of membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Faria-Pereira and Morais 2022</xref>). Paradoxically, their lack of intrinsic energy reserves makes them reliant on surrounding glial cells for metabolic support. In addition to astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Tekkök et al. 2005</xref>), under homeostatic conditions OLs contribute to this energy supply primarily by transferring lactate to axons through the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lee et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Rinholm et al. 2011</xref>). Furthermore, it has recently been suggested that in response to stress, OLs can modulate their own metabolic machinery to obtain energy from myelin-derived fatty acids. Genetically starved mice, lacking GLUT1 expression in OLs, exhibit a reduction in the thickness of their myelin sheaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Asadollahi et al. 2024</xref>), a phenomenon that correlates with the loss of myelin in specific brain areas in humans following the extreme physical stress of running a marathon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Ramos-Cabrer et al. 2025</xref>). Likewise, the use of myelin lipids as an energy source has been proposed in the context of aging as a compensatory mechanism for age-related metabolic decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Klosinski et al. 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS), single-cell RNA analysis demonstrates that OLs exhibit a form of non-professional phagocytic behaviour, upregulating interferon response genes and expressing major histocompatibility complex type 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Falcão et al. 2018</xref>). Conventionally, clearance of myelin debris has been attributed to microglia and infiltrating macrophages, which actively engulf and degrade lipid-rich remnants during injury or disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Franklin and Ffrench-Constant 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kent and Miron 2024</xref>). It has been proposed that OL-lineage cells can internalize extracellular myelin debris, activating memory and effector CD4<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Falcão et al. 2018</xref>). Therefore, there is emerging evidence that OLs may have alternative roles in pathological conditions.</p><p id="P5">Further research is needed to delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in this phagocytic response and the extent to which these non-canonical properties of OLs occur in physiological and pathological conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that oligodendroglia can internalize extracellular myelin debris both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and that this process promotes their proliferation and differentiation. By demonstrating the capacity of OLs to engage in debris clearance and that this process is associated with increased OL proliferation, we highlight the importance of a previously underappreciated aspect of their biology. This insight underscores the evolving view of OLs not just as passive support cells, but as dynamic regulators of CNS integrity and repair.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>1</label><title>Animals</title><sec id="S4"><label>1.1</label><title>Rodents</title><p id="P6">Primary cell culture experiments were conducted using Sprague Dawley rats, sourced from the Animal Facility of the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) (Leioa, Spain).

Myelin was isolated from rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) to prevent cross-species reactivity. Notably, both OLs and OPCs were found to internalize exogenous myelin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Confocal imaging of OLs labelled with the membrane-linked Calcein-AM dye confirmed the internalization of myelin debris by oligodendroglia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P37">Interestingly, our results suggest a maturation-dependent enhancement of phagocytic or endocytic activity within the oligodendroglial lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Specifically, OLs were more efficient at engulfing extracellular myelin, with more than 90% of cells containing internalized myelin particles. In contrast, OPCs presented significantly lower levels of internalization, with only about 20% of the cells showing uptake, potentially indicating a more limited role in debris clearance at this developmental stage.</p><p id="P38">In order to further explore the temporal dynamics of myelin internalization, we performed time lapse imaging of cultured OLs over 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, the processes of OLs were the first cellular region contacting the myelin debris and some particles were observed migrating along the processes toward the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, bottom section). The relative size of myelin debris compared to the thin OL processes strongly suggests that complete internalization occurs upon reaching the soma. After 48 hours, myelin accumulated predominantly in clusters within the cytoplasm and only small particles remained in the processes. In phagocytic cell types, such as microglia and macrophages, internalized material typically accumulates in the soma, where it is processed and degraded by lysosomal enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Trivedi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, the clustering of myelin within this region in OLs further supports the idea that internalization is completed upon arrival of myelin debris to the cell body.</p><p id="P39">During the 48-hour time-lapse imaging period, OLs remained static while their processes extended radially. Notably, OL processes did not exhibit directed growth toward the nearby myelin particles, suggesting that they do not actively pursue it. Instead, they appear to maintain their intrinsic growth patterns and may initiate internalization upon passive contact. Importantly, compared to controls, OLs exposed to myelin appeared more ramified and exhibited an increased cell size. Morphological sholl analysis confirmed that myelin-exposed OLs were larger and exhibited higher process complexity, as determined by increased branching. Moreover, exposure to myelin enhanced cell survival, as indicated by a reduction in cell death compared to control conditions during the time-lapse imaging period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>, green arrowheads).</p><p id="P40">Building on these observations, we next investigated the effects of myelin exposure on microglia, astrocytes and neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>. As expected, microglial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

The microglial response was characterized by a higher and more rapid uptake of myelin when compared to OLs, supporting their established role in the clearance of myelin debris as professional phagocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Franklin and Ffrench-Constant 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kotter et al. 2006</xref>). In contrast, astrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 2B</xref>) exhibited minimal uptake and some myelin clusters were observed around the cells. Moreover, exposure to myelin did not appear to disrupt the astrocytic monolayer. Similarly, neurons showed no significant internalization of myelin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 2C</xref>). In both cases, exposure to myelin did not affect cellular survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

Moreover, myelin appears to signal back specifically to OLs, promoting lineage progression and survival. These results lead us to hypothesize that myelin debris may alter metabolic and signalling pathways, thereby promoting OL differentiation and/or myelination. Our results demonstrate that OLs, in addition to microglia, are also capable of internalizing myelin, particularly as they mature. Based on these findings, we directed subsequent experiments towards myelinating OLs to further elucidate pathways triggered by myelin internalization.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><label>2</label><title>Exposure to myelin alters the metabolic transcriptional profile of oligodendrocytes</title><p id="P42">We performed RNA sequencing of OLs cultured in the presence of myelin for 48 hours, which depicted 63 differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) revealed that myelin exposure triggered a downregulation of immune-related signaling, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin signaling, interferon response and inflammatory response and complement pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). This transcriptomic profile suggests a distinct cellular phenotype, diverging from the disease-specific state activated in OLs under experimental MS conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Falcão et al. 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P43">In addition, several metabolic pathways were significantly altered. Notably, genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).

These findings suggest that internalized myelin may serve as an exogenous source of cholesterol, thereby reducing the need for <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis and potentially facilitating lipid recycling for new myelin production. Indeed, Oil Red O staining revealed that internalized myelin induced an increase in lipid droplets (LDs) formation, which colocalize with myelin, suggesting that internalized myelin is stored within lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). LDs are key organelles that maintain lipid homeostasis, prevent cholesterol overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Nugent et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Ralhan et al. 2021</xref>) and regulate lipid intermediates necessary for myelin synthesis (S.

Additionally, genes linked to lipid anabolism within the “Lipid Metabolic Process” signature, such as fatty acyl-CoA reductase 2 (<italic>Far2</italic>) and fatty acid transporter 6 (<italic>Slc27a6</italic>), were also downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). These findings suggest that myelin-derived metabolites may influence the lipid pool in OLs, thereby downregulating endogenous lipid biosynthesis pathways.</p><p id="P45">In contrast, pathways associated with lipid catabolism showed a tendency towards an enrichment, including fatty acid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure Suppl. 3A-B</xref>).

After exposing primary OL cultures to myelin, we found that myelin debris increased cell viability by ∼80%, as assessed by Calcein-AM, which could be attributed either to a greater number of viable cells and/or to an increase in cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). To better understand the underlying cause, we conducted additional analyses using immunocytochemistry. Consistent with cell viability assays, immunostaining of the oligodendroglial lineage marker Olig2 confirmed an increase in the total number of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, proliferation marker Ki67 was enhanced in cultures exposed to myelin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting a boost in proliferation. This observation likely reflects an expansion of the OPC pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dimou and Götz 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Young et al. 2013</xref>), which was further confirmed by the increase in NG2<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). In parallel, we detected higher numbers of MBP<sup>+</sup> myelinating oligodendrocytes, while the ratio of NG2<sup>+</sup> to MBP<sup>+</sup> cells remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, myelin internalization accelerates lineage progression maintaining the dynamics between precursor and mature stages. These changes prompted us to investigate whether internalized myelin boosted myelination capacity of mature OLs, typically associated to a more differentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bradl and Lassmann 2010</xref>). To this end, we seeded mature OLs onto coverslips containing synthetic nanofibers. We found that exposure to myelin significantly enhanced nanofiber myelination, as shown by an increase in OL area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p id="P48">Taken together, our results suggest that myelin internalization triggers OL proliferation, as well as morphological complexity and differentiation.

Therefore, it was important to investigate whether the internalization of myelin by OLs and the accompanying increase in proliferation was also observed in a more complex cellular environment. We aimed to determine first, whether the capacity of OLs to internalize myelin is sufficiently robust to be observed in the presence of active microglia, and second, whether microglial uptake of myelin debris triggers signalling cascades that modulate OL behaviour. To this end, we performed stereotaxic injections of fluorescently labelled myelin into the cerebral cortex of adult mice. Although myelin debris is typically associated with demyelinating pathologies or injury, we sought to isolate the internalization process from confounding factors, such as OL dysfunction. While the stereotaxic procedure inherently induces a local inflammatory response, this approach enabled us to evaluate OL internalization capacity under non-demyelinating conditions. Moreover, myelin turnover may also involve clearance mechanisms beyond microglial phagocytosis, potentially implicating OLs themselves.</p><p id="P50">As expected, microglial cells rapidly migrated towards the injection site. Within the first 24 hours post-injection, most microglial cells accumulated in the injection core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), temporarily depleting microglia from the immediate surroundings and forming a circular gap with a radius of 150–300 µm, which was subsequently repopulated over the following 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Immunohistochemistry confirmed that microglia were the predominant cell type within the injection site and internalized debris was clearly localized within phagocytic pouches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Microglia adopted a rounded, amoeboid morphology typical of activated, phagocytic cells. These findings were corroborated by electron microscopy (EM), which visualized Alexa-labelled myelin debris within intracellular compartments in microglial cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). This expected behaviour validated the approach and served as a positive control that the surgery procedure did not impair the capacity of phagocytic cells to internalize exogenous myelin.</p><p id="P51">Interestingly, 48 hours post-injection we also identified a subset of PDGRα<sup>+</sup> OPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>) and APC<sup>+</sup> OLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>) containing myelin particles, as confirmed by TEM analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>). This was observed in a more limited and structurally distinct manner compared to microglia. Unlike the well-formed phagocytic vesicles seen in microglia, internalized myelin within OLs appeared in smaller, scattered inclusions without the formation of large degradation compartments. This could also reflect the lower myelin load within OLs, which may allow them to degrade and process debris without activating the same specialized degradation pathways observed in professional phagocytes.</p><p id="P52">We next sought to determine OL proliferation. The stereotaxic procedure itself triggers a local proliferative response in the cortical area surrounding the injection, masking any additional effect that myelin may exert. As a result, the proliferation marker Ki67 increased compared to the contralateral hemisphere, but no significant difference was detected between myelin- and sham-injected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>).

Membrane localization of EGFP facilitates the assessment of potential internalization of myelin, as engulfed debris can be clearly distinguished within the boundaries of myelinating oligodendrocytes, including fine processes and soma. Labelled myelin was injected into the brain ventricle at 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) and to avoid a potential confounding localized response to the injection, the spinal cord was imaged, rather than the injection site at different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). At this developmental stage, brain ventricles are already connected to the spinal canal, allowing the movement of injected material directly into the spinal cord. Control animals were injected with vehicle solution.</p><p id="P55">To determine the distribution and diffusion of Alexa-labelled myelin following injection, we first imaged 2 hours post-injection. The spinal cord was divided into anterior, central and posterior regions for analysis. The anterior region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), located closer to the brain ventricle, showed clear presence of labelled myelin debris dispersed along and outside the central canal, reaching both the ventral and dorsal myelinated tracts of the spinal cord. The central and posterior regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure Suppl 4A</xref>), situated more caudally along the tail, showed little to no detectable myelin at this time point. This confirmed that the injected material diffused through the cerebrospinal fluid and reached the anterior spinal cord, allowing for potential interaction with resident oligodendrocytes. At this early time point, however, we did not observe internalization of myelin by oligodendrocytes. Importantly, zebrafish larvae did not exhibit any visible behavioural abnormalities or morphological defects following injection and the introduced myelin was well tolerated, indicating that it was not toxic at the administered concentration.</p><p id="P56">By 24 hours post-injection, myelin fragments had formed more discrete clusters, typically 7 to 10 per fish, distributed along the spinal cord.

Colocalization analysis revealed that large myelin clusters were predominantly found within microglial cells, confirming their active role in myelin phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure Suppl 4B</xref>). In addition to microglial uptake, we also detected smaller myelin particles contained within the soma of OLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>) and associated with their myelin tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>).

In contrast, dorsal OLs, potentially less exposed to myelin, did not show a significant change in cell number.

Taken together, and considering that zebrafish development is characterized by low levels of oligodendroglial cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Almeida and Lyons 2016</xref>), these findings suggest that myelin uptake could locally be enhancing proliferation, rather than promoting oligodendroglial survival.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S30" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P58">In this study, we found that OLs have the capacity to internalize myelin debris, leading to transcriptional changes and promoting cellular proliferation and differentiation. Traditionally, the role of myelin debris in regulating oligodendroglial dynamics has been investigated in the context of demyelination, where it is known to inhibit OPC proliferation and hinder their recruitment to lesion sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kotter et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Plemel et al. 2013</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibitory effect remain incompletely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Baer et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ji et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Molina-Gonzalez et al. 2023</xref>). Moreover, demyelination involves massive tissue damage, microglia activation and immune infiltration. Thus, signaling from damaged tissue and immune cells could potentially affect the OL population. Our findings support the idea that the deleterious impact of myelin debris is highly context-dependent, shaped by the health of OLs and signals from surrounding cellular environment. In contrast, in the absence of overt pathology, myelin may function as a trophic factor that enhances OL lineage progression.</p><p id="P59">Despite some insights, the extent to which OLs can internalize myelin and the underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Evidence suggests that OPCs may internalize myelin particles via phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Falcão et al. 2018</xref>). Similarly, Schwann cells, the myelinating cells of the peripheral nervous system, have been shown to internalize myelin following nerve injury through specific autophagy pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>). In the case of myelinating OLs, several studies have demonstrated that, under pathological and physiological conditions, they express several molecular components known to be involved in endocytic and phagocytic pathways. These include receptors such as low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), implicated in myelin uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Fernández-Castañeda et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gaultier et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lin et al. 2017</xref>); antigen presentation molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Falcão et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Zeis, Enz, and Schaeren-Wiemers 2015</xref>); and members of the tetraspanin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Terada et al. 2002</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that OLs not only have the capacity to internalize myelin debris but also to transport it retrogradely from their processes to the soma, where internalization is completed and degradation begins. This observation suggest the presence of a surface-based trafficking mechanism along their processes. Consistent with this, microvesicles interacting with microglia are known to exhibit directional motion along the external plasma membrane toward the soma, a process dependent on phosphatidylserine-mediated recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Prada et al. 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P60">Experimental models of demyelination often involve direct targeting and damage to OLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Blakemore and Franklin 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Lassmann and Bradl 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Torre-Fuentes et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Zirngibl et al. 2021</xref>), which inherently disrupts their function and may obscure broader roles. In response to injury, OPCs become activated, undergoing transcriptomic reprogramming to an immature state that promotes proliferation and migration by upregulation of immune-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Moyon et al. 2015</xref>). OLs also upregulate inflammatory mediators, stress response genes, anti-oxidant enzymes, cholesterol metabolism and growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hou et al. 2023</xref>). This signature largely overlaps with the disease-associated OLs recently reported in different neurodegenerative models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Pandey et al. 2022</xref>). Importantly, TREM2 deficiency in microglia impaired transcriptomic changes in disease associated OLs, suggesting that OL reprogramming is driven by microglial activation rather than by exposure to myelin debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hou et al. 2023</xref>). Our data shows that exposure to myelin debris, in the absence of an inflammatory insult, induces i) an opposite transcriptional signature in OLs characterized by a reduced expression of immune-related pathways and cholesterol biosynthesis and ii) an increase in OLs proliferation and differentiation. It is therefore possible that during demyelination pathological cues directly or indirectly influence OL behavior.</p><p id="P61">During CNS development, reduced expression of the cholesterol transporters Abca1 and Abcg1, transporters of cholesterol efflux to the extracellular space, is associated with the onset of active myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nelissen et al. 2011</xref>). Transcriptomic analysis also suggested predominant upregulation of the cholesterol-synthesis pathway in OLs during remyelination (Voskuhl, R.R et al., 2019; Berghoff, S.A et al., 2022). This downregulation facilitates cholesterol retention within the cell, essential for myelin synthesis. A similar regulatory pattern emerges under demyelinating conditions, wherein neurons upregulate cholesterol synthesis, while OLs downregulate <italic>Abca1</italic> and <italic>Abcg1</italic> expression to minimize cholesterol efflux and prioritize lipid availability for remyelination (S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Berghoff et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Meffre et al. 2015</xref>). Consistent with these observations, our findings demonstrate that when OLs are exposed to myelin debris, they adopt a lipid-conserving phenotype that promotes cholesterol retention and supports myelin synthesis. Similarly, lipid droplets, that regulate lipid intermediates necessary for myelin synthesis during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hayashi and Su 2007</xref>), are increased after myelin exposure. This adaptive response mirrors the molecular mechanisms observed during developmental myelination, suggesting a conserved strategy for optimizing lipid utilization.</p><p id="P62">While this study did not aim to dissect the molecular mechanisms through which myelin promotes OL proliferation and differentiation, this remains a key area for future research. Based on its lipid-rich composition and previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Asadollahi et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Ramos-Cabrer et al. 2025</xref>), OLs could be using myelin to buffer energetic stress. Although β-oxidation capacity of OLs is considered limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Fünfschilling et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Rao et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Tepavčevic 2021</xref>), there is evidence that suggests it is still functionally active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hofmann et al. 2017</xref>). Importantly, in contrast to previous studies, our experimental paradigm did not restrict glucose availability. Therefore, the observed effects are unlikely to be driven by a metabolic shift away from their preferentially glycolytic activity, but rather as a response to excess lipid availability. Additionally, both lipids and proteins in myelin are known to exert signaling functions. Lipid receptors such as CPT1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Tang et al. 2022</xref>), sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Jaillard et al. 2005</xref>) or Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Nogaroli et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Yung et al. 2015</xref>) play essential roles in regulating lipid homeostasis and myelination. These pathways may be activated upon myelin internalization and could contribute to the observed proliferative and morphological responses in OLs.</p><p id="P63">In conclusion, our findings identify that OLs can internalize and respond to myelin debris, suggesting that myelin debris itself is not intrinsically hindering the progression of the oligodendroglial lineage. Rather, detrimental effects associated with myelin debris may stem from concomitant OL damage. These results underscore the critical role of OL integrity during pathology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS207530-supplement-Supplementary_figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d77aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S31"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by Spanish Ministry of Education and Science (PID2019-109724RB-I00, PID2022-143020OB-I00 and PID2022-138276OB-I00), Basque Government (IT1551-22) and CIBERNED (CB06/05/00 76).
