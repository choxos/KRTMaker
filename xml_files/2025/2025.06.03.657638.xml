In this study, we rigorously evaluate the performance of a recently developed RFID system (iID®BEEscience from MicroSensys) in tracking bees under different conditions. We assessed the system’s accuracy in detecting and identifying travel direction both in controlled laboratory settings and with free-flying bees. Additionally, we analysed the sources of incorrect or redundant readings and provide a Python script designed to filter out erroneous data, summarising the results in biologically relevant measurements (foraging trip number, trip duration, instances of drifting). Our controlled laboratory tests revealed that the RFID system’s accuracy ranged from 93% to 100% in most cases, though accuracy diminished when a large number of transponders passed through the reader simultaneously. We also found certain transponder positions in relation to the reader position to be less reliable. In field conditions, we tracked 33 foraging trips of RFID-tagged honeybees trained to a sucrose solution feeder and observed a 100% success rate in identifying all foraging trips via the RFID data. Given that the transponders weigh only 2.1 mg, we propose that this system is a reliable tool for studying smaller bees (and other insects), which are currently understudied using RFID technology, although its application to species smaller than honeybees (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) requires further testing. This research demonstrates the potential of RFID technology for advancing the study of insect behaviour under field conditions beyond traditional models like honeybees or bumblebees.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RFID</kwd><kwd>Radiofrequency identification</kwd><kwd>ilD®BEE</kwd><kwd>Microsensys</kwd><kwd>insect tracking</kwd><kwd>honeybee</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is a useful tool in studying animal behaviour, particularly in social insects such as the European honeybee (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>), where it facilitates the tracking of individual behaviour and colony dynamics. Up until the early 2000s, researchers relied primarily on direct observations and video recordings to study social insect behaviour, identifying individuals using number tags or paint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">von Frisch, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Seeley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Nunes-Silva <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). These methods are labour-intensive and limited by the need for individuals to be visually distinguishable. More recent methods, such as RFID and QR (Quick Response) code technology overcome these issues by allowing the simultaneous recording of multiple individuals, as well as the unlimited number of identification codes and greatly expanded sampling times allowing the collection of a greater volume of data (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Nunes-Silva <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). The ability of RFID technology to be constantly active also improves detection of rare events, such as honeybee drifting behaviour, as these may be missed by the limited sampling time of direct observations. However, whilst visual obstructions in the form of hive residue and conspecifics may obscure QR tags from view and prevent data recording, RFID radio signals can pass through substances such as glue, wood, and plastic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Decourtye <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), making them a better alternative to study certain questions. However, RFID technology is costly compared to direct observations, detection errors are common, and RFID technology has a limited ability to record other aspects of bee behaviour such as resource transport. Whilst the latter can be resolved using supplementary video recordings of individual honeybee behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Stelzer <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), its high cost may make RFID inaccessible to less well-funded studies.</p><p id="P3">The number of studies utilizing this technology is extensive, spanning a wide range of species and research questions. It has facilitated studies of rodent social behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Howerton, Garner &amp; Mench, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Sabol, Solomon &amp; Dantzer, 2018</xref>), hummingbird foraging behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bandivadekar <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>), and marine crustacean burrow-emergence rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aguzzi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), as well as studies seeking to improve livestock management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Brown-Brandl &amp; Eigenberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Maselyne <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). In social insects, developments in RFID technology have been especially valuable for research on honeybee foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Schneider <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Feltham, Park &amp; Goulson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Colin <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), homing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Pahl <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), and mating behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ayup <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Heidinger <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). It has also helped to further elucidate the mechanisms behind intraspecific reproductive parasitism in large-bodied stingless bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Van Oystaeyen <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>), and their long-distance flight and homing behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Nunes-Silva <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Costa <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), as well as conopid fly parasitism in bumblebee foragers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Malfi <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). However, whilst there is a large amount of research on corbiculate bees (family <italic>Apinae</italic>), RFID studies targeting other social <italic>Hymenoptera,</italic> such as wasps and ants, remain sparse, with only a few studies investigating decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Robinson <italic>et al</italic>., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Robinson <italic>et al</italic>., 2009b</xref>) and task allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Robinson, Feinerman &amp; Franks, 2009</xref>) in rock ant (<italic>Tempothorax albipennis</italic>) colonies, drifting in the paper wasp <italic>Polistes canadensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Sumner <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), and forager longevity in common wasps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Santoro, Hartley &amp; Lester, 2019</xref>). This may be partly due to the large relative size and weight of many RFID tags limiting their use in smaller insects by potentially impacting a variety of life-history traits and reducing the reliability of acquired data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Batsleer <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Building on this extensive use of RFID technology in social insects, the present study aims to assess the performance and accuracy of an RFID system recently developed by Microsensys (Microsensys, n.d.) designed to detect passive RFID transponders (mic3®Q1.6 model) weighing just 2.1 mg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) with the aim of improving honeybee behavioural research, and enabling further research in smaller social insects and central-place foragers under field conditions, including many smaller bees (e.g. many stingless bees and solitary bees), wasps and ants. Notably, this system possesses a reader containing two antennae, allowing detection of direction using a single reader, and eliminating the need for multiple readers as in older systems (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Tenczar <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). The primary objective of our study was to evaluate the RFID system’s performance under controlled laboratory and field conditions and to identify potential sources of error that may impact data integrity. By examining factors that could affect system accuracy, we tried to understand the system’s optimal operating conditions and limitations. This involved testing for reductions in system accuracy caused by each variable, including the Multiple Protocol Command (MPC) cycle (interval in which the system reads and logs the signals received by the antennas) length, transponder speed, orientation, and position relative to the reader, and the effect of varying the distance between two readers, as the manufacturers guide specifies maintaining a minimum of 150cm between two readers. Other factors including the number of transponders simultaneously pulled through the reader, the individual reader used, the effect of water, and the addition of visual tags and acrylic paint have also been tested. A preliminary aim of our study was to investigate the origin of ‘additional readings’ in the data output file, which potentially reduced data usefulness and reliability. To explain this phenomenon, we propose 3 types of errors—Type A, B, and C—and have formulated hypotheses to test these ideas.</p><p id="P5">These analyses will evaluate the suitability of the Microsensys mic3®Q1.6 RFID system for studying bee behaviour and will facilitate further investigation into the behaviour of honeybees and other central-place foragers. We will discuss the causes behind ‘additional readings’ and evaluate the system’s functionality under laboratory conditions. Additionally, a field test of the system is conducted. Finally, we provide a Python script designed to clean and pre-process the data generated by the system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/BristolBeeGroup/BeeDrifting">https://github.com/BristolBeeGroup/BeeDrifting</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methodology</title><sec id="S3"><label>(a)</label><title>Apparatus</title><p id="P6">Our study analysed the performance of a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system manufactured by Microsensys. The transponders used were passive RFID transponders of the model Mini-Transponder mic3®Q1.6, measuring 1.6 x 1.6 x 0.4 mm<sup>3</sup> with an average mass of 2.1mg. These transponders operate through activation by an electromagnetic field generated by the fixed RFID reader, which powers the transponder, enabling it to transmit data back to the reader for recording. The model of reader used was the iID®science reader device AEB-03.C2D, measuring 101 x 55 x 30mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Data management and storage were handled by the IID®controller, model CCO-01DC, with 1GB of RAM and 2 antenna outputs, facilitating directional measurements. Data were stored using the BeeID storage software on 16GB USB drives, and power was supplied to the controller from the mains through a 12V power cord, and a PCAN cable and PCAN T-connector connected the iID®BEE controller to the reading devices. In addition to the RFID system, standard number tags (used for queen marking) with an average mass of 1.66mg were used, as well as dead bees obtained ethically from controlled test hives during scheduled observation. In later trials, painting the RFID tags resulted in an average mass of 2.28mg.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>(b)</label><title>Experimental setup</title><p id="P7">We conducted the laboratory components of this study over 14 days under constant laboratory conditions, with the iID®science readers positioned 160cm apart on a laboratory bench (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), exceeding the minimum distance of 150cm suggested by the manufacturers. The IID®controller was positioned equidistant between the readers, which were oriented in an upright position unless specific tests required variations in transponder placement. Field tests with free-flying bees took place between the 13th and 15th August 2024, during which conditions averaged 20°C and sunny.</p><p id="P8">Data collection settings were standardized to maintain consistency across experiments. Each experiment utilized a 15-second MPC (Multiple Protocol Command) cycle to control for potential variation in accuracy and to minimise the number of additional readings obtained (see section c). Data were recorded in comma-separated file format (CSV), facilitating ease of analysis and compatibility with statistical software packages. Additionally, a daily schedule of controller activity between 04:00 and 00:00 was set up to minimize disruption due to system resetting. For a detailed list of settings, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>(c)</label><title>Analysis of additional reading errors</title><p id="P9">A key feature of an accurate RFID system is its ability to classify the direction of a transponder’s movement (e.g., an arriving or departing bee). In preliminary tests, when we simulated ‘foraging trips’ by moving transponders in both directions, we observed that the IID® controller not only identified “arriving” and “departing” movements but also classified some as “unknown” in the CSV file. In addition, we found instances where 2 arrivals or 2 departures were reported in very short sequence. Understanding these instances is important to make full use of the collected data.</p><p id="P10">The IID®controller records data in a cyclical manner defined by the MPC cycle length, specified in the BeeID software, grouping all data collected within this period into a single point recorded in the csv file. This cyclic nature can result in additional readings being recorded exactly one cycle length after (type A error) or before (type B error) an accurate transponder reading. These additional readings pose an issue to the usefulness of the data, and understanding their origin is essential for correctly addressing these errors.</p><p id="P11">Based on preliminary observations, the following mechanisms for the origin of additional readings have been proposed. These additional readings appeared to occur during the transition between one cycle ending and another beginning while the transponder was still within range of one or both reader antennae. In such cases, additional readings often appeared as ‘unknown’ in the csv file when recorded by only one antenna or appear directional (2 “arriving” or “departing” in short sequence) if recorded by both. To give an accurate reading with no additional readings, the transponder must fully pass through and out of the ranges of both antennae during one cycle duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref> shows an example of an “arriving” transponder movement). Type A errors occurred when the cycles turnover whilst the transponder is still in range of the second antenna, generating an ‘unknown’ reading exactly one cycle duration after the directional reading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). Type B errors occurred when the cycles turnover whilst the transponder is only within range of the first antenna and has not yet entered the range of the second antenna, giving an ‘unknown’ reading exactly one cycle duration before the directional reading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>). We also observed occasions when the cycles turn over whilst the transponder is in range of both antennae, giving a second directional reading and generating a type C error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>). In this case, we suggest the first value should be considered correct. Whilst <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> shows only ‘arriving’ errors, these errors also occur for ‘departing’ transponders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To investigate whether these ideas are likely correct, the following predictions have been set out: <list list-type="simple" id="L1"><list-item><label>1)</label><p id="P13">When the length of the MPC cycle is reduced, the overall number of additional readings will increase proportionally due to an increased likelihood of the cycles transitioning whilst the transponder is in range of the reader.</p></list-item><list-item><label>2)</label><p id="P14">There will be an equal number of type A and type B errors since the cycle is equally likely to transition on either side of the reader.</p></list-item><list-item><label>3)</label><p id="P15">For type A errors, the ‘unknown’ additional reading will correspond to the antenna encountered secondarily during movement through the reader. For type B errors, it will correspond to the antenna encountered first (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="P16">To test these hypotheses, we analysed the type (A, B and C) and frequency of additional readings under varying MPC cycle lengths (5 sec, 10 sec, 15 sec, 30 sec). We placed a single RFID transponder upright on a 3mm-high ‘foam bee’ strip constructed from stacked 1.5mm craft foam sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), secured it with nail varnish, and pulled it through the reader by hand at ~30mm/s by timing 1.8 seconds on a stopwatch. This setup mimics the average walking speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Nouvian and Galizia, 2019</xref>) and height (measured from dead workers) of honeybees, ensuring realistic testing conditions and controlling for distance from the sensor and speed of drag. The actual time of movement was noted, allowing comparison with the recorded RFID data. Observer bias was controlled for by covering the controller display so the investigator could not see the detection outcome. The direction of pulls was alternated to facilitate efficient data analysis, with a 65-second gap between each pull to ensure data points were categorized into distinct cycles.</p><p id="P17">Data were analysed using the software R (v4.2.1). For prediction 1, the 15-second MPC cycle was considered a reference group and used to calculate the expected proportions of additional readings for the 5, 10, and 30-second cycles (25%, 12.5%, and 4.167% respectively). A chi-squared test was used to test for significant differences between actual and expected proportions of additional readings for each MPC cycle. For prediction 2, a chi-squared test was used to test for differences in the proportion of type A and type B errors within each MPC cycle. For prediction 3, the antenna recording each type A and type B error was identified and compared to the expected antenna based on our hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The proportion of matching data points was then calculated.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>(d)</label><title>Testing system accuracy</title><p id="P18">To assess the accuracy of the RFID system under various conditions, we designed a series of tests to identify and quantify potential sources of error and inform efforts to improve its accuracy. The dependent variable in all tests was the accuracy rate of the RFID system, defined as the percentage of movements of the RFID transponder through the reader whose time and direction were correctly recorded without erroneous additional readings. Erroneous additional readings are type A, B, or C errors as described in section c, but which show an incorrect direction. For example, for a departure from the hive, a type A, B, or C error may show either ‘unknown’ or ‘departing’, whereas an erroneous additional reading would read ‘arriving’. Additionally, if a transponder movement was not recorded at all, or a movement was recorded when there had not been one, these were also classed as errors. Type A, B, and C ‘errors’ were excluded from the analysis of accuracy as they are independent of system accuracy, instead relating to the cyclic nature of the system (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S5">section 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P19">As with the tests for additional readings, we placed a single RFID transponder upright on a 3mm-high ‘foam bee’ strip constructed from stacked 1.5mm craft foam sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), secured it with nail varnish, and pulled it through the reader by hand at ~30mm/s by timing 1.8 seconds on a stopwatch. The actual time of movement was noted, allowing comparison with the recorded RFID data and identification of inaccurate data points. In addition to the ‘foam bee’ strip used for the majority of tests, some tests necessitated the use of a ‘dead bee’ strip to control for any impact of honeybee physiochemistry. This involved a dead honeybee being secured to a foam strip of 1.5mm height and 31mm width using nail varnish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Whilst these strips were suitable for Tests 1-4 and 6-12, <bold>Test 5</bold> required the creation of 13mm-wide strips to assess the effects of side position in the reader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p id="P20">The following ‘default conditions’ were utilised across all tests to ensure consistency: a 15-second MPC cycle, providing the greatest accuracy whilst minimising the time spent collecting data; the speed of transponder movement maintained at approximately 30mm/s by pulling it through the reader by hand, timing 1.8 seconds on a stopwatch; 60 reads for each test (30 arrivals and 30 departures); a time interval of 65 seconds between each read to prevent their grouping into the same MPC cycle; consistent transponder placement using the ‘foam bee’ or ‘dead bee’ strips; consistent 12mm distance from the readers antennae; transponders in an upright position; nail varnish used to secure the transponders, mimicking real-world usage; controller display covered to minimise investigator bias. A detailed description of each test follows.</p><sec id="S7"><title>Test 1 - MPC cycles</title><p id="P21">To decide on which MPC cycle to use as a default, we analysed the effects of MPC cycle length (5 sec, 10 sec, 15 sec, 30 sec) on system accuracy.

To reproduce these speeds, a ‘pull-time’ of 5.5 and 1.1 seconds respectively was maintained across the reader. The accuracy of each test was then separately compared to the default speed of ~30mm/s, the average honeybee walking speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Nouvian and Galizia, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Test 4 - Transponder orientation</title><p id="P24">To test the effect of transponder orientation on the bee (upright, upside-down) on system accuracy, we secured a singular RFID transponder upside-down to a ‘foam bee’ strip using nail-varnish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9A</xref>).

To test the top of the primary reader, it was turned upside-down and kept level using strips of foam, and we pulled the ‘foam bee’ strip through at default speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11</xref>). To test the left side of the primary reader, it was oriented with the cable end facing downwards and was propped up with foam sheets, with a 13mm wide ‘foam bee’ strip pulled through. After highly anomalous results, this side was repeated with the reader positioned so the cord did not touch the lab bench, as it was believed that errors with antenna 2 were caused by the cable bending too far (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11B</xref>). To test the right side of the primary reader, it was oriented with the cable end facing upwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11C</xref>), again pulling the 13mm wide ‘foam bee’ strip through.

The hive contained a queen-right colony of <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> with ~3,000-4,000 worker bees. The IID®controller was positioned on a raised platform between the 2 readers and was plugged into the mains using the 12V power cord and extension lead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Figure 17B</xref>).

These were then plotted in a line graph of location against time, and direct focal observations were compared with RFID data to assess system accuracy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20" sec-type="results | discussion"><label>3</label><title>Results And Discussion</title><sec id="S21"><label>(a)</label><title>Additional readings</title><p id="P36">Overall, 5 second MPC cycles generated the highest proportion of additional readings (20%), followed by 10 (13.33%), 15 (8.33%), and 30 seconds (5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Figure 18</xref>).</p><p id="P37">Supporting our first hypothesis that the number of additional readings will increase proportionally as MPC cycle length is reduced, no significant difference was found between the actual and expected proportions of additional readings for cycles of 5 seconds (χ<sup>2</sup>=0.56, df=1, p=0.46), 10 seconds (χ<sup>2</sup>=0, df=1, p=1), or 30 seconds (χ<sup>2</sup>=0, df=1, p=1). This shows that the actual proportion of additional readings for the 5, 10, and 30 second cycles was not statistically different from the expected proportions of 25%, 12.50%, and 4.17% respectively, calculated proportionally based on data from the 15 second cycle. Supporting our second hypothesis that an equal number of Type A and B errors will be present, no significant difference was found between the proportion of type A and B errors in trials of MPC cycle length 5, 10, 15, or 30 seconds (χ<sup>2</sup>=0, df=1, p=1; χ<sup>2</sup>=0, df=1, p=1; χ<sup>2</sup>=0, df=1, p=1; χ<sup>2</sup>=1.37, df=1, p=0.24). Supporting our third hypothesis that each ‘unknown’ additional reading corresponds to specific antennas based on the type of error which has occurred, 100% of unknown additional readings (n=27) matched the expected antenna as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p id="P38">These results provide strong evidence backing up our proposed origin of additional readings generated by this system. Therefore, these ‘unknown’ or duplicate data points found in the csv file likely do not correspond to an actual transponder movement but are instead an artefact of the MPC cycle. Importantly, we can now interpret these additional readings and, thereby, increase data quality. For the following analysis of the trials of 60 data points, these additional readings were removed by hand. However, this method is not feasible regarding large scale data collection. Further, consistent discrepancies between the actual and recorded time of movement were observed, with the recorded time on average 120 seconds after the actual movement.

Whilst this may instead be caused by the 90° orientation of the transponder rather than position in the reader, the outcome is the same, and experimenters should take care to determine whether this must be controlled for their experiment, dependent on the frequency of honeybees travelling on the side wall.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Test 6 - Effectiveness of the second reader</title><p id="P56">No significant difference was observed between reader 1 and reader 2 for either ‘foam bee’ strips (χ<sup>2</sup>&lt;0.0001, df=1, p=1), or ‘dead bee’ strips (χ<sup>2</sup>&lt;0.0001, df=1, p=1), suggesting low variation between the 2 readers.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Test 7 - Distance from reader</title><p id="P57">No significant difference was observed between the 12mm reference and 9mm or 15mm (χ<sup>2</sup>&lt;0.0001, df=1, p=1; χ<sup>2</sup>&lt;0.0001, df=1, p=1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F22">Figure 22</xref>).

Towards the start of the observation period, foraging trips were less frequent but lasted for longer, potentially owing to the need for ‘waggle dancing’ to recruit more honeybees to the feeder. As more honeybees were recruited to the feeder, the length of foraging trips decreased, and the frequency increased. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F24">Figure 24</xref> shows all the observed foraging trips and visits to the colony recorded within the timeframe, collected by a human observer and the RFID system respectively.</p><p id="P64">For the honeybee tagged with a white and purple RFID transponder, a total of 13 observed foraging trips was recorded by the observer at the feeder. Correspondingly, the RFID system logged 13 departures and 13 arrivals at the colony, demonstrating full alignment with the direct observations. Similarly, a bee tagged with a white transponder completed 9 foraging trips, and an individual possessing an RFID transponder with a visual tag completed 11 foraging trips based on visual observations at the feeder, all of which were perfectly matched by RFID data. In all cases, the RFID system exhibited 100% efficiency in tracking the bees’ movements, with every departure and arrival detected. Based on this data, the system performed near perfectly, with RFID readings between foraging trips showing the honeybees returning to the colony, as would be expected. The only limitations of the RFID system presented as occasional ‘unknown’ errors rather than a directional movement. However, these can be interpreted correctly using our Python script (see above). No other technical difficulties arose from the use of the RFID system in combination with the observation hive.</p><p id="P65">However, the application of RFID transponders posed a challenge. Of the 18 RFID transponders attached to individual honeybees for this test (9 with number tags and 9 painted), only 3 (all painted) were later observed during the period of observation, 5 days after application of the numbered RFID transponders, and only 24 hours after application of the painted RFID transponders. Tagged foragers were observed attempting to remove their transponders immediately after tagging, and upon returning to their hive, other colony members were seen assisting them in tag removal. Potential solutions to this issue include tagging the bees shortly after hatching and re-introducing them to their home colony coated in sugar water as an appeasement, in addition to applying smoke to calm the bees, wearing fresh gloves during tagging to reduce the impact of non-colony chemicals, and housing the tagged bees in a container partially joined to the hive to allow transfer of pheromones and acclimation. Such strategies are more difficult to impose on tagged foragers. Another possibility is to house the RFID transponders in a small container with a mesh lid, inside the colony prior to application, to allow transfer of colony-specific odours onto the transponder. Future efforts to tag honeybees with individually identifiable RFID transponders should use the strategies outlined above when introducing tagged bees to a colony. They should also use painted RFID transponders rather than RFID transponders with visual tags, as the former are more secure once attached, and offer the same service of identification.</p><p id="P66">Our successful use of this new RFID system for tracking honeybee foraging behaviour not only shows its promise when monitoring honeybee behavioural dynamics but also opens up new possibilities for researching a wide range of behaviours in other central-place foragers as small as ~20mg due to the low mass (2.1mg) of the mic3®Q1.6 transponders. This will help to address the gap in the literature regarding the use of RFID technology to investigate behaviour in a wider range of <italic>Hymenoptera</italic>. By utilizing this RFID system to study the behaviour of smaller wasp and bee species, as well as larger ants, researchers can produce results which are not achievable using alternative methods such as direct observation, as RFID overcomes the issues of low sampling volume, visibility constraints, and limited observation times, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of behavioural patterns in these species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S36"><label>5</label><title>Summary</title><p id="P67">Our study explored the efficacy of using an RFID tracking system for monitoring honeybee movements into and out of the hive. We confirmed that longer MPC cycles lead to a lower number of additional readings, though this was not significant, and a 15 second cycle length was suggested as optimal for our purposes. We investigated the cause behind additional readings, confirming that these do not represent actual transponder movements but are artifacts of how the system records transponder detections. Rules for a Python script have been proposed to automatically correct these errors for large-scale data collection, as well as correcting a time discrepancy, predictable ‘unknown’ errors, and identifying ‘drifters’. We investigated factors affecting the accuracy of the system, discovering that on the whole, the system has a high accuracy, yet the orientation of the transponder (upside-down) on the honeybee and its position in the reader (left and right walls) can significantly reduce accuracy. Additionally, the reader entrance tunnel must be restricted to 15mm height, otherwise a reduction in accuracy is observed. Other variables, such as honeybee physiochemistry, transponder speed, reader distance, environmental factors (e.g., water exposure), and the application of acrylic paint or a visual tag, had little or no impact on accuracy. Multiple transponders simultaneously passing through the reader only affected accuracy when the number exceeded 5, which is unlikely in most real-world scenarios. The RFID system performed without errors in field conditions, but the primary challenge was maintaining the attachment of RFID transponders to the honeybees, which often removed their transponders, or had them removed by colony members. This was particularly prominent when using RFID transponders with visual number tags. Painted RFID transponders showed better retention and are recommended for future studies in honeybees. These findings propose optimal RFID system parameters and ways of improving tag application methods to ensure reliable data collection in future honeybee behavioural studies. Further, we propose the use of this system to investigate the behaviour of central-place foragers as small as ~20mg which were previously understudied using RFID.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S37"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>J.M. and C.G. were funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) (grant: BB/W001977/1).
