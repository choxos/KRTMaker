However, how these behaviors shift at the single-cell level remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Mtb adapts to acidic conditions by increasing the proportion of bacteria in a growth-arrested state, rather than uniformly slowing the growth rate of the entire population. This non-growing subpopulation exhibits greater tolerance to ethambutol. Clinical strains displayed higher proportions of growth-arrested cells under both neutral and acidic conditions, suggesting that growth arrest serves as a bet-hedging strategy during infection. Though the PhoPR two-component system contributes to regulating this non-growing state, we show that it is a partial regulator of the non-growing bacterial subpopulation and that additional transcriptional regulators are involved. Our study demonstrates that non-growing subpopulations of Mtb provide fitness benefits and are an active adaptation to environmental cues and not a passive consequence of stressors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Tuberculosis (TB), caused by infection with the bacterium <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), requires a lengthy multi-drug regimen to cure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). One of the key challenges in TB treatment is the complex biology of Mtb bacilli, with heterogeneity in Mtb cell state thought to be a major driver of treatment failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). During infection, Mtb encounters diverse conditions and environmental cues, including acidic pH in the phagosome, lipid-rich environments, and exposure to reactive oxygen species and other immune defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). As the resident bacteria adapt to this range of conditions, some cells’ growth and metabolic states change, generating phenotypically distinct subpopulations that may survive evading immune clearance and drug killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Understanding how drug-tolerant subpopulations of Mtb form in host microenvironments is therefore crucial for improving TB treatment strategies.</p><p id="P3">One of the earliest stressors Mtb encounters during infection is the acidic pH of the macrophage phagosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Before immune activation in macrophages, Mtb inhibits the formation of the phagolysosome and resides in a mildly acidic environment (~pH 6.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Mtb adapts to this mildly acidic stress through gene regulation and metabolic shifts that lead to bulk-level growth slowing or growth arrest, which allows Mtb to persist within a host environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Although these population-level studies provide insights into Mtb’s metabolic plasticity, most studies examine growth rate or growth arrest through bulk measurements, such as optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) and colony-forming unit (CFU) assays. We therefore lack an understanding of Mtb growth behaviors and changes at the single-cell level during adaptation to host-relevant growth conditions.</p><p id="P4">Recent advances in single-cell imaging techniques have revealed substantial heterogeneity in mycobacterial growth dynamics, with individual cells exhibiting variations in growth rates, cell cycle timing, and cell size which can affect drug susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). We examined whether growth slowing at acidic pH is uniform across the population or whether there is cell-to-cell variation in growth response. We hypothesized that variability in single-cell responses may be a source of heterogeneity that contributes to such growth slowing and pH adaptation, leading to persistence. Our study revealed that, rather than uniformly slowing growth, Mtb exhibits a bimodal response in which a subset of cells continues to grow at the same rate while another subset converts to a non-growing state. Clinical strains were particularly prone to enter a growth-arrested state. We find that non-growing states are present even in rich, neutral growth conditions, suggesting that Mtb growth arrest is a typical bacterial state and is not due to resource limitations. We challenged Mtb with antibiotic stress and observed that non-growing cells exhibit increased tolerance to the cell wall-targeting antibiotic ethambutol. We identified several regulators involved in modulating this growth behavior under acidic pH conditions, including the two-component system PhoPR, which we also demonstrated is a contributor to growth-arrest-mediated ethambutol tolerance. Our findings suggest that Mtb employs a bet-hedging strategy by changing the proportion of bacteria in a growth-arrested state, with consequences for antibiotic treatment outcome.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Growth arrest is the dominant Mtb cell growth state during adaptation to acidic conditions</title><p id="P5">Many mycobacterial species, including <italic>M. avium, M. chelonae, M. marinum, M. scrofulaceum</italic>, and <italic>M. fortuitum</italic>, grow without restriction under mildly acidic conditions (~pH 6.0), and some even grow better at acidic compared to neutral pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). In contrast, Mtb slows its bulk growth rate in response to an acidic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). A simple explanation for the occurrence of growth slowing is that individual cells reduce their growth rates in a uniform manner.</p><p id="P6">Observations of heterogeneity in mycobacterial growth and metabolic states <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> led us to speculate that Mtb cells may not uniformly slow their growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). To measure growth changes in single cells as Mtb adapts to acidic pH conditions, we adapted two commonly studied Mtb strains (CDC1551 and H37Rv) and four recently isolated strains of Mtb to pH 5.9 or pH 7.0 conditions for one or four days (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Materials and Methods</xref>). To identify actively growing cells after different adaptation times, we labeled sites of nascent peptidoglycan within the Mtb cell wall with the fluorescent D-amino acid (FDAA), RADA, in the last 6 hours of the adaptation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The cells were labeled for 6 hours, approximately one-third of the average doubling time, to avoid overcounting growing cells by including those that divide during FDAA treatment. Because mycobacteria elongate from the poles, we can analyze the polar staining patterns of the FDAA to measure growth from each pole over the 6-hour staining period. Consistent with prior studies demonstrating growth heterogeneity in Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), we observed variation in the length of the stained polar regions. Specifically, we observed that a large proportion of cells lacked detectable FDAA incorporation, suggesting these cells were entirely non-growing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). After 4 days of acidic adaptation, the proportion of this non-growing subpopulation among all six strains was 80-95%, whereas the proportion was 34-82% in neutral conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The bacilli in the non-growing subpopulation were viable, as we observed no difference in survival between Mtb adapted to the acidic or neutral conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>, p-value = 0.21). These data suggest that even in “fast-growing” conditions, there is a non-negligible subpopulation of non-growing Mtb cells. The proportion of non-growing cells is higher at pH 5.9 than at pH 7.0 for both days of adaptation for all the strains. For example, 59% ± 4.2% of CDC1551 Mtb cells in the neutral condition were growing at day 4, compared with 20% ± 0.2% in the acidic condition (T-test and Benjamini-Hochberg correction p-value = 0.047). Additionally, we observed that the proportion of non-growing cells increased in a pH-dependent manner as shown by comparisons between pH 7.0, 6.2, and 5.9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). The pattern was clearer at day 1 compared to day 4, likely reflecting differences in bacterial growth phase among the different pH conditions, as cells at neutral pH may have begun entering stationary phase by day 4. We observed a higher proportion of non-growing cells at both pH levels in the clinical isolates compared to the two strains commonly studied in labs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). This may suggest that having a higher propensity for growth arrest is beneficial for Mtb during infection.</p><p id="P7">Next, we complemented our fixed-cell imaging assay with a time-lapse pulse-chase imaging experiment to observe the dynamics of the growth adaptation over 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). We pre-labeled Mtb (CDC1551 strain) with a FDAA (HADA) for one day prior to loading the cells into a microfluidic imaging device with neutral or acidic growth media. We used HADA for the time-lapse imaging because a higher concentration (100 µM) of FDAA was needed to ensure that the whole cell body of each single cell was labeled without disturbing Mtb growth and we found that such a high concentration of RADA disrupted cell elongation. We directly observed growth dynamics by measuring the extension of the cell poles as they elongated with the new (HADA-negative region) growth occurring after the movie started (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, right). We categorized cells tracked over time into three groups based on growth trajectories: “growing,” “non-growing,” and “converted to non-growing” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref> upper right). In both neutral and acidic environments, we confirmed that a proportion of cells slowed growth and entered a non-growing state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, left). Among cells adapted to pH 7.0 (n = 308), 6% were entirely non-growing (n = 17), whereas 14% converted to non-growing (n = 43) during adaptation. These proportions were higher among the cells adapted to pH 5.9 (n = 230), 11% (n = 26) and 30% (n = 69), respectively (Pearson’s Chi-squared test p-value = 2.27x10<sup>-7</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, left). Though these proportions do not precisely match the quantities observed by fixed-cell imaging, likely due to differences in assay conditions and methods of growth quantification (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Discussion</xref>), they recapitulate the trends in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>. The time-lapse and fixed-cell imaging data demonstrate that even in growth-permissive conditions, a fraction of the non-growing population exists, and the proportion of this non-growing subpopulation is higher in an acidic environment.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The bulk growth slowdown during acidic pH adaptation is caused by an increase in the proportion of a growth-arrested cell subpopulation</title><p id="P8">Consistent with previous studies, we observed that Mtb growth slows at the population level during adaptation to an acidic environment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). These data suggest a null model in which the growth of single cells uniformly slows during acidic adaptation, leading to an overall lower average speed compared to growth under neutral conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, we observed that there was a growth-arrested cell subpopulation in both neutral and acidic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, B and D</xref>), suggesting an alternative model where bulk growth slowdown is caused by an increase in the proportion of cells in the growth-arrested state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To determine which model explains how Mtb adapts to acid stress, we analyzed single-cell growth rates from our time-lapse imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). We compared these experimental data to time-lapse imaging single-cell data that were simulated under the null model assumptions. According to the null model, we would expect that Mtb in the neutral condition grows at a fairly constant rate above 0 dL/h throughout the 5 days of adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, left). Instead, in our experimental data, we observed that even in the neutral condition some cells maintained a growth rate of ~0 dL/h throughout cell-tracking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, left), confirming that there is a subpopulation of non-growing cells and corroborating our conclusions from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. Cells adapting to the acidic condition did not slow their growth rate to above 0 dL/h as in the null model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, right, arrow); instead, many entered a completely non-growing state at ~0 dL/h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, right, arrow).</p><p id="P10">Additionally, Mtb adapting to acidic pH should slow their growth over the course of tracking time (x-axis), but the final rates should be above 0 dL/h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, right, arrow). In our experimental data of Mtb adapting to the acidic condition, we observed a subpopulation of cells that continued to grow at a rate similar to the growing cells in the neutral condition, regardless of cell age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, right). We confirmed this quantitatively, finding that there was no significant difference in growth speeds among cells that continued to grow in neutral and acidic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, right p = 0.12). These data suggest that Mtb adapts to acidic conditions in a bimodal manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>), with one subpopulation maintaining the same “fast” growth speed and one growth-arrested subpopulation that increases in abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Non-growing cells that are induced during acidic adaptation recover better from cell wall-targeting drug treatment</title><p id="P11">To understand whether the growth-arrested subpopulation was differentially susceptible to drug treatment, we measured the drug responses of Mtb adapted to neutral and acidic conditions across a range of antibiotic types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Mtb was adapted to either neutral or acidic conditions for four days, then subjected to antibiotic treatment for ten days. After drug removal by transferring the cell cultures onto agar supplemented with 0.4% charcoal (to inactivate antibiotics), the cells were allowed to recover for another ten days. Following recovery, bacterial survival via metabolic activity was assessed by measuring the fluorescence of resazurin. We measured dose responses for four drugs with different mechanisms of action: ethambutol and isoniazid (cell wall-acting drugs), rifampin (a transcription inhibitor), and linezolid (a translation inhibitor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>).</p><p id="P12">When Mtb were adapted to acidic conditions, they exhibited significantly lower susceptibility to ethambutol compared to when they were adapted to neutral conditions across all the strains tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). At 2 µg/ml ethambutol, all four strains in neutral conditions exhibited a drastic reduction in survival, with no recovery observed at 10 µg/ml. Significant differences were detected between neutral and acidic adaptation at both concentrations: at 2 µg/ml, p-values were 0.0006, 0.003, 8.8x10<sup>-5</sup>, and 0.001 for each strain, respectively; at 10 µg/ml, p-values were 0.05, 0.002, and 0.005, excluding the H37Rv strain, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). In contrast, acidic-adapted cells demonstrated robust recovery at 2 µg/ml ethambutol and maintained partial recovery even at 10 µg/ml, a concentration at which neutral-adapted strains failed to recover.</p><p id="P13">Across the Mtb strains, we did not observe consistent differences in susceptibility to isoniazid, rifampicin, or linezolid following acidic pH adaptations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4 and S5</xref>), in contrast to the uniform response seen with ethambutol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4 and S5</xref>). Rifampicin and linezolid are known to be effective against bacteria in non-replicating states; therefore, we did not expect that an increased proportion of growth-arrested (e.g., non-replicating) bacteria resulting from acidic adaptation would decrease susceptibility to these drugs. Acidic adaptation may not impact isoniazid treatment in the same way as ethambutol because acidic adaptation is thought to increase inhibition of the target of isoniazid, InhA, via PhoPR-dependent upregulation of NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), thereby increasing isoniazid susceptibility via a mechanism independent of growth arrest. These findings suggest that acidic adaptation enhances Mtb tolerance to ethambutol, but not isoniazid, rifampicin, or linezolid.</p><p id="P14">The resazurin assay reports bulk-level metabolic states as a measure of survival to drug treatment, these dose-response assays do not distinguish between the relative survival of cells that were in the growing versus the growth-arrested subpopulations. We hypothesized that ethambutol tolerance arises primarily from the non-growing cell subpopulation because ethambutol inhibits arabinogalactan synthesis, a process essential for cell wall elongation in actively growing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we conducted live-cell imaging to assess which cells (growing or non-growing) resumed growth after drug removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). To identify individual cells as growing or non-growing immediately preceding drug exposure, the CDC1551 WT strain was adapted to pH 5.9 for four days and labeled with HADA. Cells were then loaded into a microfluidic device for time-lapse imaging, where they were treated with a high ethambutol dose (245 µg/ml) for two days and allowed to recover for eight days in drug-free fresh media. This high ethambutol dose was required in live-cell imaging due to differences in environmental conditions compared to the fixed-cell assay, such as the continuous flow of fresh, nutrient-rich media through the cells and the high air permeability of the device (details in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We observed that non-growing cells formed during acidic adaptation predominantly contributed to recovery after the ethambutol treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Only 1% of previously growing cells resumed growth upon ethambutol removal (5 out of 736 cells), whereas 13% of the non-growing cells recovered (20 out of 152 cells) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Together, these data suggest that non-growing cells that arise after acidic adaptation have reduced ethambutol susceptibility.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>PhoPR is a partial regulator of growth and ethambutol tolerance in acidic adaptation</title><p id="P16">PhoPR is a two-component regulatory system and a key regulator of cellular adaptation to acidic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). We hypothesized that PhoPR controls the proportion of cells in the non-growing subpopulation and is therefore required for ethambutol tolerance attributed to growth arrest from adaptation to acidic conditions. To assess the extent to which PhoPR regulates growth arrest, we performed fixed-cell imaging using FDAA labeling in CDC1551 WT, <italic>phoPR</italic>-deleted mutant (Δ<italic>phoPR</italic>), and <italic>phoPR</italic>-complemented (<italic>phoPR</italic>*) strains at neutral (pH 7.0) and acidic conditions (pH 5.9 and 5.7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>).

However, at pH 5.7, <italic>phoPR</italic>-dependent non-growing cell formation was evident, with significantly fewer non-growing cells in the Δ<italic>phoPR</italic> strain than in WT and complemented strains (p-value 0.004 and 0.009, respectively). These data suggest that the PhoPR regulon is partially involved in increasing the proportion of the growth-arrested subpopulation at pH 5.7.</p><p id="P17">We examined the role of PhoPR in ethambutol tolerance under acidic conditions by comparing survival among the WT, Δ<italic>phoPR</italic> mutant, and <italic>phoPR*</italic> strains.

The two ethambutol doses were chosen to capture the dose where survival of acidic-adapted cells began to decrease, allowing for comparison of drug tolerance across strains. In the absence of ethambutol, a similar CFU/ml was observed among all strains. However, upon treatment with 24 µg/ml ethambutol, the Δ<italic>phoPR</italic> mutant exhibited significantly lower CFU counts than WT and <italic>phoPR*</italic> strains, suggesting that PhoPR contributes to the ethambutol tolerance observed in this context.

To identify other possible regulatory mechanisms involved in the transition to growth arrest and ethambutol tolerance under acidic conditions compared to neutral conditions, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on CDC1551 WT and two clinical isolates after four days of adaptation to neutral (pH 7.0) or acidic (pH 5.9) conditions. To determine pH-specific transcriptional changes common to all strains, we took the intersection of their differentially expressed genes and subjected them to pathway and gene regulatory program enrichment analysis. We found that PhoP-regulated genes were one of the most differentially expressed genes in acidic conditions across all tested strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, adjusted p-value = 3.1x10<sup>-3</sup>). However, there were other regulatory pathways that were also upregulated, suggesting that while PhoPR plays a key role, it may not be the sole master regulator of growth control in acidic environments. Specifically, other transcriptional programs that are known to modulate growth and division and were more enriched than the PhoP-regulated gene sets included MprAB-, WhiB4-, WhiB3-, MtrA-, TcrX-, and SigH-regulated pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Of note, the genes regulated by the MprAB two-component system were significantly upregulated at both day 1 and day 4 of adaptation (mean adjusted p-value = 1.3x10<sup>4</sup> and 1.83x10<sup>3</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). MprAB responds to pH and cell envelope stress and coordinates the expression of over 200 genes that control resistance to cell envelope damage and growth speed. The MprAB system may thus play a key role in generating a non-growing cell subpopulation in acidic conditions that is tolerant to ethambutol-induced cell wall damage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">The ability of Mtb to adapt to different environments during infection, including to acidic pH, is critical to Mtb survival in the host and to drug treatment, yet we lack an understanding of how individual cells adapt to these environments. Here, using single-cell approaches, we find that individual bacteria adapt to acidic pH conditions in a manner that could not be inferred from population-level measurement alone. Instead, we find that Mtb adapts to acidic pH not by uniformly slowing growth, but by increasing the proportion of cells in the non-growing subpopulation. We observed a significant proportion of non-growing cells not only under acidic pH conditions but also in adaptation to neutral conditions. These data suggest that non-growth is not a rare state but rather a common state for Mtb even in nutrient-rich conditions with limited environmental stress. The propensity to enter this non-growing state was higher in recently isolated clinical strains compared to those commonly studied in the laboratory. Clinical isolates have had fewer passages in laboratory growth conditions. Therefore, we expect that they would retain adaptations from the human host, which would contribute to the phenotypic plasticity. Mtb are known to enter non-growing states under severe stressors, such as hypoxia, or in lipid-rich conditions of the caseum. But our data demonstrate that there is an abundance of non-growing cells emerging after short adaptations even to rich, mild conditions in the laboratory, suggesting that a growth-arrested state may be more typical for Mtb than previously thought.</p><p id="P21">We found that the bulk slowed growth at acidic pH is due to an increased proportion of the non-growing cell subpopulation, not to slower single-cell growth rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, 2D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Correspondingly, cells that continued to grow throughout the experiment in the acidic condition maintained the same growth rate as those in the neutral condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). These data show that Mtb tunes its growth rate not by uniformly slowing or accelerating single-cell growth speeds but instead by tuning the proportion of growth-arrested cells in the population, i.e., cells do not slightly change their growth rates at the single-cell level but rather shift from a regular growth mode to a growth-arrested mode. Maintaining this heterogeneous population of cells likely provides a survival benefit in the face of various stressors (bet-hedging) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>).</p><p id="P22">We found that the growth-arrested subpopulation in the acidic condition was more tolerant to ethambutol treatment than the growing subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, B and D</xref>).

Isoniazid is a prodrug that is activated by the catalase-peroxidase KatG, producing isonicotinoyl radicals that bind NAD<sup>+</sup> to form isonicotinoyl-NAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Isonicotinoyl-NAD inhibits InhA, a key enzyme involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis, thereby compromising cell wall integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Under isoniazid pressure, Mtb downregulates genes encoding NADH dehydrogenase to limit NAD<sup>+</sup> production, reducing isonicotinoyl-NAD formation and thus mitigating InhA inhibition to promote survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). However, under acidic conditions, PhoPR regulation enhances NAD<sup>+</sup> production, which results in increased isonicotinoyl-NAD formation, increasing bacterial susceptibility to isoniazid through enhanced InhA inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). These findings underscore that drugs with similar targets, such as ethambutol and isoniazid, can yield distinct outcomes under host-relevant stress conditions due to differences in their activation pathways.</p><p id="P25">PhoPR is a master regulator of Mtb’s transcriptional response to acidic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>), but we found that it was only partially responsible for controlling the proportion of the non-growing cell subpopulation in response to pH fluctuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). To further explore additional regulatory systems beyond PhoPR, we examined transcriptional changes associated with acidic adaptation across three strains. The most significantly upregulated pathway between neutral and acidic conditions common to all strains tested was the ribosome biogenesis, potentially reflecting a compensatory mechanism to counteract reduced protein synthesis rates caused by acid stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). While PhoP-regulated genes were significantly differentially expressed, other regulators involved in sensing pH, altering growth and division, and resisting cell wall stress were more strongly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). For example, MprAB is known to respond to pH and controls the expression of genes that provide resistance against cell wall damage. The MtrAB two-component system is also known to play a crucial role in dormancy, cell division, cell wall metabolism, and modulating drug susceptibility and MtrA-regulated genes are significantly differentially expressed at acidic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). More comprehensive genetic analysis may find that MprAB, WhiB4, SigH, or other differentially expressed regulons play a larger role than PhoPR in generating the non-growing cell subpopulation. It may be that many transcriptional regulators are involved to provide redundancy and robustness to the acid stress response in Mtb. It is also likely that some regulators respond to multiple cues to integrate physiological responses; for example, Mce3R integrates cues from carbon sources and potassium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). Simultaneous integration of multiple environmental cues may allow Mtb to fine-tune its transcriptional response. Another explanation for why so many transcriptional regulators are involved in responding to acid stress could be that early and delayed responses requires different regulation. In support of this, genes regulated by the redox-dependent WhiB4 regulator are upregulated at day one but downregulated by day four (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>).</p><p id="P26">In addition to transcriptional regulation, carbon source availability can drive metabolic shifts that influence bulk slow growth or growth arrest under acidic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). For example, Mtb fully arrests growth at mildly acidic pH (pH 5.7) when provided with glucose, glycerol, or most TCA cycle intermediates as sole carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). In contrast, Mtb can maintain growth at pH 5.7 when utilizing alternative carbon sources such as cholesterol, acetate, and oxaloacetate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>).

The assay was performed using biological triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Sample preparation for RNA sequencing</title><p id="P46">Biological triplicates of CDC1551, V1, and V3 strains were used for RNA sequencing. When the cells were at mid-log phase (OD<sub>600</sub> 0.3-0.5) in the unbuffered media, the cells were back-diluted to OD<sub>600</sub> 0.05 in 10ml of buffered media (pH 7.0 or pH 5.9). The cells went through adaptation to each pH-adjusted medium, and the cells were then harvested by centrifugation at two different time points, after one or four days of adaptation. At each time point, GTC buffer was added to halt transcriptional response during RNA extraction, and the cells were washed twice. The cell pellets were resuspended in ~1ml of GTC buffer (4M GTC + 0.5% sarcosyl + 25 mM sodium citrate + 0.1M β-mercaptoethanol) and stored at -80°C at least overnight.</p><p id="P47">The RNA extraction protocol previously described was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>). On the day of extraction, the frozen GTC-treated pellets were thawed at 37ºC, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in prewarmed triazole, and transferred to 2ml O-ring tubes containing sterile 0.2 mm zirconia beads. The triazole mixture was then bead-beaten twice with an intensity of 6 meters per second for 45 seconds, followed by the addition of chloroform and vigorous shaking for one minute. The samples were then centrifuged, and the aqueous layer removed and placed in Qiagen RNeasy columns for RNA cleanup. Genomic DNA was removed from all samples by performing a DNase digest on the columns before elution in pre-warmed RNase-free water. The extracted RNA was then removed from the BSL-3 facility. Concentration and quality of RNA (260nm/280nm absorbance) were assessed using a nanodrop spectrophotometer; samples were then stored at -80°C until submission. Samples were submitted to the Microbial ‘Omics Core (MOCP) and Genomics Platform at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. QC, library preparation, ribodepletion, and paired-end sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 following a modified RNAtag-Seq method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>) was performed by the MOCP.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>RNA-seq data processing and analysis</title><p id="P48">Sequencing reads were aligned to the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> strain. Erdman = ATCC 35801 (RefSeq assembly accession: GCF_000350205.1) using Geneious Prime software (version 2023.2.1). The Geneious Prime software was used for the gene-level counts, and DESeq2 was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed in the acidic and neutral conditions. To identify acidic condition-responsive genes that were similarly differentially expressed across each strain, the up- and down-regulated gene lists were filtered by the criterion p &lt; 0.05. Genes that were significantly differentially expressed and were regulated in the same direction (up or down) between all three strains were submitted for pathway and gene regulator enrichment analysis. To quantify enrichment p-values, a Fisher’s exact test was performed in R using fisher.test and a custom pathway and gene regulator annotation file that was curated through literature searches.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary
