Pulmonary microenvironment during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection is largely governed by lung resident macrophages, initiating innate and subsequent adaptive immune responses. We investigated the role of PKCÎ´ in macrophages using a macrophage-specific PKCÎ´ knockout mice model (LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup>). PKCÎ´ deficiency in macrophages triggers an early lymphocytic immune response, increases neutrophil recruitment, and reduces inflammatory macrophages in the lungs, leading to higher <italic>Mtb</italic> burden and exacerbated pathology. Experimental and omics analysis further revealed that dysregulation of antimicrobial effector functions is detrimental to macrophageâs ability to restrict bacterial growth <italic>in vitro</italic>. Importantly this defect was mitigated by exogenous GM-CSF supplementation and/or overexpressing PKCÎ´ in macrophages. Thus, PKCÎ´ plays a crucial role in immune modulation during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection with GM-CSF amongst several downstream pathways through which PKCÎ´ exerts its regulatory effects.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Teaser</title><p id="P2">PKCÎ´ is crucial for immune modulation during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection revealing macrophages as a potential axis of signaling.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S2" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health concern worldwide, despite significant advances in treatment and prevention strategies. Reduced access to TB diagnosis and treatment due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a steep increase in TB deaths, according to the Global Tuberculosis Report 2023(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). However, the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains, limited vaccine efficacy of BCG, prolonged TB treatment regimens, and socio-economic challenges persist as significant factors for failure of TB control(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Genetic resistance and phenotypical tolerance of the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) pathogen against antimycobacterial underscores an urgency to develop adjunctive anti-TB therapies to mitigate the pulmonary pathology caused by TB disease(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Exploiting host-pathogen interplay by an alternative approach, host-directed therapies (HDT) have been a widely studied strategy in the field of TB research(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). These studies showed improved efficacy for bacterial killing, strengthening innate and memory responses, disrupting the structural integrity of TB granuloma, and modulating inflammatory responses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Hence, identifying potential HDT targets and understanding their involvement in key immune responses during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection is a foundational step toward a comprehensive understanding of the innate and adaptive components of the host defense mechanisms(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Protein kinase C - Î´ (PKCÎ´) is a phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinase first described by Nishizuka and colleagues, and it plays a critical role in intracellular signal transduction(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). As a result of its ability to phosphorylate a variety of target proteins necessary for cellular functions such as signal transduction(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), apoptosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), proliferation and survival(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), transcription(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), hormonal regulation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), and immunological responses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), PKCÎ´ is considered as a key hub for immunoregulatory functions among other PKC isoforms. PKCÎ´ null mouse (PKCÎ´<sup>-/-</sup>) exhibited B-cell accumulation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) and systemic autoimmunity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) with no apparent developmental and fertility issues. PKCÎ´ is ubiquitously expressed in lymphocytes and most mammalian tissue and cell types, including myeloid cells such as DC and macrophages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). However, the characterization of the PKCÎ´<sup>-/-</sup> mouse was focused to lymphoid progenitor development in which only B cell functionality was emphasized along with the recruitment of T lymphocytes and bone marrow cells in the spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Previous studies using PKCÎ´<sup>-/-</sup> mouse indicated immune protective roles of the kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) against different infectious diseases. Also, high susceptibility to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection with increased bacterial burden, mortality, weight loss, exaggerated lung inflammation, and unrestrained cytokine response has previously been demonstrated using PKCÎ´<sup>-/-</sup> mice model(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Protective immunity to TB is thought to result from a T-cell-dependent immune response, with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells playing a vital role(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). While PKCÎ´<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit conventional T-cell-independent susceptibility in response to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Recently, experimental and clinical evidence has increasingly highlighted the importance of innate cells in protective immunity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). The initial uptake of <italic>Mtb</italic> by macrophages, the primary innate immune cell also possesses T-cell-independent, essential bactericidal activity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) which is also apparent in PKCÎ´<sup>-/-</sup> mice with increased activated macrophages in the lungs during acute <italic>Mtb</italic> infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). However, these findings only emphasized the outcome of germ-line deficiency of PKCÎ´ in mice which prompted us to investigate the role of macrophage-specific PKCÎ´ deficiency during TB disease which has not hitherto been studied. We generated a macrophage-specific PKCÎ´ knockout mouse model (LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup>) by crossing lysozyme M â Cre (LysM<sup>cre</sup>) mice with loxP flanked PKCÎ´ mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). LysM<sup>cre</sup> mice enable specific and efficient Cre-mediated deletion of lox-P flanked target genes in myelomonocytic cells including granulocytes, monocytes, and macrophages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In this study, we demonstrated the impact of macrophage-specific PKCÎ´ deletion on various immune cell populations across organs, lung cytokine and chemokine levels to better understand the functions as well as the immunomodulatory effect of PKCÎ´ in TB using LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> murine model. Our results suggest that PKCÎ´ deficiency in macrophages exhibits an increase in mycobacterial burden in the lungs and more disseminated bacteria in the spleen at the chronic stage. Surprisingly, the lung immune cell profiling revealed T-cell-dependent host-defense through increased frequencies of T memory subsets and exhaustion markers during the initial stages of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Also, increased lung cell numbers were associated with infiltration of neutrophils at the acute stage of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. In addition, we also showed that reduced <italic>Mtb</italic> restrictive interstitial macrophages (IM) are associated with increased bacterial load in the lungs of LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice. Despite a significant reduction in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) levels -a critical cytokine for alveolar macrophage (AM) maintenance-within the lungs of LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, the frequencies of permissive AM remained unchanged(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To examine the macrophage-intrinsic role of PKCÎ´ in <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in greater detail, we investigated macrophages from LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice. Our findings mirrored the increased susceptibility of LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in isolated macrophages. Interestingly, overexpression of PKCÎ´ in a murine macrophage cell line, on the other hand, reduced the mycobacterial load. Further investigation revealed that PKCÎ´-deficient macrophages exhibited altered antimicrobial effector functions, with an elevated proinflammatory cytokine response and inflammasome activation during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Notably, we identified cellular metabolic ATP production dysregulation in the absence of PKCÎ´ in macrophages during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, which was reversed by the exogenous addition of GM-CSF, leading to reduced bacterial replication. Additionally, the transcriptomic and proteomic analysis identified that PKCÎ´ regulates critical genes and proteins involved in immune signaling during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Specifically, its deficiency impaired GM-CSF signaling, resulting in hyperactive type I IFN signaling and neutrophil migration programs. A comprehensive macrophage signaling atlas further underscored the central role of PKCÎ´ in modulating these pathways. Clinically, increased PKCÎ´ expression at site of disease from active TB patients, while knockdown of PKCÎ´ in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) recapitulated the phenotype of increased bacterial replication. Overall, the inflammatory responses elicited by PKCÎ´ demonstrated that this novel kinase is a crucial hub for orchestrating immunoregulatory functions in macrophages during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S4"><title>PKCÎ´ deficiency in macrophages increased <italic>Mtb</italic> burden and worsened lung pathology <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P8">To generate a myeloid-specific knockout mice model, we have followed the conventional LysM<sup>cre</sup>-loxP genetic manipulation technique described previously by Jiayuan Shi <italic>et al</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). We confirmed the integrity of loxP-floxed (fl/fl) PKCÎ´ in the genomic DNA extracted from the ear clips of PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice compared to wildtype(n/n) mice and the presence of Cre recombinase transgene (LysM<sup>cre</sup>) in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> (LysM<sup>cre+</sup>) mice compared to PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> (LysM<sup>cre-</sup>) mice, shown as linear DNA bands on the agarose gel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). To determine the specificity and efficiency of LysM<sup>cre</sup>-loxP mediated cell-specific conditional knockout, we sorted different immune cell populations by flow cytometry to confirm the deletion of PKCÎ´ specifically in macrophages while the expression of PKCÎ´ maintained in other myeloid cell types by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B-C</xref>). We also found that the PKCÎ´ mRNA transcript was undetectable and subsequent translation of the protein was reduced in the bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) isolated from LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1D-E</xref>). Additionally, to establish a PKCÎ´ exclusive myeloid knockout setting, we have determined the effect of PKCÎ´ deletion on different PKC family (classical PKC, novel PKC, and atypical PKC) isoforms in BMDMs through mRNA expression by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1F</xref>). To identify alterations in the lung and spleen physiology of LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice, we processed single-cell suspension from LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice. Besides having a minor reduction in lung B cell percentage, no significant irregularities of lymphoid and myeloid immune cell frequencies were observed in the lungs or spleen of LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice compared to PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1G-M</xref>). Importantly, Cre-mediated deletion of PKCÎ´ did not influence basal cytokine, chemokine levels, and growth factors, indicating no immunological distress in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice compared to PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice in naÃ¯ve state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1N-Q</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Our previous findings indicated a greater susceptibility and heightened inflammation caused by <italic>Mtb</italic> (H37Rv) infection in the lungs of PKCÎ´<sup>-/-</sup> mice mediated through suboptimal macrophage functions, leading to increased pulmonary cell recruitment and enumerated <italic>Mtb</italic> colonies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). To extend these findings and investigate clinical <italic>Mtb</italic> strain specific events, we intranasally challenged mice with hypervirulent <italic>Mtb</italic> (HN878) for 4 weeks (acute stage; 4WPI) and 12 weeks (mid-chronic stage; 12 WPI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found significantly increased <italic>Mtb</italic> burden in the lungs of LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice at both 4- and 12 WPI with dissemination to the spleen at 12 WPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-C</xref>). An increased pulmonary immune cell infiltration was observed at 4 WPI; however, the lung weight index remained unchanged. This was accompanied by a progressively increasing <italic>Mtb</italic> burden, indicating sustained bacterial replication despite the increased immune response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A-B</xref>). Mycobacterial growth often correlates with the association of tissue morphology in response to infection. Therefore, we investigated whether the increased mycobacterial burden exacerbates lung inflammation in the LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice by histopathological analysis. As expected, we found increased pathology defined as less free alveolar space in the lungs of LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice compared to PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice at 4- and 12 WPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D-E</xref>). An inflammatory and permissive environment for mycobacterial growth was further indicated by reduced nitric oxide (NO) production, as evidenced by iNOS<sup>+</sup> area in the lungs of LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice at 4 WPI compared to PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F-G</xref>). Previous studies highlighted the unique functions of GM-CSF, where it promotes host defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) but can also paradoxically compromise immune protection against <italic>Mtb</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). IL-2 plays a crucial role in shaping the T cell fate in response to <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), while IL-10, is an established potent anti-inflammatory cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Surprisingly, reduced levels of IL-2 at 12 WPI and GM-CSF at both 4- and 12 WPI were detected in the lung of LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice compared to PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice, contributing to increased mycobacterial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H-I</xref>). Notably, IL-10 levels were also reduced at both 4 WPI and 12 WPI in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> lungs. Since IL-10 is critical to limit excessive inflammation, its decreased levels could lead to dysregulated immune responses, potentially exacerbating lung inflammation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Although no significant differences in the levels of the indicated pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were observed, the altered balance of IL-10, GM-CSF, and IL-2 likely contributes to the observed increase in <italic>Mtb</italic> burden and lung pathology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2C-H</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The complexity of myeloid cell subsets that control TB-induced inflammation via distinct unique immune responses may result in protective or provide a favorable environment for pathogen survival(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Susceptibility of PKCÎ´<sup>-/-</sup> mice to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection has previously been associated with increased involvement of activated macrophages along with concomitant reduction in alveolar macrophage and DC subsets(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Based on the mycobacterial burden and increased pulmonary cell numbers during acute <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in the LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice, we further investigated the cell frequencies of various myeloid cells in the absence of PKCÎ´ in macrophages. Our findings revealed an increased influx of neutrophils early at 4 WPI in the LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice when compared to PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>). This indicates an increased pro-inflammatory response given existing evidence of functional versatility and phenotypic heterogeneity of neutrophils with regard to PKCÎ´ inhibition(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). We did not observe any differences in the frequencies of pulmonary eosinophils, monocytes, and DC subsets in the LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice compared to PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2I-J</xref>). However; ontologically distinct macrophage subsets exhibited differential effects in the absence of PKCÎ´ with a significant reduction in the frequencies of interstitial macrophages (IM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>), which are associated with pathogen restriction(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). In contrast, alveolar macrophages (AM), known to be permissive to the pathogen, remained intact at 4 WPI of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2K</xref>). Notably, a gradual increase of pulmonary IM was observed in the LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice at 12 WPI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2L</xref>). While the early encounter of <italic>Mtb</italic> with macrophages are a naturally occurring host defence mechanism upon infection, these cells play a pivotal role in triggering T cell responses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Previously, PKCÎ´<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed no variability in conventional T cell recruitment during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), however, T memory cell responses were not investigated. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> effector memory and CD8<sup>+</sup> short-lived effector cell (SLEC) frequencies were significantly increased in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice at 4 WPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1K-L</xref>). In murine TB, KLRG1 but not PD-1 is recognized as a superior marker for T cell differentiation to exhaustion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). The observed aberrations in memory and effector T cell subsets were most likely driven by the exhaustion of CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells characterized by increased PD-1<sup>-</sup>KLRG1<sup>+</sup> frequencies, in response to high antigen loads in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice at earlier stages of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1M</xref>). However, no marked increase was observed in the frequencies of lymphocytes including conventional T cells except for Natural Killer (NK) cells at 4 WPI in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice, when compared to PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice including at later stages of progressive <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2M-S</xref>). Collectively, these results showed that the deletion of PKCÎ´ in macrophages worsened disease outcome with exaggerated lung pathology, early lymphocytic immune exhaustion, and dysregulated myeloid subsets, ultimately promoting increased bacterial burden and dissemination <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ablation of PKCÎ´ in macrophages affects varying antimicrobial effector functions <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p id="P11">Based on the above role of macrophage-specific PKCÎ´ mediated immune modulation during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection <italic>in vivo</italic>, we analysed whether macrophages from LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice exerted similar effects <italic>in vitro</italic>. As expected, we found a significant increase in mycobacterial growth at 48 hour-post infections (hpi) in BMDM of LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> compared to PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). To further extend our insights into the role of macrophage-specific PKCÎ´ in sustaining immune responses during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, we overexpressed PKCÎ´ in RAW264.7 murine macrophage cell line to assess whether it could rescue the phenotype of PKCÎ´ deficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). Indeed, we found a significant decrease in mycobacterial growth in PKCÎ´ overexpressed cells compared to the control cells at 72 and 144 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results show that PKCÎ´ critically regulates macrophage-mediated protective functions during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. To reduce <italic>Mtb</italic> survival, macrophages use reactive oxygen species (ROS) to restrict the growth of cytosolic bacteria which escape from the phagolysosomal compartment, a primary component of their antibacterial defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Despite increased bacterial growth, surprisingly, we found elevated levels of cellular and mitochondrial ROS production at 24 and 48 hpi in BMDM of LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> compared to PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-D</xref>). Also, previous research has shown the consecutive fusion of <italic>Mtb</italic> trapped in phagosome with the lysosome is required for microbicidal activity, leading to bacterial destruction inside macrophages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). We determined that phagosome acidification was slightly reduced at 4 hpi in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> compared to PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> macrophages, however, no major effect overall on acidification of phagosomes using pHrodo was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), a major nitric oxide (NO) producing enzyme, is critical for the macrophage antimicrobial activity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). qRT-PCR results revealed that iNOS expression in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> was reduced at 24 and 48 hpi with subsequently reduced levels of NO production at 48 hpi compared to PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> BMDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E-F</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Previously, it has been shown that siRNA inhibition of PKCÎ´ in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) restricts both initiation and execution of caspase-3-mediated apoptosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). A similar reduction in caspase-3 activity was observed in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> BMDM at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). In addition, we found that bacterial proliferation was associated with impaired macrophage activation via reduced surface expression of activation markers CD80, CD86, and major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII) in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> BMDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). Unlike in the <italic>in vivo</italic> settings, we found a significant increase in IL-6, IL-1Î±, and IL-1Î² production in the BMDM of LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> compared to PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice at the indicated time points during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I-K</xref>). The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1Î² and IL-18 are governed by either canonical or non-canonical inflammasomes, which serve as important signalling platforms to detect pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). PKCÎ´-mediated inflammasome activation in macrophages appeared primarily dependent on the caspase-11-NLRP3 non-canonical axis, with AIM2- mediated activation and not on caspase-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2L-O</xref>). As expected, we also found higher expression of IL-1Î² but not IL-18 in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> compared to PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> macrophages during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2P-Q</xref>). The pathogenic success of <italic>Mtb</italic> is also connected to its capacity to recalibrate metabolic processes in infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). To assess the energy metabolism, we measured the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis rate by LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> BMDMs, as ATP is necessary for P2X purinergic receptor 7 (P2X7) mediated activation of the inflammasome and subsequent IL-1Î² production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). Utilizing the Seahorse Bioanalyzer, we found that the total ATP production rate was unchanged in naÃ¯ve macrophages but drastically increased in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> BMDM during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2R-S</xref>). Additionally, we found that the enhanced ATP production in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> BMDM during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection induced a relative increase in glycolysis than oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)/ mitochondrial origin of cellular energy metabolism. Our previously published Cap Analysis Gene Expression (CAGE)-transcriptomics dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>) demonstrated predominant PKCÎ´ expression in M2 (IL-4 stimulated) macrophages, a finding we further confirmed by qRT-PCR in IL-4 stimulated BMDM during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3C</xref>). This is in agreement with a recent study reporting PKCÎ´ expression in M2-like BMDM in cancer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). However, how the absence of PKCÎ´ influences macrophage polarization has not been explored. Using two novel and improved markers (CD38 &amp; Egr2)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>) to distinguish distinct murine macrophage phenotypes, we found that BMDM from LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice displayed significantly reduced surface expressions of both M1 and M2 markers compared to PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> BMDM at naive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2T</xref>). During <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, the surface expression of M1 marker was restored, whereas M2 marker expression remained reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2U</xref>), further supporting the association of PKCÎ´ with M2-like macrophages. These findings collectively suggest that PKCÎ´ in macrophages orchestrates a variety of antimicrobial effector activities, activation and polarization during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Loss of PKCÎ´ in macrophages alters IFN signalling and chemotaxis at the transcriptomic level</title><p id="P13">To investigate pathways underlying the pathogenesis during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in the absence of PKCÎ´ in macrophages, we performed bulk RNA-Seq to examine differentially expressed genes (DEG) in BMDM from LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice and compared them with PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> BMDM at 0 hr uninfected and 24 hr post <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We identified a total of 100 significant DEG at 0 hr uninfected timepoint, among which 26 genes were downregulated and 74 genes were upregulated in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> BMDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). We observed a modest transcriptional response with 53 significant DEG at 24 hr post <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, among which 38 genes were downregulated and 15 genes were upregulated in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> BMDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Several of these DEG aligned with our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, supporting the observed regulatory effects. As expected, both at 0 hr uninfected and 24 hr post <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, significant downregulation of Lyz2 was identified in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-C</xref>). This indicates that endogenous reduction of Lysozyme (Lyz2) gene function as the consequence of floxed-PKCÎ´ deletion in macrophages by Cre recombinase was sustained throughout our experiments. In agreement with our previous findings, we also observed a significant reduction of Nos2 expression in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> BMDM during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Mtb</italic> infection led to broad downregulation of multiple interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> BMDM, including but not limited to Ifi208, Cmpk2, Ifit2, Gbp5, Fgl2. Studies have also shown that Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2), a regulator of iron sequestered bacterial growth, promotes neutrophil recruitment by inducing granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) levels by alveolar macrophages during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). We found both Lcn2 and G-CSF (CSF3) were significantly increased in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> BMDMs during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). This increase suggests enhanced expression of neutrophil recruitment-associated genes in macrophages, potentially linking the observed <italic>in vitro</italic> transcriptional changes to the <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed several DEG enriched pathways related to the proliferation of leukocytes and mononuclear cells at naive state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>), whereas pathways significantly over-represented at 24 hr post <italic>Mtb</italic> infection predominantly included neutrophil migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). We also observed a subset of genes associated with neutrophil migration were significantly altered in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> compared to PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> macrophages at 24 hr post <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Neutrophilic inflammation contributes to tuberculosis pathology, with some subsets creating a permissive state for <italic>Mtb</italic> growth(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). Additionally, nitric oxide, the main product of the Nos2 enzyme, is shown to inhibit neutrophil recruitment, which otherwise creates a nutrient-rich environment for <italic>Mtb</italic> growth(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Previous studies found that depletion of an epigenetic reader speckled protein 140 (Sp140) in mice and specifically in macrophages exhibits a hyper type I IFN response and increased neutrophil recruitment in <italic>Mtb</italic> infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Notably, we found Sp140 was significantly decreased in BMDM of LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> compared to PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). To examine this further, we performed immune response enrichment analysis (IREA) to infer cytokine responses based on the regulated transcriptional signature in the absence of PKCÎ´ in macrophages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Surprisingly, IREA indicated type I and II IFNs (IFNÎ±1, IFNÎ², IFNÎ³) response in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> BMDM at 0 hr (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>) and 24 hr post <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>), suggesting a possible fundamental role of PKCÎ´ in macrophage triggering of IFN signaling as reported recently by Chaib and colleagues(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Studies have shown that elevated Sp140 levels augment STAT1 inhibition(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>), whereas, Sp140 blockade enriches IRF1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>), conducive to reducing macrophage inflammatory status. Moreover, PKCÎ´ is known to be an upstream mediator of STAT1 phosphorylation inducing type I IFN biological response in both B and T lymphoblasts(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). In parallel, ChIP-X Enrichment Analysis (ChEA) analysis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>) revealed that both STAT1 and IRF1 were the top consensus transcription factors among others in the absence of PKCÎ´ in macrophages at naive and in <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting a possible role of other PKC isoforms regulating STAT1 and IRF1 in macrophages, as also noted by Pilz <italic>et al</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>), which requires further mechanistic validation.

Combined heat map cluster analysis of the total proteome shows significant differences in the protein expression patterns between LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> and PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> BMDM in both uninfected and infected states, rendering a segregated classification tree of LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> and PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> samples on the horizontal axis of the heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-C</xref>). In agreement with transcriptome, levels of Lyz2 was significantly decreased in the LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> BMDM compared with PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> macrophages detected in both uninfected and infected total proteome clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-C</xref>). Interestingly, cumulative differentially expressed proteins (DEP) were associated with various catabolic processes in the uninfected macrophages suggesting baseline metabolic adaptation, while the regulation of neutrophil activation emerged as one of the prominent pathways during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Additionally, phosphoproteomic dataset with stringent abundance and significance criteria identified a few phosphorylated increased and decreased proteins in BMDM lacking PKCÎ´ at the uninfected timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, only downregulated phospho-peptides achieved the significance and enrichment threshold during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). The association of phosphorylated DEP to Reactome pathways underscores critical phosphorylation events, including IRF-3-mediated type I IFN activation in the uninfected state, as evident in our transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). RAC1, a small GTPase, is a key regulator of neutrophil recruitment to lung tissue, with its loss leading to reduced neutrophil influx and attenuated emphysematous lesions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). During <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, we found activation of RAC1 was significantly increased as a consequence of PKCÎ´ deletion in BMDMs, fortifying a crucial role of PKCÎ´ in regulating neutrophil migration as reflected in our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). Given that several pathways involved in macrophage immune modulation during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection were influenced by the deletion of a single kinase, we next investigated whether the identified putative substrates or phosphorylated DEP could predict which other kinases likely to phosphorylate these substrates or DEP in uninfected and <italic>Mtb</italic> infected BMDM. By integrating phosphoproteomic data with the kinase-substrate prediction algorithm, Kinase Enrichment Analysis (KEA3)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>), we aimed to map upstream kinases to gain deeper insights into the dynamic kinase signaling events associated with PKCÎ´ deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>).

Interestingly, a tyrosine kinase Fyn was amongst the highest-ranked kinases in both uninfected and infected phosphoproteome enrichment analyses. Overall, these results showed a wide spectrum of PKCÎ´ involvement in macrophage signalling, including of neutrophil activation and migration during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection at the proteome level.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>PKCÎ´ exerts intrinsic protection through independent GM-CSF and IFN signaling in macrophages against <italic>Mtb</italic> infection</title><p id="P15">In a TB-susceptible experimental mice model, elevated type I IFN signalling triggers pulmonary NETosis and promotes mycobacterial growth in the absence of GM-CSF(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>).

Additionally, the inflammatory status of LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> BMDM was reversed as depicted by the M1 marker CD38, while M2 marker Egr2 remained reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). The inhibition of type I IFN signalling by Chlorpromazine (CPZ) lower the ability to produce type I IFN(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>).

Of interest, we successfully silenced PRKCD using anti-PRKCD siRNA and achieved a knockdown efficiency of ~90% and above in MDM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5D</xref>). We then infected PRKCD-silenced MDM and observed an increase in mycobacterial growth at 48 and 72 hpi in comparison to MDM that was transfected with scramble siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). This was corroborated by imaging where we detected an increase in the bacterial growth, as measured by mean-fluorescence intensity (MFI) of GFP-expressing <italic>Mtb</italic> HN878 bacilli in PRKCD-silenced MDM compared to scramble siRNA-treated MDM at 72 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). As <italic>Mtb</italic> infection induces robust immunological responses in the absence of PKCÎ´ in macrophages, we explored whether its expression changes during the transition from infection to active TB disease. We analysed PRKCD gene expression in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained from active TB patients, as it exhibits the most favourable clinical manifestation of TB disease(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>). Expectedly, PRKCD mRNA expression was significantly elevated in the active TB group compared to the household contact control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>), establishing a strong basis for further exploration of PRKCD as a central regulator of immunoregulatory functions in clinical settings during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.

However, this response has overcome by <italic>Mtb</italic> over time, leading to dissemination to the spleen in the chronic stage of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Prolonged challenge with <italic>Mtb</italic> antigen has been shown to facilitate reduction in IL-2 and CD8<sup>+</sup> T memory cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, resulting in impaired antibacterial immunity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>). We found a significant reduction in the IL-2 levels with restored effector and memory T cell turnover in the LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice similar to the control animals at the chronic stage of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. This varied T cell interplay modulating IL-2 levels at various stages of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in the absence of PKCÎ´ in macrophages is critical and needs further evaluation. <italic>Mtb</italic> can also disrupt innate immunity processes by subverting various myeloid cells. Recent studies have explained a nutrient-replete niche that supports bacterial growth and tissue damage by neutrophilic inflammation during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>). Moreover, NOS2<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited an enhanced neutrophilic influx into the lungs, promoting increased susceptibility to TB(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>). This accords with our observation that neutrophils in the lungs of the LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice produce fewer nitrogen intermediates in response to acute <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Among the major myeloid cells at the site of infection, macrophages play a key role both in disease control as well as progression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Studies have established the restrictive nature of interstitial macrophages (IM) exhibiting a distinct metabolic state by contrast with permissive alveolar macrophages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). We inferred that increased mycobacterial burden was likely associated with reduced frequencies of IM in the lungs of LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice. Also, murine IM subsets are known to produce IL-10 among macrophage/monocyte lineages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>). Therefore, reduced IL-10 levels observed in the lungs of the LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice support this immunophenotypic outcome of depleting inflammatory macrophages during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.</p><p id="P19">The phagocytosis of <italic>Mtb</italic> by macrophages in the lungs initiates host protection from infection and involves various cellular mechanisms(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>). We observed switching of various cell death modalities in the absence of PKCÎ´ in macrophages during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Cellular ROS has been described as a bactericidal effector function during pathogen engulfment by macrophages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>). Surprisingly, we found a significant increase in the cellular ROS levels in the LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> macrophages, despite the enhanced ROS not correlating with improved control of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. This is unexpected, as ROS are generally believed to exert antimicrobial effect against infective agents. However, our findings raise important question of whether ROS on this context function primarily as antimicrobial agents or inadvertently favor <italic>Mtb</italic> survival. Mice lacking NOX2, a prominent ROS-generating transmembrane protein, are less susceptible to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>) and excessive or incorrectly localized ROS can be detrimental, leading to host damage(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>). LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> macrophages had higher mitochondrial ROS levels, indicating that PKCÎ´ may regulate excessive ROS-mediated inflammation following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also detected less expression of iNOS and NO, suggesting that PKCÎ´ is essential for NO-mediated control of enhanced bacterial growth in macrophages. We probed additional antimicrobial effector mechanisms and PKCÎ´ emerged as a key player in caspase-3-mediated apoptosis that drives infected macrophage killing as well as the MHCII-mediated antigen presentation during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, previous study suggests a link between elevated mitochondrial ROS and enhanced IL-1Î² production via activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>). The role of IL-1Î² is dichotomous in <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, with some studies suggesting a role in host protection whilst others show the host vulnerability in sustained IL-1Î² exposure(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>). Additionally, a recent study proposed that pharmacological and genetic suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome would decrease bacterial viability in macrophages for <italic>Mtb</italic> strains that produce a strong IL-1Î² response(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>). Based on our observations of ROS elevation, we have found an increase in IL-1Î² secretion in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> macrophages, which in turn was associated with the modest upregulation of NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasome genes. We observed a modest yet previously unrecognized immune response signature suggestive of caspase-11 mediated non-canonical inflammasome activation in PKCÎ´-deficient macrophages in <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Although the precise mechanism is unclear, the detrimental role of excessive production of IL-1Î² may augment bacterial growth in the context of PKCÎ´ deficiency in macrophages following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, which needs further exploration. Numerous investigations have demonstrated that NLRP3-mediated increased IL-1Î² production during inflammation is ATP-dependent(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>). This was evident in our results with increased ATP production in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> macrophages, functionally implicating a role in bacterial persistence in the absence of PKCÎ´ in murine macrophages during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Metabolic profiling further revealed this enhanced ATP generation was primarily driven by glycolysis, however, redundant towards OXPHOS. Notably, Mills and colleagues have described an LPS-induced rise in glycolytic activity that generates sufficient cytosolic ATP reducing the need for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This leads to build-up of mitochondrial membrane potential and allowing Complex I to produce pro-inflammatory mitochondrial ROS through reverse electron transport(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>).</p><p id="P20">We found that absence of PKCÎ´ also perturbed the expression of several genes associated with macrophage antimicrobial effector functions during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Transcriptomic analysis further indicated that the differentially expressed genes were linked to type I IFN signalling in the absence of PKCÎ´ in the naive state, a pattern that persisted during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection as well, albeit, to a lesser extent. Constitutively, this likely contributes to a less inflammatory macrophage profile and the accumulation of permissive myeloid cells, promoting impaired bacterial control as reported in previous studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>). Also, exacerbation of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection due to type I IFN signalling, which leads to neutrophilic recruitment, has been reported(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>). The absence of PKCÎ´ displayed a similar pattern of upregulated neutrophil associated genes following hyperactivation of type I IFN signalling, positioning PKCÎ´ as an upstream kinase regulator of the type I IFN signalling pathway, which contributes to intensified <italic>Mtb</italic> infection of macrophages. Comprehensive proteome analysis also demonstrated that the absence of PKCÎ´ is possibly modulating RAC1-driven neutrophil activation in <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. A critical role of RAC1 as a physiological integrator for neutrophil chemotaxis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>) and migration into the lung during inflammation has been well documented(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>). However, the association of RAC1 activation in murine macrophages support an unexplored indirect role of PKCÎ´ in regulating neutrophil migration during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Additionally, GM-CSF has also been well-documented in terms of its role in mediating <italic>Mtb</italic> control and inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>). Despite no observable changes in the frequencies of alveolar macrophages, GM-CSF levels were significantly reduced in the lungs during the disease progression. This is particularly noteworthy, as previous studies established a clear link between GM-CSF and bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>). While GM-CSF can be produced by a variety of host immune cells such as macrophages, conventional/ non-conventional T cells, and alveolar epithelial cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), we were limited in able to determine the major sources of GM-CSF in the absence of PKCÎ´ in macrophages <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, the macrophages could be amongst the cells which are a major producer of GM-CSF since the latter was abolished in the absence of PKCÎ´ <italic>in vitro</italic>. Consistent with our findings, Mishra <italic>et al</italic> reported that macrophages from active TB patients exhibited lower levels of GM-CSF(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>), aligning with our <italic>in vitro</italic> observation of diminished production of GM-CSF in the absence of PKCÎ´ in murine macrophages during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. While others have reported an impaired GM-CSF signalling leads to type I IFN induced neutrophil migration into lungs during murine <italic>Mtb</italic> infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>), we found an unexplored link, showing that this effect might be facilitated by PKCÎ´ in murine macrophages. Interestingly, exogenous GM-CSF supplementation in LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup> macrophages reduced mycobacterial growth with a subsequent restriction of uncontrolled metabolic reprogramming during infection and restored the inflammatory macrophage status. Similarly, pharmacological blockade of type I IFN signalling by Chlorpromazine (CPZ) reduced PKCÎ´-deficiency mediated augmented <italic>Mtb</italic> burden, which was also sustained with the addition of exogenous GM-CSF. GM-CSF licenses signaling through IFNyR (type II IFN) to confer monocytic inflammatory functions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref>). PKCÎ´-deficient macrophages also confirmed GM-CSF licensing may not be dependent on type I IFN transcriptional signalling to exhibit inflammatory response, which was blocked by CPZ treatment.</p><p id="P21">Previously, whole blood transcript profiling showed a significant increased mRNA expression of PKCÎ´ in active TB patients compared to healthy and LTBI individuals as well as PRKCD protein in human caseous and necrotic lung granulomas(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). We also observed higher mRNA expression of PKCÎ´ in BAL samples from active TB patients compared to household contacts, pointing towards the involvement of PKCÎ´ kinase at the site of infection and presenting a prospective target for future therapeutic intervention. Upon employing human MDM <italic>Mtb</italic> infection approach, we observed a comparable increase in PKCÎ´ signature, indicating a consistent activation pattern in response to infection. Furthermore, conventional knockdown of PKCÎ´ in MDMs showed an increase in mycobacterial growth, highlighting PKCÎ´ is also optimal for macrophage restriction of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in humans. Our study suggests that as a key hub of intracellular immune modulators â PKCÎ´ acts on various cellular modalities which restrict bacterial growth in macrophages and inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic>. The protective effect was also enhanced by overexpressing PKCÎ´, exogenous addition or blocking of PKCÎ´ regulated upstream and downstream immune correlates. Due to the broad role of PKCÎ´ in immune modulation, our study confers that GM-CSF represents one of the mechanism(s) through which PKCÎ´ attenuated immune dysregulation during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Moreover, sustained suppression of PKCÎ´ could potentially trigger direct or indirect compensatory mechanisms via other family members of PKC family potentially driven by macrophage plasticity in response to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. This underscores the need for focused investigation to validate PKCÎ´ as a viable therapeutic target, mainly through the development of highly specific pharmacological activators to harness its immunoregulatory potential without invoking broader, possibly maladaptive pathways. In conclusion, our study reveals that PKCÎ´ is a key hub governing macrophage immunodynamics during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Mouse Strains</title><p id="P22">To generate the macrophage-specific PKCÎ´ knockout mice, we crossed loxP flanked PKCÎ´ mice of C57BL/6 strain with in-house LysM<sup>cre</sup> mice of C57BL/6 strain for three generations to achieve homozygous knockout model LysM<sup>cre</sup>PKCÎ´<sup>flox/flox</sup>.
