This holobiont is situated in a chemical soil environment that is defined, in parts, by the specialised metabolite legacy of proximal and preceding organisms, including other plants. Here, we investigated the influence of external plant-derived specialised metabolites on the interactions among root-associated bacterial strains, and between these strains and a plant host. Using benzoxazinoids and their derivatives as a model in both simplified pairwise experiments and more complex multi-organism analyses, we show that these chemicals can modulate bacteria-bacteria, as well as bacteria-plant interactions. While the chemical environment alone had little effect on the plant at the molecular level, it differentially affected plant chemical defences, immunity, and sugar transport when combined with single-isolate or micro-community inoculums. Our study underlines the importance of the chemical environment in modulating organismic interactions and illustrates the value of combining reduced-complexity, bottom-up reconstruction approaches with top-down holobiont profiling.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>soil legacy</kwd><kwd>bacterial competition</kwd><kwd>benzoxazinoids</kwd><kwd>plant specialized metabolites</kwd><kwd>jasmonic acid</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Microbiomes are complex ecosystems that can vary depending on the plant species, environmental conditions, and the host’s life cycle, implying a tight regulation of microbiome composition by the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fitzpatrick et al., 2020</xref>). The plant immune system is tailored to recognise conserved microbial molecules via pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which leads to the activation of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) as the first line of defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Jones et al., 2024</xref>). As pathogens evolved effector molecules that interfere with host responses, plants evolved effector-triggered immunity (ETI) as a second line of defence, by which Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeat (NLR) receptors sense microbial effectors and trigger various defence mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Jones et al., 2024</xref>). Although tailored to fend off pathogens, plant immunity also acts towards non-pathogenic microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fitzpatrick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Teixeira et al., 2019</xref>). To colonise a host, commensal bacteria consequently need to escape plant immunity by suppressing plant responses or evading host recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Teixeira et al., 2019</xref>). For example, rhizosphere bacteria of the Xanthomonadales family can modulate the immune system of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, leading to reduced immune responses and a competitive advantage in root colonisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ordon et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Moreover, plants can recruit and shape their microbiome through the exudation of up to 40% of their assimilated carbon in the form of various organic molecules, mostly sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">An et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Canarini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Sasse et al., 2018</xref>). The SWEET (<underline>S</underline>ugars <underline>W</underline>ill <underline>E</underline>ventually be <underline>E</underline>xported <underline>T</underline>ransporters) sugar uniporters, are differentially expressed along the root axis of Arabidopsis, allowing for spatial organisation of specific microbial communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Loo et al., 2024</xref>). Plant sugar transport proteins (STPs) are responsible for sugar import, lowering sugar levels in the apoplast, and are involved in defence responses by depriving pathogens of nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lemonnier et al., 2014</xref>), which highlights the importance of sugar transport in microbiome and pathobiome establishment.</p><p id="P4">Plant-derived specialised metabolites also play a role in modulating the microbiome and have been increasingly recognised as the primary route for this inter-kingdom communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Korenblum et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Pang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Weston and Mathesius, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Zaynab et al., 2018</xref>). For example, glucosinolates (GLS) from Brassicaceae attract specific microbes, which in turn influence GLS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">DeWolf et al., 2023</xref>); strigolactone content is increased in phosphorus-deficient conditions to recruit arbuscular mycorrhiza to the roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Yoneyama et al., 2007</xref>); and coumarins recruit specific root-associated bacteria, leading to induced systemic resistance (ISR) in the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Stassen et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, the benzoxazinoids (BXs) DI(M)BOA (2,4-dihydroxy-(methoxy)-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one), which can be found in many grass species, are exuded through the roots and have an important and long-lasting impact on soil microbiomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cotton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gfeller et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Janse van Rensburg et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Stengele et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Thoenen et al., 2023</xref>). Upon release into the soil, DIBOA is rapidly converted to BOA (2-benzoxazolinone) and ultimately to APO (2-amino-3H-phenoxazin-3-one), which exhibits high phytotoxicity and antibacterial properties, remaining detectable in soil for years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Anzai et al., 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Macías et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Schandry et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Venturelli et al., 2016</xref>). Such long-lasting effects of plant specialised metabolites in soil are of particular importance in agricultural contexts, as the legacy left by previous crops will impact the growth of the next generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gfeller et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Janse van Rensburg et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Semchenko et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Stengele et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). Interlinked with trans-generational effects, the composition of the soil microbiome is driven by plant specialised metabolites and is a major player in soil legacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bakker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Janse van Rensburg et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Steinauer et al., 2023</xref>). However, the basic mechanisms through which plant specialised metabolites act on the microbiome composition and function remain unclear, which is particularly relevant if one considers that stable metabolites remain active in the soil even after the plant that produced them has disappeared.</p><p id="P5">In recent years, many approaches have been used to try and break down the complexity of plant-microbe-soil interactions. On the one hand, bottom-up approaches, which apply the design of communities composed of members with known characteristics, allow for a tight control of each member of the community. They have led to major advances in the understanding of commensal-host homeostasis and protective capabilities of bacterial strains adapted to abiotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Schmitz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Voges et al., 2019</xref>). Top-down approaches, on the other hand, take existing communities and aim at understanding them as a whole, for example via the introduction of perturbations and the identification of essential members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Jing et al., 2024</xref>). They have led to significant advances in understanding the role of plant hormones in plant-bacteria communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Conway et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Finkel et al., 2020</xref>), on the extent of plant responses to bacterial inoculums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Keppler et al., 2025</xref>), and on the regulation of plant stress responses by root commensals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hou et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In this study, we set out to expand reductionist bottom-up approaches to understand the impact of metabolite legacy on microbiome assembly and plant responses. We used benzoxazinoids (BX) as a representative of well-studied legacy-conferring plant specialised metabolites.</p><p id="P7">After initially establishing that binary bacteria-bacteria interactions are modulated by the chemical environment <italic>in vitro</italic>, we used a tightly controlled experimental setup to investigate ternary bacteria-host-chemical interactions and generated a top-down meta-transcriptomics dataset to investigate the interactions across different levels of complexity. The presence of benzoxazinoids lead to a dampening of the host’s hormonal signalling and a subsequent decrease of defence responses. Intriguingly, the inoculation with more complex communities attenuated this effect of the chemical environment. In summary, our study highlights the finely tuned responses of bacteria and plants to the chemical environment and illustrates the importance of deconstructing and reconstructing complex interactions, looking beyond the biotic environment to understand multi-organismic relationships.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Inhibition of bacterial rhizosphere isolates is modulated by plant specialised metabolites</title><p id="P8">To investigate the effects of plant-derived chemicals on bacterial interactions, we first tested the impact of chemical treatment on pairwise bacterial interactions, in absence of a host.

Of these, 63% were caused by the genus <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and 25% by <italic>Bacillus</italic>, even though these genera accounted only for respectively 13% and 16% of the tested isolates. These results are in line with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Helfrich et al. (2018)</xref>, who surveyed over 200 Arabidopsis leaf isolates for growth interference and found that <italic>Bacillus</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> dominated the inhibition network. While most of the inhibitory strains inhibited the growth of only a few isolates, suggesting specific interactions, ten isolates accounted for 75% of the inhibitions, with each one inhibiting more than ten other isolates. Most notably, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> MF397 inhibited over two-thirds of all isolates, suggesting that this strain produced several antibiotics that targeted most of the surveyed genera. <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> Root401, which had previously been reported to have strong inhibitory capacity due to its ability to produce both pyoverdine and the antimicrobial DAPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Getzke et al., 2023</xref>), served as an internal control and was among the most suppressive isolates, inhibiting 11 others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The natural hosts of the isolates of our collection, Arabidopsis and Lotus, do not produce benzoxazinoids, therefore leading to isolates naive to these chemicals. To understand how bacteria-bacteria interactions are influenced by APO and BOA, we repeated the pairwise interaction assay, supplementing the growth medium with either of these metabolites. One third of all inhibitory interactions were affected by the chemical environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>): 12% of the interactions were inhibitory only in mock conditions, while 9% and 11% were specific to BOA and APO, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). Only 3% of all inhibitory interactions occurred in both BOA and APO but not in mock conditions, suggesting that these two metabolites differentially influence inhibitory interactions between isolates. As some bacteria can convert BOA to the more potent APO, we next asked whether the differential inhibitory capacity of one third of all isolates was linked to their chemical phenotype. Of 73 isolates, 29 (40%) were capable of converting BOA to APO, while 55% (40/73) were inhibited by APO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>). Interestingly, some isolates that were able to produce APO were also sensitive to it.</p><p id="P11">The capacity of a given isolate to inhibit other isolates in BOA-supplemented media was independent from its capacity to convert BOA to APO (X<sup>2</sup> (df=1, n=209) = 0.05, p=0.8). Conversely, and contrary to our expectations, APO-sensitive isolates were not significantly inhibited by more isolates when APO was present (X<sup>2</sup> (df=1, n=448) = 3.35, p=0.07). Taken together, these results indicate that the differences in the inhibitory capacity of APO- or BOA-containing media are linked neither to APO sensitivity of the inhibited isolates nor to the capacity of the inhibiting strains to produce APO. Given that APO has been reported as the long-term stable metabolic product in soil, we used only APO for subsequent assays in soil.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Bacterial colonisation leads to transcriptional changes in the host</title><p id="P12">Benzoxazinoids modulate the microbiome composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kudjordjie et al., 2019</xref>), and this modulation cannot be explained by differential bacteria-bacteria interactions alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). To understand the influence of the chemical environment on differential microbial interactions, we next investigated how exogenous metabolites modulated bacteria-bacteria and plant-bacteria interactions at the molecular level in the presence of a host. We selected three bacterial isolates that had shown differential antagonistic behaviour <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>) and engaged in different types of interactions with Arabidopsis. The commensal <italic>Rhodanobacter</italic> Root179 was described to modulate Arabidopsis immunity, effectively evading detection from the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ordon et al., 2025</xref>); LjRoot171 (<italic>Variovorax</italic> sp.) reduced rosette weight of Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e,f</xref>), while MF196 (<italic>Bacillus</italic> sp.) did not impact Arabidopsis growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e,f</xref>). We combined Root179 with MF196, which inhibited Root179 only in mock conditions, or LjRoot171, which inhibited Root179 only in the presence of APO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). We inoculated the selected isolates either individually or in micro-communities of two isolates on one-week-old Arabidopsis Col-0 seedlings and co-cultivated them for three weeks in presence or absence of APO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1b</xref>). Interestingly, while LjRoot171 had a detrimental effect on the growth of Arabidopsis in both mock- and APO-treated environments, this effect was weak in APO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e,f</xref>). After confirming, via counting colony-forming units (CFU), that all isolates had established themselves on the host roots at the end of the experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1c</xref>), we extracted total RNA from the roots to carry out meta-transcriptomic sequencing.

We defined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as those with an absolute log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) &gt;1 and an FDR adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05. For all pairwise inoculations, the presence of APO increased transcriptional responses compared to mock conditions. In the Root179xLjRoot171 combination, the presence of APO resulted in a 1.6-fold increase in the number of DEGs for both strains compared to mock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>), while in the Root179xMF196 pair, the presence of APO lead to two times more DEGs in Root179 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P14">In both tested pairs, Root179 responded more strongly to the presence of a second isolate than the respective co-inoculated isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary 2a,b</xref>). The transcriptional response of pair Root179xLjRoot171 resulted in a total of 187 DEGs in Root179 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>), that of the Root179xMF196 pair in 54 DEGs in Root179 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p><p id="P15">For both pairs, the <italic>in vitro</italic> assays showed that the inhibition of Root179 depended on the chemical environment, with LjRoot171 inhibiting Root179 only in presence of APO, and MF196 inhibiting Root179 only in absence of APO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). To gain functional insights into the specificity of this bacterial competition, we conducted a cluster of orthologous genes (COG) enrichment analysis, comparing DEGs of a single isolate to their micro-community inoculated counterpart. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2a</xref>). The two COG-terms “Intracellular trafficking, secretion and vesicular transport” and “Extracellular structures” were exclusive to Root179 genes upregulated in mock conditions in response to LjRoot171 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2c</xref>).

Our experimental set-up allowed an in-depth insight into transcriptional response of Arabidopsis facing selected isolates individually or in micro-communities, in the presence or absence of APO.</p><p id="P17">First, we focused on responses upon plant inoculation with a single isolate. The PCA of the 1,000 genes with the highest variance confirmed the previous observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ordon et al.

This evasion was not influenced by APO, as the respective mock and APO samples both clustered with axenic samples. Samples inoculated with LjRoot171 showed the strongest response compared to axenic control; MF196-inoculated samples were spread between the axenic and LjRoot171-inoculated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). Overall, samples did not separate by chemical treatment but rather by bacterial inoculum. Interestingly, the response of Arabidopsis to APO seemed to depend on the presence of bacteria, as we detected only 5 DEGs in axenic plants in response to APO, compared to 16, 142 and 101 DEGs when inoculated with LjRoot171, Root179 and MF196, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P18">When comparing numbers of DEGs between mock and APO-treated samples for each bacterial inoculum, we found that APO reduced the effect of the bacteria on the transcriptional reprogramming of the plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3a</xref>). This was contrary to the transcriptional responses in microbes, which were increased by the presence of APO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). To understand which biological processes (BP) were attenuated by APO in response to bacterial inoculums, we performed hierarchical clustering on the normalised z-scores, which revealed three distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3b</xref>). Subsequent gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis revealed that all three clusters were enriched for BP terms linked to biotic stress responses, i.e., “defence response to fungus” (Cluster I), “response to wounding” (Cluster I and II), or “defence response to bacterium” (Cluster III) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Bacteria trigger few long-term immune responses</title><p id="P19">Given that the presence of bacteria is sensed by the plant and elicits a response from the immune system, we asked how immunity genes responded to the bacterial inoculums in mock vs. APO treatments.

The response of other JA biosynthesis genes (<italic>AOS, AOC3</italic> and <italic>OPR3</italic>) to single-strain inoculums were similarly dampened in APO compared to the mock environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>).

As a master regulator of plant defence responses, JA regulates the production of several plant specialised metabolites. We investigated the expression of genes from two major defence metabolite biosynthesis pathways downstream of JA, glucosinolates and flavonoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f-h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4a,b</xref>).

Among the glucosinolate biosynthesis genes, the effect was stronger for genes involved in the biosynthesis of aliphatic than for indolic glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4a</xref>), suggesting a preferential production of aliphatic glucosinolates.

The micro-community of Root179xMF196, showed a clearer separation from the axenic samples than the respective single inoculums. This grouping was also confirmed through hierarchical clustering based on normalised z-scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5b</xref>).

Instead, the flavonoid and glucosinolate pathways showed a strong and consistent upregulation independent of the chemical environment. Moreover, in Root179xMF196 micro-community inoculums, indolic glucosinolate biosynthetic genes, which had not responded to single isolates, were upregulated regardless of the chemical treatment.</p><p id="P25">To better understand what was driving these community-specific responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 3a, 5a</xref>), we performed a PCA on the normalised counts of Col-0 genes when inoculated with micro-communities only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7 a,b</xref>). Mock and APO treatments clearly separated, indicating an influence of the chemical environment on Col-0 genes in micro-communities. This was in contrast to the limited influence APO had on plant responses to single inoculums (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). Interestingly, the single gene mostly driving the clustering by treatment in the Root179xLjRoot171-inoculated samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7a</xref>) encoded for an oxygenase responsible for the hydroxylation of JA to 12-OH-JA (<italic>AT2G38240</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Caarls et al., 2017</xref>), important in the activation of the JA signalling pathway. This gene was strongly upregulated (l2FC = 4.8) in APO compared to mock in Root179xLjRoot171-inoculated roots. This suggested an increased defence response in APO in micro-communities compared to single inoculums, which might be linked to an activation of the JA signalling pathway via this oxygenase. Similarly, in the Root179xMF196 inoculated samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7b</xref>), the genes <italic>BT1</italic> and <italic>BT2</italic> (<italic>BTB</italic> [<italic>broad-complex, tramtrack and bric-a-brac</italic>]-<italic>TAZ</italic> [<italic>transcriptional adapter zinc finger</italic>]-<italic>domain containing proteins 1 and 2</italic>) showed strong contribution to the clustering by treatment.

Consistently, genes involved in JA biosynthesis and signalling pathways were upregulated in response to micro-communities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7c,d</xref>). In single-strain inoculums, APO led to the dampening of the upregulation of these pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 d,e</xref>). In micro-community inoculums, we observed the opposite trend (albeit not statistically significant) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7c,d</xref>).

This gene has been shown to downregulate aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aarabi et al., 2016</xref>), a response that we only observed in APO when plants were inoculated with single isolates, suggesting that other mechanisms might be regulating glucosinolate biosynthesis in micro-community-inoculated plants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="S13"><title>Bottom-up and top-down approaches converge to unravel chemical influences on bacterial interactions</title><p id="P26">The establishment of a specific microbiome on the host roots is a tightly regulated process that can be influenced by external factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Trivedi et al., 2020</xref>).

In this study, we used a bottom-up approach to initially study the impact of the chemical environment on bacteria-bacteria interactions. In our large-scale binary interaction assay, we found that the benzoxazinoid-derived compound APO and its precursor BOA can both influence bacteria-bacteria interactions via processes that are independent from the direct effects of the chemicals on bacterial growth.</p><p id="P27">The subsequent top-down approach to decipher the mechanistic impact of APO on plant-microbe interactions indicated that such altered interactions can, in at least one case, be traced back to resource divestments towards detoxification, leading to decreased competitiveness. The decreased competitive ability of Root179 towards LjRoot171 in the presence of APO was linked to an upregulation of pathways associated with detoxification, and a cognate downregulation of the offensive arsenal, such as the type-II secretion system (TIISS) in Root179. We propose that this decreased competitive ability resulted in an APO-specific inhibition of LjRoot171 towards Root179. Overall, our findings highlight the relevance of the chemical dimension in the bottom-up design of communities. Accounting for the chemical environment and potential fluxes is an important design element to ensure that observed interactions that contribute to the ecosystem, for example between keystone and other taxa, are robust to chemical perturbations.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>The host’s ability to sense microbes is modulated by the chemical environment</title><p id="P28">Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ordon et al.

In line with these results, we found that different isolates lead to different transcriptomic responses in Arabidopsis. While the plant mounted a strong immune response to the pathogenic isolate LjRoot171, only a diminished response was observed to the commensal bacteria Root179 and MF196. Notably, the presence of APO resulted in a weaker response to LjRoot171.

The observation that the biosynthesis pathways of these two main defence compounds were impaired further pointed towards APO inhibiting the ability of the plant to respond to colonizing bacteria. We also observed a more subtle differentiation in the response of the glucosinolate pathway. Single-strain inoculums upregulated mostly genes involved in the synthesis of aliphatic and lesser in indolic glucosinolates in mock-treated plants, suggesting a targeted plant response with preferential production of one type of glucosinolates. In contrast, both pathways were upregulated upon colonisation by micro-communities. Genes belonging to the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were differentially expressed between the two chemical environments in single inoculums. Notably, chalcone synthase (CHS) and chalcone isomerase (CHI), catalysing the synthesis of naringenin and thus the first dedicated steps in the flavonoid/anthocyanin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">W. Liu et al., 2021</xref>) were consistently upregulated in single inoculums in mock conditions. Conversely, micro-communities strongly induced the expression of the flavonoid but not the anthocyanin pathway, indicating that the plant mounts a stronger and more specialised metabolic response when facing multiple bacteria, independent of the chemical environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

The reads were mapped to the Col-0-CEN reference genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Naish et al., 2021</xref>) and to the <italic>de-novo</italic> assembled bacterial genomes. After filtering low quality reads, we could unambiguously map 33-83 million reads per sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1d</xref>). A negligible part (&lt;1%) of all filtered reads could not be mapped to the provided references, validating that the samples were free of contamination.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Significance</title></caption><p>Many plant species secrete specialized metabolites into the soil, where they can have a long-lasting effect on subsequent plant generations and their associated microbiomes. Understanding the effect of this chemical environment on soil- and plant-associated microbiomes is crucial to determine the impact of soil legacy on host plants, for example in the context of crop rotations. Here, we report that the interactions among root-associated microbes are modulated by specialized metabolites of the benzoxazinoid family, which are prominent metabolites in many grasses. We further show that the chemical environment can inhibit the defence capacity of the plant towards colonizing bacteria, and that more complex bacterial communities are able to mitigate these effects. Our work highlights the importance of deconstructing bacterial communities and the chemical environment to gain insights into the fine-tuned molecular mechanisms that determine the outcome of complex organismic interactions.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Bacteria-bacteria interactions are modulated by plant specialised metabolites.</title><p><bold>a</bold>.
