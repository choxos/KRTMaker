However, the precise events that cause individuals to become sensitised to spores are poorly understood. Mgl2<sup>+</sup> type 2 conventional dendritic cells (Mgl2<sup>+</sup> cDC2s) are critical in coordinating allergic airway inflammation in mice following repeated exposure to inhaled spores. Yet, whether these DCs are directly acquiring spores from the airway, and the downstream mechanism(s) upon fungal uptake causing DCs to trigger allergic inflammation are unknown. Here we find that spores are acquired by lung DCs after inhalation although these events are rare (~ 0.5% of the cDC2 population). Transcriptomics on isolated spore<sup>+</sup> Mgl2<sup>+</sup> cDC2s, compared to spore<sup>-</sup> Mgl2<sup>+</sup> cDC2s from the same environment, revealed that a major consequence of fungal uptake was a boost in metabolic activity. Single-cell metabolic profiling revealed this increase in Mgl2<sup>+</sup> cDC2 metabolism upon spore acquisition was fuelled by a glycolytic shift. To pinpoint if nutrient availability and acquisition is an important determinant of this response, mass spectrometry-based metabolomics revealed that, during fungal allergic inflammation, the local airway nutrient environment is altered. To ascertain which of these could be fuelling DC responses, we identified which substrates that feed into glycolysis were crucial. Of these, we found that glucose availability acts as a key rheostat in shaping cDC2 responses to spores. These data highlight a crucial role for glycolytic metabolism in driving cDC2 responses to spores, which is governed by glucose availability, defining novel targets for future therapeutic development of fungal allergic inflammation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Fungi are major, yet often underappreciated, triggers of allergic inflammation that underpins asthma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Spores of the environmental mould <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> (<italic>Af</italic>), designated as a critical pathogen of concern by the World Health Organisation, are one of the primary fungi that cause these responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Of the 300 million individuals that suffer from asthma worldwide, approximately 10% patients display severe disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. It is projected that 30-50% of these severe asthmatic patients are sensitive to fungi, which correlates with reduced treatment efficacy and poorer patient outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Despite this, these patients are difficult to diagnose and treat effectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Our limited understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for triggering these harmful responses to spores hampers our ability to develop new approaches to diagnose and treat fungal allergic disease.</p><p id="P3">Allergic inflammation in asthma is underpinned by type 2 (e.g. IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13) and/or type 17 (e.g. IL-17 and IL-22) cytokine responses which orchestrate influxes of activated granulocytes, airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR), mucus production and fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that both CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) can be critical sources of type 2 and type 17 cytokines in response to fungal allergens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. We and others have found repeatedly exposing mice to <italic>Af</italic> spores causes fungal allergic airway inflammation that is dependent on type 2 and type 17 cytokine from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. We further found that dendritic cells (DCs), particularly a conventional subset of DCs (cDC2s) expressing Mgl2 (macrophage Gal/GalNAc lectin-2), were vital for triggering CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell Th2 fungal allergic inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, in humans we have identified (via sampling sputum) that the cDC2s in the airway is a key defining feature of patients with severe asthma and fungal sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. However, despite defining the primary DC subset responsible for fungal allergic inflammation, the mechanism(s) governing the ability of these cDC2s to trigger allergic type 2 responses in response to fungi has not yet been addressed.</p><p id="P4">Though DCs are integral for triggering allergic inflammation, it is unclear whether they directly encounter inhaled spores. Epithelial cells, airway macrophages (MΦ), neutrophils, DCs and monocytes have all been shown to acquire spores and co-ordinate protective immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, these findings were mostly in the context of invasive fungal disease (aspergillosis) whereby mice were either immunosuppressed prior to <italic>Af</italic> infection and/or exposed to a large fungal inoculum (typically 10 - 100 million spores) resulting in a dramatically different inflammatory environment compared to conditions in healthy individuals or in allergic disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Due to their small size (2-3 μM) spores are likely deposited deep in alveolar spaces, even in healthy immunocompetent individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Mathematical modelling proposes airway MΦs clear inhaled spores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, but the role of DCs and whether frequent exposure to fungi impacts this process is unknown. Previous studies suggest that DCs likely encounter fungi, we have shown that early growth stages of spores promote DCs to trigger allergic inflammation, and others have shown that DC expression of pathogen recognition receptors C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) is an important step in coordinating antifungal immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. However, it is also possible that other signals from neighbouring cell types encountering fungi may be more important in conditioning DCs to induce allergic inflammation. For example, cytokines released from epithelium cells (e.g. IL-33 and TSLP) upon contact with allergens and/or ILC secretion of cytokines (e.g. IL-13 and leukaemia inhibitory factor), promote DC induction of allergy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Therefore, to decipher how cDC2s co-ordinate fungal allergic inflammation, the question arises if cDC2s directly encounter fungi in the airway and whether this an important step in cDC2 activation.</p><p id="P5">In this work, we administered fluorescent spores to mice in a model of direct, intranasal (i.n.) sensitisation and challenge with repeated low doses of live <italic>Af</italic> conidia to induce allergic inflammation and tracked the uptake of spores. Few spores were acquired by the epithelium, with the majority acquired by immune cells. Furthermore, upon repeat spore exposure the uptake of fungi by cDC2s increased after repeated administration, although these remained rare events (only ~100 lung cDC2s acquired spores). Combining the use of transcriptomic analysis on isolated DCs with cytometry-based SCENITH metabolic profiling, we show that fungal uptake boosts metabolic activity, fuelled by glycolysis, when compared to cDC2s from the same environment which had not acquired spores. We also show that CLR-Card9 signalling helps promote the increase of cDC2 metabolic activity and activation upon spore uptake. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics revealed that fungal allergic inflammation alters the nutrient environment of the airway and compound profiling determined that cDC2s rely on nutrients that feed into glycolysis. Importantly, of the identified nutrients, only glucose was essential, and its availability is crucial in determining the magnitude of cDC2 responses upon spore exposure. Overall, use of complementary approaches reveals that cDC2s, which are vital for driving downstream fungal allergic inflammation, uptake of spores induces activation that is reliant on increased glycolysis and is governed by glucose availability.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Immune cells acquire spores during fungal allergic inflammation</title><p id="P6">The precise host cell types (e.g. airway epithelial versus immune cells) which coordinate removal of inhaled spores in healthy individuals is unclear. To address this directly, we exposed mice i.n. to a single dose of surface labelled <italic>Af</italic> spores (4 x 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>) and following 3h, administered CD45-APC antibody i.t. immediately prior to lung harvest to identify airway immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Staining precision cut lung slices (PCLS) with EpCAM and podoplanin, to visualise the epithelial network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, revealed most of the spores were acquired by airway CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cells, with only a small proportion of <italic>Af</italic> associated with the epithelium and/or outside cells in the airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Having identified that immune cells were responsible for spore uptake, flow cytometry analysis after a single exposure of GFP-expressing <italic>Af</italic> (1x <italic>Af</italic>) revealed spores were largely acquired by Alv MΦs, with only minimal uptake by other immune cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E &amp; F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 2-4</xref>). Therefore, Alv MΦs are primarily responsible for acquiring <italic>Af</italic> following a single exposure to fungal spores.</p><p id="P7">We and others have found that exposing mice repeatedly to spores causes allergic inflammatory responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. To identify whether Alv MΦ are still the dominant population to acquire spores following the onset of fungal allergic inflammation, we exposed mice repeatedly to 6 or 9 doses of spores, which induces hallmarks of allergic inflammation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Replacing the final dose with GFP<sup>+</sup> spores revealed constant <italic>Af</italic> exposure resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of spore<sup>+</sup> Alv MΦs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D &amp; E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs 2-4</xref>). This decline in spore uptake by Alv MΦs was not compensated by either lung interstitial MΦs or monocytes previously implicated in mediating microbe killing and inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, as both populations expanded but the number of spore<sup>+</sup> Int MΦs and monocytes did not increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 2-4</xref>). Instead, we found following 6x and 9x doses of spores, neutrophils, eosinophils and DCs were the major lung cell populations to increase their spore uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 2-4</xref>). These alterations in spore uptake did not change the total number of spores acquired in the lung as numbers of spore GFP<sup>+</sup> cells remained similar regardless of whether mice received a single or multiple <italic>Af</italic> doses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P8">These data show that the dynamics of spore uptake and clearance is fundamentally altered in the context of constant spore exposure, characterised by increased uptake by granulocytes and DCs.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Mgl2<sup>+</sup> cDC2s are the major subset to acquire spores during fungal allergic inflammation</title><p id="P9">After identifying that lung DC acquisition of spores increases after repeatedly dosing mice with <italic>Af</italic>, we wanted to ascertain if certain DC subsets are preferentially acquiring <italic>Af</italic>, as we have previously demonstrated that one of these (Mgl2<sup>+</sup> cDC2s) are crucial for mediating fungal allergic inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In mice that received only a single dose of GFP<sup>+</sup> <italic>Af</italic>, so in the absence of an allergic inflammatory environment, ~100 total DCs acquired spores of which cDC2s were the largest majority (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 5 &amp; 6</xref>). In agreement with our previous findings, constant exposure to spores caused the expansion of: cDC2s (Mgl2<sup>+</sup>CD209a<sup>+</sup>, Mgl2<sup>+</sup>CD209a<sup>-</sup>, Mgl2<sup>-</sup>CD209a<sup>+</sup>), CCR7<sup>+</sup> DCs, monocyte derived DCs (MoDCs), CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> inflammatory DCs (InfDCs) while others (cDC1s, FcγR4 cDCs) remained static or decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 5 &amp; 6A</xref>). Of these, only Mgl2<sup>+</sup>CD209a<sup>+</sup> cDC2s, Inf DCs and moDCs increased their uptake of spores as allergic inflammation developed (9x versus 1x) and cDC2s represented the dominant subset to acquire spores, accounting for 45-50% of total DC spore<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 5 &amp; 6A</xref>). However, even upon allergic inflammation DC spore uptake in the lung remained relatively rare as only ~1% of cDC2s acquired spores (~100 spore<sup>+</sup> cDC2s per lung; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6A</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To determine whether spore acquisition induced DC activation, we measured expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86, pivotal in polarising CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to secrete type 2 cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, on DCs from <italic>Af</italic>-exposed mice. Of the DC subsets to acquire fungi after 9x doses of <italic>Af</italic>, only spore<sup>+</sup> Mgl2<sup>+</sup>CD209a<sup>+</sup> cDC2s significantly upregulated (versus spore<sup>-</sup> Mgl2<sup>+</sup>CD209a<sup>+</sup> cDC2s from the same lung tissue) both CD40 and CD86 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6B</xref>).

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the 500 most expressed genes revealed PC1 (~50%) and PC2 (~23%) separated samples based on <italic>Af</italic> spore uptake and number of exposures, respectively. This resulted in spore<sup>+</sup> cDC2s from both 6x and 9x <italic>Af</italic> dosed mice clustering separately from spore<sup>-</sup> cDC2s which were isolated from the same tissue environment, with minor, but markedly less separation occurring between spore<sup>-</sup> and PBS control dosed samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Together, these data suggest that while gene expression of cDC2s is influenced by the inflammatory signals in the lung environment, direct spore uptake plays a much more dominant role on the transcriptome of cDC2s during allergic inflammation.</p><p id="P14">To determine the major gene pathways within cDC2s that are shaped by spore uptake versus the allergic lung environment, we undertook KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. As revealed via PCA analysis, a greater number of identified pathways were up and down-regulated from spore<sup>+</sup> cDC2s compared to spore<sup>-</sup> cDC2s in <italic>Af</italic>-exposed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7 &amp; 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Unexpectedly, cDC2 gene pathways associated with fungal recognition (especially CLRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>) were either unaltered or down-regulated upon spore acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs.7 &amp; 8</xref>).

To pinpoint the crucial nutrients in the airway, which are impacted during fungal allergic inflammation, it is essential to determine which nutrient sources are specifically utilised by cDC2s to fuel activity upon spore acquisition. To address this, we exposed FLDCs to spores and employed Biolog’s Phenotype MicroArray Mammalian plates PM-M1 that are pre-loaded with an array of individual carbon nutrients known to be utilised in both glycolysis and OXPHOS metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>).

Indeed, increased airway glucose levels has been reported in diabetic patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>,</sup> which has been associated with higher incidence of asthma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">102</xref></sup>. Further work is needed to understand whether metabolic disorders and/or therapies which target glycolysis (e.g. Metformin) alter glucose levels in the airway and whether this could influence airway DC responses and susceptibility to respiratory disease.</p><p id="P36">In summary, our work highlights that by tracking the DC populations which acquired spores after inhalation we were able to interrogate the processes which govern cDC2 capability to mediate fungal allergic inflammation. In this way, our data provide further insight in to how metabolic activity and levels of nutrients co-ordinate DC driven lung inflammation that is relevant for understanding allergy that underpins asthma and other diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Experimental animals</title><p id="P37">C57BL/6 were either purchased from Charles River Laboratories or bred in-house along with: <italic>Card9</italic><sup>-/-103</sup> and littermate controls at the University of Exeter.
