However, the stoichiometric nature of such inhibitors and the emergence of resistance highlight the need for new modalities. Here, we report a Phosphorylation-Inducing Chimeric Small molecule (PHICS) that rewires the hyperactivity of an oncogenic kinase, BCR-ABL, to phosphorylate its active site residue. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest this phosphorylation inhibits BCR-ABL by inducing electrostatic rearrangements of its active site. This “event-driven” mechanism selectively induces apoptosis of BCR-ABL-dependent cancer cells at substoichiometric concentrations (vs. stoichiometric concentrations of occupancy-driven drugs). Furthermore, PHICS is effective on other oncogenic ABL fusions or clinically observed resistance mutations, including to occupancy-driven drugs with the same binding site as PHICS, pointing to the orthogonality of their resistance mechanisms. These studies lay the foundation for electric-field and “event-driven” modalities to control hyperactive enzymes with orthogonal resistance mechanisms to occupancy-driven modalities.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>BCR-ABL</kwd><kwd>PHICS</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>induced proximity</kwd><kwd>event-driven pharmacology</kwd><kwd>resistance development</kwd><kwd>CRISPR-suppressor scanning</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Aberrant enzymatic activity is the etiological factor in many disorders.

We were gratified to see an increase in levels of Y253 phosphorylation of ABL in the presence of <bold>2</bold>, while such phosphorylation was undetectable in DMSO or monomer <bold>1</bold> treated ABL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>). Previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> have shown that phosphorylation at Y253, which is part of the ATP-binding loop (P-loop) and proximal to the DFG motif, reduces BCR-ABL oncogenicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In agreement with these studies, <bold>2</bold> reduced the viability of BCR-ABL dependent K562 cells with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 740 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Using the viability of K562 cells as a readout, we performed structure-activity relationship studies by systematically varying the linker between the previously reported ABL binders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>).

Furthermore, the <italic>S</italic>-enantiomer (<bold>8</bold>) of compound <bold>6</bold> is approximately 10-fold more potent than the (<italic>R</italic>) enantiomer (<bold>7</bold>) (EC<sub>50</sub> = 107 nM and 1090 nM, respectively), in agreement with their reported degree of ABL activation. Finally, linking a methyl pyrimidine on the amino dihydropyrazole through an amide bond afforded compound <bold>9</bold>, which displayed comparable activity to <bold>8</bold> (EC<sub>50</sub> = 157 nM). Using a methyl pyrimidine scaffold <bold>9a</bold> for synthetic simplicity and avoiding the chiral centers in <bold>8</bold>, we varied the length of PEG linkers (n = 0–3) between the two ABL binders and identified PEG2 (<bold>11</bold>) as optimal, achieving an EC<sub>50</sub> of 69 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). Substituting the methyl group from pyrimidine to (<italic>S</italic>)-4-methyl dihydropyrazole further improved potency slightly (<bold>12</bold>, EC<sub>50</sub> = 52 nM). However, due to minimal gain and challenges with chiral purification, we proceeded with <bold>11</bold> as the optimized molecule. Notably, <bold>11</bold> exhibited higher potency than the first-in-class BCR-ABL drug imatinib in reducing the viability of K562 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Next, we confirmed the activity of <bold>11</bold> in other BCR-ABL positive CML cell lines (KCL22, BV-173, EM-2 and KYO-1).

Compound <bold>11</bold>, but not vehicle or <bold>10</bold>, caused a shift in the sedimentation coefficient, consistent with ABL dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To further confirm ternary complex formation in cells, we used a split luciferase NanoBiT assay, where BCR-ABL constructs were fused to luciferase components LgBit and SmBit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Treatment with <bold>11</bold> increased luminescence, indicating ternary complex formation, while competition with <bold>10</bold> reduced the signal. Indicative of an induced-proximity mechanism, we observed a characteristic “hook effect”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> by increasing the concentration of <bold>11</bold>. In agreement with these findings, we found that ABL binder <bold>10</bold>, which is not cytotoxic to K562 cells, rescued the killing activity of <bold>11</bold> when K562 cells were co-treated with <bold>10</bold> and <bold>11</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).

While treatment with <bold>10</bold> had similar phosphorylation levels at Y253 to the vehicle (DMSO), <bold>11</bold> selectively increased phosphorylation at Y253. Phosphorylation at Y253 correlates with reduced BCR-ABL activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and in agreement with these studies, we observed reduced autophosphorylation at multiple activation sites on BCR-ABL (pY70, pY226, and pY393) in <bold>11</bold>-treated K562 cells using immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> We further performed a global phosphoproteomic analysis and confirmed increased Y253 phosphorylation and decreased phosphorylation at sites correlating with autoactivation (pY226 and pY393). In contrast, the global proteome was comparably unaltered relative to DMSO treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3g</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">i</xref>). These findings suggest that <bold>11</bold> forms a ternary complex with a BCR-ABL homodimer to selectively promote Y253 phosphorylation.</p><p id="P9">Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a plausible mechanism for inhibiting BCR-ABL caused by Y253 phosphorylation. In the apo state, phosphorylation of Y253 (Y253TP2) is observed to induce a significant conformational change in the P-loop, leading to the formation of a salt bridge between the phosphate group with R367 that obstructs ATP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">b</xref>). Electrostatic potential calculations further reveal that Y253 phosphorylation enhances the negative potential of the active site, disfavoring the binding of ATP’s triphosphate moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). Simulations of activated BCR-ABL in complex with ATP · Mg<sup>2+</sup> also suggest that phosphorylation of Y253 impedes the catalytic competency. Intuitively, one might expect that the negatively charged Y253TP2 and ATP would strongly repel each other. Instead, the MD simulations suggest that the high negative charge density draws sodium ions into the binding pocket, forming a stable ionic cluster (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>) between Y253TP2’s phosphate group, ATP’s triphosphate moiety, R367, and three to four sodium cations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c,d</xref>).

To ensure adequate sgRNA coverage, the number of transformed cells was maintained at more than 1,000-fold the number of sgRNAs in the library. Lentiviral particles were produced using pMD2.G (Addgene #12259) and psPAX2 (Addgene #12260) packaging plasmids (both gifts from Didier Trono) and transduced into K562 cells via spinfection (1,800 rcf for 90 min) at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI &lt; 0.3) to ensure integration of a single sgRNA per cell. Cells then underwent puromycin selection for &gt;10 days and were split into three independent replicates for treatment with vehicle (0.1% DMSO), asciminib, or PHICS (<bold>11</bold>) over a total of 63 days (details for the drug-dosing are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Cell growth was recorded every 3–5 days to ensure the selection of drug-resistant cells. At 7, 21, and 63 days post-treatment, cells were harvested for sgRNA enrichment analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, #51104) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The sgRNA regions were PCR-amplified to incorporate Illumina adapters, and the coverage and distribution of the sgRNA library were assessed using MiSeq (Illumina). Data analysis was performed using previously described Python scripts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> Briefly, sgRNAs were mapped to the protein amino acid positions based on the predicted cut site coordinates within the <italic>ABL1</italic> (NP_005148.2) coding sequence. Sequencing reads uniquely matching each sgRNA were converted to reads per million, increased by a pseudocount of 1, log2-transformed, and averaged across replicates for each condition. The values were normalized to the plasmid library. sgRNA resistance scores were then calculated by normalizing to the mean score of the negative control sgRNAs within each condition and subtracting the score in the vehicle condition from that in the compound-treated condition at matching time points. Final values were z-scored based on the mean and standard deviation of the negative control distribution.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Validation of sgRNAs from the CRISPR-resistance screening</title><p id="P36">The six most enriched sgRNAs (sgD325, sgD504, sgK508, sgN670, sgS676, and sgL686) from the pooled CRISPR suppressor screen were cloned into the LentiCRISPRv2 plasmid for validation. The vector was digested with BsmBI (New England Biolabs, #R07399L) to generate 3’ and 5’ overhangs. Single-stranded protospacer oligonucleotides with complementary overhangs (Eton Bioscience) were phosphorylated using T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (New England Biolabs, #M0201S), annealed, and ligated into the digested vector with the Quick Ligation Kit (New England Biolabs, #M2200S). Oligonucleotide sequences for sgRNA validation are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>. Lentiviral particles were produced and transduced into K562 cells as described for library preparation. Transduced cells underwent a 63-day drug selection following the outline in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. Growth rates were measured every 3–5 days to ensure the selection of drug-resistant cells.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Genotyping and indel sequencing of drug-resistant variants</title><p id="P37">Genomic DNA from drug-selected cells was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, #51104), following the same protocol used for sgRNA distribution analysis. At least 1 µg of genomic DNA was used as the template for the first round of PCR to amplify gene-specific amplicons with common overhangs (20 cycles, NEBNext Ultra II Q5 Master Mix, New England Bio Labs, #M0544L). For cDNA analysis, total mRNA was isolated from drug-selected cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, #74106). cDNA was synthesized by RT-PCR using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Invitrogen, #18080-400). The resulting cDNA was then amplified in a first round of PCR, following the same conditions as genomic DNA amplification. PCR products were diluted 1:10 and subjected to a second round of PCR using primers with barcoded Illumina adapters (10 cycles, NEBNext Ultra II Q5 Master Mix). Primer sequences for both PCR rounds are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>. The final PCR products were purified using SPRIselect bead clean-up (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, #B23317), isolating fragments of approximately 500 bp according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The concentration of purified amplicons was determined by qPCR using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Roche, #07960140001) and adjusted to 2 nM. Final amplicons were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq using a Nano Kit v2 (Illumina, #MS-103-1003) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing reads were aligned to their reference amplicons using CRISPResso2 (ref<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>), and allele frequencies were calculated (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 5,6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supporting Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS206482-supplement-Supporting_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d89aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This work was supported by the NIH (R01GM132825, R01 GM137606, R01 DK132900, R21AI178690, and R35GM141930).
