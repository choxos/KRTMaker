Accordingly, tactile fingertip maps have been extensively studied in human primary somatosensory cortex. However, the fine-grained functional architecture of these maps remains largely unknown. To uncover this architecture, we sought to estimate 2D spatio-tactile population receptive fields (pRFs) of the tip of the index finger in human Brodmann area 3b (BA3b). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7T and submillimeter resolution along with prospective motion correction, we recorded brain responses whilst participants sensed a row of vibrotactile pins sweeping along cardinal axes over a portion of the fingertip. To estimate pRF position and size, we initially fit a 2D Gaussian pRF model to the data, which, however, produced largely implausible pRF estimates. Simulations indicated that this likely occurred because the size of pRFs in BA3b surpasses the portion of the fingertip we stimulated, resulting in an incomplete mapping of pRFs. To address this issue, we constrained the fitting procedure and refined the 2D Gaussian pRF model by keeping pRF size constant. Our results for pRF position then revealed that the ulnar-to-radial axis spanning the fingertip maps onto a superior-to-inferior axis in BA3b. Both the putatively large pRF size (relative to the mapping area) and the pRF position gradient we uncover here appear compatible with receptive field properties quantified in monkeys. Our study provides the first comprehensive investigation into the fine-grained functional architecture of human fingertip maps and brings us one step closer to a thorough understanding thereof.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>functional magnetic resonance imaging</kwd><kwd>population receptive field modeling</kwd><kwd>ultra-high field</kwd><kwd>7T</kwd><kwd>spatial</kwd><kwd>tactile</kwd><kwd>primary somatosensory cortex</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>exploratory research</kwd><kwd>simulations</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Day in, day out, we use our fingertips for a variety of touch-based tasks, such as twisting a cap, pressing a lever, tapping on a pad, popping a pimple, or stroking someone else’s face. In fact, by guiding both our perception and motor actions, tactile fingertip sensations render our interaction with the world incredibly effective. This becomes most evident when such sensations are suddenly impaired following (temporary) paresthesia, disease, injury, or amputation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gorniak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kawaiah et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Nora et al., 2004</xref>). Yet, despite the functional significance of fingertip sensations for our daily lives, we know surprisingly little about how tactile input to the fingertips is represented in the human brain. More precisely, although we know that human primary somatosensory cortex (SI) represents our fingertips in a somatotopic fashion (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Janko et al., 2022</xref>), we lack insights into the fine-grained architecture of an individual fingertip representation.</p><p id="P3">The building blocks of this fine-grained architecture are tactile neurons and their 2D spatial receptive fields – the region on the skin a tactile neuron is sensitive to. To investigate spatial receptive field properties of the fingertips at the level of neuronal populations, a plethora of studies has combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 7T with phase-encoding analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Engel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Engel et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Kuehn et al., 2018</xref>; P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Puckett &amp; Sanchez-Panchuelo, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Puckett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2018</xref>). This is because fMRI at an ultra-high field strength (≥ 7T) allows for high image resolution whilst ensuring a good signal-to-noise ratio of the fMRI response, which is thought to help resolve small somatotopic gradients in individual brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Puckett &amp; Sanchez-Panchuelo, 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P4">For phase-encoded fingertip mapping, participants’ fingertips (or a subregion thereof) are typically successively stimulated vibro-tactilely and voxel-wise blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) time courses recorded simultaneously. Assuming neurons in different voxels have receptive fields preferentially encoding different fingertips, the stimulus-evoked responses in these time courses should vary systematically in their delay. As such, a sine wave can be fit to each time course to obtain a phase estimate reflecting this delay<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3">1</xref></sup> and thus which voxel responds preferentially to which fingertip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Engel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Engel et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Puckett &amp; Sanchez-Panchuelo, 2023</xref>). Using this approach, the existence of so-called between-fingertip maps has been repeatedly demonstrated, where the tips of the thumb, index, middle, ring, and little finger are typically represented somatotopically along an inferior-to-superior axis in Brodmann area (BA) 3b, 1, and 2 in SI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Kuehn et al., 2018</xref>; P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Puckett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, such maps have also been reported for other experimental designs, analysis techniques, stimulus types, and lower field strengths (3T, 4T) as well as for multi-focal stimulation along the fingers and finger tapping instead of passive tactile stimulation (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Janko et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P5">A more explicit way to investigate spatial receptive field properties at the level of neuronal populations is fMRI-based population receptive field (pRF) modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dumoulin &amp; Knapen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dumoulin &amp; Wandell, 2008</xref>). A pRF refers to the aggregate receptive field properties of a population of neurons within a voxel (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dumoulin &amp; Knapen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dumoulin &amp; Wandell, 2008</xref>). Similar to phase-encoding analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Engel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Engel et al., 1994</xref>), pRF modeling has been pioneered in the field of vision science to study retinotopic maps in the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dumoulin &amp; Knapen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dumoulin &amp; Wandell, 2008</xref>). However, unlike phase-encoding analyses, pRF modeling typically uses biological encoding models inspired by invasive electrophysiology to estimate pRF properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dumoulin &amp; Knapen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Naselaris et al., 2011</xref>). As such, pRF modeling makes explicit assumptions about how a stimulus interacts with the pRF of a voxel over time to obtain predicted BOLD time courses, which are then compared to actually observed BOLD time courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dumoulin &amp; Knapen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dumoulin &amp; Wandell, 2008</xref>). A perfect pRF model can thus – at least in theory – provide an exhaustive functional characterization of a certain brain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Naselaris et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In vision science, pRFs are typically modeled as a 2D excitatory Gaussian function, which allows the center position (<italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub>) and size (<italic>σ</italic>) of a pRF to be estimated in 2D sensory space (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dumoulin &amp; Knapen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dumoulin &amp; Wandell, 2008</xref>). To adapt 2D pRF modeling to the case of 1D between-fingertip stimulation, the 2D Gaussian model can be either constrained by keeping one dimension constant (e.g., fixing <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub>) or reduced to a 1D Gaussian pRF model (e.g., removing <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub>). A series of high-resolution 7T-fMRI studies adopting such approaches did not only show that pRF position maps in SI are reminiscent of between-fingertip maps typically obtained via phase estimates, but also that overall pRF size might differ between different digits, although individual results did not always converge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">P. Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Puckett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Schellekens et al., 2021</xref>). What these studies leave completely unaddressed, though, is how neighboring points on a given fingertip and thus the skin’s 2D receptor sheet maps onto human SI (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Sereno et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Unlike research in humans, research in owl and/or macaque monkeys involving invasive single-neuron or multi-unit recordings already started tackling this question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Merzenich et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Nelson et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Sur et al., 1980</xref>). Using dense tactile stimulation delivered via fine glass probes, this line of work revealed that excitatory 2D receptive fields are organized so that the ulnar-to-radial and the distal-to-proximal axis spanning a monkey’s finger(tip) are represented along a superior-to-inferior and anterior-to-posterior axis in BA3b, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Merzenich et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Nelson et al., 1980</xref>). It furthermore indicated that the area of excitatory receptive fields in BA3b can range from a subportion of to almost the entire fingertip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Merzenich et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Nelson et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Sur et al., 1980</xref>). Interestingly, a series of human fMRI studies differing along various methodological dimensions (experimental design, analysis technique, stimulus type, field strength, image resolution, digits of interest) has already investigated the representation of the distal-to-proximal axis along the fingers in BA3b. Whereas some findings point to an ordered mapping just like in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Blankenburg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Choi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2012</xref>), others are less clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">P. Liu et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Overduin &amp; Servos, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Schweisfurth et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">2015</xref>). However, the granularity of stimulation in all these studies was coarse (no more than two effective locations per phalange) and the ulnar-to-radial axis along individual fingers was not mapped, rendering it impossible to fully resolve the fine-grained architecture of an individual fingertip representation.</p><p id="P8">In the present exploratory study, we therefore sought to estimate fine-grained, excitatory 2D pRFs of the fingertip in human BA3b (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). To maximize sensitivity, we combined 7T-fMRI at submillimeter resolution with prospective motion correction (PMC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Maclaren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Stucht et al., 2015</xref>) and precision neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gordon et al., 2017</xref>). Whereas PMC refers to correcting head motion at the time of data acquisition, precision neuroscience refers to collecting a large amount of data per individual for a detailed characterization of individual brains. To map 2D spatio-tactile pRFs, we recorded BOLD responses whilst participants sensed a fine-grained row of vibrotactile pins moving along cardinal axes over a portion of the tip of the index finger. To estimate 2D pRFs, we fit an excitatory 2D Gaussian pRF model to the data. To refine our modeling procedure and investigate the reliability, explanatory power, computational validity (accuracy), and meaningfulness of our results, we furthermore performed reliability, cross-validation, and simulation analyses. Our study provides the first comprehensive investigation into the intricate architecture of an individual fingertip representation in the human brain.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p id="P9">The study sample comprised 3 healthy participants (2 female, 1 male; age range: 27-39 years; all right-handed; all authors) referred to as subject 01, 02, and 03 (Sub-01, Sub-02, and Sub-03). Two of them were highly experienced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) participants. None of them were naïve as to the purpose of the experiment. All participants were screened for contraindications for 7T-(f)MRI and PMC, gave written informed consent prior to participating in the experiment, and reported intact sensory and motor function of their hands. All participants furthermore gave explicit written informed consent that their pseudonymized brain data can be shared publicly without any form of defacing. Experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Otto-von-Guericke University (OVGU) Magdeburg.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2.2</label><title>Apparatus</title><p id="P10">A whole-body MAGNETOM 7T-MRI scanner (7T Classic; Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) along with a 32-channel head coil (Nova medical, Wilmington, MA, USA) was used to acquire functional and anatomical images at the MRI Research Infrastructure of the OVGU Magdeburg. For participants’ comfort, a blank display was projected onto a screen at the back of the MRI scanner. Participants viewed the screen through a mirror mounted onto the head coil. Participants’ head was stabilized via foam padding wrapped around the entire back part of their head (from cheek bone to cheek bone). An MRI-compatible piezostimulator developed by QuaeroSys (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.quaerosys.com/">https://www.quaerosys.com/</ext-link>) was used to stimulate a portion of the tip of the left index finger (glabrous skin) via a single stimulation module comprising 16 vibrotactile pins. These pins had a pointy pinhead (maximal diameter: ~1 mm; distance from pin center to pin center: ~2.5 mm), were arranged as a 4×4 array (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), and passed through a surface containing 16 circular apertures. The piezostimulator had a voltage output of 4096 levels representing the possible range of pin heights. A dark surgical marker was used to draw the 4×4 pin array onto participants’ fingertips (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">2.4 Procedure</xref>) and an elongated cushion to stabilize the left hand.</p><p id="P11">Head motion was corrected online via a PMC system consisting of an MRI-compatible camera (Metria Innovation, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) with a lighting unit illuminating a marker with Moiré patterns (size: 15×15 mm<sup>2</sup>). The camera including lighting unit was mounted onto the MRI bore’s ceiling above the head coil and tracked the marker with a sampling rate of 86 Hz. The marker was attached to the extending bit of an MRI-compatible customized mouthpiece that was worn by participants during scanning. The customized mouthpieces were manufactured at the University Clinic for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery in Magdeburg, covered 6 teeth of the upper jaw (i.e., the central and lateral incisors and the canines), and ensured rigid coupling between the marker and participants’ head. The video stream captured by the camera was sent to a dedicated computer that processed the image frames and estimated head motion along 6 degrees of freedom: 3 rotation axes (pitch, roll, yaw) and 3 translation axes (forward-back, up-down, left-right). These estimates were then forwarded to the MRI scanner and converted from the camera’s coordinate system to the scanner’s coordinate system via a precalibrated transformation matrix. The PMC system tracks motion with a precision of ~ 0.01 mm (translation) and ~ 0.01° (rotation), which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the voxel edge length. More details on the PMC system and its validation can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Maclaren et al. (2012)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Stucht et al.

A single bar therefore functioned as the pRF mapping stimulus. The pins of this bar stimulus typically oscillated according to a sine wave with a constant frequency (<italic>A</italic> = 3095; <italic>f</italic> = 25 Hz; <italic>ω</italic> = 157.08 rad/s; <italic>ϕ</italic> = 4.71 rad). However, as part of an oddball task (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">2.4 Procedure</xref>), the bar stimulus occasionally oscillated according to a sine wave with a lower frequency (<italic>A</italic> = 3095; <italic>f</italic> = 10 Hz; <italic>ω</italic> = 62.83 rad/s; <italic>ϕ</italic> = 4.71 rad). For an illustration of the pRF mapping area and stimulus, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. To account for an accumulation of small temporal delays in the order of several seconds over the course of a full run of the pRF mapping experiment, we occasionally dropped points sampled from the sine wave. The bar stimulus used here can be seen as the tactile equivalent of bar stimuli comprising flickering high-contrast images frequently adopted for visual pRF modeling (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alvarez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dumoulin &amp; Wandell, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><label>2.4</label><title>Procedure</title><p id="P13">Adhering to the principles of precision neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gordon et al., 2017</xref>), we collected a large amount of data for each participant. In particular, the pRF mapping experiment consisted of 4 sessions <italic>a</italic>’ 10 runs per participant. For each participant, these 4 sessions were split across 2 days (either consecutive or 1 day apart), so that session 1-2 were conducted on the first day and session 3-4 on the second day. There was a break of ~15-30 min between sessions on the same day, during which participants were taken out of the MRI scanner. At the beginning of each session, a series of prescans (localizer, transmit adjustment, and shimming) was acquired, followed by anatomical data, followed by functional BOLD data for the pRF mapping experiment and a series of additional scans (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">2.5 MRI acquisition</xref>).</p><p id="P14">At the beginning of each pRF mapping run, 4 dummy volumes were acquired. Next, the bar stimulus translated step-by-step along a portion of the tip of the left index finger. Specifically, it translated from distal-to-proximal (32 s), proximal-to-distal (32 s), ulnar-to-radial (32 s), and radial-to-ulnar (32 s) with a baseline interval (32 s) before/after every sweep. During the dummy volumes and the baseline interval, no stimulation was applied. Note that baseline intervals are necessary for estimating large pRFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dumoulin &amp; Knapen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dumoulin &amp; Wandell, 2008</xref>). Each bar position was stimulated for 8 s. To prevent adaptation, pin oscillation was ceased for 0.2 s every 0.8 s. Moreover, to ensure sustained attention, participants were asked to detect 0-10 oddball events throughout each run. They were instructed to count these events and verbally report whether there were more than 5 oddballs at the end of a given run. The number and timing of oddball events in any given run was determined randomly. During an oddball event, the frequency of the sine wave changed briefly for 0.2 s (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S5">2.3 Stimuli</xref>). For an illustration of the pRF mapping experiment, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p id="P15">Prior to the start of the first scanning session on a given day, the camera had to warm up for ~1 hr. During this time, we performed 1-2 mock pRF runs. Moreover, before the start of each pRF mapping run, a subset of pins was supposed to rise and fall once and participants were asked to report if this was not the case. These check-ups were conducted to ensure that all components of the stimulation equipment were intact and the experiment could run through properly. Nonetheless, due to the relatively large number of runs collected in any given session, it could happen that the pRF mapping experiment did not run through properly, which was clearly perceivable (e.g., pins stopped oscillating). As such, participants were instructed to report such instances at the end of a given run, in which case this run was repeated. Similarly, a run was repeated whenever participants reported that they were “inattentive” or “sleepy” at the end of the run. Per participant and session, the range of invalid and thus to-be-repeated runs was 0-3.</p><p id="P16">Prior to the start of session 1, participants performed a training session outside the MRI scanner, where they familiarized themselves with the pRF mapping experiment and the oddball task. All participants were able to correctly report the movement direction of the bar stimulus, to detect the oddball events, and perceive each bar position clearly and distinctly. To ensure consistent placement of the pins in each session, we aligned the lower edge of the surface element of a second (identical) stimulation module with the terminal finger joint, and used a dark surgical marker to draw the 4×4 pin array onto each participant’s fingertip. If not actively washed off, the drawing could remain on the fingertip for several days. Moreover, to ensure that the pins remained in the same position throughout a whole scanning session, the stimulation module was attached to the index finger using medical tape. Participants were furthermore instructed to keep still during scanning and to refrain from moving their hand and fingers in particular.

Afterwards, we acquired several runs of functional BOLD images for pRF mapping (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">2.4 Procedure</xref>). In both cases (geometric distortions and pRF), we used a T2*-weighted 2D echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Between the first and second run of functional data acquisition, we additionally mapped geometric distortions using the T2*-weighted 2D EPI sequence for acquiring functional data with reversed phase-encoding as well as a T2*-weighted 2D gradient-echo sequence with two different echo times. However, these additional images were only acquired for potential future investigations and not used in the scope of the present study.</p><p id="P18">For acquiring functional images for pRF mapping and mapping geometric distortions, the image slab was centered at the base of the hand knob (i.e., a posteriorly-oriented hook when viewed sagittally; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Yousry et al., 1997</xref>) and then titled so that the anterior-posterior midline of the slab (the longer line of symmetry) was aligned with an oblique axis at approximately 160/340°. Moreover, any acquired dummy volumes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">2.4 Procedure</xref>) were directly discarded by the MRI scanner. As for the MPRAGE sequence, the motion estimates obtained via the PMC system were used to update the field-of-view prior to the excitation of each individual k-space line. As for the EPI sequences, this was done prior to the excitation of all k-space lines pertaining to an individual slice. As such, for both anatomical and functional data, PMC accounted for head motion within but not between runs or sessions. The distortion correction of the functional images using the PSF method was performed online via a fully-automated procedure. All acquired images were exported in DICOM format.

As part of the reconstruction process, we adopted a deep learning strategy for generating a brain mask (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hoopes et al., 2022</xref>). A subset of the reconstructed anatomical surfaces was later converted from surface to MAT format (along with the vertex-wise functional time series, see below).

Next, we generated a brain mask by thresholding these run-wise functional averages, obtaining the largest component (to remove non-brain tissue), and morphologically closing holes (due to noise/imperfect thresholding). Subsequently, we used these run-wise brain masks to mask the run-wise average functional images. All masked run-wise average functional images were then used to generate a masked functional template across sessions by aligning these images (interpolation method: nearest neighbor) and calculating the median across them. The final masked anatomical template (see above) was then coregistered to this masked functional template<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN9">7</xref></sup> (interpolation method: nearest neighbor). Next, we applied both resulting types of transformation matrices to every functional image of each run in one go<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN10">8</xref></sup> (interpolation method: nearest neighbor), therefore aligning them and coregistering them to the final masked anatomical template. More specifically, we used the forward transformation matrices for generating the masked functional template and the inverse of the transformation matrix for coregistering the final masked anatomical template to the masked functional template. This first coarse coregistration step was used as a seed for a second fine coregistration step, where we coregistered every coarsely-coregistered functional image of each run to the unmasked anatomical template (interpolation method: nearest neighbor) using the previously generated cortical surface model and boundary-based registration<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN11">9</xref></sup> (BBR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Greve &amp; Fischl, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Polimeni et al., 2018</xref>). Lastly, we used the transformation matrices resulting from BBR to project the coarsely-coregistered functional data onto the cortical surface model, thus resampling them to surface vertices. To this end, we used the voxel in the functional image that was located midway (projection fraction = 0.5) between corresponding vertices on the gray-white matter and pial boundary<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN12">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, we modestly smoothed the data along the surface<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN13">11</xref></sup> (surface FWHM = 1 mm).

Moreover, to conduct a split-half reliability analysis and cross-validation analyses, we repeated this analysis for the 15 odd-numbered and the 15 even-numbered runs of session 2-4. In each case, we first averaged the preprocessed vertex-wise fMRI time series across all runs of interest<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN15">13</xref></sup>. We then fit three pRF models to the averaged data. The first model consisted of a 2D excitatory Gaussian function (henceforth 2dg model) with 5 free parameters: pRF center position (<italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub>), pRF size (<italic>σ</italic>), pRF baseline (<italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub>), and pRF amplitude (<italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub>). The second model consisted of a 2D excitatory Gaussian function where the parameter for pRF size was fixed (<italic>σ</italic> = 8.5 mm; henceforth 2dg-fix model), leaving 4 free parameters (<italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub>). The third model was a model without any spatial tuning and thus 2 free parameters (<italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub>), essentially consisting of a boxcar function reflecting the presence or absence of tactile stimulation (henceforth onoff model). For both the 2dg and the 2dg-fix model, we expressed pRF center position and pRF size in physical units (mm) and estimated pRF center position in a Cartesian coordinate system where origin corresponded to the midpoint of the mapping area on the left fingertip (i.e., the pin array). For an illustration of the pRF modeling pipeline, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p id="P25">For all three models, we first predicted an fMRI time series. To this end, we calculated an overlap image by multiplying an image of the pRF model and a binarized image of the stimulus per volume (a stimulus movie). These images consisted of a 170×170 pixel matrix, where 1 pixel corresponded to 0.05 mm on the skin. For each overlap image, we then aggregated the pixel values by calculating the mean percent overlap with the image of the pRF model, resulting in a predicted neuronal time series. This neuronal time series was then convolved with a canonical HRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">The FIL Methods Group, 2021</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">2.7.1 Functional localization</xref>), resulting in a predicted fMRI time series. For the 2dg model, we generated 8750 predictions by sampling all putative parameter combinations from a 3D search space for pRF position and size (<italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub> = from -10.625 to +10.625 mm with 25 evenly-spaced values; <italic>σ</italic> = from 0 to 12.75 mm with 15 evenly-spaced values and 0 being excluded). For the 2dg-fix model, we generated 625 predictions by sampling from the same search space but dropping the dimension for pRF size because pRF size was fixed for this model. For the onoff model, we generated a single prediction. We then determined the Pearson correlation between the predicted and observed fMRI time series. For the 2dg and the 2dg-fix model, we subsequently selected the combination of parameter values showing the largest goodness-of-fit (squared Pearson correlation, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) as final pRF estimates. Only for the 2dg model, this constrained grid search fit was followed by an unconstrained optimization procedure taking the grid search fits as seeds and using a Nelder-Mead algorithm to further maximize the goodness-of-fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lagarias et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Nelder &amp; Mead, 1965</xref>). This is because the 2dg model with unconstrained optimization resulted in largely implausible parameter estimates (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S19">3.2 Fingertip pRFs in BA3b are larger than the mapping area</xref>). To address this issue, we introduced the 2dg-fix model with a constrained grid search and based all further analyses on this model.

To investigate whether the 2dg-fix model has superior explanatory power over the onoff model, we compared the cross-validated goodness-of-fit (<italic>cR</italic><sup>2</sup>) per vertex for this model to the cross-validated goodness-of-fit for the onoff model. This is possible because the cross-validation procedure we apply here automatically accounts for model complexity. And lastly, to determine how much the overall explanatory power varies between participants and models, we extracted all vertices falling within a given delineated BA3b cluster (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">2.7.2 Delin-eations</xref>) and determined the median cross-validated goodness-of-fit for each participant and model.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><label>2.7.4</label><title>Simulations</title><p id="P27">To investigate the implausibility, computational validity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lerma-Usabiaga et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Senden et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">Zeidman et al., 2018</xref>), and meaningfulness of our pRF estimates, we performed a series of simulations. The basic principle underlying these simulations consists in simulating a noise-free fMRI time series for a specific pRF model by following the steps for predicting an fMRI time series (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">2.7.3 PRF modeling</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Depending on the type of simulation, this time series either remains as it is or is perturbed by random Gaussian noise and <italic>z</italic>-scored afterwards, resulting in a noise-tainted fMRI time series. Next, a specific pRF model is fit to the simulated noise-free or noise-tainted time series by feeding the time series into the pRF modeling pipeline as if it represented truly observed data (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">2.7.3 PRF modeling</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><sec id="S14"><title>Implausibility</title><p id="P28">To investigate why fitting a 2dg model with unconstrained optimization resulted in implausible pRF estimates (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">3.2 Fingertip pRFs in BA3b are larger than the mapping area</xref>), we simulated how well we can recover the parameters of ground-truth pRFs varying in size when we add or do not add noise to the simulated data. This allowed us to test for the hypothesis that for large pRFs surpassing the mapping area, there is not enough unique information left in a noise-tainted time course to keep the parameter estimates within a plausible range. In a noise-free time course, however, this information is present, resulting in accurate recovery irrespective of pRF size. As such, using the 2dg model, we first simulated noise-free time courses for ground-truth pRFs with a center position at origin (<italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0 mm; <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0 mm) and 6 different sizes (<italic>σ</italic> = 1.0625, 2.125, 3.1875, 4.25, 6.375, 8.5 mm).

To this end, we first used the 2dg-fix model to simulate noise-free time courses for pRFs with 25 different <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> positions (from -10.625 to +10.625 mm with 25 evenly-spaced values) and 25 different <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub> positions (from -10.625 to +10.625 mm with 25 evenly-spaced values), matching all 625 search grid value pairs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">2.7.3 PRF modeling</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, upper left panel).

An inspection of the empirically-observed time series suggested that these implausible pRF estimates might be due to broadly-peaked stimulus-evoked responses (for example time courses, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>). For ordered pRF mapping designs, such as the one adopted here, broad peaks are characteristic of large pRFs, such as pRFs whose size encompasses a large portion of the mapping area or goes well beyond it. Due to the noise being present in empirical time series, broad peaks might be difficult to identify and different broadly-peaked time series difficult to distinguish from one another. This in turn might complicate the unconstrained optimization procedure and result in implausible pRF parameter estimates. To test for this hypothesis, we simulated noise-free and noise-tainted time series for ground-truth pRFs varying in size using a 2dg model and fit a 2dg model with unconstrained optimization to the data.</p><p id="P35"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> shows the simulated noise-free time series. This illustration highlights that even without considering the effect of noise, larger pRFs surpassing the mapping area are associated with broader-peaked and less distinctive stimulus-evoked responses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> (upper panels) shows the corresponding recovered pRF parameter estimates (<italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>σ</italic>).

For pRFs within the mapping area, we were able to closely recover the ground truth using the median (apart from for the smallest pRF).

For pRFs surpassing the mapping area, we were still able to recover the ground truth using the median, albeit less precisely. However, the percentiles of the recovered pRF parameters now indicated an implausibly large range.</p><p id="P36">Taken together, this pattern of results suggests that for larger pRFs (relative to the mapping area), there is not enough unique information left in a noise-tainted time course to keep the parameter estimates within a plausible range. This does not only lend support to the idea that fingertip pRFs in BA3b are large (relative to the mapping area), but also that we lack the sensitivity to distinguish between different large pRFs, and that an unconstrained optimization procedure with an unlimited parameter space is ill-suited. To address these issues, we therefore constrained the pRF model and fitting procedure. Specifically, we fixed the parameter for pRF size to 8.5 mm, that is, a pRF that basically occupies the whole fingertip, resulting in the 2dg-fix model. We consider such a large pRF size reasonable because research in the owl and macaque monkey indicated that receptive fields of neurons in BA3b can occupy almost the entire fingertip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Merzenich et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Nelson et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Sur et al., 1980</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN17">15</xref></sup>. In addition to that, we used the constrained grid search fits that are based on a limited parameter space as final pRF estimates.

When contrasting the cross-validated goodness-of-fit for the 2dg-fix model to the onoff model directly, the 2dg-fix model slightly outperformed the onoff model in various locations for all participants, which was largely consistent across both cross-validation folds.

The same is true for any claims about the computational validity of our pRF estimates. To address these issues, we next investigated to what extent the overall explanatory power, that is, the median cross-validated goodness-of-fit, differs between empirical and simulated data. In doing so, we also investigated to what extent the overall explanatory power varies between participants and fitted models.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><label>3.6</label><title>Empirical overall explanatory power is variable and similar to simulated one</title><p id="P46"><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref> shows the median cross-validated goodness-of-fit (<italic>cR</italic><sup>2</sup>) for each participant or simulation type as a function of fitted pRF model and cross-validation fold. Whereas the median cross-validated goodness-of-fit varied slightly between cross-validation folds for each participant and fitted pRF model, the variability across participants was much greater, with Sub-02 showing the highest median values, followed by Sub-01 and then by Sub-03. These interindividual differences resonate well with both the split-half analysis for pRF position estimates and prior analyses involving cross-validated goodness-of-fit and suggest that the overall explanatory power was highest for Sub-02. This increase not only needs to be considered when interpreting empirical pRF position gradients, but also provided an upper benchmark for evaluating the appropriateness of our simulations. Considering that the median cross-validated goodness-of-fit for all simulations lay well within the range observed for Sub-02, the overall explanatory power was comparable in this case. As such, the level of noise we used to perturb noise-free time courses can be considered adequate.</p><p id="P47">Apart from these observations, it is worth noting that for all participants except Sub-03, the median cross-validated goodness-of-fit tended to be higher for the fitted 2dg-fix model as compared to the fitted onoff model across both cross-validation folds. Notably, this difference in median cross-validated goodness-of-fit between the fitted models was absent for both cross-validation folds when we simulated data using the onoff model. These findings mirror our previous results for empirical and simulated differences in cross-validated goodness-of-fit, broadly corroborating the idea that we found evidence for spatially-tuned tactile pRFs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S24"><label>4</label><title>General discussion</title><p id="P48">In the present study, we sought to estimate fine-grained 2D spatio-tactile pRFs of the tip of the index finger for the first time in human SI. To this end, we recorded brain responses whilst finely stimulating a portion of participants’ fingertips vibro-tactilely and focused on BA3b as a region of interest. As a first step, we fit a 2D Gaussian pRF model to the data using an unconstrained fitting procedure. This resulted in implausible estimates for pRF position and size, suggesting the recorded brain responses do not contain enough unique information to keep the estimates within a plausible range. Simulations indicated that this likely occurred because the size of pRFs in BA3b exceeds the mapping area on the fingertip skin, resulting in partial pRF mapping and thus less distinct brain responses. As a second step, we therefore constrained the fitting procedure and the 2D Gaussian pRF model by fixing pRF size. When doing so, our results for pRF position indicated that the ulnar-to-radial axis along the fingertip is represented along a superior-to-inferior axis in BA3b, whilst no clear pRF position gradient was discernible for the distal-to-proximal-axis. Although this pattern of results was largely consistent within and across participants (2 out of 3), a cross-validated model comparison showed that our constrained 2D Gaussian pRF model only slightly outperforms a pRF model without any spatial tuning in various cortical locations. However, simulations highlighted that even such slight differences might be meaningful and with that the pRF position estimates we obtained. Collectively, these findings shed first light onto the fine-grained functional architecture of human fingertip maps.</p><sec id="S25"><label>4.1</label><title>The size of fingertip pRFs in BA3b</title><p id="P49">Our finding of putatively large fingertip pRFs (relative to the mapping area) in human BA3b appears compatible with invasive recordings in the owl and macaque monkey showing that the area of excitatory receptive fields in BA3b can range from a subportion of to almost the entire fingertip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Merzenich et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Nelson et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Sur et al., 1980</xref>). Although we cannot make any firm statements about the exact size of fingertip pRFs in human BA3b, our simulations suggest that for a pRF sitting at the middle of the mapping area, pRF size is likely larger than the mapping area, and thus 4.25 mm. Such large pRFs can arise from a multitude of neuronal and non-neuronal sources.</p><sec id="S26"><label>4.1.1</label><title>Neuronal sources</title><p id="P50">As far as neuronal sources are concerned, it is important to appreciate that large fingertip pRFs can result from both small receptive fields of single BA3b neurons with a large position scatter or truly large receptive fields with a small position scatter. Similarly, they can arise from only a few large receptive fields of single BA3b neurons biasing the population estimate. Without having an estimate of the variance of receptive field properties within a voxel in BA3b and modeling this aspect explicitly, it is impossible to distinguish between these possibilities.</p><p id="P51">Leaving these ambiguities aside, it is conceivable that large fingertip pRFs reflect the existence of receptive fields elongated along the distal-to-proximal axis of the finger. In line with this, invasive recordings in owl and macaque monkeys show that the shape of receptive fields in BA3b can range from circular to elliptical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Merzenich et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Nelson et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Sur et al., 1980</xref>). As such, expanding the mapping area along the distal-to-proximal axis of the finger might be critical for obtaining a direct estimate of the size and eventually also the shape of fingertip pRFs.</p><p id="P52">Similarly, it is possible that large fingertip pRFs evince the existence of multi-digit receptive fields. In fact, electrophysiological studies in macaque monkeys suggest that a subportion of BA3b neurons responds to tactile stimulation to multiple fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">DiCarlo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lazar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Trzcinski et al., 2023</xref>). Human fMRI studies modeling pRFs along the between-fingertip dimension also show tendencies for multi-digit pRFs, although it is not always clear whether these are indeed present in BA3b (P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Puckett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Schellekens et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, these considerations suggest that it might be necessary to expand the mapping area to other fingers to obtain comprehensive estimates of the size as well as shape of fingertip pRFs.</p><p id="P53">Lastly, large fingertip pRFs might be related to the type of stimulation we applied. Specifically, we adopted a position-changing vibrotactile stimulus consisting of a row of pins that oscillated at a frequency of 25 Hz with brief on and off periods. This stimulus might have not only been effective in driving Merkel cell neurite complexes and Meissner corpuscles, mechanoreceptors known to have small peripheral receptive fields (area: ~9 mm<sup>2</sup> and ~22 mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively), but also Pacinian corpuscles, mechanoreceptors known to have large peripheral receptive fields (e.g., entire finger; as summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Johnson, 2002</xref>). This is because all these mechanoreceptors are known to be sensitive to a range of frequencies including 25 Hz (Merkel: ~0-100 Hz; Meissner: ~1-300 Hz; Pacinian: ~5-1000 Hz), albeit their peak sensitivities are thought to differ markedly (Merkel: ~5 Hz; Meissner: ~50 Hz; Pacinian: ~200 Hz; as summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Johnson, 2002</xref>). What is more, locally applied vibrotactile stimulation is known to result in surface waves propagating through the skin, effectively enlarging the stimulus and limiting its resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dandu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Manfredi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Sofia &amp; Jones, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Tummala et al., 2024</xref>). Depending on how pronounced and far-reaching these propagating waves were, they might have led to a fairly effective stimulation of the large peripheral receptive fields of Pacinian corpuscles despite our small mapping area, which might have manifested itself at the cortical level too.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><label>4.1.2</label><title>Non-neuronal sources</title><p id="P54">As far as non-neuronal sources are concerned, it may be argued that large pRF sizes are due to the brain’s macrovasculature. This is because fMRI measures a hemodynamic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Logothetis, 2003</xref>) and BOLD fMRI, as applied in our study, is known to be sensitive to large draining veins, such as those near the pial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bause et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Koopmans et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Polimeni et al., 2010</xref>). This sensitivity might lead to a systematic blurring of fMRI time series near the pial surface and thus an inflation of pRF size estimates. It is important to note, however, that our analyses were limited to voxels located midway between vertices on the gray-white matter and pial boundary. Moreover, pRF size estimates in human visual cortex based on BOLD-fMRI have been shown to vary according to a u-shaped function across cortical depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fracasso et al., 2016</xref>). And lastly, visual pRF mapping in macaque monkeys shows that BOLD-fMRI-based pRF size estimates and variations thereof closely reflect those obtained via direct neural recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Klink et al., 2021</xref>). As such, our finding of putatively large pRF sizes (relative to the mapping area) cannot be easily dismissed as a mere effect of the brain’s macrovasculature.</p><p id="P55">Another factor that may have led to a blurring of the fMRI time series and thus an inflation of pRF size estimates is body motion, such as movements of the head or hand. However, the effect of body motion on fMRI time series is likely complex, depending, amongst other things, on the nature and location of movement, how body movements interact with the image acquisition process (e.g., T. T. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Liu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Zaitsev et al., 2015</xref>), and how and if cutaneous, proprioceptive, and motor information is integrated in BA3b (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). As such, a one-to-one relationship between an increase in body motion and an increase in pRF size seems unlikely. Moreover, it is important to consider that 2 of our 3 participants were highly experienced fMRI participants and all participants familiarized themselves with the pRF mapping experiment prior to scanning, had their hand stabilized using a cushion, and were explicitly instructed to keep still. In addition, our data were prospectively corrected for within-run head motion and retrospectively for between-run head motion via a carefully designed procedure. As such, it seems unlikely that hand or head motion was a primary driving factor.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S28"><label>4.2</label><title>The organization of fingertip pRFs in BA3b</title><p id="P56">Our finding of a pRF position gradient where the ulnar-to-radial axis along the fingertip maps onto a superior-to-inferior axis in BA3b fits in with invasive recordings in the owl and macaque monkey showing a similar topographic organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Merzenich et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Nelson et al., 1980</xref>). However, unlike these invasive recordings, our findings revealed no clear pRF position gradient for the distal-to-proximal axis along the finger(tip) in BA3b. Similar to our incapacity to obtain a direct estimate of pRF size, this might be due to large receptive fields that are elongated along the distal-to-proximal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Merzenich et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Nelson et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Sur et al., 1980</xref>) and a mapping area that was too small to account for this.</p><p id="P57">Importantly, the pRF position gradient we uncovered for the ulnar-to-radial axis was not discernible for 1 out of our 3 participants. Given that the inferior part of both pRF position maps was rather unreliable for this participant and characterized by a low cross-validated goodness-of-fit, this inter-individual variability seems, at least partly, due to an increased level of noise for this participant. Importantly, however, invasive recordings in owl and squirrel monkeys point to considerable inter-individual variability in the architecture of hand maps in BA3b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Merzenich et al., 1987</xref>). It is therefore vital to assess the test-retest reliability as well as cross-validated goodness-of-fit within a given participant and across participants to distinguish intra- from inter-individual variation in pRF properties, as we did here.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><label>4.3</label><title>Study limitations</title><p id="P58">PRF modeling is only as sensible as the data and assumptions it operates upon. To collect high-quality datasets, we combined 7T-fMRI at submillimeter resolution, precision neuroscience, PMC, and fine-grained vibrotactile stimulation. Despite this effort, our findings suggest that the usefulness of these datasets is limited because of partial pRF mapping. Future studies aimed at resolving fine-grained 2D spatio-tactile pRFs should therefore try to map out body parts as completely as possible whilst ensuring a dense sampling of the skin. Yet, due to the general lack of commercially-available high-density tactile stimulation equipment that is MRI-compatible, this is a challenging endeavor.</p><p id="P59">Besides, both the explanatory power and computational accuracy of our pRF estimates may be limited by the assumptions we made about the HRF in BA3b. Given that we adopted a canonical HRF, we assumed invariance across voxels(vertices) and individuals, which is not necessarily the case. However, accurately estimating voxel-wise(vertex-wise) HRF parameters in individual brains is challenging and susceptible to noise, thus requiring a large amount of additional data.</p><p id="P60">The explanatory power and computational accuracy may be furthermore compromised by the assumptions we made about the resolution and extent of tactile stimulation.

Before any such incorporation can happen, though, it is necessary to quantify the properties of propagating waves for a given pRF mapping design via suitable techniques, such as vibrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dandu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Manfredi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Tummala et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P61">Lastly, the adequateness of our simulations might be limited by the assumptions we made about the noise. Specifically, we assumed additive white Gaussian noise across voxels(vertices).

Similarly, unlike traditional quantifications of goodness-of-fit using a single dataset, the cross-validated quantification adopted here can occasionally result in negative cross-validated goodness-of-fit values. Although these negative values are expected, they cannot be readily interpreted in the scope of the present modeling framework and were thus excluded.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref
