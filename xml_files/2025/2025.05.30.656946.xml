FPR1 activation results in an increase in the cytosolic concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>), and an activation of the superoxide anion producing NADPH oxidase. Receptor downstream signals generated by the danger molecule ATP recognized by the purinergic receptor P2Y<sub>2</sub> are transduced by a G protein containing a Gα<sub>q</sub> subunit. The neutrophil response induced by ATP also includes a transient rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, but the downstream signals do not activate the NADPH oxidase. ATP can, however, activate this enzyme system through a receptor transactivation mechanism dependent not only on the ATP receptor but also on the free fatty acid receptor FFA2R, provided that this receptor is allosterically modulated. This occurs through a novel mechanism whereby FFA2R is activated from the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane by Gα<sub>q</sub> transduced signals generated by the ATP receptor. Furthermore, in neutrophils with a disrupted actin cytoskeleton, ATP (as well as platelet activating factor; recognized by the Gα<sub>q</sub>-coupled PAFR) becomes a potent NADPH oxidase activating agonist. At high concentrations of the actin cytoskeleton disrupting drug latrunculin A the activation was only partly reduced by Gα<sub>q</sub> inhibition. More importantly, this response was also partly inhibited by pertussis toxin. The effects on the ATP-induced NADPH oxidase activity, of the Gα<sub>q</sub> inhibitor and pertussis toxin were more and less pronounced, respectively, when the concentration of latrunculin A was reduced. Taken together, we show that in primary human neutrophils the actin cytoskeleton is part of the regulatory machinery that determines the activation of NADPH oxidase activation and the G protein recruitment profile downstream of activated of Gα<sub>q</sub>-coupled GPCRs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Neutrophils</kwd><kwd>actin cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>NADPH oxidase</kwd><kwd>G protein-coupled receptors</kwd><kwd>GPCRs</kwd><kwd>biased signaling</kwd><kwd>functional selectivity</kwd><kwd>G protein recruitment</kwd><kwd>P2Y<sub>2</sub>R</kwd><kwd>PAFR</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Professional phagocytes such as neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes express an NADPH oxidase with the capacity to transport electrons over a membrane using electrons from NADPH, produced in the hexose monophosphate shunt. The electrons reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide anions (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]). The membrane component of the NADPH oxidase is made up by one larger (NOX2; gp91<sup>phox</sup>) and one smaller protein (p22<sup>phox</sup>) and this heterodimer (cytochrome b<sub>558</sub>) contains two heme groups, and, together with a redox coenzyme (FAD), the cytochrome functions as the catalytic center of the electron transporting enzyme. In resting (naïve) neutrophils several phagocyte oxidase factors (p40<sup>phox</sup>, p47<sup>phox</sup>, p67<sup>phox</sup>, Rac1/2) are cytosolic and for an activation of NADPH oxidase, these proteins must first be recruited to the b cytochrome containing membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. It has long been well established that signals generated in neutrophils by chemoattractant receptors such as formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1), trigger an assembly and activation of the NADPH oxidase in the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. As a consequence, the O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> produced by neutrophils activated by the FPR1 agonist fMLF are not retained inside the cells but instead released/secreted extracellularly where other reactive oxygen species (ROS) are formed with O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> as the starting component (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]). Although signaling by activated FPRs has been intensively studied for long, the precise signals and molecular mechanisms that regulate the NADPH oxidase activation process have not yet been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Neutrophil receptors and the ligands that regulate their functions constitute the basis for the ability of our innate immune system to recognize both pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). The neutrophil activities induced by such PAMPs and DAMPs are of importance for our ability to combat invading microbes and to repair damaged tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Many of the neutrophil plasma membrane-localized receptors belong, just as FPR1, to the family of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs, also known as seven-transmembrane receptors [7TM receptors] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]). FPR1 is usually denoted as the prototype for the neutrophil GPCRs and in accordance with name and receptor group affiliation, this receptor is activated by N-formyl methionyl containing peptides and signaling rely on coupling to, and activation of, a heterotrimeric G protein containing a Gα<sub>i</sub> subunit. Basically, the majority of the initial GPCR activities that are important for receptor downstream signals are mediated by G protein complexes containing a GTP/GDP-binding α subunit with GTPase activity and a dimeric β/γ subunit. In the non-activated and low-signaling state of the receptor, GDP (guanosine diphosphate) is bound to the α subunit, and when the receptor is activated, GTP replaces GDP, and this binding triggers a dissociation of the α subunit from the β/γ subunit. The two dissociated G protein subunits then transfer the information from the activated GPCR to a second messenger cascade specifically characterized by the receptor, the receptor specific ligand, the G protein involved in the response and, the cell in which the receptor is expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. The dissociated β/γ subunit downstream of FPR1 activates PLC (phospholipase C), an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of PIP<sub>2</sub> (phosphatidyl-inositol-4,5-bisphosphate) to IP<sub>3</sub> (inositol trisphosphate) and DAG (diacylglycerol). The latter is an activator of PKC (protein kinase C). The IP<sub>3</sub> that is released to the cytoplasm is recognized by IP<sub>3</sub>-receptors on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> storing endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and when these receptors are occupied, stored Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released from the ER and the intracellular concentration of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) is increased. Our genome encodes many different G protein subunits, including around 20 α-subunits divided into four groups (Gα<sub>s</sub>, Gα<sub>q</sub>, Gα<sub>i/o</sub> and Gα<sub>12/13</sub>). These subunits combine with a β/γ dimer generated from the 5 and 12 subunit genes encoding β and γ subunits, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The literature suggests the presence of at least 30 distinct G protein complexes, with the possibility of additional complexes yet to be identified. Studies involving the overexpression of GPCRs in conjunction with various G proteins in cell lines have revealed that certain GPCRs exhibit selective coupling to a limited number of G proteins, while others exhibit promiscuity by coupling to several different G proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. This promiscuity is expected to increase as more data become available. It is also reasonable to assume that GPCRs previously identified as promiscuous may exhibit a more selective G protein coupling profile when activated in primary cells. The recruitment profile may be contingent not only on the cell in which the receptor is expressed but also on the agonist that activates the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. However, the regulatory repertoire is also open to other novel mechanisms that restrict the recruitment of different G proteins. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]</p><p id="P4">In addition to FPRs, neutrophils express GPCRs that recognize platelet activating factor (PAF; recognized by PAFR), generated by diverse cells through lipid remodeling, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs, recognized by FFARs) generated by bacteria, and adenosine trisphosphate (ATP; recognized by the purinoreceptor P2Y<sub>2</sub>R) generated by host cell mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Like the FPRs, FFA2R (one of the neutrophil FFARs) couple to a G protein containing a Gα<sub>i</sub> subunit, and the activated dissociated β/γ subunit activates the PLC-PIP<sub>2</sub>-IP<sub>3</sub>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway. This signaling pathway is activated also by ATP and PAF but the rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> downstream of their cognate receptors is mediated by the Gα subunit of a Gα<sub>q</sub> containing G protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Despite the signaling similarities, but in contrast to the activation profiles of several neutrophil GPCRs coupled to Gα<sub>i</sub> containing G proteins, the agonist occupied P2Y<sub>2</sub>R in naïve neutrophils do not generate signals that trigger an assembly and activation of the ROS producing NADPH oxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p><p id="P5">In the context of ATP, we have previously shown that the ATP/P2Y<sub>2</sub>R complex can activate the ROS producing NADPH oxidase by two different mechanisms; i) in TNF-primed neutrophils, ATP triggers such an activation in the presence of an FFA2R selective allosteric modulator, and this activation is achieved through a novel receptor transactivation (cross-talk) mechanism that results in an activation of the allosterically modulated FFA2R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], and ii) ATP triggers this activation also in neutrophils in which the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton has been disrupted by an actin binding toxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. The precise signaling triggered by ATP leading to an activation of the NADPH oxidase in neutrophils is still poorly understood. We now show that that ATP also activates the NADPH oxidase in neutrophils that have been primed with GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) through a transactivation mechanism involving also FFA2R. The transactivating signals are generated downstream of a Gα<sub>q</sub> containing G protein. Furthermore, in the context of neutrophils with a disrupted actin cytoskeleton, the activation of the NADPH oxidase by ATP occurs through signals generated both with and without the involvement of a Gα<sub>q</sub> containing G protein.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p id="P6">Dextran T500 was from Pharmacosmos and Cytiva Ficoll-Paque™ Plus Medium was from Fischer Scientific.

In summary, these data show that not only ATP but also PAF, has the capacity to activate the neutrophil NADPH oxidase via both Gα<sub>q</sub>-dependent and Gα<sub>q</sub>-independent signals.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Pertussis toxin sensitivity reveals Gα<sub>i</sub> involvement in the ATP induced NADPH oxidase activation</title><p id="P23">To further elucidate the intracellular signaling pathway in Gα<sub>q</sub>-independent ATP induced activation of the NADPH oxidase, we employed pertussis toxin (PTX) which, although the G protein subtype selectivity of PTX has been questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], is an established inhibitor of signaling by GPCRs that couple to Gα<sub>i</sub>-containing G proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Neutrophils treated with latrunculin A at a concentration of 25 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL, exhibited approximately 40% and 60% remaining ATP response (relative to control cells not treated with PTX, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A and B</xref>). Conversely, PTX lacked inhibitory effect on the ATP induced neutrophil response when the latrunculin A concentration was reduced to 5 ng/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C</xref>). Taken together, the data presented clearly show that in neutrophils treated with high concentrations of latrunculin A, the downstream signals that activates the NADPH oxidase utilizes signals that depend on Gα<sub>q</sub> and a switch to a Gα<sub>i</sub> initiated pathway. Conversely, no G protein switch occurs when the concentration of latrunculin A is reduced, yet signaling proceeding exclusively via Gα<sub>q</sub> still activates the NADPH oxidase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">The receptor downstream signals generated in neutrophils by the agonist/receptor pair ATP/P2Y<sub>2</sub>R fulfills the basic characteristic of an agonist that through binding to its receptor induces a “functional selective” response that is the result of a “biased receptor signaling cascade” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. This means that in contrast to a balanced GPCR agonists such as the FPR1 agonist fMLF, which facilitates signaling that regulates several different neutrophil functions, the activated ATP receptor transfers signals that result in a functional profile that is circumcised. Agonist binding both to P2Y<sub>2</sub>R and FPR1 results in coupling of the two receptors to G proteins, which activate phospholipase C and this activation gives directly rise to a production of inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>), which is linked to an increase in the cytosolic concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>,) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Although this response is induced by both receptors it is transduced by different G proteins; whereas FPR1 couples to a Gα<sub>i</sub> containing G protein, the signaling G protein partner of P2Y<sub>2</sub>R contains an α<sub>q</sub> subunit (this study and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]). Despite the signaling similarity, the functional outcome in naïve neutrophils differs. The signals that trigger an assembly and activation of the superoxide anion generating NADPH oxidase are not generated by the ATP activated P2Y<sub>2</sub>R, clearly showing that the downstream signals generated are not alone sufficient to activate the oxidase. The incapacity of ATP to activate the NADPH oxidase may be due either to that no NADPH oxidase activating signals can be produced by the Gα<sub>q</sub>-coupled P2Y<sub>2</sub>R, or that such signals can be produced also by this receptor and its G protein partner, but that this signaling pathway is (in one way or another) blocked in naïve neutrophils. The primary signaling mechanism downstream of the activated P2Y<sub>2</sub>R involves coupling to the Gα<sub>q</sub>-containing G protein and this signaling synergize with other neutrophil receptors such as the free fatty acid 2 receptor (FFA2R). Our data show that in the presence of an FFA2R specific positive allosteric modulator, the P2Y<sub>2</sub>R agonist ATP activates the neutrophil NADPH oxidase. We have earlier shown that PAF shares the basic primary signaling mechanism with ATP, involving coupling to Gα<sub>q</sub> and activation of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase by signals that synergize with FFA2R in the presence of a positive allosteric FFA2R modulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>].</p><p id="P25">The actin-rich cortex of neutrophils is, together with several different actin binding proteins, closely associated with the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane. It can therefore be deduced that an interaction between cytoskeleton proteins and integral plasma membrane proteins such as GPCRs may affect the function of the latter. In neutrophils, this has primarily been studied with FPR1 as a model for GPCRs. The basic regulatory function of the actin cytoskeleton in FPR1 signaling was described over 30 years ago in some excellent publications by Algirdas Jesaitis and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Little notice has been given to these early observations, which have been confirmed and extended to also include the closely related FPR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Based on the results obtained in these studies, a working model that describes how FPR signaling is regulated has been developed; signaling by FPRs is terminated by actin cytoskeleton dependent receptor desensitization, a process in which a continuous G protein recruitment to the activated FPRs becomes physically blocked when the actin cytoskeleton binds to the activated receptor. The molecular mechanism through which the cytoskeletal proteins bind to the cytosolic parts of the FPRs remains to be elucidated, but the results obtained in studies of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity, induced by FPR agonists in the presence of inhibitors of actin polymerization, such as latrunculin A, provide strong support for the suggested model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. However, a somewhat divergent regulatory profile emerges when the model is applied to analyze the data obtained when ATP is used as the activating agonist instead of FPR agonists. In naïve neutrophils, the NADPH oxidase activating signals are evidently not generated by the activated ATP receptor unless the actin cytoskeleton first has been disrupted. This suggests that in neutrophils, the signaling pathway leading to an activation of the NADPH oxidase is blocked by the cytoskeleton whereas the pathway resulting in a transient rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is accessible. Furthermore, the prolongation of the response, characterizing the response induced by FPR agonists in neutrophils with a disrupted actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], is absent in the response to ATP, suggesting that this response is terminated without the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton. More importantly, however, that the inhibitory effect of the Gα<sub>q</sub> inhibitor diminishes with increasing concentrations of latrunculin A. These data suggest on the one hand, that NADPH oxidase activating signals are generated through an involvement of a Gα<sub>q</sub>-containing G protein and, on the other hand, that such signals are generated also by Gα<sub>q</sub>-independent signals. In agreement with this, the ATP induced response in the presence of high latrunculin A concentrations is partly reduced by pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gα<sub>i</sub>-mediated signaling. Conversely, the ATP induced response in the presence of low latrunculin A concentrations is entirely dependent on Gα<sub>q</sub>, thereby evading inhibition by PTX. The effect of a disruption of the actin cytoskeleton on the response induced by PAF, an agonist recognized by a receptor (PAFR) that, like P2Y<sub>2</sub>R, couples to a Gα<sub>q</sub> containing G protein, is analogous to that described for the ATP-induced response, thereby adding another functional similarity for these two neutrophil-expressed GPCRs.</p><sec id="S17" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P26">A disruption of the actin cytoskeleton affects G protein involvement in ATP-induced signals that activate the neutrophil NADPH oxidase; the Gα<sub>q</sub> signals that activate the NADPH oxidase are apparently blocked in neutrophils with an intact actin cytoskeleton, whereas such signals are generated when this block is removed by the actin cytoskeleton disrupting drug latrunculin A. In addition, a disrupted cytoskeleton allows for a change of the G protein recruitment pattern. As such, also Gα<sub>i</sub> dependent signals activate the NADPH oxidase in ATP activated neutrophils with a disrupted cytoskeleton. The G protein coupling maps for a multitude of GPCRs reveal that, whereas some GPCRs selectively activate a limited number of Gα proteins, others have the capacity to couple promiscuously to a large number of different Gα subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. The purinergic receptor P2Y<sub>2</sub>R belongs to the group of promiscuous GPCRs, capable of recruiting multiple G proteins, whereas the PAFR displays a more restricted coupling profile that has been shown not to engage Gα<sub>q</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is evident from the data presented, that in neutrophils the immediate signals generated, when ATP as well as PAF bind to their respective receptor, are primarily mediated by a Gα<sub>q</sub>-containing G protein. This raises questions concerning the determinants of such a single-faceted selectivity profile. The molecular basis for the G protein selectivity could of course be related to the fact that cells/tissues differ in their G protein expression profile, but other mechanisms may regulate the G protein recruitment and signaling processes, mechanisms that allow responding cells to alter intracellular signaling pathways and the functional outcome of an agonist-induced activation. It has been shown that binding of an allosteric modulator to the prostaglandin 2 receptor EP4, occupying a receptor site localized close to the binding site for the recruited G protein complex, affects the G protein recruitment profile. That is, binding of a positive allosteric modulator to an intracellular receptor site in EP4, converts the signaling from being Gα<sub>s</sub>-dependent to instead use Gα<sub>i</sub> as the signaling partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. However, G protein selectivity most likely relies on a multitude of other molecular mechanisms, including structural conformation alterations in intracellular G protein binding receptor interfaces, induced from within the cell by regulatory proteins that dynamically facilitate or selectively block G protein binding. Collectively, such mechanisms ensure that GPCRs engage the appropriate G protein signaling pathway in response to different stimuli and in neutrophils the actin cytoskeleton is suggested to be part of this regulatory machinery. It is reasonable to assume that other binding partners present on the cytosolic side of the receptor-expressing plasma membrane may also have the capacity to be unbound or bound to a receptor, thereby regulating GPCR signaling through an interaction with the parts of a receptor that are accessible from the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane. Although the precise mechanisms by which the GPCR mediated recruitment of G proteins is regulated in neutrophils are unknown, it is evident that the actin cytoskeleton has a regulatory role that is crucial for the signaling and activation profile in ATP-activated neutrophils.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Funding sources</title><p>The work was supported by grants from the Åke Wiberg Foundation (M21-0025, M23-0193 and M24-0227), the Swedish state under the agreement between the Swedish government and the county councils, the ALF-agreement (ALFGBG 78150),, the Swedish Medical Research Council (2018-02848 and 2022-00624), the Swedish Rheumatism Association (R-995669, R-1013370 and R-995361), the Rune and Ulla Almlövs Foundation (2023-418), the Mary von Sydow foundation (2023-4723 and 2024-163), the King Gustaf the V 80-year foundation (FAI-2021-0804 and FAI-2022-0873), the Magnus Bergwall foundation (2024-1434), the Health &amp; Medical Care Committee of the Region Västra Götaland (VGFOUREG-979715, VGFOUREG-995348) and the Wilhelm and Martina Lundgren Science Fund (2024-SA-4605).</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ATP</term><def><p>adenosine triphosphate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CL</term><def><p>chemiluminescence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DAMP</term><def><p>danger associated molecular pattern</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ER</term><def><p>endoplasmic reticulum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>fMLF</term><def><p>formyl-Met-Leu-Phe</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FPR</term><def><p>formyl peptide receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFA2R</term><def><p>free fatty acid receptor 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GDP</term><def><p>guanosine diphosphate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GM-CSF</term><def><p>granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GPCR</term><def><p>G protein-coupled receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GTP</term><def><p>guanosine triphosphate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRP</term><def><p>horseradish peroxidase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IP<sub>3</sub></term><def><p>inositol trisphosphate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KRG</term><def><p>Krebs-Ringer glucose</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LA</term><def><p>latrunculin A</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAF</term><def><p>platelet-activating factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAMP</term><def><p>pathogen associated molecular pattern</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="FN1"><p id="P27">Declarations of interest: None.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="FN2"><p id="P28"><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p id="P29"><bold>Neele K.
