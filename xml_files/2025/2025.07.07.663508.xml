Although RXLR-EER motifs are critical for host translocation and are cleaved prior to secretion, the relevance of this processing is poorly understood. Prior evidence suggests RXLR effectors utilize a distinct, unconventional secretion pathway, raising the question of whether the RXLR-EER motifs influence selection of the secretion route. Here, we combined genetic, molecular and cell biology approaches to investigate the secretion pathways of RXLR effectors. Confocal microscopy revealed that RXLR and apoplastic effectors localize to distinct vesicular compartments in cultured hyphae. Moreover, fusing the ER retention signal KDEL to RXLR effectors did not impair their secretion, in contrast to apoplastic effectors, which were retained in the endomembrane system, indicating that RXLR effectors bypass the canonical ER-to-Golgi pathway. Importantly, RXLR effectors associate with extracellular vesicles, whereas RXLR-EER motif mutants show reduced association and are rerouted through the ER-to-Golgi secretion pathway. These findings demonstrate that the RXLR-EER motif governs effector sorting into an unconventional, EV-linked secretion route. This study sheds light on the molecular basis of effector trafficking in <italic>P. infestans</italic> and underscores the potential role of EVs in delivering virulence factors during host colonization.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The oomycete <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> is the causative agent of potato late blight, a devastating disease that triggered the Irish potato famine in the 19th century and continues to pose a major threat to global food security <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. As a highly adapted hemi-biotrophic pathogen, <italic>P. infestans</italic> relies on a large and complex suite of effector proteins to manipulate host cell physiology and suppress immune responses, enabling successful colonization and disease progression.</p><p id="P3">The effectors can be broadly divided into two classes based on their site of action: apoplastic effectors, which are secreted into the extracellular space (apoplast) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, and cytoplasmic effectors with an Arg-any amino acid-Arg-Leu (RXLR) motif, many of which have followed closely by EER (Glu-Glu-Arg) motif, downstream of a secretion signal peptide are encoded by hundreds of genes within the genomes of <italic>Phytophthora</italic> spp. and downy mildew pathogens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. RXLR effectors are delivered into the host cell cytosol and target multiple proteins and processes at diverse locations inside host cells to suppress immunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Whereas apoplastic effectors may be perceived by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) at the cell surface, RXLR effectors interfere with intracellular immunity by targeting various host processes within plant cells and can, in turn, be perceived by nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. The RXLR-EER motif is crucial for host cell translocation and is proteolytically cleaved prior to secretion, although the functional consequences of this processing are poorly understood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Previous studies show that apoplastic effectors in <italic>P. infestans</italic> are secreted via the conventional ER-to-Golgi pathway, as indicated by their sensitivity to the inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA). In contrast, RXLR effectors are largely BFA-insensitive, suggesting they follow an unconventional secretion route<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. A similar dichotomy in effector secretion has been observed in the fungal pathogen <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, where cytoplasmic effectors are delivered via a BFA-insensitive, non-classical pathway, while apoplastic effectors rely on BFA-sensitive ER-to-Golgi trafficking <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. However, it is important to recognise that BFA treatment can have off-target or pleiotropic effects, including disruption of endosomal trafficking, vesicle recycling, and broader alterations in membrane dynamics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. These side-effects may complicate interpretation of BFA sensitivity assays, particularly in complex filamentous pathogens such as <italic>P. infestans</italic>, where multiple secretory routes may coexist. Therefore, while BFA sensitivity provides a useful initial indication of secretory pathway involvement, additional genetic and imaging-based approaches are essential to unambiguously distinguish between conventional and unconventional secretion routes.</p><p id="P5">Recently, emerging evidence suggests that RXLR effectors are secreted via an unconventional pathway potentially associated with production of extracellular vesicles (EVs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. EVs are membrane-bound nanoparticles released by cells into the extracellular milieu and have been increasingly recognized as vehicles for intercellular communication and molecular cargo delivery between organisms from different kingdoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Recently, EVs have been shown to play a pivotal bidirectional transport role in plant–pathogen interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. In addition to the intriguing link between EVs and effector trafficking, the mechanisms by which RXLR effectors are sorted to EVs, and the signals that determine their route of secretion, are largely unknown. In particular, whether the RXLR-EER motif influences intracellular sorting within the pathogen secretory systems has yet to be resolved.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we combined molecular, genetic and live-cell imaging approaches to investigate the secretion pathway of RXLR effectors in <italic>P. infestans</italic>. To determine whether these effectors utilize the classical ER–to-Golgi secretion route, we fused a canonical ER retention signal, KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu), to RXLR effectors. The KDEL motif, typically found at the C-terminus of ER-resident proteins, is recognized by KDEL receptors in the cis-Golgi, which mediate the retrograde transport of these proteins back to the ER. While apoplastic effectors were largely retained in the ER after the addition of KDEL, RXLR effectors remained efficiently secreted, suggesting that they bypass the conventional ER–Golgi pathway. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of the RXLR-EER motifs redirected these effectors to the classical ER-to-Golgi secretion route and disrupted their association with EVs, indicating that the RXLR-EER motif plays a role in effector trafficking within the pathogen.</p><p id="P7">Our findings provide compelling evidence that the RXLR-EER motif governs effector trafficking within <italic>P. infestans</italic>, channelling them into an unconventional secretory route linked to EV production. This study deepens our understanding of effector biogenesis and secretion and highlights EVs as potential mediators of virulence protein delivery in plant-pathogen interactions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>RXLR effectors and apoplastic effectors are associated with different types of trafficking vesicles</title><p id="P8">Previous studies have shown that the secretion of RXLR effectors in <italic>P. infestans</italic> is largely insensitive to BFA, whereas the secretion of apoplastic effectors is BFA-sensitive. This differential response suggests that RXLR and apoplastic effectors utilize distinct secretion pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. To further explore this hypothesis, we co-expressed two apoplastic effectors, PiSCR74 and PiEPIC1, each C-terminally tagged with fluorescent proteins (mCitrine or mCherry respectively), in <italic>P. infestans</italic> and analyzed their localization using confocal microscopy. The two proteins exhibited substantial co-localization in puncta in cultured hyphae, consistent with the previous observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> that they are both trafficked through the conventional secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We have shown that RXLR effectors Pi04314 and Pi09216 strongly co-localized in cultured hyphae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Consistent with these findings, co-expression of Pi04314 and PiAVRblb1 also revealed robust co-localization, reinforcing the concept that RXLR effectors follow a common intracellular trafficking route (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). In contrast, when apoplastic effector PiSCR74 was co-expressed with RXLR effector Pi04314, the two proteins localized to distinct subcellular compartments, providing supporting evidence that RXLR and apoplastic effectors are sorted through different secretory routes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To investigate whether these effectors are associated with distinct populations of endosomal vesicles, we isolated endo-vesicles from cultured mycelia using a sucrose gradient that was bottom-loaded to allow vesicles to rise to their buoyant density and thus exclude protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy of the vesicle fractions (VFs) confirmed the presence of typical membrane-bound vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). Confocal imaging of the VFs revealed that fluorescent protein tagged PiSCR74 and PiEPIC1 largely co-localized within the same vesicle population. Furthermore, fluorescence signals from both effector fusions were abolished by pre-treatment with 1% TritonX-100 detergent, which disrupts lipid membranes but not protein aggregates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Similarly, two fluorescently tagged RXLR effectors Pi04314 and PiAVRblb1 largely co-localized within the same vesicle population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>). In contrast, Pi04314 and PiSCR74 fusions localized to separate vesicle populations. Similarly, their respective fluorescence signals were also detergent-sensitive, indicating membrane association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that apoplastic and RXLR effectors were all present in the vesicle fractions, and that detergent treatment abolished their presence in VFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). These results indicate their association with membrane-bound vesicular structures, supporting the conclusion that RXLR and apoplastic effectors are sorted into distinct vesicle types and follow different secretion pathways in <italic>P. infestans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>RXLR effectors follow a Golgi-independent route after cleavage</title><p id="P10">Given that apoplastic effectors are secreted via the conventional ER-to-Golgi pathway and that RXLR effectors are insensitive to BFA treatment, we hypothesized that RXLR effectors utilize a Golgi-bypass secretion mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we employed a molecular strategy involving the addition of an ER retention signal—KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu)—to the C-terminus of effector-fluorescent protein fusions. The KDEL motif is recognized by KDEL receptors (KDELRs) located in the cis-Golgi, which mediate retrograde transport of KDEL-tagged proteins back to the ER <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Proteins secreted via a Golgi-independent route are expected to escape this retention mechanism. To evaluate this, apoplastic (PiSCR74 and PiEPIC1) or RXLR (Pi04314 and PiAVRblb1) effector fluorescence protein fusions either with or without the KDEL motif, were expressed in <italic>P. infestans</italic> strains cultured in liquid medium. Immunoblotting revealed that apoplastic effectors were efficiently secreted under normal conditions, but their secretion was markedly reduced upon addition of KDEL, whereas the secretion of RXLR effectors was largely unaffected, indicating that their export does not primarily depend on Golgi-mediated trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We validated these findings <italic>in planta</italic> using confocal microscopy. All effectors accumulated at the haustorial interface under normal conditions. However, upon KDEL addition, apoplastic effectors accumulated in ER-like endomembrane compartments, consistent with receptor-mediated retention. In contrast, RXLR effectors accumulated at the haustorial interface even when fused to KDEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). These results strongly support the conclusion that apoplastic effectors are secreted through a conventional ER-Golgi pathway, whereas RXLR effectors are exported via a Golgi-bypass mechanism.</p><p id="P12">Our previous work showed that the RXLR-EER motif is not recognized or correctly cleaved in plant cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. To determine whether proteolytic processing of this motif influences the pathway of secretion, the RXLR effector Pi04314 — with or without its native signal peptide (SP) — was transiently expressed in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. Confocal microscopy revealed that the SP-containing version was secreted into the apoplast, whereas the version lacking the SP localized to the nucleus or nucleolus, the expected site of the effector activity <italic>in planta</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. While BFA treatment disrupted secretion of SP-tagged Pi04314, causing it to accumulation in BFA bodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, it did not alter the subcellular localization of NSP-Pi04314 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). Addition of a C-terminal KDEL motif caused SP-04314-RFP to be retained in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>), confirming that uncleaved RXLR effectors follow the conventional ER-Golgi pathway in plant cells. These results highlight the importance of appropriate recognition and cleavage of the RXLR-EER motif in directing these effectors toward an alternative, Golgi-bypass secretion route.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The RXLR-EER motif determines the secretion pathway</title><p id="P13">Given that the RXLR-EER motif functions as a protease processing site prior to secretion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, we sought to investigate whether this motif also determines the secretion route of RXLR effectors. In previous work, we showed that RXLR-EER motif mutants could still be secreted at haustoria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, but it is unclear if the secretion pathway was altered. To test this, we generated a mutant version of the RXLR effector Pi04314 in which the RXLR-EER motif was substituted with alanines (Pi04314-7A). Both wild-type (WT) and mutant versions were fused with different fluorescent proteins (mCherry or mCitrine) and co-expressed in <italic>P. infestans</italic>. Confocal microscopy of cultured hyphae revealed that the WT and mutant effectors localized to distinct vesicular compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Notably, the Pi04314-7A mutant co-localized significantly with apoplastic effector PiSCR74 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), suggesting a shift in its trafficking route. Endo-vesicle isolation from the same transformants confirmed that the RXLR-EER mutant was sorted into vesicles distinct from those carrying the wild-type RXLR effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), but largely co-localized with vesicles associated with apoplastic effector PiSCR74 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Importantly, addition of a KDEL motif to the RXLR-EER 7A mutants, for both Pi04314 and PiAVRblb1, significantly impaired their secretion into the culture medium (culture filtrate, CF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). <italic>In planta</italic>, these KDEL-tagged mutants displayed ER retention patterns similar to those observed for KDEL-tagged apoplastic effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>). These findings indicate that the RXLR-EER motif plays a key role in directing RXLR effectors into an unconventional, Golgi-independent secretion pathway, and its mutation leads to conventional ER-to-Golgi secretion.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The RXLR-EER motif govern the association of RXLR effectors with EVs</title><p id="P14">Our recent work suggested that RXLR effectors such as Pi04314 and PiAVRblb1 are associated with pellets containing EVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.

To investigate whether the RXLR-EER motif governs this co-association, we examined WT and RXLR-EER mutant versions of the effectors (Pi04314-7A and PiAVRblb1-7A) using EVs isolated from cultured mycelia and western blotting. Although the mutants were still detected in pellets containing EVs, their abundance that relative to total secretion (CF) was significantly reduced compared to the WT proteins, indicating diminished association with EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In contrast, the addition of a C-terminal KDEL motif to the WT Pi04314 or PiAVRblb1did not affect EV association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), consistent with our findings that KDEL does not alter the secretion route of RXLR effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To further assess the role of the RXLR-EER motif in EV targeting, Pi04314-7A was co-expressed with the EV marker PiMDP1 in <italic>P. infestans</italic>.

In contrast, WT Pi04314 strongly co-localized with PiMDP1 in the same endo-vesicle types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4b, c</xref>). Together, these findings demonstrate that the RXLR-EER motif and its processing are key determinantS of RXLR effector sorting into an unconventional secretion pathway associated with EV production.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">Our study provides compelling cell biological and genetic evidence that <italic>P. infestans</italic> deploys distinct secretion pathways for two major classes of effector proteins—apoplastic and RXLR-type cytoplasmic effectors. Whereas apoplastic effectors are secreted via the conventional ER-to-Golgi pathway, RXLR effectors utilize an unconventional secretion route that bypasses the Golgi. Critically, we demonstrate that the RXLR-EER motif is essential for determining the unconventional secretion of these cytoplasmic effectors and their association with extracellular vesicles (EVs).</p><p id="P17">Previously, sensitivity to the inhibitor BFA was used to distinguish between <italic>P. infestans</italic> apoplastic and cytoplasmic (RXLR) effector secretion pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. This approach was used also to demonstrate that apoplastic and cytoplasmic effectors from the fungal pathogen of rice and wheat, <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, were also secreted by conventional and unconventional pathways, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. However, BFA treatment can have off-target effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. As such, non-disruptive cell biological and genetic approaches are required to confirm inhibitor-based studies. We found that apoplastic effectors and RXLR effectors did not co-localise at mobile endo-vesicles in <italic>P. infestans</italic> hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>), consistent with their secretion via different pathways. Critically, whereas addition of a KDEL motif to the C-terminus of apoplastic effectors resulted in their retention in hyphae, consistent with retrograde trafficking of them from the Golgi to the ER, addition of a KDEL motif to RXLR effectors did not prevent their secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). These cell biological and genetic approaches, which agree with previously published BFA results <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, offer a non-disruptive means to distinguish between conventional and unconventional secretion pathways that could be adopted to verify previous findings in other fungi such as <italic>M. oryzae</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and investigate effector secretion in other pests and pathogens of plants or animals.</p><p id="P18">Importantly, we identified the RXLR-EER motif as a key determinant of unconventional secretion of these effectors. Mutating the RXLR-EER motif not only altered the intracellular localization of RXLR effectors—leading them to co-localize in endo-vesicles with apoplastic effectors—but also shifted their secretion to a Golgi-dependent route (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). When the RXLR-EER motif was mutated, effectors were retained in the ER upon addition of a KDEL tag, confirming they were secreted conventionally via the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). We thus argue that the RXLR-EER motif acts as an ER sorting signal to an unconventional, Golgi-bypass secretion path. Importantly, secretion of the WT RXLR effector Pi04314-mRFP by the plant <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> followed a conventional ER-to-Golgi pathway that was BFA-sensitive and prevented by addition of a KDEL motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). As we showed previously that there is no efficient proteolytic cleavage of Pi04314 during secretion by <italic>N. benthamiana</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> this strongly implicates such processing of the RXLR-EER motif as a requirement for sorting into an unconventional secretion pathway. Interestingly, our recent observation that RXLR effectors are often associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs), whereas apoplastic effectors are not<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, provides further evidence that these effector classes follow distinct secretion pathways. Our data here demonstrate that the RXLR-EER motif also governs the association of RXLR effectors with EVs. Whereas WT RXLR effectors co-localized with EV markers and were enriched in EV pellets, their RXLR-EER mutants showed diminished EV-association and failed to co-localize with EV markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). This suggests that the RXLR-EER motif has a critical role in the intracellular sorting of RXLR effectors toward an unconventional pathway associated with EV production.</p><p id="P19">The <italic>Phytophthora</italic> RXLR effectors have been described as analogous to PEXEL effectors delivered into human cells by the distantly-related apicomplexan malaria pathogen <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. PEXEL effectors contain a related motif, RxLxE/D/Q, which is also proteolytically processed during secretion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.
