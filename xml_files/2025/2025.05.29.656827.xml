To identify novel host defence factors targeted to intracellular bacteria, we developed a versatile proximity biotinylation approach coupled to quantitative mass spectrometry that maps the host-bacterial interface during infection. Using this method, we discovered that intracellular <italic>Shigella</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> become targeted by UFM1-protein ligase 1 (UFL1), an E3 ligase that catalyses the covalent attachment of Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1) to target substrates in a process called UFMylation. We show that <italic>Shigella</italic> antagonises UFMylation in a dual manner: first, using its lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to shield from UFL1 recruitment; second, preventing UFM1 decoration by the bacterial effector IpaH9.8. Absence of UFMylation leads to an increase of bacterial burden in both human cells and zebrafish larvae, suggesting that UFMylation is a highly conserved antibacterial pathway. Contrary to canonical ubiquitylation, the protective role of UFMylation is independent of autophagy. Altogether, our proximity mapping of the host-bacterial interface identifies UFMylation as an ancient antibacterial pathway and holds great promise to reveal other cell-autonomous immunity mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bacterial infection</kwd><kwd>cell-autonomous immunity</kwd><kwd>E3 ligases</kwd><kwd>proximity biotinylation</kwd><kwd><italic>Shigella</italic></kwd><kwd>ubiquitin-like systems</kwd><kwd>UFMylation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P5"><italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> is a human-adapted enteroinvasive pathogen that causes over 200 million episodes of bacillary dysentery annually worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.

Typhimurium become targeted by UFMylation, a highly conserved UBL system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> that has recently emerged as a major regulator of cell homeostasis. This is particularly well studied at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where UFMylation is involved in stress tolerance through ribosome-associated quality control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and selective ER autophagy (ER-phagy)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.

Here, we show that UFMylation also has a cell-autonomous immunity role against intracellular bacteria. We show that <italic>S. flexneri</italic> counteracts UFMylation via two distinct mechanisms: its LPS hampers the recruitment of the E3 ligase UFL1, and the secreted effector IpaH9.8 antagonises decoration of the UBL molecule UFM1 on the surface of intracellular bacteria. While UFMylated bacteria are not targeted to degradation by autophagy, lack of UFMylation leads to increased bacterial burden in human epithelial cells and zebrafish larvae. Together, we identify UFMylation as a highly conserved cell-autonomous immunity pathway against bacterial infection.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Proximity biotinylation approach at the host-bacterial interface identifies UFL1 as targeted to intracellular bacteria</title><p id="P9">Recognition and restriction of intracellular pathogens by cell-autonomous immunity provides an immediate and localised defence against infection before the organism can mount an immune response. Importantly, many cell-autonomous immunity mechanisms that host cells deploy against bacterial intruders are delivered to the bacterial surface. We exploited this feature to develop a proximity biotinylation approach that specifically maps host proteins at the interface between the host and the bacterial surface during <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infection (i.e., the bacterial “proxisome”). For this, we engineered <italic>S. flexneri</italic> to display anti-GFP nanobodies on its surface, which enabled their functionalisation in vitro with GFP-fused recombinant proteins such as APEX2, an engineered ascorbate peroxidase widely used for proximity biotinylation campaigns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a, b</xref>). In a second step, bacteria functionalised with GFP-APEX2 can be used in infection assays for the biotinylation of host proteins in close proximity to bacteria and subsequent identification by mass spectrometry. In vitro, we observed specific biotinylation of the <italic>S. flexneri</italic> surface when the anti-GFP nanobody was expressed and exogenous biotin-phenol and H2O2 were added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1c-e</xref>). We showed that GFP-APEX2 functionalised bacteria were able to infect HeLa cells and form actin tails and septin cages, which are considered hallmarks of the <italic>S. flexneri</italic> cytosolic lifestyle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a, b</xref>). In HeLa, biotinylated proteins appeared as a halo around the bacteria during infection in immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and as a smear during western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Biotinylation of the <italic>S. flexneri</italic> microenvironment also occurred in vivo during infection of zebrafish larvae, highlighting the versatility of the method beyond tissue culture cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Video 1</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Using this approach, we identified the proxisome of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> during infection in HeLa cells by label-free quantitative mass spectrometry. We compared the proxisomes generated by wildtype (WT) bacteria and bacteria lacking the transcriptional regulator MxiE, which controls expression of late T3SS effectors including important factors that antagonise cell-autonomous immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2c, d</xref>). To this end, HeLa cells were infected with GFP-APEX2 functionalised WT or Δ<italic>mxiE S. flexneri</italic> and biotinylated proteins were pulled-down for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS analysis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). We identified and quantified a total of 1.298 proteins of which 9 were <italic>S. flexneri</italic> proteins and 1.289 were human host proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). GO term enrichment analysis of the host proteins identified multiple pathways related to host-pathogen interactions relevant for <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infection, including actin filament-based transport, outer-mitochondrial membrane organisation or stress granule assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>). In addition, proteomic screening revealed that multiple members of the ubiquitylation machinery are recruited to the bacterial surface during infection, including 13 E3 ligases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>). One of the most enriched hits in the proxisome of the <italic>S. flexneri</italic> Δ<italic>mxiE</italic> was the E3 ligase ring finger protein 213 (RNF213), which was discovered to ubiquitylate the LPS of cytosolic <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and <italic>S. flexneri</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.

Considering the pivotal role of ubiquitin E3 ligases in host defence, we decided to focus on the E3 UFM1-protein Ligase 1 (UFL1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>), an enzyme that catalyses the covalent attachment of Ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (UFM1) to target proteins in a process called UFMylation similar to ubiquitylation. UFL1 had the second lowest p-value among the E3 ligases identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Together, we show that our proximity biotinylation approach is effective to identify novel host factors in close proximity to <italic>S. flexneri</italic> during infection, including UFL1 and other E3 ligases.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title><italic>S. flexneri</italic> LPS shields intracellular bacteria from recognition by the UFMylation ligase UFL1</title><p id="P11">Microscopy experiments validated the localisation of UFL1 and UFM1 to the surface of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> during infection in HeLa cells, using both HA-tagged exogenous expression and antibodies against the endogenous proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Considering that LPS is the bacterial substrate for ubiquitylation by the E3 ligase RNF213<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, we tested the impact of UFL1 and UFM1 recruitment to a <italic>S. flexneri</italic> mutant Δ<italic>rfaC</italic>, which lacks the O-antigen and the LPS outer core<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.

Despite some overlap between UFL1 and FK2 decoration (17.3% ± 4.4% of the bacteria), robust recruitment of UFL1 and FK2 rarely coincided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).

Importantly, a Yeast-Two-Hybrid screening for the <italic>S. flexneri</italic> secreted effector IpaH9.8 identified UFM1 as potential interaction partner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), suggesting that IpaH9.8 may prevent <italic>S. flexneri</italic> UFMylation. Immunoprecipitation assays using recombinantly expressed IpaH9.8 enhanced the recovery of UFM1 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). Binding studies using purified proteins confirmed a weak but direct interaction between GST-tagged IpaH9.8 and UFM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Meanwhile, as a control, GST-tagged ubiquitin showed no interaction with UFM1. To understand the interaction of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> with UFM1, we isolated bacteria from infected cells and probed for the presence of UFM1 conjugates by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).

Here, we pioneered a proximity biotinylation approach to specifically map the host-bacterial interface during infection. This strategy is particularly relevant to understand the proteomic microenvironment of cytosol-dwelling bacteria, since the isolation and proteomic characterisation of bacterial containing vesicles (BCVs) has been performed successfully for multiple vacuolar pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. In addition, our proximity biotinylation approach is highly versatile, as it is functional in tissue culture cells and in animal models, and it can be easily adaptable to any other genetically tractable Gram positive or negative bacteria.</p><p id="P20">Our proximity biotinylation screening identified multiple E3 ligases in close proximity to <italic>S. flexneri</italic> during infection. Among these, RNF213 was found enriched in bacteria lacking MxiE, an important transcriptional regulator for the expression of late T3SS effectors. Consistent with these results and serving as internal positive control for our screening, multiple studies have recently reported that <italic>S. flexneri</italic> deploys the bacterial effector IpaH1.4 (under MxiE transcriptional control) to target RNF213 to degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The proxisome of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> also revealed UFL1, the only identified E3 ligase of the UFMylation pathway, the latest UBL system discovered.</p><p id="P21">Our work has shown that both UFL1 and its substrate peptide UFM1 are recruited to the surface of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> and <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium during infection, which showed little to no overlap with bacterial ubiquitylation. The <italic>S. flexneri</italic> surface became UFMylated during infection, as bacteria recovered from infected cells presented UFM1-conjugates absent in bacteria from broth. In contrast to RNF213, which ubiquitylates LPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, the nature of the UFMylated substrates on <italic>S. flexneri</italic> is likely proteinaceous, as they appeared as discrete, well-defined bands on western blot.

First, the S<italic>. flexneri</italic> mutant Δ<italic>rfaC</italic> with shortened LPS showed an increased recruitment of UFL1, indicating that the LPS can shield intracellular bacteria from host recognition. It is worth noting that <italic>S. flexneri</italic> Δ<italic>rfaC</italic> is also more susceptible to septin cage entrapment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.

Likely reflecting the host-pathogen arms race, host cells also evolved to recognise intracellular LPS by caspase-4/-11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> and the TRAF-interacting forkhead-associated protein A (TIFA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> for inflammasome and NF-κB activation, respectively.
