Each capsomer contains a central pore lined with rings of positively charged amino acid side chains – Arg-18 (R18) and Lys-25 (K25). The R18 and K25 rings drive capsid assembly by binding the host polyanion inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) and are proposed to mediate the import of dNTPs into the capsid to facilitate reverse transcription. Here we demonstrate that the R18 ring can be functionally replaced by the introduction of a mutation (N21K) that establishes a new electropositive ring within the central pore. In contrast with previous studies in which R18 mutants were unable to adapt in culture, the N21K mutation facilitated the acquisition of second-site compensatory mutations that restored near-WT fitness to viral mutants lacking the R18 ring. Comparative analysis of several central pore mutants lacking the R18 ring revealed that particle infectivity was not correlated with IP6 binding or capsid assembly, but rather with capsid stability and key post-entry events including reverse transcription and nuclear entry. Our results indicate that the central pore plays critical roles in both the assembly of capsids and their sustained stability post-entry.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">HIV-1 particle assembly occurs at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of infected cells. This process is driven by the Gag polyprotein precursor, which assembles with the GagPol polyprotein precursor at a Gag:GagPol ratio of ∼20:1 into a spherical lattice, called the immature Gag lattice. The oligomerization of Gag is driven by its capsid (CA) domain, and upon completion of assembly, nascent virions bud from the cell as immature virus-like particles (VLPs). Concomitant with particle release, these VLPs undergo particle maturation in which the viral protease (PR), incorporated into virions as part of GagPol, proteolytically cleaves the Gag and GagPol precursors into the mature forms of their constituent domains. The final step of productive maturation occurs when the mature CA protein assembles into a closed conical structure – called the capsid – that encloses the viral RNA genome and enzymes reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN), and serves as the protective shell of the viral core. After viral entry, the capsid remains stable and intact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, acting as a container for reverse transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, and interacting with host factors to mediate nuclear entry and viral DNA integration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The HIV-1 capsid is composed of a predominantly hexameric lattice with approximately 250 hexamers and exactly 12 pentamers of the mature CA protein. The quasi-equivalent assembly of CA into both hexamers and pentamers, collectively called capsomers, is crucial for the formation of a closed capsid during maturation. Specifically, the inclusion of pentameric “defects” at either end of the capsid lattice induces the curvature required to close the lattice, resulting in the capsid’s characteristic conical structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In the presence of high salt, recombinant CA protein assembles into helical tubes composed entirely of hexamers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. However, in the presence of the host polyanion inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), CA assembles into capsid-like particles (CLPs) that are similar in size and shape to authentic HIV-1 capsids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Indeed, IP6 is a critical co-factor for HIV-1 replication owing to its role in promoting the assembly of a stable capsid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. IP6 also promotes virus assembly by binding and stabilizing the immature Gag lattice in a process that enriches virions with levels of IP6 necessary to build the capsid during maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">IP6 promotes the assembly of the HIV-1 capsid by binding to two amino acid side chains in the CA N-terminal domain – Arg-18 (R18) and Lys-25 (K25) – that form positively charged rings within a “central pore” in capsomers. Both the R18 ring and K25 ring can bind an individual IP6 molecule, and by neutralizing these positive charges lining the central pore, IP6 stabilizes capsomers. Mutations of either of these IP6-binding residues prevents proper capsid assembly and severely reduces particle infectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Consistent with the ability of IP6 to drive the in vitro assembly of CLPs, IP6 has been proposed to play a particularly important role in the formation of pentamers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Mutations at K25 prevent IP6-mediated CLP assembly <italic>in vitro</italic>, resulting instead in the assembly of helical CA tubes exclusively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our previous work demonstrated that K25A CLP assembly <italic>in vitro</italic> and closed capsid assembly in virions is restored by second-site compensatory mutations that likely restore pentamer formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. In addition to binding IP6, the central pore also binds dNTPs in an interaction that is driven primarily by R18, suggesting that dNTPs could be transported through the central pore to facilitate reverse transcription inside closed capsids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Optimal stability of the HIV-1 capsid after viral entry is critical for several post-entry functions required for productive infection. Efficient reverse transcription of the viral genome requires a closed, stable capsid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> to protect the viral nucleic acid from detection by host innate immune sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and to keep the RT enzyme associated with its RNA substrate. Additionally, stable capsids are required for the core to efficiently dock at the nuclear envelope and pass through the nuclear pore complex (NPC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. After nuclear entry and the completion of reverse transcription, the core undergoes uncoating, a process that is characterized by the disassembly of the capsid leading to the release of the viral DNA for integration into host chromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. The timing of uncoating is crucial for productive infection, and premature uncoating due to mutations that destabilize the capsid prevents efficient reverse transcription, nuclear entry, and integration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. IP6 stabilizes pre-formed capsids <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, however its role in stabilizing capsids in cells is less certain. Several studies have shown that depletion of IP6 in target cells does not disrupt HIV-1 infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. In contrast, the infectivity of select CA mutants with hypostable capsids is acutely reduced by IP6 depletion, suggesting that IP6 stabilizes capsids post-entry but that this stabilizing effect is not required for WT HIV-1 to complete a productive infection. IP6 has also been proposed to play a role in dNTP import through the central pore of capsomers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Ultimately, while the importance of the central pore and its interaction with IP6 is clear regarding capsid assembly, the significance of this interaction in infected cells post-entry and its implications for capsid stability, dNTP import, and reverse transcription are not well understood.</p><p id="P6">Here we examine the role the central pore of HIV-1 capsomers by determining the consequences of replacing the R18 ring with a new positively charged ring in the central pore. We report that replacing the R18 ring facilitates the acquisition of second-site compensatory mutations that potently restore viral replication. Further manipulation of the central pore and comparative analysis of several mutants lacking the R18 ring reveal that the ability to bind IP6 and assemble capsids in vitro and in virions is not correlated with infectivity. However, we find that non-infectious central pore mutants lacking the R18 ring are defective for reverse transcription and nuclear entry, and that the mechanism underlying these defects is a lack of sustained capsid stability. Our findings indicate that, in addition to its well-established role in capsid assembly, the central pore plays an important part in maintaining the stability of capsids post-entry.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The R18 ring in the central pore of capsid hexamers can be replaced by a new positively charged ring at position 21</title><p id="P7">We recently reported that propagation of an HIV-1 mutant lacking the K25 ring (K25A) resulted in the rapid selection of second-site compensatory mutations that restore the ability of HIV-1 to assemble closed capsids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, our attempts to propagate several R18 mutants did not result in the acquisition of compensatory mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Importantly, in vitro assembly assays indicated that R18 and K25 play separate roles in capsid assembly with R18 driving CA hexamer formation and K25 driving CA pentamer formation. Therefore, we investigated how HIV-1 could adapt to a loss of the R18 ring. In an additional in-vitro selection K25A acquired the N21K substitution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Interestingly, N21 is located in helix 1 of CA ∼1 turn of the helix below R18 and above K25, and its side chain, like those of R18 and K25, is oriented toward the center of the central pore in the context of assembled capsomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). We reasoned that the introduction of a lysine at position 21 could establish an additional positively charged ring capable of interacting with IP6, and may facilitate enhanced adaptability in HIV-1 mutants lacking an electropositive ring at amino acid 18 in CA.</p><p id="P8">To test the hypothesis that the R18 ring can be functionally replaced, we transfected 293T cells with infectious molecular clones harboring R18A, N21K, or R18A/N21K mutations to produce virions and measured their specific infectivity in TZM-bl cells. R18A displayed no measurable levels of infection in our assay, whereas N21K demonstrated a ∼10-fold decrease in infectivity relative to wild-type (WT). Like R18A, R18A/N21K infectivity was often not measurable, however we were able to detect low levels of infection in some experimental replicates, suggesting that the infectivity of the R18A/N21K mutant is near the detection limit of our assay. Ultimately, R18A/N21K demonstrated a ∼4-log decrease in infectivity relative to WT HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). While these results indicate that the R18A/N21K mutant is severely defective, we postulated that this low-level infectivity may facilitate the acquisition of compensatory mutations upon propagation in T-cell lines. To test this, we transfected MT4 cells with pNL4-3-R18A/N21K and monitored replication kinetics by quantifying the RT activity in the supernatants. We observed a substantial (24-42 day) delay in replication of R18A/N21K relative to WT suggestive of the acquisition of compensatory mutations. We subsequently re-passaged virus collected from the peak of replication until replication kinetics resembled those of WT virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 C-E</xref>). We then extracted genomic DNA from infected cells collected at the peak of replication, PCR-amplified the Gag-coding region of the proviral DNA, and subjected these amplicons to sequencing analysis to identify compensatory mutations. We performed these selection experiments several times with multiple replicates and observed the acquisition of several potential compensatory mutations by R18A/N21K (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Table S1</xref>). Two mutations were located in amino acid residues within or adjacent to the central pore, including an alanine-to-serine substitution at position 18 (A18S), S16L, and H12Y (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2A</xref>). We also observed the A31T substitution which is present on the luminal surface of the CA hexamers and pentamers that comprise the capsid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2B</xref>). In subsequent experiments, we propagated R18S/N21K in MT4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 F, G</xref>) and observed a rapid acquisition of A31T or T216I, which we previously reported as a compensatory mutation that restores CA pentamer formation and closed capsid assembly to K25A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. These findings indicate that HIV-1 can acquire mutations both proximal and distal to the central pore capable of restoring replication to a mutant lacking the R18 ring.</p><p id="P9">To test the ability of the selected mutations to compensate for the loss of the R18 ring in the presence of N21K, we introduced each mutation into infectious molecular clones harboring R18A/N21K or R18S/N21K substitutions and compared their specific infectivity. We found that the addition of S16L, T216I, or the combination of H12Y and A31T (which were acquired together in an individual experiment, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Table S1</xref>) resulted in a 65-300-fold increase in R18A/N21K particle infectivity, though these mutants remained substantially (25-100-fold) less infectious than WT NL4-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3A</xref>). Remarkably, the change from an alanine (R18A/N21K) to a serine (R18S/N21K) resulted in a similar increase in particle infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). Furthermore, S16L (S16L/R18S/N21K), A31T (R18S/N21K/A31T), or T216I (R18S/N21K/T216I) restored R18S/N21K infectivity ∼30-fold to ∼30% that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). While these mutations do not confer a complete rescue, they confer a ∼3000-fold increase in infectivity over the R18A/N21K mutant that was used to initiate the selection experiments. H12Y did not increase R18S/N21K infectivity and did not enhance the ability of S16L or A31T to restore infectivity to R18S/N21K. Furthermore, the simultaneous addition of S16L and A31T to R18S/N21K antagonized the restorative effect conferred by each mutation individually (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3B</xref>). Finally, we engineered two additional mutants for comparison with S16<bold>L</bold>/R18<bold>S</bold>/N21<bold>K</bold> (hereafter called “LSK”). S16<bold>N</bold>/R18<bold>S</bold>/N21<bold>K</bold> (hereafter called “NSK”) was engineered because S16N has been previously reported to restore replication and infectivity to the replication-defective central pore mutant I15V<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. S16<bold>L</bold>/R18<bold>S</bold>/N21<bold>R</bold> (LSR) was engineered to test the effect of a different positively charged residue at position 21 in the absence of the R18 ring. Interestingly, despite only differing from the rescued LSK mutant by one amino acid, each of these mutants is completely non-infectious. Finally, we tested the replicative capacity of each of these mutant viruses in MT4 cells. The results were consistent with our infectivity measurements. Briefly, over 25 days in culture, WT, N21K, LSK, R18S/N21K/A31T (SKT), and R18S/N21K/T216I (SKI) each replicated with WT or near-WT kinetics, peaking at Day 4-8 post-transfection. Consistent with selection experiments, R18S/N21K (SK) replicated with a ∼10 day delay relative to WT, whereas R18A, R18S, R18A/N21K, NSK, and LSR showed no signs of replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S4</xref>). We also measured viral replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from four individual donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig S5</xref>). Whereas WT displayed rapid replication, peaking at day 4 post infection, LSK, SKT, and SKI showed delayed replication kinetics and virus production, peaking between day 8 and 10. We did not observe any signs of SK replication in PBMCs. Overall, these infectivity and replication data demonstrate while HIV-1 can adapt to the loss of the R18 ring, it remains extremely sensitive to changes in the central pore of capsomers.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Inositol phosphates bind and stabilize capsid hexamers lacking the R18 ring</title><p id="P10">Upon confirming that the N21K substitution restores infectivity to HIV-1 mutants lacking a positively charged ring at position 18 in CA, we sought to understand how these changes to the central pore affect the ability of ligands IP6 and dNTPs to bind and stabilize CA hexamers. To address this question, we expressed and purified CA hexamers for three variants demonstrating vast differences in particle infectivity – WT (100% infectivity), LSK (∼30% infectivity), and NSK (non-infectious) – and subjected these hexamers to several biochemical and structural analyses. Our finding that N21K restores infectivity and replication to HIV-1 mutants lacking a positively charged amino acid at position 18 in CA suggests that this change functionally replaces the R18 ring with a new positively charged ring of amino acids at position 21 (K21 ring). To confirm the presence of a new electropositive ring at K21, we solved crystal structures of LSK and NSK crosslinked CA hexamers crystallized in the presence of IP6 and compared their central pores to that of our previously solved WT structure (PDB 6R6Q) in which two IP5 molecules were resolved within the central pore – one bound above the R18 ring and another coordinated by the surrounding K25 rings. While the structures of the central pores of WT, LSK, and NSK CA hexamers were largely similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), the data confirmed that the N21K mutation introduces a new ring of positively charged residues just above the K25 ring. In the LSK and NSK structures, this K21 ring participates in electrostatic interactions with a molecule of IP6 bound at the center of the K25 ring. Most notably, LSK and NSK CA hexamers lack an IP6 molecule bound at the top of the pore where IP6 has been shown to interact with the R18 ring in WT CA hexamers and pentamers. Presumably, this is because the R18S mutation removes the positively charged side chains required to coordinate an IP6 molecule. Interestingly, the sharing of a single molecule of IP6 by the K21 and K25 rings in the LSK and NSK structures is reminiscent of how IP6 binds to the immature Gag lattice, in which one IP6 molecule is coordinated by the CA-K158 and CA-K227 rings at the center of Gag hexamers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The similarity observed in the structure of the central pore of LSK and NSK CA hexamers and their similar interactions with IP6 suggests that the ability to bind IP6 is not the mechanism underlying the observed differences between the infectivity of LSK and NSK.</p><p id="P11">To more directly compare the ability of LSK and NSK to bind IP6, we used nano differential scanning fluorimetry to quantify the extent to which IP6 and other inositol phosphates enhance the thermal stability of CA hexamers. In the absence of inositol phosphates, we observed no difference in the stability of WT and LSK CA hexamers, whereas NSK CA hexamers were significantly more stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, compare white bars). Thermal stability of CA hexamers was increased by the addition of the inositol phosphates IP2 (1,4), IP3 (1,4,5), IP4 (1,3,4,5), IP5 (1,3,4,5,6), and IP6 for each variant. As expected, CA hexamers were most potently stabilized by IP6. Peak thermal stability in the presence of IP6 was highest for NSK CA hexamers, though the shift in thermal stability induced by IP6 was greater for WT and LSK CA hexamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, compare white and dark blue bars). This observation is likely due to the increased inherent stability of NSK CA hexamers, resulting in a lower thermal stability shift in the presence of IP6. These data are consistent with our structural observations, which did not reveal substantial differences in the ability of LSK and NSK to interact with IP6 in the context of CA hexamers.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>NSK assembles capsids in vitro and in virions</title><p id="P12">While the use of crosslinked hexamers is useful for the study of capsid-host interactions in vitro, we sought to investigate the effect of LSK and NSK on IP6 binding in a more biologically relevant in vitro system. We therefore used an in vitro turbidity assay in combination with negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) to assess the ability of IP6 to drive the assembly of LSK and NSK CA protein into CLPs that broadly recapitulate the size and shape of authentic HIV-1 capsids. We mixed mature WT, LSK, or NSK CA protein with 5 mM IP6 and measured the kinetics of assembly by quantifying the increase in optical density at 350 nm (OD<sub>350</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). While LSK and NSK CA protein assembled with slower kinetics than WT (with NSK assembling slightly faster than LSK), negative-stain EM revealed an abundance of CLP structures present across all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Similar results were obtained when assembly reactions were performed in the presence of 1.5 and 3 mM IP6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S6</xref>). This finding suggests that although LSK and NSK CA assembles less efficiently than WT in the presence of IP6, each can assemble <italic>in vitro</italic> into the closed conical capsid structure that is required for infection.</p><p id="P13">Next, we sought to determine the effect of the LSK and NSK mutations on the ability of HIV-1 to properly assemble capsids in virions. We produced non-infectious WT, LSK, and NSK virions in 293T cells and assessed capsid morphology using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). For each virus, we observed a range of capsid morphologies and classified each imaged virion into one of four morphological categories: immature, mature (conical), mature (tubular), and mature (irregular) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 A and B</xref>). Roughly 75% of WT virions displayed the conical or tubular capsid morphologies that are associated with productive infection, whereas only ∼50% of LSK and NSK virions contained conical or tubular capsids. Notably, the number of LSK and NSK virions containing irregular capsid morphologies was doubled that of WT virions. These findings are consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> assembly results showing that LSK and NSK CA can assemble into CLPs, but do so less efficiently than WT. Finally, the similarity in the distribution of capsid morphologies found in NSK and LSK virions suggests that, despite the complete lack of particle infectivity displayed by NSK, it is not defective for capsid assembly.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>NSK is defective for reverse transcription in cells and in vitro</title><p id="P14">The central pore of capsomers and its interaction with IP6 is crucial for the assembly of the HIV-1 capsid. However, our comparison of the LSK and NSK central pore mutants, in which we deliberately manipulated the IP6 binding site, reveals that the drastic differences in the particle infectivity of these mutants cannot be explained by differences in the ability of IP6 to bind and stabilize CA hexamers or facilitate capsid assembly. To understand the mechanism underlying the differences in particle infectivity between LSK and NSK, we quantified the accumulation of RT products in SupT1 cells infected with replication-incompetent WT, LSK, and NSK virions pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) protein. We also included the R18S/N21K (SK) mutant and the rescued R18S/N21K/A31T (SKT) and R18S/N21K/T216I (SKI) mutants in this analysis for comparison. WT early (minus-strand strong stop) and late (second-strand transfer) RT products accumulated rapidly during the first 6 hours post-infection (hpi) and continued to rise slowly between 6 and 12 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 A and B</xref>). The rescued mutants LSK, SKT, and SKI showed similar reverse transcription kinetics, though the total copy numbers were ∼1.5-3-fold lower than WT at each time point. In contrast, SK and NSK displayed only minor accumulation of early and late RT products over the course of infection. Thus, the levels of SK and NSK RT products decreased progressively relative to WT at each time point collected. At 12 hpi, SK early and late RT products were reduced 20- and 50-fold, respectively, relative to WT, and NSK early and late RT products were reduced 50- and 200-fold. We also quantified the accumulation of 2-LTR circles, which form only in the nucleus and thus provide a measure of nuclear import of viral DNA. Similar to the results observed for RT products, LSK, SKT, and SKI displayed only modestly reduced levels of 2-LTR circles, whereas SK and NSK displayed drastic reductions (50-300-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Importantly, the reductions in RT products and 2-LTR circles for each of these mutants relative to WT correlate well with the infectivity defects displayed by each of these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>): WT &gt; LSK, SKT, &amp; SKI &gt; SK &gt; NSK. This suggests that the primary biological mechanism underlying the infectivity defects induced by replacing the R18 ring with the K21 ring is decreased efficiency of reverse transcription and nuclear entry.</p><p id="P15">There are two possible mechanisms that may explain how the changes that we made in the central pore could affect the efficiency of reverse transcription. First, we have previously shown that R18 plays a key role in the binding to dNTPs, which have been proposed to translocate through the central pore to facilitate reverse transcription inside closed capsids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, the replacement of the R18 ring with a K21 ring may prevent efficient dNTP binding and import into the lumen of the viral capsid, depriving RT of the substrates that it requires for viral DNA synthesis. We therefore measured the ability of ATP and dATP to stabilize WT, LSK, and NSK crosslinked CA hexamers. Whereas WT CA hexamers display increased thermal stability upon the addition of ATP and dATP, LSK and NSK CA hexamers were only marginally stabilized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S7A</xref>). Consistent with this finding, fluorescence polarization (FP) assays revealed that the affinity of ATP for LSK (K<sub>d</sub>= 161.5 μM) and NSK (K<sub>d</sub>= 112.9 μM) CA hexamers is ∼10-fold lower than its affinity for WT (K<sub>d</sub>= 12.31 μM) CA hexamers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S7B</xref>). We previously reported that the R18G mutation results in a ∼1000-fold decrease in the affinity of ATP for CA hexamers, suggesting that the introduction of the N21K mutation significantly restores nucleotide binding in the absence of the R18 ring, though not to fully WT levels. These data suggest that less efficient binding to dNTPs may contribute to the reverse transcription defects that we observed. However, the finding that the reduction in ATP binding is similar for LSK and NSK indicates that nucleotide binding to the central pore does not fully explain the vast differences in infectivity and reverse transcription exhibited by LSK and NSK.</p><p id="P16">The second mechanism that may explain how the changes to the central pore may alter the efficiency of reverse transcription is perturbed capsid stability post-entry. While the initial assembly of the capsid in virions is required for efficient reverse transcription and infection, capsids also must remain closed and stable after viral fusion, acting as a container for reverse transcription and a barrier to sensing by the innate immune system. We therefore tested the ability of WT, LSK, and NSK virions to reverse transcribe their genomes in an endogenous reverse transcription (ERT) assay. Briefly, virions were incubated with dNTPs, IP6, and streptolysin O (SLO), a pore-forming toxin that disrupts the integrity of the viral membrane, for 6 hours at 37°C. The pore-forming activity of SLO allows IP6 and dNTPs access to the interior of the virion to facilitate reverse transcription inside closed IP6-stabilized capsids. Consistent with our quantification of RT products in infected cells, the production of early (MSSS), intermediate (first-strand transfer, FST), and late RT products was slightly reduced for LSK relative to WT. However, the reduction in RT products exhibited by NSK relative to WT and LSK was considerably less severe than in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 D-F</xref>, white bars; G-H, compare white and grey bars). Identical ERT reactions performed in the presence of DNase reduced the quantity of all RT products for each virus. Because DNase is too large to enter a closed capsid, we interpreted this reduction in RT products as a consequence of DNase-mediated digestion of reverse transcripts that were not protected by a closed capsid. WT RT products were least susceptible to DNase treatment, whereas LSK RT products displayed modest susceptibility to DNase. NSK RT products, particularly late RT products were highly susceptible to DNase digestion, suggesting that a large percentage of NSK RT products were not protected within closed capsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 D-F</xref>, blue bars). Importantly, the relative production of WT, LSK, and NSK RT products observed in the presence of DNase closely recapitulates the results we obtained in cells at 6 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 G &amp; H</xref>, compare white and black bars). Together, our reverse transcription measurements in cells and in vitro suggest that NSK capsids are inherently unstable, leading to a loss of integrity upon disruption of the viral membrane. In cells, we posit that this loss of NSK capsid integrity occurs shortly after viral fusion and leads to the rapid disassembly of the capsid and severely reduced reverse transcription due to the diffusion of the RT enzyme from its RNA substrate. In our ERT assay, we suspect that in the absence of DNase, the loss of NSK capsid integrity occurs after permeabilization of the viral membrane by SLO. However, because the overall architecture of the viral membrane remains intact, large-scale capsid disassembly and the loss of the RT enzyme is slowed, allowing reverse transcription to continue even after loss of capsid integrity. Finally, the milder sensitivity to DNase displayed by LSK suggests that LSK capsids are considerably more stable than NSK capsids, but less stable than WT capsids.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Mutants lacking the R18 ring demonstrate variable capsid stability, nuclear envelope docking, and nuclear entry</title><p id="P17">To test the inherent stability of the central pore mutant capsids after viral membrane permeabilization, we utilized a previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> TIRF microscopy assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Briefly, WT and several central pore mutants (R18S, N21K, SK, LSK, and NSK) virions were produced using a GagPol construct with EGFP inserted between its MA and CA domains and flanked by viral protease cleavage sites. During viral maturation, EGFP is passively incorporated into capsids and serves as a fluid-phase marker that is released upon capsid rupture. EGFP-labeled virions were immobilized, permeabilized with SLO in the presence or absence of IP6 for 30 minutes, and imaged to quantify the number of virions containing intact capsids. Consistent with previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, in the absence of IP6, we observed very low EGFP+ particle counts for WT and all central pore mutants relative to virus-only controls, suggesting that in the absence of added IP6 capsids rapidly rupture after membrane permeabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). In the presence of IP6, we observed markedly increased EGFP+ particle counts for WT, N21K, and LSK virions, suggesting that these capsids remained intact in the presence of IP6. In contrast, we observed substantially smaller increases in intact SK and NSK capsids in the presence of IP6, while R18S virions displayed no increase in intact capsids in this condition. These results are broadly consistent with the differences in infectivity and reverse transcription measurements for these mutants and suggest that the inherent stability of capsids is the primary mechanism underlying these observed differences.</p><p id="P18">To further investigate the effect of IP6 on the capsid stability of CA mutants lacking the R18 ring, we measured the effect of IP6 depletion in target cells on particle infectivity. Several studies have reported that while WT HIV-1 infectivity is unaffected by the depletion of IP6 in target cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, the infectivity of certain CA mutants that assemble inherently unstable capsids is severely reduced in such cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. We therefore compared the infectivity of WT and several central pore mutants (N21K, SK, LSK, SKT, SKI) in wild-type 293T cells (parental) and cells in which IPPK, the host enzyme that phosphorylates IP5 to synthesize IP6, was knocked out (IPPK KO). As a positive control we also measured the effect of IP6 depletion on the hypostable CA mutant virus P38A. Consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, WT HIV-1 infectivity was similar in parental and IPPK KO cells, whereas P38A infectivity was reduced ∼30-fold in IPPK KO cells relative to parental cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure S8</xref>). Our central pore mutants showed much milder sensitivity to target cell IP6 depletion. SK and LSK infectivity was reduced ∼3-fold, and N21K and SKT displayed a 2-fold reduction in infectivity in IPPK KO cells. We also observed a statistically significant, but minor, increase in SKI infectivity in IPPK KO cells. We were unable to test NSK in these experiments as its infectivity was below the detection limit of our assay in both cell lines. The mild sensitivity to IP6 depletion displayed by LSK may be indicative of a slight reduction in capsid stability and is consistent with the mild DNase sensitivity observed in our ERT experiments. However, the SK mutant, which demonstrates significantly reduced capsid stability in our TIRF assay, displays the same mild sensitivity to target cell IP6 depletion. This suggests that the effects of target cell IP6 depletion on the infectivity of CA mutants are not necessarily correlated with capsid stability and should be interpreted with caution.</p><p id="P19">We next sought to determine the ability of our central pore mutant capsids to dock at the nuclear pore and enter the nucleus. We produced WT, LSK, and NSK virions from 293T cells expressing YFP-labeled APOBEC3F that is resistant to Vif-mediated degradation (A3F-E289K-YFP) and infected HeLa cells with these virions. A3F-YFP is a host restriction factor that is packaged into virions and is incorporated into HIV-1 capsids via its interaction with the viral ribonucleoprotein, providing a marker for the subcellular localization of capsids in infected cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Infected cells were fixed 6 hours post-infection and discrete YFP-positive particles were quantified in the nucleus and at the nuclear envelope (NE) using confocal microscopy. The percentage of NSK particles at the NE and in the nucleus was severely reduced relative to WT and comparable to the level of WT particles in the presence of the capsid inhibitor PF74, which destabilizes the capsid and prevents NE docking and nuclear entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). LSK capsids docked at the NE with WT-efficiency, but displayed a modest 2-fold decrease in nuclear entry relative to WT. These data are consistent with the reduction in 2-LTR circles that we observed for NSK and LSK. Based on the preceding results, and because optimal capsid stability is required for NE docking and nuclear entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, we propose that NSK capsids are inherently unstable, resulting in essentially no NE docking, nuclear entry, or infection. In contrast, LSK capsids are stable enough to dock at the nuclear pore complex (NPC), but do not pass through the NPC as efficiently as WT capsids, leading to a modest decrease in infectivity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">Each capsomer in the HIV-1 capsid lattice contains a central pore that binds IP6 to facilitate capsid assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The central pore also binds dNTPs, which are proposed to translocate through the pore to facilitate DNA synthesis inside the capsid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. These binding events are coordinated by two positively charged rings (R18 and K25) that line the inner rim of the central pore. Our previous work produced two findings that are relevant to this study. First, we found that HIV-1 is unable to adapt to the loss of its R18 ring, whereas mutation of the K25 ring can be readily compensated for by mutations in CA that do not re-establish a positively charged ring in the central pore. Second, we found that the K25 ring is particularly important for the assembly of closed capsids during maturation. This finding is consistent with several other studies that have shown that mutations within the central pore prevent proper capsid assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,38-40</sup>.</p><p id="P21">In this study we engineered a mutation (N21K) in combination with R18A designed to replace the R18 ring with a new positively charged ring in the central pore (K21 ring). In contrast to all single R18 mutants tested previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, R18A/N21K acquired second-site compensatory mutations in CA that restored its infectivity and replication upon propagation in MT4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). These mutations did not result in the introduction of any new charged rings in the central pore, indicating that the R18 ring can be functionally replaced by the K21 ring (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2</xref>). Comparative structural and biochemical analysis of a rescued mutant, S16L/R18S/N21K (LSK), and a completely non-infectious mutant (S16N/R18S/N21K, NSK) revealed no differences in IP6 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 A-C</xref>), in vitro CLP assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), or core formation in virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that capsid assembly can occur at near-WT efficiency even in absence of the R18 ring and the molecule of IP6 with which interacts. In contrast, we observed a severe defect in the ability of NSK to undergo reverse transcription in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 A-C</xref>). This finding combined with NSK’s sensitivity to DNase in our endogenous reverse transcription assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 D-F</xref>) and reduction in particles upon viral membrane permeabilization in our TIRF assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> suggests that NSK capsids are inherently unstable and break open shortly after fusion. This interpretation is supported by our confocal microscopy analyses that demonstrate that NSK capsids are defective in nuclear envelope docking and nuclear entry. Overall, our findings establish a role for the central pore in promoting the sustained stability of HIV-1 capsids that appears to be independent of its ability to bind IP6.</p><p id="P22">Our finding that HIV-1 can replicate in the absence of the R18 ring is noteworthy in light of early structural studies that described the R18 ring as the only binding site for IP6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. While several subsequent studies have confirmed that the K25 ring can also coordinate an IP6 molecule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, the R18 ring likely binds IP6 with greater affinity owing to the tighter packing of its side chains and its closer proximity to the outer surface of the capsid. Our LSK and NSK crystal structures demonstrate that the R18:IP6 interaction is lost upon replacement of the R18 ring with the K21 ring, suggesting that the R18 ring and its interaction with IP6 are not absolutely required for HIV-1 replication. We previously came to a similar conclusion regarding the importance of the K25 ring based on the ability of second-site compensatory mutations to restore infectivity and replication to K25A. However, a key difference in the relative importance of these two positively charged rings is that while the R18 ring can facilitate replication as the sole electropositive ring within the central pore, the K25 ring requires the introduction of an additional electropositive ring in the absence of R18. We speculate that this is due to lower affinity between IP6 and the K25 ring relative to the R18 ring, leading to a requirement for additional clustering of positively charged side chains to efficiently coordinate IP6.</p><p id="P23">Our finding that NSK capsids are inherently unstable but not assembly-defective indicates that the central pore plays a role in maintaining the stability of the HIV-1 capsid post-entry. Most reported central pore mutations that reduce particle infectivity are unable to efficiently assemble capsids during particle maturation. Notable exceptions are R18G and R18L, which are capable of assembling into normal cones, but also display aberrant capsid morphologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Given the importance of the central pore in binding IP6 and the ability of IP6 to stabilize capsids, our finding that mutations within the central pore can destabilize capsids seems intuitive. However, we were unable to detect notable differences in the ability of IP6 to bind or stabilize LSK and NSK CA hexamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 A and B</xref>), suggesting that the differences in the inherent stability of LSK and NSK capsids is unrelated to their ability to bind IP6. One caveat regarding this conclusion is that our crystallography and thermal stability measurements were performed with isolated, crosslinked CA hexamers. It is therefore possible that these experiments do not fully recapitulate the stabilizing effect of IP6 in the context of a complete capsid lattice composed of native hexamers and pentamers.</p><p id="P24">The LSK and NSK mutants differ at a single amino acid position (S16L vs. S16N). Why a leucine (LSK) at position 16 restores infectivity ∼30-fold, whereas an asparagine (NSK) completely blocks infectivity in the context of the R18S/N21K mutations is unclear. This is especially surprising because the Ser-to-Asn substitution is a more conservative amino acid change than Ser-to-Leu. The lack of even subtle differences in the hexamers of LSK vs NSK suggests that any structural changes associated with the different mutations are either not present in the cross-linked proteins used for study or occur between capsomers within the lattice. There may also be functional differences, for instance in dNTP import. The central pore is the channel through which dNTPs are putatively imported into the capsid to facilitate viral DNA synthesis. Importantly, the R18 and K25 rings have each been proposed to play a role in this process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Notably, it is the polar side-chains at residue 16 that negatively affect infectivity (S16 or N16) whereas the non-polar leucine (L16) increases it. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the hydrophobic substitution at position 16 is needed to promote the import of nucleotides into the capsid interior and disfavor dissociation back out of the pore. Whilst there is no direct evidence for the role of position 16 in nucleotide import, NSK is clearly impaired for reverse transcription compared to LSK.</p><p id="P25">However, we did not observe substantial differences in the ability of ATP to bind or stabilize LSK and NSK CA hexamers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S7</xref>). Consistent with the key role that R18 plays in dNTP binding to the central pore, both LSK and NSK exhibited a ∼10-fold reduction in ATP binding affinity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S7</xref>). This reduction in ATP binding is less severe than the ∼100-fold reduction exhibited by R18G CA hexamers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, suggesting that the N21K mutation partially restores dNTP binding in the absence of the R18 ring. Because LSK remains capable of reverse transcribing its genome with near-WT efficiency, we propose that this reduction in nucleotide affinity is not sufficient to alter the kinetics of viral DNA synthesis. Importantly, the lack of differences in nucleotide binding displayed by LSK and NSK support our conclusions that capsid stability, rather than dNTP import, is the primary mechanism driving the differences in LSK and NSK infectivity.</p><p id="P26">In summary, our findings highlight the flexibility of the placement of the positively charged rings within the central pore of HIV-1 capsomers while simultaneously demonstrating the sensitivity of HIV-1 to changes within the central pore. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate the critical roles that the central pore plays in both the assembly of the HIV-1 capsid during particle maturation and sustained stability of the capsid post-entry.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cells</title><p id="P27">MT4 and SupT1 T-cell lines were acquired from American Type Culture Collection (ATTC) and cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2mM L-glutamine, penicillin (100U/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL).

Infected cells were then fixed, stained with BioTracker 650 Red Nuclear Dye, and imaged by confocal microscopy to determine the subcellular localization of HIV-1 capsids. An additional condition in which WT-infected cells were treated with 10 μM PF74 was used as a negative control. (A) Representative confocal images showing HIV-1 capsids labeled with A3F-E289K-YFP at the nuclear envelope (open triangle) and inside the nucleus (filled triangle). Scale bar, 10 μm. (B) YFP-positive particles at the nuclear envelope were quantified as a percentage of the total particles in the cytoplasm and expressed as a percentage of WT in untreated cells. (B) YFP-positive particles in the nucleus were quantified as a percentage of the total particles in the cell and expressed as a percentage of WT in untreated cells. Statistical significance was determined by paired t-test (p-value summary: &gt;0.05 = not significant; &lt;0.05 = *; &lt;0.01 = **; &lt;0.001 = ***; &lt;0.0001 = ****).
