The immune dysregulation caused by the parasite may lead to bacterial superinfections and increase mortality. We reveal that <italic>Pf</italic> exploits extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by infected red blood cells (iRBC-EVs) to deliver host-derived miR451a to human neutrophils, impairing their antimicrobial defences. Neutrophil phagocytosis of iRBC-EVs suppresses reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and compromised microbicidal activity against <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>. Microfluidic assays show that miR451a transfer significantly disrupts neutrophil chemotaxis and swarming upon microbial challenge. Transcriptomic profiling indicates that EVs and miR451a reprogram neutrophil gene expression, notably upregulating ferroptosis-related genes, suggesting a role in further impairing immune responses. We have uncovered a novel mechanism of iRBC-EVs-induced neutrophil immune suppression and provide insights into increased susceptibility to bacterial superinfections in malaria. These findings have implications for therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating bacterial superinfections and sepsis in malaria-endemic regions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Malaria</kwd><kwd><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic></kwd><kwd>extracellular vesicles</kwd><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>microRNAs</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Malaria remains a significant global health challenge, with nearly half of the world’s population at risk of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Snow et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Venkatesan, 2024</xref>). In 2022, there were an estimated 249 million cases of malaria, leading to 608,000 deaths worldwide. Alarmingly, the majority of these deaths was in children younger than the age of 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Organization., 2022</xref>). Beyond causing direct mortality, malaria indirectly contributes to deaths by compromising the host immune response and heightening vulnerability to secondary infections from bacteria or fungi. Indeed, infection with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, the most virulent malaria parasite species, has been linked to an elevated risk of invasive bacterial infections, which are associated with high mortality rates among children suffering from severe malaria in sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Were et al., 2011</xref>). While the correlation between malaria and fungal infections is poorly documented, there is an increasing number of clinical reports on fungi associated malaria infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dabritz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Eckerle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hocqueloux et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Ruhnke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Wilson et al., 2000</xref>). The underlying mechanism for the increased risk of co-infection is not fully understood.</p><p id="P4">Neutrophils are important in pathogen defense through processes such as inflammation, NETs formation, ROS production and swarming behavior around invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hopke et al., 2020</xref>). However, malaria infection has been linked to defective neutrophil responses. For instance, malaria patients often exhibit significantly reduced neutrophil counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kotepui et al., 2014</xref>), and neutrophils in these patients have been reported to exhibit reduced oxidative burst, reduced pathogen phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cunnington et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cunnington et al., 2012</xref>) and impaired chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Leoratti et al., 2012</xref>). This may partly explain the increased susceptibility to bacterial superinfection observed during malaria. While the exact cause of neutrophil impairment during malaria is ill defined, several hypotheses have been formulated such as the increase of free heme in circulating blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cunnington et al., 2011</xref>) and release of digestive vacuoles from the iRBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dasari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dasari et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P5">During blood stage, the parasite releases membranous material in the form of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are small vesicles ranging from 30 to 150 nm (exosomes) and 150 nm to 1–2 μm (microvesicles) in diameter. In severe malaria cases, the number of EVs derived from malaria-infected red blood cells (iRBCs) in patient serum is significantly elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Nantakomol et al., 2011</xref>). EVs are known to shuttle biological materials such as cytosolic proteins, lipids, DNA and RNA. Beside their role in immune regulation, EVs have been reported to aid cell-to-cell communication between <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites to synchronize the transmission stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Regev-Rudzki et al., 2013</xref>), and between <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Mantel et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we hypothesized that circulatory iRBC-EVs could play an important role in the observed neutrophil dysfunction during malaria. Our data show that iRBC-EVs transfer the host miRNA, miR451a to neutrophils resulting in several functional impairments. These results provide new insights into the molecular basis of neutrophils dysfunction in malaria and highlight the role of EVs as key mediator of host-parasite interactions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Fungi</title><p id="P6"><italic>Candida albicans</italic> SC5314 constitutively expressing a far-red fluorescent protein was cultured overnight at 30°C with shaking in YPD broth media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hopke et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Plasmodium falciparum in Vitro Culture</title><p id="P7">The 3D7 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain was kept in fresh type O<sup>+</sup> human erythrocytes suspended at 2% hematocrit in HEPES-buffered RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich), containing 10% (w/v) heat inactivated human serum, 0.5 mL gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich), 2.01 g sodium bicarbonate, and 0.05 g hypoxanthine at pH 6.74.

The host’s survival during blood stage malaria hinges on two defense strategies: resistance, which aims to eliminate parasites, and tolerance, which prioritizes host fitness over pathogen clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">McCarville and Ayres, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Medzhitov et al., 2012</xref>). While tolerance may reduce self-inflicted damage, it potentially compromises resistance to secondary infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Soares et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, neutrophil paralysis presents a double-edged sword: it benefits the parasite by reducing immune constraints yet potentially protecting the host from severe inflammatory damage. This delicate balance underscores the complex interplay between parasite virulence and host immune responses in determining malaria outcomes. Multiple factors released by iRBCs have been shown to promote tolerance by modulating the immune system, particularly through the suppression of neutrophil functions, such as heme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cunnington et al., 2011</xref>) and food vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dasari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dasari et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we show that EV treatment impaired several aspects of neutrophil functionality, including ROS production, chemotaxis, anti-bacterial activity and swarming. The neutrophil “paralysis” appears to be part of the complex immune modulation induced by both <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections. In malaria patients, neutrophils exhibit reduced chemotaxis and are a poor source of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Leoratti et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P48">First, we confirmed that iRBC-EVs are efficiently internalized by neutrophils in an endocytic manner similar to endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Mantel et al., 2013</xref>), in a process that requires actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dale et al., 2008</xref>). Coordinated neutrophil migration by swarming is crucial for arresting the growth and spread of various pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lammermann, 2016</xref>). We demonstrate that neutrophils-iRBC-EVs interaction alters the chemotactic response of human neutrophils towards fMLP, reduces their ability to swarm and to arrest the growth and progression of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Additionally, these interactions trigger NETosis in both whole blood and isolated neutrophils <italic>in vitro</italic>. While EVs might contribute to NET release during malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Knackstedt et al., 2019</xref>), the ability of neutrophils to form large swarm is reduced, resulting in diminished antimicrobial activity at infection sites and increased pathogen proliferation.</p><p id="P49">Furthermore, we showed that EVs diminished the capacity of neutrophils to produce ROS upon PMA stimulation, consistent with observations of reduced ROS production in children with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cunnington et al., 2012</xref>). Neutrophils treated with EVs also exhibit impaired killing of Gram-negative bacteria such as <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>. these findings suggest that EVs contribute to the neutrophil dysfunction observed in malaria patients, potentially increasing the risk of death from bacteremia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bachou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bronzan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mabey et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Orf and Cunnington, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P50">MiR451a is a microRNA critical for erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chapman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cheloufi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Murata et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Patrick et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Yu et al., 2010</xref>), is the most abundant miRNA in erythrocytes and regulates erythroblasts differentiation and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kakumani et al., 2023</xref>). Given that EVs can shuttle functional RNA between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Mittelbrunn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">O’Brien et al., 2020</xref>), we investigated whether miRNAs contained in EVs modulate neutrophil function. We focused on miR451a, due to its abundance in EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Babatunde et al., 2018</xref>). We demonstrated that EVs transferred miR451a to neutrophils. To further explore the molecular mechanisms, we generated a cell line overexpressing miR451a. HL-60<sup>miR451a</sup> differentiated toward a neutrophil-like phenotype displayed the “paralyzed neutrophil” features, implicating miR451a directly in the suppression of chemotaxis, swarming and antibacterial activity. Previous studies have shown that miR451a has immunoregulatory properties, with reduced expression of miR451a observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and elevation of miR451a expression markedly reduces neutrophil chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Murata et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to miRNAs, EVs from iRBCs can transfer parasitic genomic DNA to immune cells, activating STING-dependent DNA sensing and immune activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Sisquella et al., 2017</xref>). While genomic DNA in EVs may activate monocytes, EVs also suppress CXCL10 secretion by disrupting ribosome association with CXCL10 transcripts, highlighting the complex nature of EV-mediated immune modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Ofir-Birin et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P51">We next examined the effect of EVs on neutrophil transcriptional activity, particularly in response to bacterial stimulation. The transcriptomics data revealed that HO-1 is the most upregulated gene following EV treatment, whereas it is slightly downregulated by LPS alone.</p><p id="P52">HO-1, encoded by HMOX1, plays a key role in malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cunnington et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Silva et al., 2020</xref>), with promoter polymorphisms and high HO-1 levels associated with severe malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Walther et al., 2012</xref>). Evidence from the rodent model showed that HO-1 plays a protective role by inducing tolerance and reducing damage to the host, since mice deficient in HO-1 are more susceptible to cerebral malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Ferreira et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Pamplona et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P53">HO-1 is crucial role for heme catabolism and provides anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cytoprotective and vascular protection. Moreover, HMOX1 plays a complex and significant role in ferroptosis a form of programmed cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>). We found that several genes involved in ferroptosis were upregulated, neutrophils appear particularly sensitive to ferroptosis, which can promote tolerance and tumor growth by limiting antitumor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kim et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P54">Neutrophils are crucial players in the immune response to malaria, but their activation must be carefully regulated. While they contribute to parasite clearance, excessive neutrophil activation and NET formation can lead to tissue damage and exacerbate disease severity. Future research and therapeutic strategies may focus on harnessing the protective functions of neutrophils while mitigating their potential harmful effects in severe malaria.</p><p id="P55">Collectively, our <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggest that iRBC-EVs released during malaria contribute to the host immune suppression and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections by inhibiting neutrophil functions such as swarming and antimicrobial activity. Previous observations of elevated iRBC-EVs in severe malaria patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Nantakomol et al., 2011</xref>) strongly support a role for these vesicles in malaria pathology.</p><p id="P56">In summary, our study identifies miR451a-containing EVs from iRBCs as key mediators of neutrophil dysfunction, providing new insights into how malaria parasites subvert host immunity. By impairing critical neutrophil functions such as chemotaxis, swarming, and antimicrobial activity, these EVs contribute to both immune evasion and increased susceptibility to secondary infections. This dual effect underscores the complex evolutionary balance between parasite survival strategies and host defense mechanisms, where immune modulation may simultaneously limit immunopathology and compromise resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Su et al., 2025</xref>). Our findings highlight the importance of targeting EV-mediated pathways in future therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring neutrophil function and improving outcomes in malaria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="EMS206245-supplement-Supplementary_Data.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d65aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary video 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS206245-supplement-Supplementary_video_1.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d65aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary video 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS206245-supplement-Supplementary_video_2.mov" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="quicktime" id="d65aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary video 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS206245-supplement-Supplementary_video_3.mov" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="quicktime" id="d65aAcEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary video 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS206245-supplement-Supplementary_video_4.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d65aAcEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S30"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was partially supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant# 31003A_182729 and grant# CRSK-3_190848 to PYM), the Novartis foundation for medical-biological research (P.-Y.M.), he Kurt and Senta Herrmann Foundation, the Gottfried and Julia Bangerter-Rhyner-Stiftung (PYM) and the Research Pool of the University of Fribourg.
