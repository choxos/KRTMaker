This mutation entirely abrogates kinase activity, but strikingly no oncogenic phenotype is observed for the related inactivating mutation D463N indicating that the lack of activity is not the driver. In cells, the D463H mutant closely mirrored PKCα WT behaviours and retained ATP binding, contrary to the related D463N mutant. Mechanistically, the PKCα D463H mutant protein was found to display quantitative alterations to the PKCα interactome, enhancing association with epigenetic regulators. This aligned with transcriptomic changes which resembled an augmented PKCα expression program, with enhanced BRD4, Myc and TGFβ signatures. D463H dependent reduced sensitivity to the BET inhibitors JQ1 and AZD5153 indicates the functional importance of these pathways. The data show that D463H is a dominant gain-of-function oncogenic mutant, operating through a non-catalytic allosteric mechanism.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">There is a breadth of roles assigned to PKC family members in cancer, with examples of both tumour suppressor and tumour promoter actions for individual isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The complexities surrounding this family of kinases in part reflects isoform specificity and context, however underlying discrepancies may also reflect preconceptions. An intriguing example of this is the role of PKCα in chordoid glioma. In this circumscribed, low-grade but difficult to access CNS tumour, two groups published the finding of completely penetrant heterozygous clonal mutation in <italic>PRKCA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). The clonal somatic mutation repeatedly identified was a transversion (c.1387G&gt;C) that alters the catalytic aspartate of PKCα to a histidine residue (D463H). However, no LOH in the 17q24.2 locus, nor other consistent mutations, deletions, amplifications associated with <italic>PRKCA</italic> and no mutations in other oncogenes or tumour suppressors were reported for these tumours. The same D463H mutation was also documented by other groups in a 16 patient clinical study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) and in two case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), suggesting the mutation is a specific diagnostic marker of chordoid glioma. Intriguingly, extrapolating from the pioneering work on PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) this <italic>PRKCA</italic> mutation would be an inactivating mutation, hence the parsimonious conclusion would be a loss-of-function and a suppressor role for <italic>PRKCA</italic>. However, the heterozygous occurrence of the D463H mutation in chordoid glioma does not align with a classical suppressor role unless through dominant loss-of-function or haploinsufficiency. Such assumptions would seem nevertheless provocative as there is only one mutation found (D463H mutation) while there are many ways to inactivate PKCα.</p><p id="P4">Understanding the ‘sense’ of action of this penetrant <italic>PRKCA</italic> mutation and the apparent lack of other driver mutations, would offer vulnerability and opportunity to a non/post-surgical intervention in chordoid glioma. To address this, we used genetic models and comparative biochemistry. Here we show that a global heterozygous knock-in of the D463H mutation of <italic>Prkca</italic> in mice drives chondrosarcoma formation in very young neonates. We determined that the <italic>Prkca</italic> D463H mutation is a non-catalytic gain-of-function oncogenic mutation which drives a transcriptomic program resembling an augmented WT response. However, the catalytic activity of PKCα <italic>per se</italic> is not the trigger of the phenotype as a related knock-in inactivating mutation of the same residue (D463N) has no such effect either in a heterozygous or homozygous setting. The distinct behaviour of the D463H mutant is reflected by mutant specific alterations to the PKCα interactome, linking to transcriptomic changes and demonstration of a functional link to BRD4. A model of action of this unique PKCα oncogenic mutant is presented, impacting our wider appreciation of kinase behaviour, and prescribing a distinctive approach to intervention.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The heterozygous expression of <italic>Prkca</italic> D463H mutant in mice has a dominant harmful effect causing hindlimb deformation and neonatal death</title><p id="P5">To assess the in vivo impact of the PKCα D463H mutation we knocked-in a single allele into C57BL/6J mice using two different guide RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). From 3 litters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S1</xref>), 8 pups harboured the mutation (from 11% to 90% penetrance) of which all but 3 had to be culled within 2 weeks due to ill health. Only one male (22% penetrance) survived to breeding age. The WT mice from the same cohorts were healthy, suggesting that the presence of the <italic>Prkca</italic> mutation rather than a side effect of the CRISPR/Cas9 directed knock-in, was responsible for the morbidity of the animals.</p><p id="P6">In timed matings of the one surviving male mosaic mouse with C57BL/6J females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S2</xref>), 7 heterozygous mice were identified out of 46 pups from 6 different litters, indicating germline transmission and a roughly Mendelian segregation given the mosaic nature of this founder. The <italic>Prkca</italic> D463H heterozygotes pups were smaller or hunchbacked and were malnourished, needing to be culled at about 3 weeks despite the addition of high energy mash nutrition to encourage weight gain.</p><p id="P7">To determine whether the C57BL/6J mouse background might have contributed to the phenotype, we used outbred CD-1 mice that carry greater genetic diversity, are a more robust strain and produce larger litter sizes than inbred C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S3</xref>). Using sperm from the surviving male mosaic mouse, 3 heterozygotes from 4 litters were born. Despite the genetic background change the pups again showed signs of sickness with hindlimb deformation, typically becoming symptomatic at about 2 weeks of age. However, one het male survived longer (11 weeks) and was crossed with CD-1 females producing 4 heterozygotes in 12 progenies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S4</xref>), none of which survived to breeding age, but all of which displayed malnourishment and a hindlimb phenotype (see further below).</p><p id="P8">The intrinsic constraint on breeding and back-crossing to link genotype to phenotype, led us to perform a second round of gene editing. New mosaic mice were obtained from 8 litters on a C57BL/6J background (4 with guide RNA1 and 4 with guide RNA2) and 8 litters on an F1(B6 x CBA) background (4 with guide RNA1 and 4 with guide RNA2). From these litters 56/103 mice born were mosaic and as observed in the first round of CRISPR knock-ins the mosaic mice but not their WT littermates were malnourished and displayed deformation of the hindlimb. One mosaic male mouse from C57BL/6J background and one male from the F1(B6 x CBA) background that expressed 12% and 18% mutation penetrance respectively were selected for breeding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S5</xref>). Both mice were crossed with two WT CD-1 females producing 15/39 mice from the C57BL/6J male and 6/23 mice from the F1(B6 x CBA) male heterozygous for the D463H mutation. Yet again from the 5 litters obtained (62 mice in total) all the 21 heterozygotes were sickly and displayed a deformation of the hindlimbs. These findings support the conclusion that the heterozygous mutation was a trigger for the malnourished, hindlimb phenotype observed.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The <italic>Prkca</italic> D463H mutation elicits bilateral hindlimb chondrosarcoma</title><p id="P9">To address the penetrant hindlimb phenotype of the D463H heterozygotes, representative animals were imaged by CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). While the CT-scan of the hindlimb showed the extensive loss of weight and the bilateral leg deformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), no deformation was visible on the forelimbs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1A</xref>). Furthermore, CT scan of skulls showed a small decrease in size for the heterozygous mice which was not significant when related to overall body size and weight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1B</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The longitudinal and radial cross sections of the hindlimbs of representative D463H heterozygotes when compared to a WT littermate clearly showed the aberrant growth of cartilage and bones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Effacing the gracilis, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and gastrocnemius muscles there were bilateral, symmetrical, mesenchymal neoplasms, composed of moderately differentiated chondroblasts and chondrocytes surrounded by a pale cartilaginous matrix. There was moderate anisokaryosis and anisocytosis and only a single mitosis was observed in ten high-power fields (400x). The bulk of these neoplasms blended with an outer rim of poorly mineralized woven bone with a population of activated osteoblasts. Occasionally within the neoplasms there were entrapped segments of nerve fibres. There was no evidence of chronic inflammatory changes or haemorrhage. Forelimbs and the remaining soft tissues were histologically unremarkable. Based on both the histological appearance and the infiltrative nature of these proliferative lesions, they were consistent with well-differentiated chondrosarcomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). These lesions were associated with morbidity due to muscle and nerve compression and atrophy resulting in the disuse of the hindlimbs. The loss of weight was attributed to the lack of easy access to food due to the competition with the other pups for the mother’s milk. Furthermore, sections from both forelimbs and hindlimbs, lung, heart, liver, kidney, and spleen of WT littermates were also examined and were histologically unremarkable.</p><p id="P11">Since the PKCα D463H mutation had initially been identified in chordoid glioma tumours originating from β2 tanycytes in the third ventricular region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1C</xref>), we analysed the brains of D463H mutant mice and wild-type controls at the level of the median eminence. As the D463H mutation did not allow the survival of the het mice beyond a few weeks of age, the analysis of the adult brain could only be performed on a single mosaic mouse (IRCP 4.1e). This mosaic female (30 weeks - 23% D463H penetrance) was the only surviving littermate of the mosaic founder male IRCP 4.1c (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S1</xref>). Additionally, 2 week old D463H heterozygotes and wild-type control mice were analysed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1D, E</xref>). These analyses did not detect any change in the brain architecture or aberrant growth in any of these animals.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>PKCα D463H mutant is inactive</title><p id="P12">In order to determine the mechanism by which PKCα D463H mutant was driving tumour formation, we first analysed the impact of the D463&gt;H change on kinase activity. Recombinant WT and mutant full-length proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2</xref>) and isolated kinase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) were assessed for protein kinase catalytic activity with both peptide and protein substrates. As a comparison, the behaviour of a previously characterised mutant at the same site (D463N) was analysed; this mutant had previously shown lack of catalytic activity but retention of protein integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Characteristic activity was observed for the WT protein, however neither D463 mutant displayed any phosphotransferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C-E</xref>). Assessing ATPase activity showed that this was detectable for the WT protein, albeit orders of magnitude lower than phosphotransferase activity, but again, no activity was observed for either D463 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). To ensure that there was no compensating function for PKCα derived from mammalian cell expression, we also determined the activities of these proteins on expression in HCT116 (colorectal cancer derived) and U87MG (malignant glioma derived) cells. Using PKCα pull-down/kinase assays a series of phosphorylated coprecipitated proteins could be detected, but only for WT and not for either of the D463 mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F and 2G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title><italic>Prkca</italic> D463N mutation does not phenocopy <italic>Prkca</italic> D463H in mice</title><p id="P13">Notwithstanding the lack of an overt tumour driver phenotype in hetero- or homozygous knock-out <italic>Prkca</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), in principle the effect of the D463H inactivation mutation might still be compatible with a dominant negative impact on a suppressor <italic>Prkca</italic> allele as opposed to a gain-of-function allele. To address this question, we knocked in the <italic>Prkca</italic> D463N inactivating mutation not found in chordoid gliomas but known to retain protein integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). We used the same guide RNAs as described for the D463H mutation but with a modified repair template to change codon D463 to an asparagine (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Materials and Methods</xref>). From the 16 C57BL/6J mosaic mice obtained with the D463N mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S6</xref>), 3 were bred to assess germline transmission, yielding 15 of 30 pups that were <italic>Prkca</italic> D463N heterozygous from 4 litters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S7</xref>). All mice were asymptomatic and 8 of these offspring were crossed with C57BL/6J, F1(B6 x CBA) or CD-1 mice. In these different backgrounds, a Mendelian ratio of 30 heterozygotes out of 58 pups were obtained, and all the 30 heterozygous <italic>Prkca</italic> D463N mice obtained from all backgrounds survived for at least 20 weeks without any health issues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S8</xref>). Hence the monoallelic expression of kinase inactive <italic>Prkca</italic> D463N is not sufficient to drive the chondrosarcoma phenotype.</p><p id="P14">It remained possible that the D463N mutation might be haploinsufficient failing to ‘dominate’ the WT allele in the manner that the D463H mutation might be argued to do. To address this, we bred the D463N allele (C57BL6 background) to homozygosity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S9</xref>). 12 homozygotes, 14 heterozygotes and 6 wild types were generated. None of the mice displayed any phenotype and the histology of organs was entirely normal. It is noted that neither mutant appears to express well in mouse tissues with the heterozygote D463H+WT expressing 38% normal PKCα protein (range 15-65) and the D463N+WT expressing 48% (range 41-53); we cannot distinguish WT and mutant proteins so cannot define contributions to assess if D463N versus D463H levels impact phenotype. However distinctions from ex vivo studies (see below) demonstrate distinctive biological properties.</p><p id="P15">The rapid onset of chondrosarcoma in the <italic>Prkca</italic> D463H mutant heterozygotes but not in the <italic>Prkca</italic> D463N homo- or heterozygotes indicates that the D463H mutation is a positive driver of neoplastic disease. This suggests that the mutant either has neomorphic properties or that it is a gain-of-function PKCα allele that redefines effector outputs of this protein kinase.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>PKCα D463H behaviour aligns with WT-PKCα properties</title><p id="P16">With a view to understanding how the D463H mutant varies from the D463N mutant and whether this tracks with WT behaviour or represents neomorphic behaviour, we analysed the effects of the D463H and D463N mutations on biochemical and in cell properties. Thermal shift assays and microscale thermophoresis were conducted to assess whether differences between the mutants might reflect distinct nucleotide binding properties. The mutant proteins showed monophasic melting curves, in thermal shift assay, unlike WT full length protein which displayed some heterogeneity in its behaviour (Tm WT1 and WT2). However, all proteins displayed a shift in melting temperature(s) on binding ATP or ADP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3A</xref>) with some variations in the extent of nucleotide stabilisation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3B</xref>). Despite the biphasic melting behaviour of the WT protein complicating comparisons with the mutants, there is a substantial reduction in ATP affinity for the D463N mutant (shown by higher EC50) compared to the WT with the D463H mutant displaying a more modest loss of affinity. Both mutants displayed a similarly reduced affinity for ADP relative to the WT protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3C</xref>). To address this differential loss of affinity for ATP more directly, we employed an orthogonal approach, assessing ATP binding to full-length recombinant PKCα and mutants in vitro with microscale thermophoresis (MST). This revealed that both D463H and D463N bind ATP less well than the WT (Kd<sup>WT</sup>= 0.70 ± 0.23 µM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3D</xref>); critically the D463N bound ATP with very much lower affinity (Kd<sup>D463N</sup>=1.5±0.7mM) than D463H (Kd<sup>D463H</sup>=94±17µM) μM. These values predict significantly greater ATP occupation of the D463H mutant compared with the D463N mutant at physiological ATP concentrations.</p><p id="P17">To compare cellular behaviours of the PKCα WT and mutants, GFP-fusion proteins were expressed in U87MG cells, and characteristic activation-induced degradation monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). All three GFP-tagged proteins were phosphorylated at their priming sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> panel b) indicative of protein integrity, consistent with previously published findings for the D463N mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). There was however a modest decrease in the phosphorylation of both mutants on the activation loop (about 25%) compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> panels a and b) perhaps reflecting a more open conformation (see below). The dephosphorylation and degradation of PKCα known to occur upon prolonged phorbol ester-dependent activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>) was observed for WT and D463 mutants. Notably, the kinetics of the D463H mutant response mirrored that of PKCα WT whilst the D463N mutant was slower both in the dephosphorylation of the HM motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> panel c), turn-motif and the activation loop (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S4A, B</xref>). The D463H mutant matched with WT in its degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S4E</xref>). Myc-fusion proteins similarly showed the D463H mutant following the WT kinetics of induced dephosphorylation and degradation with the D463N mutant being delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S4C, D</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The distinction between the D463 mutants was also reflected in the detergent soluble versus insoluble distribution of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>), where the D463N mutant was retained in the neutral detergent soluble fraction and was dephosphorylated more slowly in this context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>); in contrast the D463H mutant behaviour closely aligned with the WT protein.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Evidence for distinct protein interactions for PKCα D463H</title><p id="P19">The distinctive in vivo behaviour of D463H with respect to WT and D463N, led us to assess how this specific mutant might impose itself to trigger oncogenic signals in a non-catalytic fashion. To address this, we first sought to examine differences in the interactome between WT and D463 mutant PKCα in U87MG cells. U87MG cells were transfected with Myc-tagged WT-PKCα, PKCα-D463H, PKCα-D463N or empty-vector control as technical triplicates; all PKCα constructs expressed to comparable levels and were recovered equally in Myc immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), which were subsequently analysed by tandem MS/MS. Any proteins recovered in precipitates from empty-vector transfected cells were excluded as artefacts. A total of 200 proteins were identified as potential PKCα interactors, including known PKCα interacting proteins (Caveolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>); PKCγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>); Annexin V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>)). Principal component analysis and unsupervised clustering of interactomes indicates a clear distinction between the interactomes of WT, D463H and D463N mutants, with the D463H mutant interactome showing greater similarity to WT-PKCα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B and 4C</xref>) than D463N. Approximately 90 proteins were identified as interactors with both WT and PKCα-D463H, with 15 showing statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) differences in their abundance between replicates (Fig.4D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S12</xref>). Further, 11 high confidence interactors were exclusively recovered with PKCα-D463H, including the oncogenic BET domain containing epigenetic regulators BRD3:BRD4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S13</xref>); BRD4 has been implicated previously as a driver of glioma progression, potentially through promotion of Myc driven anabolic pathways (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>)). To further explore PKCα functional roles for PKCα or the PKCα-D463H mutant in glioblastoma biology, STRING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) analysis was conducted on proteins showing preferential binding to D463H over WT, which revealed networking between epigenetic regulators, including BRD4 and the MLL1 complex components HCFC1 (HCF-1) and PRPF31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). These pathways are associated with promotion of RNA polymerase II and Myc driven transcription, through permissive histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). These distinctive binding patterns suggest a gain-of-function for the D463H mutant and importantly, show clear differences between the D463H and D463N mutants.</p><p id="P20">We employed TurboID-PKCα fusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S5A, B</xref>) in U87MG cells with or without PMA activation to identify by western blot biotinylated partner patterns using fluorescently labelled streptavidin. The fusion proteins themselves were biotinylated as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S5C</xref>) alongside a significant number of bands identified by the streptavidin probe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S5D</xref>). This technique allowed us to detect a prominent biotinylated species of about 27 kDa in the D463H expressing cells that was absent from the WT cells under basal conditions but became biotinylated on stimulation with the PKCα activator PMA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S5D</xref> white star). This is indicative of a specific up-regulated interaction for the D463H mutant at steady state, which mimics the up-regulated interaction observed on acute allosteric activation of the WT protein. Both the steady state interactome studies and the TurboID proximity analyses support the concept that D436H alters interaction of PKCα with binding partners to drive an augmented and functionally distinct oncogenic program. Enhanced association with epigenetic regulators also helps explain how a single point mutation might induce profound oncogenic reprogramming.</p><p id="P21">Structure predictions provided insight into the molecular details underlying this privileged behaviour. In the case of PKCα, AlphaFold3 yielded confident predictions for the effect of a single-residue Asp-463 substitution. We predicted the structure of WT, D463H and D463N mutants, generating 100 models for each protein. For the WT, the top scoring model displayed an auto-inhibited conformation, with the pseudosubstrate sequence reliably positioned docking into the active site in a substrate-binding mode (see PAE matrix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S6A</xref>), and the C1a contacting αB, the αB-αC loop as well as the C-tail (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S6A</xref>). The top scoring model for D463N and D463H however displayed a confident prediction of a pseudosubstrate-out conformation with the C2 domain packing against the back of the C-lobe of the kinase domain and the C-tail, and the C1 domains positioned under the C-lobe. Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions (one in D463N, both in D463H) were modelled out of the active site in the C2 domain, and the kinase domain was in a more open conformation, while still more closed compared to apo predictions. We then broadened the analysis to all predicted models. Inspection showed them all to be either in PS-in or PS-out state, so we first classified them based on their predicted conformation. For the WT protein, most models (88%) were predicted as PS-in, whereas most were predicted as PS-out for D463H (96%) and D463N (81%) (fig S6B). We next compared model quality and characteristics of the predicted models by comparing the pTM score and median PAE score. The latter is used as a metric to compare the confidence in the relative positioning of domains within a predicted conformation. The mutant kinases showed better pTM scores in the PS-out conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S6C</xref>) and a better confidence in this conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S6D</xref>), with the best models observed for the D463H mutant. In the PS-in conformation however pTM scores were better for WT. The D463N mutant showed a bimodal distribution, with about half of its PS-in models predicted with WT or D463H-like scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S6E</xref>). Similarly, the confidence in PS-in conformers was worse for the mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S6F</xref>). Overall, the WT protein is predicted as a PS-in conformer with high confidence, whereas the D463H mutant is predicted as a PS-out conformer with high confidence. These predictions suggest the D463H mutant presents as a PS-out, disinhibited state that is effector-competent, similar to an activated form of the WT protein, albeit incapable of ATP hydrolysis. The D463N mutant shows similar characteristics as the D463H mutant, although less pronounced, and its functional characterization supports a different nucleotide-binding profile that may not be compatible with effector trapping. The effect of D463 substitution is also supported by a predicted effect on stability of the WT kinase which is more pronounced for D463H (ΔΔG<sup>WT&gt;D463H</sup> -2.1 kcal/mol, ΔΔG<sup>WT&gt;D463N</sup> -1.4 kcal/mol).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>PKCα D463H is a gain-of-function PKCα allele</title><p id="P22">Having established distinct biochemical characteristics and protein interactomes for the oncogenic PKCα D463H mutant, we next examined transcriptional changes in the U87MG models to explore mechanisms driving transformation. We compared U87MG glioma cells stably expressing WT-PKCα or the two D463 mutants. mRNA expression of PKCα was comparable between WT and the two mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>), however, the expression of D463N protein was reduced compared to WT or D463H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). This may reflect differences in the protein stability or proteasomal targeting for the distinct D463 mutants. Nevertheless, all expressed proteins altered the pattern of mRNA expression and principal component analysis indicated tight clustering for biological replicates for each construct and the parental samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Furthermore, all constructs resulted in significant displacement in principal component space away from the parental samples indicating that despite the difference in expression levels (in D463N versus the other two) there is a distinct impact of each PKCα allele on mRNA profiles.</p><p id="P23">Remarkably, the D463H mutant RNAseq data segregated closely with the WT and well away from the D463N mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), consistent with similarities in biochemical behaviour and interactome changes. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression profiles also indicates the close relationship of WT and the D463H mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>), which entirely mirrors that seen for the proteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). While the majority of differentially expressed (DE) genes induced or suppressed by WT-PKCα follow the same directionality for PKCα D463H, the amplitude of change is generally greater for the D463H mutant; this can be seen in both principal component analysis, scatter analysis and through clustering of all DE genes when compared with parental (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A, B</xref>). Exploring the amplitude differential between WT and the D463H samples, we separated gene clusters according to their significant DE expression patterns (relative to parental) between the WT, D463H and D463N experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). The largest individual cluster comprises 1895 genes which are significantly up or down regulated only by the D463H mutant; within this cluster, the vast majority (94.6%) of genes displace from the parental in the same direction for both the D463H and WT-PKCα conditions, but the mean Log Fold Change (LFC) for D463H is approximately doubled on average for the whole 1895 gene group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Examining the distribution of LFC clearly indicates the directional similarity but augmented response of the D463H compared with WT, in contrast to the distinct behaviour of the D463N mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>). Numerous known cancer-genes (cancer gene consensus - COSMIC) are present within the D463H only group that have augmented gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>). The second largest cluster comprised genes which are DE for both WT and D463H, and these largely show parallel behaviour, but strong differential expression compared with D463N and parental (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). These dominant groups underly the directionality and amplitude of movement observed in the principal component analysis and also identify a specific gene-expression output which is noticeably augmented by the D463H mutant. To assess functional impact, we conducted geneset over-representation analysis, focussed on genesets associated with translation and metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H</xref>). This demonstrates D463H acts as a gain-of-function mutant, augmenting expression of multiple anabolic genesets compared to WT and elicits an entirely distinct pattern compared to D463N.</p><p id="P24">Only a minor group of 163 genes showed some degree of similarity between the two kinase-inactive D463N and D463H mutants compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). We would interpret these alterations as those where PKCα kinase catalytic activity plays an active effector role. Overall, however, these data suggests that PKCα kinase activity is of minor importance to ‘positive’ effector outputs in the context of this glioblastoma derived cell line, consistent with the in vivo observations.</p><p id="P25">Among <underline>the D463H</underline> DE genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7</xref>) there are many known and candidate cancer genes, including enhanced expression of NRAS, KMT2D and CD74 (Cancer Gene Census - COSMIC). The majority of these genes are not DE between WT and the D463N mutant. Geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA) also revealed potential phenotypic differences promoted by D463H compared with WT; TGFβ and Myc target signatures are increased, while mutant p53 downregulated genes are suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>); these are pathways broadly implicated in most human tumours, including glioma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). D463H also enhanced a signature associated with Cyclin D promotion of cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), which has previously been reported as a downstream growth effector axis for PKCα in glioma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S8A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Bioinformatic analysis does not however implicate PKCα D463H in the regulation of common oncogenic signalling pathways, suggesting a non-canonical signalling mechanism underlying deregulation of Myc, p53 and cell-cycle progression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S8A</xref>). D463H also enriched signatures for anabolic processes, including protein translation, amino-acid and nucleic acid metabolism, and ribosome biogenesis, all in line with enhanced Myc-driven growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S8B, C</xref>).</p><p id="P26">The enhanced interaction of PKCα-D463H with epigenetic regulators provides a potential mechanism driving observed changes to the transcriptome. Intriguingly, the D463H exclusive binder BRD4 has been implicated as an oncogenic regulator of many cancers, including glioblastoma, and widely linked with Myc driven tumourigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Usefully, Du <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study examining BRD4 dependent gene-expression in U251 glioblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Using genesets derived from this data and GSEA analysis, we showed that genes upregulated by BRD4 loss are significantly negatively enriched following expression of PKCα-D463H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). This supports the concept that PKCα-D463H may regulate transcription through targetable epigenetic mechanisms, providing a potential clinical strategy for <italic>PRKCA</italic> mutant choroid glioma, particularly as BET domain inhibitors have been proposed for use in other glioma settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). We therefore sought to examine the impact of PKC mutant over-expression on sensitivity of U87MG cells to the BET inhibitors JQ1 and AZD5351 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Over-expression of D463H but not D463N resulted in significantly decreased sensitivity to growth inhibition with both JQ1 and AZD5351 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A, C</xref>); D463H increased both the JQ1 and AZD5351 IC50 values by approximately 5-fold relative to parental, WT and D463N expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B, D</xref>). Interestingly, although WT expressing cells consistently showed lower growth inhibition with JQ1 and AZD5351, IC50 values did not significantly change relative to parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B, D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">The early onset chondrosarcomas associated with the heterozygous knock-in of the penetrant chordoid glioma-associated <italic>PRKCA</italic> D463H mutation in mice and the lack of any phenotype associated with the related D463N mutant knock-in (heterozygous or homozygous), provides evidence for an in vivo gain-of-function associated with the D463H mutation. The allied biochemical, interactome and transcriptomic analyses associated with this mutant, suggests that PKCα D463H promotes a non-canonical cell-cycle progression and pro-growth phenotype, which resembles an augmented PKCα driven response. The functional ex vivo evidence indicates that this behaviour is in part driven through epigenetic pathway modulation. Mechanistically, this gain-of-function and loss of catalytic activity is consistent with a working model of effector complex-driven output under negative feedback control of catalytic activity. This is supported by significant modulation of the PKCα interactome for the D463H mutant and structural prediction of a more open kinase conformation (effector competent) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7E</xref>).</p><p id="P28">The neonatal morbidity of the observed murine chondrosarcomas did not allow us to assess any slow growing chordoid glioma in the brain. The conditional tissue-targeted knock-in of a 463H mutant <italic>PRKCA</italic> allele(s) will be necessary to create a mouse model of this human cancer. Nevertheless, the parsimonious conclusion would be that the driver behaviour of this mutation evident in the early onset chondrosarcomas is conserved in the context of β tanycytes and this has implications for non-surgical intervention. The model suggests that the PKCα D463H mutant preferentially resides in a conformational state, capable of promoting tumour development. This and previous studies indicate that high levels of PKCα, or PKCα retained in an active configuration (for example through sustained effector complex formation) are oncogenic in glioma, but that kinase activity is not required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). This may not be addressable pharmacologically through ATP-competitive inhibitors, indeed this study provides some explanation for why ATP competitive inhibitors of PKCα have shown no benefit in the clinic to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>); to the contrary inhibitors may provoke PKCα output by locking a signalling competent conformer, as promoted by the D463H mutation. We infer that intervention in chordoid glioma would be effective through the removal of mutant PKCα from these tumours. Whilst to date the use of the PKCα-directed antisense agent aprinocarsen has not shown efficacy in other tumour types (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>)), the application of targeted protein degraders offers a powerful alternative route to protein removal (for review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>)). For chordoid glioma specifically, this could be developed in a manner selective for the mutant protein, promising a strong therapeutic index.</p><p id="P29">Targeting oncogenic effectors downstream of PKCα may also provide therapeutic options. The enriched association of a number of epigenetic regulators with PKCα D463H, including BRD4 and MLL1 complex components, certainly warrants closer attention, given that licenced drugs are available for both. Indeed, the enhanced signatures for c-Myc and BRD4, and the functional protection against two distinct BET inhibitors, driven by D463H over-expression in glioma cells, provides strong evidence that this mutant preferentially interacts with the BRD4 axis. As BRD4 and related BET domain family members, and HCFC1, are potent promoters of RNA polymerase II and Myc driven transcription (see for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>)), this could provide a mechanism supporting the gain-of function broad transcriptional upregulation promoted by the D463H mutant compared with WT PKCα. Targeting BET-domain family members has been widely proposed as an approach for suppressing Myc driven tumour growth, including in neuroblastoma and glioma settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Revumenib which targets MLL1 (also known as KMT2A) has recently been approved for a series of pathway modified tumours (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>)). Preclinical studies to examine the therapeutic potential of such epigenetic targeting drugs in PKCα-D463H mutant choroid glioma are certainly warranted.</p><p id="P30">Evidence for the underlying molecular mechanisms involved for PKCα have come through multiple avenues contrasting the behaviour of WT and D463H (phenotype inducer) with that of D463N (phenotype neutral) mutants. Comparison of nucleotide binding affinities suggest that D463H preferentially binds ATP over ADP, and with ATP affinity very much higher than the D463N mutant. The affinity of the D463N mutant for ATP would likely predict significant deficit in ATP occupancy at physiological concentrations, which may underly the inability of this mutant to act effectively as a gain-of-function allele. We propose a mechanism where the combination of both ATP binding preference and lack of ATPase activity would benefit an ATP occupied active conformation for D463H-PKCα. Structural modelling suggests both D463H and D463N mutants exist in a PS-out, disinhibited conformation that likely reflects an activated state of the kinase in basal conditions. This ATP-bound effector-competent conformation of the D463H mutant in the absence of activators is further supported by the Turbo-ID profile. This marks D463H out as a privileged gain-of-function mutation analogous to gain-of-function small GTPase mutations which retain unhydrolyzed GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7E</xref>) favouring the effector binding conformers.</p><p id="P31">Chondrosarcomas are a group of bone malignancies thought to derive from chondrocyte and chondroblast progenitor cells (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>)), and are characterised by the production of cartilaginous extracellular matrix, with a low percentage of dividing cells, as reported here for D463H mice hindlimbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The Archs4 database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://maayanlab.cloud/archs4/">https://maayanlab.cloud/archs4/</ext-link>) indicates that PKCα is highly expressed in chondrocytes and is predicted to be linked to an abnormal chondrocyte physiology phenotype in mice (MP0009780). There is also involvement of PKCα in the regulation of extracellular matrix organization (GO:1903055) chondrocyte proliferation (GO:0035988) and cell adhesion mediated by integrins (GO:0033627) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://maayanlab.cloud/archs4/gene/PRKCA">https://maayanlab.cloud/archs4/gene/PRKCA</ext-link>). In concordance, our GSEA analysis of the canonical pathways also showed a decrease in the extracellular matrix organisation, osteogenic collagen synthesis and integrin signalling associated with PKCα D463H expression. This suggests some canonical effects of this specific PKCα D463H mutation may be shared despite the distinctive cellular contexts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8B, C</xref>). In accordance with the early onset of the phenotype in our heterozygous mice, cartilage formation is one of the earliest morphogenetic events during embryonic development (for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>)).</p><p id="P32">Chondrocytes translate mechanical forces in various cellular responses to regulate cartilage homeostasis and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>) and the pathogenesis of bone and cartilage are linked to alterations in these mechanotransduction pathways (for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>)). It is important to note that mechanical strains occur specifically in the hindlimbs (as opposed to the forelimbs) that support the whole mouse weight, which might explain the localised phenotype seen in our D463H mutant mice, with no evidence of forelimb-associated pathology. Notably, PKCα was shown to be important in the mechanotransduction of the signal downstream of integrins in chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>) through a role for the PKCα/ERK-1 axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Goode <italic>et al</italic>. had shown that ERK signalling was upregulated in chordoid glioma, likely associated to the presence of D463H mutation in these tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) and here functional GSEA pathway enrichment in the glioma cell line showed also an enrichment of the PDGF_ERK up regulated geneset on expression of the PKCα D463H mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8A</xref>). Altogether the results suggest that the formation of chondrosarcomas in the hindlimbs of D463H mutant mice might be due to PKCα D463H driven dysregulation of the mechanotransduction signals involved in cartilage homeostasis, through pathways we anticipate would be conserved in the context of chordoid gliomas.</p><p id="P33">It is notable that various kinase inactive PKCα mutants have been employed in different studies to examine their dominant negative impact on physiology, our results suggest that the preconceived expectation of their impact needs reassessing. The likelihood that in some contexts, a protein-driven pathway may indeed be negatively influenced by catalytic activity should now be considered. For example, it has been shown that expression of the inactive PKCαK376R mutant in haematopoietic progenitor cells which are then differentiated down a B-Cell lineage, triggers the formation of a B-CLL phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). The original interpretation promoted a suppressive function in B-cells, re-evaluation in light of the results here might lead to a rather different conclusion. Generally, the penetrance of catalytic activity independent properties of PKCα and indeed other members of this family and the wider kinome would merit broad consideration. In the context of pseudokinases we readily accept the importance of allostery and the associated influence of ATP binding on kinase domain conformation (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>)). The implication of the current findings is that such properties can be ascribed to active kinases and moreover that activity may act negatively as well as positively on kinase effector output(s).</p><p id="P34">The evidence presented provides a paradigm shift in our appreciation of PKCα action and questions our understanding of the wider kinome. Unravelling the conformation-dependent but kinase-independent proximal targets and associated downstream programs elicited by this PKCα mutant, will provide insights that will no doubt guide the development of innovative interventions.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Antibodies and Reagents</title><p id="P35">Phospho-PKC Substrate Motif [(R/K)XpSX(R/K)] MultiMab™ Rabbit mAb mix (#6967), Phospho-(Ser) PKC Substrate Antibody (#2261), Phospho-PKC (pan) (gamma Thr514) Ab (#9379), Phospho-PKCα/β II (Thr638/641) Ab (#9375), Phospho- PKC (pan) (βII Ser660) Ab (#9371) and PKCα Ab (#2056) were from Cell Signaling Technology.

PKCα is in an autoinhibited inactive state but in a fully phosphorylated (primed) conformation prior to stimulation. Upon activation the protein translocates to the plasma membrane where the regulatory domains (C1A/C1B and C2) bind to the lipids where PKCα becomes fully active when the pseudo substrate (PSS) is ejected from the catalytic site. The open conformation becomes substrate for the phosphatase that dephosphorylate the priming sites and renders PKCα prone to degradation.

In the basal catalytically autoinhibited state (Regulatory/Catalytic domains interact), PKCα cannot interact with downstream effector(s); for simplicity this state is indicated as a nucleotide free state (apo) although this is not necessarily the case. On allosteric activation triggering an open conformation, the kinase domain can load ATP, and the ATP-bound state is competent to bind downstream effector(s). In some specific cellular contexts for example in tanycytes and chondrocytes, the formation of a PKCα/effector complex drives a proliferative signal which is switched off through kinase activity-dependent effector release (conformation/stability change). In this model, a tumour promoter such as PMA promotes sustained allosteric activation of the kinase pushing the equilibrium towards a higher effector bound steady state. In the case of the loss-of-activity, gain-of-function D463H mutant that still retains an ATP-bound active conformation, the lack of catalytic activity prevents the normal physiological release of the effector (red cross), sustaining complex formation. The maintenance of the stable PKCα D463H-Effector complex triggers a persistent proliferative output (see text for further <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">discussion</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206004-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
