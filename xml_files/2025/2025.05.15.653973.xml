Conventional amplification-based methods fail to resolve repeat length accurately due to amplification bias and sequence homogeneity. Here, we present a single-molecule nanopore-based strategy that enables direct quantification of tandem repeats in native RNA. By assembling RNA nanostructures that encode specific repeat number, we achieve repeat size discrimination with a resolution of 18 nucleotides. Using tandem repeat-containing RNA, we successfully detect and discriminate disease-relevant repeat lengths associated with myotonic dystrophy types 1 (DM1) and 2 (DM2), and congenital central hypoventilation syndrome-1 (CCHS1). Finally, we apply our method to total RNA extracted from a DM1 human cell line model, demonstrating its compatibility with complex biological samples. Our approach offers a platform for studying repeat expansion biology at the single-molecule level, with broad implications for diagnostics, clinical research and multiplexed repeat profiling.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Short tandem repeats are DNA sequences repeated consecutively with lengths of repeated motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Expansions or increasing in size of short tandem repeats cause at least 50 genetic conditions, known as repeat expansion disorders (REDs), affecting 1 in 3000 individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Among them, polyglutamine and polyalanine diseases, such as congenital central hypoventilation syndrome-1 (CCHS1), are caused by relatively small repeat expansions (less than a hundred) in the coding region of gene. In addition, diseases caused by repeat expansions in non-coding regions of gene, include myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2), fragile X syndrome, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The severity and onset of REDs depend on the number of repeats, i.e. expansion size, making their accurate quantification critical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In addition, repeat expansions are transcribed in RNA which plays a central role in the molecular pathogenesis of the majority of REDs and represents the major target for the developing gene modifying therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Depending on the expansion size, current methods for quantifying tandem repeats rely on PCR-based amplification combined with fragment analysis, and/or Illumina sequencing for small expansions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and southern blot and Small-pool PCR (SP-PCR) for large expansions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, DNA polymerase slippage during PCR amplification of tandem repeats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, a phenomenon extensively studied in trinucleotide repeats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, introduces biases that can prevent precise assessment of repeat expansion sizes. Amplification biases also represent a challenge for sequencing, as preferential amplification of wild-type alleles may occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Since the expanded repeat regions often exceed the short read lengths, these methods struggle with sequencing through the full expansion, leading to incomplete or ambiguous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Recently, long-read nanopore sequencing has been implemented for amplification-free studying of tandem repeat expansions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, error rates per-base are generally higher than short-read sequencing technologies, with particularly pronounced substitution and indel errors in homopolymer regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, the lack of specialized base calling algorithms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, the sequence complexity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and the amounts of material needed for experiments prevents their immediate use for diagnostics purposes. Due to these challenges, there is still a clear need for more precise and amplification-free methods to quantify tandem repeat expansions.</p><p id="P4">Here, we introduce an amplification-free tool for determination of tandem repeat expansions that relies on RNA:DNA nanotechnology and solid-state nanopores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Our method addresses current unresolved challenges related to reverse transcription and amplification biases that limit accurate assessment of repeat sizes in expanded RNA molecules. We differentiate pathogenic and non-pathogenic sizes of tandem repeat arrays at the single-molecule level by careful design of RNA:DNA hybrid nanostructures from RNA transcripts containing clinically relevant tandem repeats. RNA nanostructures are passed through a nanopore for quantification of the tandem repeats. We characterize RNA tandem repeats arrays of varying sizes derived from the loci associated with DM1, DM2, and CCHS1, showing a resolution of 18 nucleotides (six trinucleotide repeats). Our resolution allows the distinction of non-pathogenic and pathogenic tandem repeat sizes. Finally, we study tandem repeats in total RNA extracted from a DM1 human cell line model, performing direct determination of expansions in complex biological backgrounds. Our method offers a platform for studying repeat expansion biology at transcript level, and with broad implications for RED diagnostics.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Nanostructure-mediated nanopore sensing of RNA tandem repeats associated with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and type 2</title><p id="P5">We characterize tandem repeats in RNA using nanopore sensing through the assembly of RNA:DNA nanostructures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>).

The RNA nanostructure is designed with a barcode and a repeat-sensing region. The barcode allows for specific identification of the transcript. In this region, the presence of an attached streptavidin denotes a ‘1’, while its absence signifies a ‘0’. The nanostructure was engineered to have a ‘1111’ barcode. In the repeat-sensing region, CUG repeats are identified though hybridization with a number ‘n’ of complementary (CAG)<sub>10</sub> oligonucleotides, each containing an overhang for streptavidin binding and a complementary DNA strand, which binds an additional streptavidin.

Every time a structural label (i.e. streptavidin) passes through the pore, either from the barcode or the repeat-sensing region, a larger number of ions are prevented from passing through the nanopore producing a deeper drop in the ionic current<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">The nanostructures with CUG repeats translocate through the nanopore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>) inducing an initial transient drop in ionic current, that corresponds to the RNA:DNA duplex backbone (gray).

The nanostructures were translocated through the same solid-state nanopore, allowing for direct comparison of the ionic current readout across the four nanostructures while eliminating pore-dependent variability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>).

Repeat arrays of larger sizes can bind more streptavidins, leading to increased ion depletion as the nanostructure translocates through the nanopore. The depth of this current spike is dependent on the number of streptavidins that bind the repeats. We use the depth of this current spike to quantitatively assess the size of tandem repeats in each RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>).

The experiments were done in triplicate, an additional dataset is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S14</xref>. The tandem repeat size distributions agree with the spread observed for the repeat sizes of the initial DNA plasmids used for RNA synthesis. Beyond spike depth, spike charge deficit also proves effective for repeat array size differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S15</xref>). Moreover, RNA nanostructures can translocate through the nanopore in both 5′-3′ and 3′-5′ orientations. Notably, characterization of the current spikes and discrimination of repeat array sizes is possible in both translocation directions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S16</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S17</xref>, the length of the oligonucleotides used for labelling the repeats can also be adjusted to different sizes of repeat arrays to enhance discrimination precision.</p><p id="P17">By measuring the spike depth associated with the repeat-sensing region of the RNA nanostructures, we successfully quantify the repeat arrays in the original RNA transcript. This approach provides an accurate method for discriminating a pathogenic size of 51 repeats from non-pathogenic sizes of 12, 24 and 30 repeats, relying on the hybridization of DNA oligonucleotides to RNA without introducing amplification or short-read assembly biases. The achieved repeat resolution of 18 nucleotides (six trinucleotide repeats), is sufficient to clearly discriminate wild-type alleles and DM1 expanded alleles that are within a lower boundary of the pathogenic size.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Six-repeat resolution in RNA sensing discriminates pathogenic alleles in CCHS1</title><p id="P18">We determine GCN tandem repeat expansion as a model where six repeat resolution is required.

By sensing RNA nanostructures derived from CUG, CCUG and GCN repeat-containing transcripts, we identify variable-length repeat arrays in kilobase-range RNA molecules. Additionally, we map their relative position within the RNA molecules while detecting other transcript elements, such as the introduced barcodes that allow for multiplexed characterization. Our method bypasses reverse transcription biases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> which are linked to the capability of different enzymes to reverse transcribe molecules with high GC-content and complex secondary structure such as long hairpins formed by CUG and CCUG expanded repeats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">We quantify tandem repeats with no need for amplification, another important bias source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, and we discriminate CUG tandem repeat arrays with 12, 24, 30 and 51 repeats. Notably, the 51-repeat array is associated with asymptomatic or mild DM1 phenotypes but is likely to expand into the full disease range upon paternal transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, showing that our sizing strategy holds diagnostic relevance. For GCN repeats, our method also successfully discriminates between the wild-type number of 20 repeats, and pathogenic 26 repeats associated with CCHS1, further demonstrating the applicability of this approach for diagnostics of multiple REDs with expansion sizes that result in significantly different clinical outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">Despite successful, single-molecule identification of biological targets in complex backgrounds has been proven challenging in previous studies, especially when the target is found in low copy numbers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Here, we have successfully identified clinically relevant CUG-containing transcripts expressed in transfected human cell lines, without requiring reverse transcription, amplification or pull-down protocols.

The counting resolution of our method is determined by the number of hybridized DNA oligonucleotides to the target RNA. Here, we demonstrate a resolution of 6 trinucleotide repeats (18 nucleotides) which is achieved by the hybridization of a single additional oligonucleotide to the nanostructure. While our approach does require knowledge on the transcript sequence for nanostructure assembly, repeat quantification is entirely based on the number of complementary oligonucleotides that bind to the tandem repeats, offering determination of the size of the tandem repeat array while avoiding the systematic errors associated to RNA sequencing of heteropolymer regions.</p><p id="P30">In conclusion, we have introduced a reliable tool for detecting and quantifying tandem repeats in clinically relevant samples with a single-molecule resolution, offering an alternative amplification-free method for RED diagnostics, basic and clinical research of toxic RNAs.

The nanostructure includes a barcode region and a repeat-sensing region. The barcode comprises a series of monovalent streptavidin distributed throughout the sequence, each representing a ‘1’; and their absence indicating a ‘0’. We assigned this RNA nanostructure with a ‘1111’ barcode. The repeats are labelled using ‘n’ (CAG)<sub>10</sub> oligonucleotides that bind two streptavidins each. Translocation of the nanostructure through a solid-state nanopore produces a drop in ionic current ascribed to the nanostructure’s backbone (gray), four downward current spikes are produced from the ‘1111’ barcode (black), and a prominent current spike (red) is produced from the five (CAG)<sub>10</sub> oligonucleotides bound to the 51 CUG repeats. <bold>e</bold> We assigned for CCUG-containing RNA nanostructures (3.2 kbp) a ‘1001’ barcode, that yields two downward current spikes in the nanopore readout (black).

Each repeat array hybridizes with ‘n’ complementary (CAG)<sub>10</sub> oligonucleotides, allowing two streptavidins to bind per oligonucleotide. Larger repeat arrays accommodate more (CAG)<sub>10</sub> oligonucleotides on the nanostructures, facilitating quantification of the repeats as the nanostructures translocate through a nanopore. <bold>b</bold> We assembled RNA nanostructures with distinct barcodes corresponding to specific CUG repeat sizes and translocated them through the same nanopore. RNA with 12 CUG repeats was barcoded as ‘0011’, 24 repeats as ‘1001’, 30 repeats as ‘1110’, and 51 repeats as ‘1111’ where ‘1’ corresponds to 12 consecutive DNA dumbbells. A greater number ‘n’ of consecutive oligonucleotides with streptavidins can bind to larger repeat array sizes, resulting in increased ion depletion during the translocation of the nanostructure through a nanopore, thus generating a more prominent current spike in the nanopore readout. <bold>c</bold> We measure the depth of the current spike caused by streptavidin binding to the repeats, to quantify tandem repeats. <bold>d</bold> We observed an increase in the median current spike depth as the number of repeats increases, with all populations showing mean independence, Welch’s t-test ***p-values &lt; 0.001: 4.9×10<sup>-57</sup> (12 and 24), 2.4×10<sup>-6</sup> (24 and 30), 6.2 ×10<sup>-13</sup> (30 and 51).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS205640-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Quantitative characterization of repeats associated with CCHS1.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Expansion of the second, polyalanine coding GCN triplets in exon 3 of the <italic>PHOX2B</italic> gene causes CCHS1. <bold>b</bold> We produced RNA nanostructures with a ‘011’ dumbbell barcode from transcripts containing 20 GCN repeats, and RNA nanostructure with a ‘111’ barcode targeting 26 GCN repeats. The six additional repeats of the ‘111’ barcoded RNA allow for an extra (NGC)<sub>6</sub> DNA oligonucleotide and streptavidin to bind to the construct, producing a larger drop in the ionic current upon translocation through a nanopore, compared to the construct with only 20 GCN repeats. <bold>c</bold> The current spike depth associated to the repeats labelling shows a higher median for constructs with 26 GCN repeats (0.8 and 0.15 nA, respectively), and a p-value between the distributions of 9.3×10<sup>-9</sup> for Welch’s t-test.
