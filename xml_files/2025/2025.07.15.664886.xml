Monitoring of these toxins is challenged by requirements of the low μg/L detections limits and structural diversity. Here, we employ aerolysin nanopores to distinguish seven of the most prevalent microcystin congeners, both individually and in mixtures, at environmentally relevant concentrations. Importantly, we showed that aerolysin enables the detection of microcystins in different lake water samples at concentrations below the World Health Organization’s intervention thresholds, reaching picomolar sensitivity. Moreover, combining experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we further investigated the microcystin sensing mechanism, suggesting that the ionic current blockage is primarily governed by K238 in aerolysin, while dwell time is regulated by R220 constriction site. Our results open the way to use the nanopore sensing technology for real-time monitoring of microcystins in drinking water sources and surface waters.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Aquatic ecosystems and water quality are increasingly threatened by both anthropogenic pollutants and natural toxins, particularly those produced by cyanobacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Climate change, eutrophication, and rising CO<sub>2</sub> levels have led to more frequent cyanobacterial blooms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, which negatively impact biodiversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and pose significant risks to human health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. During these blooms, cyanobacteria release a range of potent cyanotoxins — including neurotoxins, cytotoxins, and hepatotoxins such as microcystins, nodularins, and cylindrospermopsin — that inhibit key metabolic enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Cyanotoxins, especially microcystins, can accumulate to micromolar concentrations in surface scums<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and nanomolar levels in the water column<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, well above the 1 μg/L safety guideline for chronic exposure to drinking water set by the World Health Organization (WHO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Even at lower concentrations, these toxins may persist before and after blooms in meso-oligotrophic lakes like Lake Geneva (Switzerland)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, impacting aquatic life despite being below regulatory thresholds.</p><p id="P3">Microcystins (MCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> are cyclic peptides made of canonical and three non-canonical amino acids: D-erythro-β-methyl-isoaspartic acid (D-Masp), 3-amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyldeca-4,6-dienoic acid (Adda), and N-methyldehydroalanine (Mdha) for the congener MC-LR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, located at positions 3, 5, 7, respectively). Variations of this general scaffold can produce more than 300 congeners identified to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. MCs are well-documented public health hazards; for example, a 1996 cyanobacterial bloom in Brazil led to the deaths of over 50 dialysis patients due to acute liver failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. This incident highlighted the need for effective monitoring of MC concentrations in water. Human exposure typically occurs via oral or respiratory routes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, with symptoms ranging from mild skin rashes and nausea to severe gastrointestinal, liver damage and respiratory distress. At the molecular level, MCs are actively taken up by hepatocytes and potently inhibit the protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, disrupting cellular signaling and cytoskeletal integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, which can lead to cell death and, in severe cases, fatal liver failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The use of contaminated water for irrigation also raises concerns for food safety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In response to these risks, the WHO established three guideline values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) that trigger specific interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, with the guideline for drinking water set at 1 μg/L (equivalent to 1 nM) for the best-studied microcystin congener, MC-LR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">To date, MCs are commonly monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, US EPA Method 546<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>), which is easy to operate and enables a rapid, picomolar-range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> detection. However, ELISA lacks specificity for individual MC congeners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and may cross-react with similar toxins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, potentially causing false positives. In contrast, liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS, US EPA Method 544<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>) delivers the precise, sensitive and selective analysis of 11 MC congeners for which reference standards are available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, reaching sensitivities in the low nanomolar range (compatible with environmental samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>). However, the high cost of equipment, the need for qualified users, sample transportation and the long turnaround time until results are available make this method expensive and impractical for real-time analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Currently, LC-MS/MS analysis of MCs takes from one day for quantitative results to several weeks for detailed suspect screening where no reference standards are available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. This delay limits timely interventions and increases the risk of missing sudden toxin spikes, as cyanotoxin levels can rapidly exceed safe limits due to blooms or cell lysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Real-time monitoring is therefore essential for promptly detecting toxin peaks and enabling timely responses to protect drinking and recreational water — especially for vulnerable groups such as children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and pets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Other detection methods include fluorescence, spectroscopy, and biosensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> such as biological nanopores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Nanopore sensing allows single-molecule detection by monitoring ionic current fluctuations as molecules interact with a biological pore. Recent advances in nanopore research have shown that three of the most abundant MC congeners (MC-LR, -YR, and -RR) can be distinguished by their unique current signatures using the α-hemolysin (α-HL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> nanopore. However, these measurements required relatively high concentrations (1 μM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, 200 nM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>), well above the WHO safety threshold.</p><p id="P6">Here, we present a nanopore-based approach for the simultaneous detection of MCs at concentrations below the second strictest WHO threshold (&lt;12 nM, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) by using wild-type aerolysin (WT AeL) – a pore-forming toxin known for its ability to distinguish (bio)polymers, sugars, peptides with single amino acid differences, and various post-translational modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. We achieved picomolar detection of MC-LR at levels well below the strictest WHO threshold (&lt;1 nM) by using asymmetric salt gradient and showed the capability of discriminating MC congeners while in mixture in a lake water background at an environmentally relevant concentration. Moreover, combining experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we identify how single-point mutations influence the sensitivity of aerolysin, shedding light on its mechanism for the microcystin discrimination. Our results set the basis to use biological nanopores for real-time detection and monitoring of the presence and abundance of microcystins in rivers and lakes.</p><sec id="S2"><title>Characterization of MC-LR, MC-RR, MC-YR with wild-type aerolysin nanopore</title><p id="P7">Single-channel recordings using WT AeL nanopore were conducted to investigate current blockage characteristics and assess the translocation of MCs.

The 3 most studied congeners of MCs differ by a single residue at the X site, where either a leucine, arginine or tyrosine (L, R, Y) residue can be found. Initially, we focused on congeners that solely differ at the X site, while maintaining a fixed arginine residue at site Z. These congeners, denoted as MC-LR, MC-RR, and MC-YR, exhibit net charges of -1, 0, and -1 at pH 7.5, respectively.</p><p id="P9">Experimental conditions were adapted from previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>, using 4 M KCl to enhance capture and translocation of neutral, negatively and positively charged peptides through WT AeL by increasing electro-osmotic flow (EOF) and reducing electrostatic interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> . This approach enabled sensitive detection of MCs at 50 nM — substantially lower concentrations than previously used in the α-HL nanopore studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, 50 nM concentrations of MCs yielded clear and prolonged blockade events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs.

Scatterplots of dwell time vs. current blockage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs.

A voltage of 100 mV provided optimal separation among the 3 congeners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), with MC-RR showing 6.6% and 8.7% lower current blockage than -YR and -LR, respectively.</p><p id="P11">Histograms of current blockage produced by MCs at 100 mV in individual experiments, showing the current separation between the three different MCs. <bold>(E)</bold> Dwell time dependence on voltage.

Dwell time analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>) showed that MC-LR and -YR, both negatively charged, began translocating at lower voltages compared to neutral - RR. The longest dwell time for MC-RR (314.2 ± 66.4 ms) occurred at 160 mV, indicating that higher voltage is needed to drive its translocation due to its neutral charge.</p><p id="P13">Although larger molecular volume is often associated with greater current blockage, no systematic correlation was found between the volume of the variable amino acid and the respective congener’s current blockage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Despite arginine’s (R) larger volume (173.4 Å<sup>3</sup>) compared to leucine (L) (166.7 Å<sup>3</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>, MC-RR generated less blockage than -LR, consistent with prior α-HL data. Similarly, MC-YR, with a larger tyrosine residue (Y) (193.6 Å<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>), showed less blockage than -LR. This suggests that factors beyond volume — such as charge, conformation and hydrophobicity — influence blockade behavior. MC-RR showed the smallest blockage, likely due to its +1 charge, compared to -LR and -YR, promoting intramolecular interactions and reducing the interaction with AeL (also reflected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> by short dwell times), likely resulting in a more compact conformation in the long and narrow β -barrel of AeL.</p><p id="P14">The increasing blockage from MC-RR to -YR and -LR aligns with their rising negative charge and hydrophobicity. RR, being neutral and least hydrophobic, interacts weakly with the pore, whereas LR, the most hydrophobic and negatively charged, exhibits stronger binding and longer dwell times. YR shows intermediate behavior consistent with its physicochemical profile.</p><p id="P15">NMR spectroscopy was used to probe the conformational states of the 3 MCs in solution by comparing their backbone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>H and <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>C chemical shifts, which are exquisitely sensitive to conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). These data show that MC-LR and - YR must be structurally more similar to each other than to -RR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>). In particular, the <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>Cα and <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>Cβ chemical shifts at E6 defer markedly between MC-LR and MC-RR (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>C-HSQC spectra were not attainable for MC-YR due to its low concentrations, but <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>H-TOCSY patterns are almost identical to MC-LR’s). Although explicit interpretation of the chemical shift changes is not trivial, the higher Δδ<sub>Cα</sub> - Δδ<sub>Cβ</sub> in MC-RR would indicate a slightly higher level of local structure. Molecular dynamics simulation for MCs in solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup> have shown that these are very flexible molecules, and it appears from this NMR data that the conformational landscape is altered in MC-RR compared to MC-LR and MC-YR. These differences would be consistent with the trends found in current blockages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), and if it were at the root cause of the observed trends, it would imply overall somewhat tighter states in MC-RR. However, what was not observed in the NMR spectra — but becomes evident in the nanopore experiments between 140 mV and 200 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6, S7</xref>) — is the presence of two distinct populations for MC-RR, suggesting that the congener may adopt multiple orientations and conformations upon entering and interacting with the pore, as similarly observed in MD simulations of MCs in solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P16">Finally, a mixture experiment tested whether WT AeL could resolve all three congeners simultaneously. An initial binary mixture of MC-RR and -YR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>) was followed by -LR addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>) at adjusted concentrations (25 nM MC-LR, 50 nM - RR, 20 nM -YR) to balance capture rates to ensure uniform signal distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). The resulting current blockage distributions aligned well with the individual experiments, confirming that WT AeL can distinguish MC congeners differing by a single residue.</p><p id="P17">The capture frequency of the negatively charged congeners MC-LR and -YR increased more rapidly with increasing voltage, compared to neutral -RR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). This might be due to the combined effect of electrophoretic mobility and electroosmotic flow (EOF) leading to an increased frequency of negatively charged species at higher voltages, whereas neutral species are less affected by electrophoretic force<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Dissecting the microcystin translocation mechanism</title><p id="P18">To gain more insights into which region of the pore influences the current blockage the most, we compared results from nanopore experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), by measuring current blockages (in experiments and simulations) and dwell times (from experiments only) for MC-LR (and MC-RR, -YR in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>) in WT AeL and comparing with two mutants that alleviate the two constriction points, K238A and R220A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B and 2C</xref>). In the simulations, the MC-LR molecule was placed inside the β-barrel, in-between the two constriction points, near K238 – a conformation we hypothesized is dominant for producing MC-LR current blockages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) – spanning residues from S228/Q268 to G234/N262 (residue numbers correspond to the two β-strands of AeL’s barrel) and with no MC atoms within 4 Å of any protein atoms. In both experiments and simulations, currents were measured in symmetric 4 M KCl buffer.</p><p id="P19">Experimentally, MC-LR induced comparable levels of blockage in both WT and R220A pores, although the dwell times differed between the two pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). In contrast, the K238A mutant exhibited significantly reduced blockage compared to WT and R220A, but a similar dwell time as the WT AeL pore. Based on these findings, the main current blockage (sensitivity) seems modulated only by the K238 constriction, as mutation of the R220 constriction does not alter the current compared to WT. This is further supported by MD simulations, which show a similar trend in blockage percentages across the three different pores (WT, K238A and R220A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>) when MC-LR was positioned within the pore cavity as stated above. In contrast, dwell time seems to be primarily regulated by the R220 constriction, since the R220A mutant exhibits a shorter dwell time for MC-LR while maintaining the same current blockage as WT.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Expanding the detection range of microcystins</title><p id="P20">To further test the ability of WT AeL to discriminate MCs, the electrical readouts of four additional MC congeners were recorded. These congeners possess a fixed leucine residue at position X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) and a variable residue at position Z, being alanine, phenylalanine, tyrosine or tryptophan, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> as MC-LA, -LF, -LY and -LW respectively. Under a voltage of 160 mV, we were able to separate all the tested MC congeners, as shown by the current blockage histograms obtained from individual experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S12</xref>). More hydrophobic MCs, especially MC-LF and -LW, produced significantly longer dwell times at 160 mV compared to other MCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>). The dynamic range of our method is reliably achievable up to 50 nM for the tested microcystins, except for MC-LY and -LW, for which optimal signal can only be observed at concentrations up to 25 nM. This range is suitable for detecting environmentally relevant concentrations, as MC levels during cyanobacterial blooms rarely exceed 50 nM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. MC-LY and -LW required testing at 25 nM because, at higher concentrations (e.g., 50 nM), they frequently produced two-level blockade events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13</xref>) that hindered rapid and confident identification. These events often failed to return to the open-pore current, particularly at lower voltages (e.g. 100 mV). A similar behavior was initially observed for MC-LR at 2 μM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S14</xref>), which was resolved by lowering the analyte concentration. Based on these observations, we propose two hypotheses to explain the two-level events observed with MC-LY and -LW. First, they may result from strong aromatic interactions (e.g., π–π or cation–π) between the MCs and the pore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>, resulting in MC getting stuck in 2 possible states within the pore. Secondly, two MC-LY or -LW (and similarly -LR at 2 μM) molecules may be entering the pore sequentially or in a chain-like manner, potentially driven by intermolecular aromatic interactions that increase affinity and facilitate cooperative entry and exit dynamics.</p><p id="P21">Bulkier MCs such as MC-LF, -LY, -LW provided deeper pore blockage than -LA, seemingly the smallest MC based on structure. However, MC-LA produced deeper blockage than -RR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), probably due to its higher hydrophobicity compared to RR as previously discussed. Separation of the 7 MC species was clearly evident in dwell time and current blockage dimensions, without the need for further sophisticated analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). We observed that all the MCs did possess a similar dwell time for this voltage except MC-LA, probably due to its smaller size. The results demonstrate that the main parameter to discriminate MC is current blockage, since very narrow current distribution can be observed. To go a step beyond, a mixture experiment with all 7 MC congeners present in a single sample was performed, relevant for real-world applications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). As shown, the individual current slightly shifted, but the specific population corresponding to each MC remained conserved and did not overlap, demonstrating the capabilities of WT AeL to discriminate up to seven MC congeners simultaneously.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Discrimination of microcystins in lake water</title><p id="P22">Discrimination of up to 7 MCs was achieved in lab-controlled conditions; subsequently, we focused on assessing MC detection in natural waters such as lakes or rivers. For that, we assessed the detection of MC-LR and -YR in water sourced from Lake Geneva, Switzerland. This condition was anticipated to pose a challenge due to the minimal difference in current blockage (2.1% from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). The lake water, confirmed to be free of MCs (as determined by ELISA; see <bold>Methods</bold>), was used as a background matrix. MC-LR and MC-YR were spiked at 25 nM and 20 nM, respectively – concentrations resembling those found in lake environments affected by strong cyanobacterial blooms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Lake water background signals were recorded in unspiked samples. As shown in the scatterplots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, E, I</xref>, lake water did not produce any significant background and mainly short events could be observed. More importantly, there were no events within the current blockage windows expected for MCs, which could otherwise interfere with MC discrimination.</p><p id="P23">First, MC-LR, and -YR were spiked into a diluted lake water matrix (at 3.3 M KCl instead of the 4M KCl previously used, see <bold>Methods</bold> for water sample preparation) and the same resolution in current blockage was retained as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>, with a separation of approximately 2.5% between MC-YR and -LR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-D</xref>). Next, we directly used water collected at 10.2 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>) and 1.5 m depths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I</xref>), representing water from the deep chlorophyll maximum layer and the surface layer, respectively. To keep similar experimental conditions and assess the background noise resulting from any other (in)organic material present, the same electrolyte concentration (4 M KCl) was kept for the following experiments, and the MC-YR, -LR were spiked sequentially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4F-H, 4J-L</xref>). Assessing this under high-salt conditions is necessary, as elevated salt levels can enhance the capture of any molecules from lake water, potentially contributing to signals that interfere with MC detection. Sequential spiking of the MCs to the respective samples demonstrated that the current separation was preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H, L</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D, H, L</xref>, the current separation was still present as in individual and mixture experiments performed previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). A slight shift in current is observed, which can be attributed to the different ion composition present in the lake water, but with no apparent consequence for the separation of MC-LR and -YR (2.4 ± 0.2 % compared to 2.1 % in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). These results demonstrate that AeL nanopore enable reliable and selective detection of these microcystin congeners in natural water samples, at environmentally relevant concentrations during blooms, without interference from the sample matrix.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Pushing the microcystin detection limit to reach picomolar concentrations</title><p id="P24">To further enhance the sensitivity of the nanopore-based detection system, a series of experiments was performed to determine the lowest achievable limit of detection (LOD) and quantification for MC-LR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Our aim is to detect concentrations well below the WHO’s lowest guideline value of 1 nM for chronic lifetime exposure in drinking water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>, as well as environmentally relevant concentrations typically found in lake surface waters during bloom events <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In concentrated cyanobacterial scums, MC levels can even reach micromolar concentrations (up to 14000 μg/L of total MC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. However, in open surface or lake waters, MCs are usually reported in the nM range or lower (ng/L to low μg/L). For example, microcystin levels can peak between 105 pM to 147 pM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> in Lake Geneva to approximately 1 nM (1,000 ng/L) in other Swiss lakes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>, 10 nM in highly eutrophic lakes in the USA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>, 24 nM in the southern US Reservoir<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>, 46 nM in Hoan Kiem Lake (Vietnam)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>, 50 nM in Lake Taihu (China)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>, and up to 78 nM in lakes in Mexico<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. To improve the detection, we employed a salt concentration gradient, a technique previously demonstrated to increase event frequency for ssDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. Specifically, we used asymmetric salt condition with 0.15 M KCl buffer solution in the <italic>cis</italic> chamber and 4.0 M KCl buffer solution in the <italic>trans</italic> chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p id="P25"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> shows two representative raw current traces for 200 pM MC-LR in symmetric (<bold>A</bold>) and asymmetric conditions (<bold>B</bold>). The number of events (depicted by a star) is drastically improved in asymmetric conditions. This is further demonstrated in the scatterplots, where MC-LR events (highlighted within a dark rectangle) account for 54.1% of total events under asymmetric conditions, compared to only 6.8% under symmetric conditions. The LOD was defined as the lowest concentration at which the event ratio exceeded the detection threshold, set at the ratio of 0.15, i.e. three times from the ratio observed at the analyte concentration, where MC-LR was barely detectable (0.2 nM at symmetric salt condition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Additionally, event frequency (in Hz) was calculated by fitting inter-event time in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S15</xref>. Therefore, concentrations of MC-LR ranging from 25 pM to 50 nM were screened under both symmetric and asymmetric conditions, and the ratio of events corresponding to microcystin was extracted (from 45 % - 55 % current blockage; from 1 ms - 10 s range; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>) and compared to all the events detected. Based on the scatterplots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>) and the ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), under symmetric conditions, MC-LR was confidently detected at concentrations as low as 1 nM, accounting for 32.9 % of observed events. In contrast, a comparable event ratio (39.2 %) was still observed at 25 pM under asymmetric conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>), representing a 40-fold improvement in detection sensitivity. The event ratio at 2 nM under symmetric conditions was similar to that observed at 100 pM under asymmetric conditions, representing a 20-fold improvement in sensitivity. Using this approach, we can therefore significantly improve the detection capability of WT AeL, enabling reliable MC-LR detection at concentrations substantially lower than the 1 nM WHO guideline with an LOD of 25 pM for asymmetric condition and 1 nM for symmetric condition. This sensitivity is well below the concentrations for water safety and environmental monitoring, demonstrating the strong potential of this method for real-world applications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P27">In conclusion, using the aerolysin nanopore, we demonstrate real-time detection of 7 MC congeners with high sensitivity and specificity competing with state-of-the-art LC-MS/MS technique. We successfully detected the congeners at nanomolar concentrations and achieved picomolar detection for MC-LR under asymmetric buffer conditions. This represents a significant advancement over previous studies and positions nanopore-based detection as an effective technology for real-world applications in water surveillance. The method’s ability to discriminate seven MC congeners within mixture experiments, including those spiked in lake water, underscores the reliability and robustness of the aerolysin nanopore platform for direct, real-time monitoring of microcystins.</p><p id="P28">Beyond microcystins, water sources worldwide are threatened by a diverse array of contaminants, including other cyanotoxins (such as anabaenopeptins, cylindrospermopsins, anatoxins or saxitoxins), pesticides, pharmaceuticals, heavy metals or other industrial pollutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>.

Current blockage was calculated as the difference between the open pore current (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>) and the current produced by the passage of the analyte through the pore (<italic>I</italic>), expressed as <italic>ΔI/I</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> (where <italic>ΔI = I</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub><italic>-I</italic>), and reported as ‘Blockage %’ in the figures. The raw signals are divided according to voltage discontinuities and significant time-scale shifts to identify stable single pore readings and discard segments where the pore self-blocks or where several pores are present. For each identified segment, the distribution of the open pore current is analyzed by applying a Gaussian fit to the peak of the current distribution that exhibits the highest mean value. Event detection is performed using a dual-threshold approach based on the open-pore current distribution: 1) for event initiation, a threshold of 7 σ below the mean open-pore current is applied, where σ represents the standard deviation of the open-pore current, 2) for event termination, a threshold of 3 σ below the mean open-pore current is applied. The average relative current is translated into the pore blockage % (ΔI/I0), the processed data is initially visualized as scatterplots, enabling the selection of events of interest (falling in the blockage range of 40 %-60 %, dwt range of 0.2 ms – 10 s) for further in-depth analysis, where both, current and dwell time distributions, are identified by fitting a Gaussian and an Exponential function, respectively.

For event frequency analysis of both ratio (event selection %) and inter-event time (Hz), selection was modified (to a 45% - 55 % current blockage and 1 ms - 10 s dwell time range). Due to the possible occurrence of two-level events, the frequency calculated from inter-event times (Hz) might not accurately reflect the true event rate at concentrations &gt; 10 nM, as multiple events can overlap and be counted as a single inter-event interval, causing the measured frequency to plateau or even decrease at higher concentrations. Therefore, we relied on the ratio of observed events rather than inter-event time-derived frequency, which provided more consistent and interpretable results across conditions, resulting in a sigmoidal relationship between ratio and concentration. We observed an increase in event frequency with concentration up to 2 nM; however, data above 10 nM were excluded from analysis, as the apparent decrease in frequency at higher concentrations was inconsistent with expected linear increase and likely reflected measurement artifacts (i.e two-levels).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Lake water collection and sample preparation</title><p id="P35">Lake water samples were collected in early June 2022 from L’éXPLORE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup> experimental platform of Lake Geneva (Switzerland).
