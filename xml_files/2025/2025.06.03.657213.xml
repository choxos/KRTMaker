including transcription, translation, and DNA damage repair. However, a further liquid-to-solid transition (LST) of condensates due to mutation or external stimuli can result in aggregation, sometimes pathological. The unique ability of protein condensates to concentrate and sequester biomolecules is at the heart of the regulatory mechanism, controlling the dynamics and function of the condensates. While the recruitment of essential biomolecules, such as RNA has been studied to have the impact to the condensate formation, how DNA partition can affect the phase behaviour and dynamics of protein condensates is not fully elucidated. In this study, we investigate both the short-term and long-term kinetics of double-stranded DNA partitioning into preformed fresh and aged FUS protein condensates. Confocal imaging shows that DNA partition follows the core-shell diffusion pattern within the condensates. LST slows down and reduces FUS condensates’ ability to recruit DNA but stabilizes the DNA-FUS condensate complex due to the heterogeneous solid network formation. Using the optical technique of Spatial Dynamic Mapping (SDM), we find that DNA partition promotes coalescence and alters the characteristics of the condensates. The partition made the condensates more dynamic in the short term (within minutes) but accelerated LST in long-term incubation (within hours), ultimately leading to an irreversible porous core-shell structure of FUS condensates. Our findings reveal the kinetics of DNA partition during aging and its impact on LST, underlining the modulation of condensate properties by molecule sequestration, shedding light on possible regulation of disease-related LST of biomolecular condensates.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Biomolecular condensates formed by liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) provide a dynamic means of spatial organization within cells, enabling the compartmentalization of biochemical processes as membrane-less organelles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Condensates exhibit canonical liquid behaviours, including the ability to fuse, drip, deform under shear stress, and rapidly exchange components with their surroundings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Their liquid-like nature is crucial to support the reversible assembly and disassembly of compartments for biological processes. Biomolecular condensates are inherently multi-component systems, typically comprising of scaffold molecules that drive phase separation and client molecules that are recruited for specific functions. While scaffolds determine the formation and stability of the condensates, clients can be integrated post-condensate-assemblies, sometimes influence the maturation and structure of the condensates. For instance, actin filament structure is determined by the kinetics of actin-binding proteins (ABP) condensates, which over time affect the condensate characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">RNA/DNA-binding proteins (RBP), like TDP-43, hnRNPA1A, α-synuclein and fused-in-sarcoma (FUS) have intrinsic disordered regions and are known to form condensates in cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Their condensates can act as sequesters to accommodate protein-protein, protein-RNA/DNA interactions, involving in the cellular functions, such as stress response, RNA transcription and neuronal functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. These proteins are particularly interested due to their association with neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Taking FUS protein as an example, its mutations are tightly linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. These mutations often cause FUS to mislocalize to the cytoplasm, where it undergoes liquid to solid transition (LST) from a dynamic liquid-like state to solid, aggregate-prone forms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. This pathological aggregation disrupts stress granule function and sequesters essential cellular components, leading to loss of normal nuclear functions, such as DNA repair and RNA processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Together, these dysfunctions contribute to progressive neuronal damage and are characteristic hallmarks of ALS and FTD pathology.</p><p id="P4">Previous studies have shown that FUS protein can undergo LLPS forming condensates. With aging and physical stimulation, the condensates can undergo further LST forming β-sheet rich solids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>It has been demonstrated that aging of the condensates increases the viscosity, reduce the molecular mobility and the LST is promoted by the condensate surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. However, most studies have focused either on single-component systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> or RNA as a modulator of phase separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Overlooking the complex interplay between scaffold proteins and client molecules. For example, FUS protein forms condensates that recruit DNA fragments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and DNA repair proteins such as Ku70/80, NBS1, SFPQ, and 53BP1 (polymerase and ligase)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> to facilitate crucial steps in the DNA repair process. However, whether and how the client molecules such as DNA actively contribute to protein condensate physicochemical characteristics is unclear.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we investigate the spatiotemporal behaviour of FUS condensates with DNA partitioning at different aging stages. We measure the partitioning kinetics, coalescence kinetics, and molecular dynamics by using microscopic technique such as confocal imaging and optical approach such as Spatial Dynamic Mapping (SDM). We found that DNA partitioning into FUS condensates is controlled by the FUS condensates’ characteristics, following a core-shell structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DNA recruitment modulates condensate dynamics and internal structures, suggesting that DNA plays an active role in FUS condensate maturation. These findings provide new insights on how to modulate protein condensate phase transitions and prevent irreversible aggregation, shed light on potential treatment and therapies for protein aggregates related diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Aging of FUS condensates slows down DNA partitioning</title><p id="P6">To examine the role of condensates in molecular sequestration, we explored DNA recruitment into FUS condensates. FUS condensates were prepared at a final concentration of 2 μM FUS and 50 mM KCl, following an established protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. We then aged the FUS condensates for 1 hour (1hr-FUS), 5 hours (5hr-FUS), 24 hours (24hr-FUS), and 48 hours (48hr-FUS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Following condensate formation, we introduced 100 nM of Cy3-tagged DNA at different aging stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Through confocal imaging we observed that DNA partitioned into preformed FUS condensates by propagating from the shell of the condensate to the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To our surprise, freshly formed condensates dissolve upon the partitioning of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> <italic>top row</italic>, c). The fluorescence signal from both FUS and DNA reduce to below detection levels within 700 s, showing that both molecules return to a dispersed state with no further phase separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) (Supplementary Video 1). Meanwhile we observed a similar trend of DNA partitioning into aged FUS condensates as seen in freshly formed condensates but without condensate dissolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). As DNA is highly charged, we suspect fresh condensates are more sensitive to the electrostatic changes due to the high internal molecular dynamics, while semi-aged (5-24 hours) condensates are still flexible to recruit DNA molecules but more stable to resist the dissolution due to the fluctuation of the charge (Supplementary Video 2).</p><p id="P8">Interestingly, after 30-minutes of observation, the DNA partitioning for 24hr-FUS is mostly at the shell of the condensates unlike for 5hr-FUS, for which the DNA is already at the core, indicating there’s a difference of partitioning kinetics due to aging of FUS condensates. To confirm this, we continued monitoring DNA partitioning until the DNA fluorescence signal reached a plateau. Average intensity of DNA signal is measured from at least 3 condensates as a function of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Results have shown that DNA signal increases at all aging states and plateaus at 17-25 hours depending on the aging. To be noted, there is no decrease in FUS fluorescence intensity with the partitioning of DNA, indicating that there is only influx of DNA into FUS condensates. During the recruitment, 5hr-FUS condensates have the highest DNA intensity, followed by 24hr-FUS and then 48hr-FUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Previous study has shown that FUS condensates can undergo LST within 48 hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Our findings suggest this aging induced LST hinders the ability of FUS condensates to take up DNA. The reduced ability may result from the loss of available heterotypic (FUS-DNA) interacting sites, as charged and aromatic residues becoming locked into stable hydrogen bonded β-sheets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Furthermore, we noticed there were differences in the rate of DNA partitioning across aging stages. To quantify these differences, we measured the half-time of DNA partitioning as the time needed for DNA to reach half of its maximum concentration in the condensates. Condensates formed from different experiments were used to assess replication. The results indicated that 48-hour-aged condensates recruit DNA approximately two times slower than 5-hour and 24-hour samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). These findings support the hypothesis that LST progressively impairs the ability of condensates to recruit DNA. We propose that in the more solid-like 48-hour-aged FUS condensates, the reduced partitioning efficiency is due to decreased molecular mobility, and increased internal viscosity and elastic modulus of FUS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, which together hinder both the diffusion of DNA and the FUS–DNA interactions.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Diffusion pattern of DNA partitioning into FUS condensates during aging</title><p id="P10">Our data has shown a distinct diffusion pattern of DNA within FUS condensates. To gain insights into the effects of LST-induced structural heterogeneity, we measured the DNA diffusion (estimated based on its fluorescent intensity) across five distinct regions within the condensates over time, from the shell to the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). It is important to note that we measured the recruitment kinetics of condensates with similar sizes (8-10 μm in diameter) to avoid bias in volume differences, while still capturing the variation in diffusion characteristics between the shell and core regions.</p><p id="P11">Our results show that in semi-aged 5-hour and 24-hour FUS condensates, DNA reaches the core of the condensate within 2.5 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, c</xref>), while 48-hour FUS condensates require more than 15 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). These results are consistent with previous data, indicate that the diffusive behaviour of DNA varies across different aging stages. Interestingly, for 24-hour and 48-hour condensates the plateau concentration of DNA at core is higher than at the shell, showing a core-shell pattern. We suspect this is due to the greater recruitment capacity of the condensate’s dynamic core.</p><p id="P12">We further calculated the diffusion coefficient of DNA in the five regions inside FUS condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). The diffusivity of DNA in 5-hour FUS condensates ranged from 35 μm<sup>2</sup>/s at the shell, with an increase to 74 x 10<sup>−4</sup> μm<sup>2</sup>/s in the core area. Similarly, in 24-hour FUS condensates, DNA diffusivity range of 23 to 30 x 10<sup>−4</sup> μm<sup>2</sup>/s, showing only a subtle difference of diffusion from shell to core areas. Notably, in 48-hour condensates, this core-shell diffusion pattern was no longer observed, and the overall diffusivity dropped significantly to 5 × 10<sup>−4</sup> μm<sup>2</sup>/s, an order of magnitude slower than in the earlier aging stages. This suggests that aged condensates slow down the diffusion of client molecules due to the increase of the viscosity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">Despite previous studies having shown that there is a distinct characteristic within the core-shell area of condensates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, we suspect that the absence of a core-shell DNA diffusive gradient is because of the short hydrodynamic radius of the DNA. Our model DNA is relatively small with 207 base pairs; therefore, the formation of a gradient gel-like network from shell to core was not sufficiently dense enough to obstruct DNA movement and affect its diffusion behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>DNA partitioning leads to SLT of FUS condensates</title><p id="P14">Building on our observations of altered DNA diffusion dynamics, we next examined how DNA partitioning changes over time and whether it influences the physical properties of FUS condensates. To investigate how condensate stability responds to increasing DNA levels at different aging stages, we tested a range of DNA concentrations (50–300 nM), based on previous findings that RNA influences condensate dynamics in a highly concentration-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P15">Confocal imaging was performed after 24 hours of incubation of the mixture of the condensates and DNA, allowing the system to reach near-equilibrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We found the addition of high concentrations of DNA (100-300 nM) dissolved freshly formed FUS condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In contrast, aged condensates exhibited greater resistance to high DNA concentration and underwent a solid-to-liquid transition (SLT), leading to coalescing events. Interestingly, 5hr-FUS only dissolve at DNA concentration higher than 200 nM. Meanwhile, 1wk-FUS condensates remained even with high DNA concentration. Some of the 1-week-aged condensates, particularly the small ones, retained the ability to recruit DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, red arrows). This might be the result of the SLT of FUS condensates at the highest concentration of DNA. Together, these results suggest that FUS condensates remain in a liquid-like state up to 48 hours of aging, beyond which they acquire solid-like characteristics that mostly resist both dissolution and partition of DNA.</p><p id="P16">We next analysed condensate size distributions across varying DNA concentrations and aging stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). As expected, increasing DNA concentration leads to larger condensates in fresher samples due to coalescence, while size shifts are minimal in aged condensates, again, likely due to the formation of more solid-like networks in 1-week-old FUS. Notably, coalescence occurred once DNA began to be recruited into condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Coalescence times increased by two orders of magnitude for 5- and 24-hour FUS, and by three orders for 48-hour FUS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary 1a</xref>). Condensate fusion followed an exponential relaxation trend in aspect ratio, from which we calculated relaxation times of 55 s for 5-hour, 73 s for 24-hour, and 1986 s for 48-hour FUS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary 1b</xref>). Where no coalescence was observed in single-component FUS condensates beyond 48 hours of aging. These findings are consistent with previous studies, where single-component fresh FUS condensates had relaxation times ranging from milliseconds to 10 seconds, while aged condensates (&lt;30 min) showed relaxation times of approximately 30 seconds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">Previous study suggests that the coalescence of condensates can rearrange the location of DNA at the condensate interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. The primary driving force behind condensate coalescence is the reduction of interfacial free energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, with droplets fusing to form larger ones due to the energetically favourable decrease in surface area. This is aligned with our observation that the coalescence of FUS condensates starts before DNA reaches the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary 1</xref>), suggesting that molecular influx immediately drives coalescence by altering condensate composition, surface tension, and internal dynamics.</p><p id="P18">Finally, to assess the impact of the aging process, we measured the partition coefficient of DNA at different concentration and aging stages. Briefly, the partition coefficient (Kp) is the ratio of the client molecule concentration in the condensed phase to the dilute phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Results show that, for the low DNA concentrations, the partition coefficient decreases as condensates age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). However, for the high DNA concentrations, aged condensates recruit and retain the DNA molecules, while fresher condensates dissolve into the disperse state, in agreement with the previous results.</p><p id="P19">These findings suggest that while aging reduces the ability of condensates to actively recruit client molecules from the surrounding environment, aged condensates develop a stable microenvironment that retains and concentrates client molecules. In disease-related contexts, a lower ability of FUS to recruit client molecules might result in compromised cellular functions. On the contrary, condensate aging may also play a role in preserving key biomolecular interactions or buffering undesired components in high molecular flux conditions (e.g., stress, overexpression, high molecular signalling exchange)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>DNA partitioning increases the dynamics of FUS condensates in the short term but accelerates LST in the long term</title><p id="P20">Moving forward, we focus on the effects of DNA partitioning over different time scales on the dynamics within FUS condensates. Specifically, we aim to investigate the effects of short-term DNA partitioning and the long-term outcomes once DNA partitioning plateaus. Here, we probed the dynamics within the condensates using a bespoke previously reported Spatial Dynamic Mapping (SDM) optical technique to reveal the material properties within the condensates at high spatial resolution. Briefly, this method enabled us to measure the dynamics of molecules at specific locations within a condensate by analysing the spatial variance in real space over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. A short characteristic time indicates liquid-like behaviour, while a long characteristic time corresponds to solid-like behaviour.</p><p id="P21">We investigate the changes in dynamics within 5hr-, 24hr- and 48hr-FUS condensates in the presence of 100 nM DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Using SDM, we find that FUS condensates alone become more solid-like during aging, consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Subsequently, we performed SDM analysis upon DNA partitioning at different aging stages of the condensates. The analysis is performed after the DNA reaches a uniform intensity from shell to core (2.5 – 6 hours depends on the aging stage). The results reveal that all condensates become more dynamic after the recruitment of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). This finding aligns with other studies, which have shown that the exchange of molecules enhances the overall dynamics of condensates through molecular rearrangement within the dense phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">Next, we examined the dynamics of the condensates after 24 hours aging of FUS-DNA condensates. All 5hr-FUS-DNA, 24hr-FUS-DNA and 48hr-FUS-DNA condensates became more solid-like. Interestingly, we observe a greater degree of heterogeneity in dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>) resembling a porous network, that is also demonstrated by the confocal images of the condensates (GFP signal alone) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). From our results, it has shown that although DNA partitioning can dissolve and increase the dynamicity of the condensates, the LSTs still occur during aging after the recruitment of molecules. Meanwhile, the partitioning of DNA might alter the irreversibility of LST of condensates, resulting in more uneven network formation within the condensates.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>DNA partitioning introduces irreversible microstructural changes of FUS condensate</title><p id="P23">To probe internal spatial reorganization effects from DNA partitioning, we performed a dissolution assay. Briefly, we added 1 M KCl to FUS-DNA condensates after a 24-hour incubation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a</xref>). This incubation time is chosen to ensure DNA partitioning reaches a near plateau.</p><p id="P24">As aging progressed, we observed that DNA no longer distributed evenly throughout the condensates but instead localized preferentially in the core of 24hr-FUS-DNA condensate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5b</xref>). The rearrangement of DNA within the condensates, likely results from the development of a core-shell architecture during aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. As the shell presents a more crosslinked and solid-like structure, it loses the ability to recruit DNA molecules. In contrast, the more dynamic and interactive core promotes DNA recruitment and retention. Following this, a dissolution assay was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Upon the addition of KCl solution, the condensates dissolve quickly with most of the fluorescent signal dispersed into the diluted phase (Supplementary Video 3). A porous and heterogeneous FUS network is left with a very small amount of DNA evenly distributed through the condensate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref> bottom row). This experiment suggests the irreversible DNA-protein covalent binding is minimum in the protein-DNA condensate and does not take part in the solid network formation. Instead, there are transient bindings between DNA and protein molecules, influencing the condensate phase behaviour.</p><p id="P26">Furthermore, we compared the dissolution results without and with the presence of different concentration of DNA (0, 50, 100 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Interestingly, with 50 nM DNA partitioned, FUS condensates barely dissolved at all aging stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref> mid row). Meanwhile, with 100 nM of DNA partitioned, 5hr-FUS condensates dissolved but the semi-aged condensates (24hr- and 48hr-FUS) showed porous solid network structure and a solid shell after dissolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref> top row). Comparatively, with the absence of DNA partitioning, all FUS condensates dissolved except for 1wk-FUS condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref> bottom row). This result indicates that without DNA partitioning, FUS condensates remained in high-viscosity liquid as opposed to an irreversible porous solid network. In the presence of DNA, transient interactions occur between DNA and protein. We suspect, at a high concentration, DNA saturate the active binding sites and disrupt the protein-protein interactions, resulting in formation of solid structures. In contrast, at a lower concentration, DNA molecules available were not enough to occupy all the active binding sites of FUS. It possibly screens the charge and enhance the protein-protein interactions, accelerating condensate LST.</p><p id="P27">Finally, using 3-D projection confocal images, we demonstrate zoomed-in porous solid network within the condensates after dissolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). With the DNA partitioning at different aging time, the FUS network density changes. 24-hr FUS shows an irreversible porous core-shell structure after dissolution (Supplementary Video 4), while 48-hr FUS exhibits visibly smaller pore sizes (Supplementary Video 5). Finally, 1 wk-FUS shows a dense shell with no visible pores (Supplementary Video 6). These changes in porosity and morphology suggest that recruitment of nucleic acid can modulate the internal microstructures of FUS condensates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussions</title><p id="P28">In this study, we investigated the dynamic interplay between DNA and FUS condensates during aging, revealing how client molecules can modulate the condensate phase behaviour and structural organization. Upon the addition of DNA, over a short timescale, fresh condensates rapidly dissolve, while aged condensates retain their structure and recruit DNA over time. The partitioning of DNA propagates from shell to core, with DNA molecules accumulated at the core of the condensates at last.</p><p id="P29">Using diffusion kinetics analyses, we found that the degree of DNA partition decreases with condensate’s age. A core-shell diffusion pattern emerges at semi-aging stages. This pattern fades in aged condensates as a solid gel formed across the whole condensate. Our findings further demonstrate that DNA partition has dual effects on FUS condensates: while short-term DNA recruitment can enhance dynamics and promote coalescence via solid-to-liquid transitions (SLT), in the long term, the partition accelerates condensate solidification. Interestingly, DNA appears to accumulate more in the core than the shell in aged condensates, likely due to increased viscosity and solid network in the shell that limit the partition. The formation of an irreversible porous network of FUS emerged while most of the DNA was released into a dispersed phase. It has demonstrated that, depends on the concentration, client molecules can drive internal reorganization and alter the microstructure of condensates.</p><p id="P30">Together, these findings suggest that DNA plays a dual role: it transiently enhances condensate fluidity at early stages but ultimately contributes to the maturation and solidification of FUS condensate over time. This highlights that DNA is not a passive client but act as a modulator of condensate phase behaviour, capable of shaping both phase stability and material properties depending on two factors: client molecule concentration and aging time. This work expands our understanding in how nucleic acid-protein interactions may contribute to either physiological or pathological liquid-to-solid transitions of biomolecular condensates. Our results provide a range of insights into the fundamental principles governing condensate phase behaviour and offer a foundation for developing condensate-based therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>DNA preparation</title><p id="P31">Labelled nucleosomal DNA was prepared by large-scale PCR (5 mL) amplification of the 0w60 DNA sequence with Cy3-labelled forward primer and reverse primer supplied by Integrated DNA Technologies.
