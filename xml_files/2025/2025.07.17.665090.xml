These microbes have evolved a several methods to remove N-glycans from proteins; herein we describe the biochemical and structural characterisation of one such enzyme, a PNGaseA superfamily member produced by the infant-associated <italic>Bifidobacterium bifidum</italic> LMG13195. This PNGase was demonstrated to elicit activity against a wide variety of N-glycan structures yet exhibited a high preference for N-glycans attached to a peptide rather than to a denatured or native protein. This unusual specificity highlights how bacterial species tune their enzymology to different types of substrates. The structural characterisation of this PNGase reveals how its structure determines this specificity while being the first structure presented from the PNGaseA superfamily, revealing a unique ten-stand Î²-sheet cradling a canonical PNGase catalytic module.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">N-glycans are posttranslational modifications on proteins, particularly common on proteins secreted extracellularly, such as antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In the context of the human colonic microbiota, the prevalence of this N-glycosylation means that they are ubiquitously available for these microbes to use as a nutrient source. N-glycans are both host-produced and diet-derived (from both animal and plant sources). Furthermore, fungal yeasts produce large mannan N-glycan structures as a part of their cell wall, so these will be available to the colonic microbes derived from yeast-fermented foods and from mycobiota species also residing in the colon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">There are now several studies characterising the enzymology of N-glycan degradation by human-associated microbes: <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotomicron</italic> and mammalian complex N-glycans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotomicron</italic> and yeast mannan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and both high-mannose and complex N-glycans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, <italic>Phocaeicola massiliensis</italic> and plant/insect N-glycans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> species and high-mannose N-glycans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. There are three families of enzymes that remove the N-glycan from the peptide component and one of these is the Peptide:N-glycosidases (PNGases), which hydrolyse between the protein and the core GlcNAc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The two other families are glycoside hydrolase (GH) families 18 and 85, whose members hydrolyse between the two core GlcNAc sugars to separate the glycan from the protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The infant colonic microbiota is dominated by species of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, especially in breast-fed infants, at least partly due to their ability to directly or indirectly metabolise human milk oligosaccharides as their main carbohydrate and energy source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, N-glycans are also present in human milk and some species of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> have characterised GH18 and GH85 enzymes that are active against N-glycoproteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The presence of these enzymes in infant-associated species of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> indicate that N-glycans are also a source of nutrition. One notable observation showed growth of <italic>B. longum subsp. infantis</italic> ATCC 15697 on a mixture of complex N-glycans released from whey, including both sialylated and non-sialylated structures, of which the majority were degraded during growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In terms of high-mannose N-glycan breakdown, the full enzymatic machinery from a <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic> strain has been biochemically characterised<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Finally, N-glycan fragments have been observed in the faeces of breastfed infants and the dominant bacteria were species of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The ability of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> species to breakdown N-glycans as a nutrient source is thus evident from available literature, although the extent and importance of this activity has not yet been fully elucidated. To further enhance understanding in this area, we searched for possible PNGase enzymes encoded by genomes of infant-associated <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> species and found a single putative candidate in two <italic>B. bifidum</italic> strains, one of which is <italic>B. bifidum</italic> LMG13195 (PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup>).

This provided two candidates from <italic>Bifidobacterium bifidum</italic> LMG13195 and <italic>Bifidobacterium leontopitheci</italic>. Due to the presence of a PNGase being relatively uncommon to species of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, the genetic context was then investigated. To analyse the variable region containing the gene encoding PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> (<italic>pngaseA<sup>bif</sup></italic>) across multiple <italic>B. bifidum</italic> genomes, the genbank files for 18 complete <italic>Bifidobacterium bifidum</italic> strains were downloaded from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website. The initial search was filtered to include only complete genomes, resulting in the selection of the 18 genomes included in the analysis (accessed on 4th July 2025). The downloaded genbank files were uploaded to artemis (v16.0.5) and gene clusters were manually curated by searching for the actetate kinase and phosphoketalase genes, which flank the desired cluster. Once located, gene clusters were saved as a genbank file and uploaded to cagecat clinker1 for analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.

Size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 26/200 column (Cytivia) using an AKTA Pure FLPC system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) was carried out with a buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl (pH 8). SDS-PAGE gels were used to determine the pure fractions, which were then pooled and concentrated. PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> was initially screened using commercial kits, using a sitting drop vapour diffusion method and set up using a Mosquito liquid handling robot (TTP Labtech). The crystallisation experiments were composed of 0.1 Î¼L of reservoir solution and 0.2 Î¼L of protein (25 mg/mL). A second drop of 0.1 Î¼L reservoir solution was also included.

Therefore, assays were designed to test specificity towards both the N-glycan and protein components of these substrates. Three glycoprotein substrates were initially screened that have three different types of N-glycans: high-mannose (bovine RNaseB), mammalian biantennary complex (bovine Î±1acid glycoprotein) and mammalian triantennary complex (bovine fetuin). The protein part of the substrate was also prepared in three different ways â no pre-treatment (native), boiling (denatured) and by removing most of the protein to leave just a fragment (peptide).

This species uses most of the protein as a nutrient source and the remaining N-glycan on a short peptide is purified for assays. In addition to this, the high-mannose N-glycan and complex N-glycan substrates were also pretreated with an Î±1,2-mannosidase (BT3990) and a broad-acting Î±-sialidase (BT0455), respectively, to fully explore potential activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 3-5</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">The results were initially visualised by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and sodium dodecyl sulfateâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), which monitor for released glycan and changes in glycoprotein size, respectively.

PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> was determined to possess activity primarily towards N-glycans attached to just a peptide, some activity against the denatured substrates, and no activity against the native version. To analyse the released glycans from these assays in more detail, high-performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) was used. For the high-mannose N-glycoprotein, released glycans could be detected for denatured protein with both the positive control and PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup>. Notably, high mannose N-glycans of a variety of sizes (Man5-8) were released by PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup>. For the N-glycan on a peptide fragment, the high background means that the peaks corresponding to the different glycans are not clearly identifiable, however, the peak corresponding to Man5 has been highlighted. Furthermore, the chromatograms for the samples where PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> was included are different to the control, whereas the PNGaseL chromatograms look akin to the control. The data suggests that the addition of an Î±1,2-mannosidase, under these assay conditions, does not affect the efficiency of the control or PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup>. The HPAEC-PAD data from assays against glycoproteins with mammalian complex N-glycans also support the conclusions drawn from the TLCs. The activity observed for PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> when the N-glycan is attached to a peptide fragment is considerably higher. The addition of Î±-sialidase, under these assay conditions, does not appear to affect the efficiency of the control or PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup>.</p><p id="P20">To assess the influence of Î±-fucosylation of the core GlcNAc on activity, we used the plant-derived glycoprotein, horseradish peroxidase, as a substrate. It was only possible to carry out these experiments under native and denatured conditions due to the nature of the proteins (not enough to test bacterial growth and subsequent purification). PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> was able to release glycans from this substrate, suggesting that core Î±1,3-fucose can be accommodated in the active site. Activity against plant and insect type N-glycans has been observed previously for both PNGaseA and PNGaseF superfamily members<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Crystal structure of the PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> from <italic>B. bifidum</italic></title><p id="P21">To investigate the structural basis for the unusual specificity displayed by PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> we determined the crystal structure to 1.9 Ã (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 6-9, Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> catalytic module comprises two eight-stranded Î²-sandwich domains and this overlays well with the solved structures from the PNGaseF superfamily. To demonstrate this, superimposition of the crystal structure of archetypal PNGaseF from <italic>Elizabethkingia meningoseptica</italic> (1PNF) and PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> shows an RMSD of 4.8 over 248 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Strikingly, however, in the PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> structure there is an additional large ten-strand Î²-sheet closely associated with this core catalytic module which cradles the entirety of one side of the catalytic module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This is absent in all other solved PNGase structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">Notably, a magnesium ion was observed in the active site of this structure, and it is coordinated by waters molecules and four residues, both directly and indirectly, in an octahedral geometry (D107, T109, E126, E236; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). The equivalent residues to D107 and E236 in PNGaseF (D60 and E206) have previously been shown to be essential for catalytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, metal has not been implicated in the catalytic activity of PNGases and the importance of magnesium for activity was not explored further here. Similar metal binding has not been observed in other structural data for PNGase enzymes from other organisms. The structure of PNGaseF (1PNF) was solved with chitobiose in the active site and the superimposition of PNGaseF and PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> shows that this magnesium ion is in very close proximity to the reducing end of the core GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>).</p><p id="P23">The overlay of the PNGaseF 1PNF structure and PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> also allows comparison of the residues in the active sites. Interactions with the Î±-face of the core GlcNAc and the Î²-face of the second GlcNAc show significant similarities for four out of five residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Both have two aromatic residues that are tryptophan (W59 &amp; W120) and tyrosine (Y106 &amp; Y161) in PNGaseF and PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup>, respectively. Both structures also have an arginine and aspartate on this side of the disaccharide that overlay well. The residue that differs between the two structures is a glutamic acid (E118) and a threonine (T159) in PNGaseF and PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup>, respectively, nearest to C6 of the second GlcNAc. In PNGaseF, there is evidence that E118 blocks N-glycans with Î±1,3-fucose core decorations so PNGaseF cannot cleave them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. In comparison, T159 in the PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> structure is relatively smaller and contributes to a more open pocket around the C6 and C3 of the non-reducing end and reducing end GlcNAc sugars, respectively. This supports the biochemical data obtained for PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> where release of N-glycans from horseradish peroxidase was observed and these glycans predominantly have Î±1,3-fucose core decorations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Opposite the conserved aspartic acid (D107), there is a conserved glutamic acid (E236) and, as stated above, both have been shown to be essential for catalytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Finally, on the other side of the disaccharide (Î²-face of the core GlcNAc and the Î±-face of the second GlcNAc) this area is much more open for PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> compared to PNGaseF. PNGaseF has an isoleucine and tryptophan pinning the disaccharide into the active site, whereas an asparagine is in the place of this tryptophan in PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> with no equivalent residue to the isoleucine.</p><p id="P24">Analysis of the area around the active site provides insights into why PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> prefers N-glycans on a peptide. Either side of where the reducing end of the core GlcNAc would be positioned are two long pockets that together form a âCâ shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This is likely where a short peptide would be accommodated during catalysis. In comparison to this, the PNGaseF structure is very open around the catalytic site, likely allowing it to accommodate N-glycans attached to larger protein components. PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> B-factors suggest that the loops connecting the Î²-sheets of the cradle near the active site are dynamic, so the structure may open and close to accommodate differently sized substrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). This would explain why PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> can also remove N-glycans from some denatured glycoproteins.</p><p id="P25">An electrostatic overlay was applied to the PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> structure to visualise the charge of the surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Interestingly, one of the pockets is highly negatively charged and the entrance to the other is highly positively charged. In theory, this would support the accommodation of the charged amino- and carboxy- termini of a peptide and support the overall proposal that the function of the C-shaped pocket is to accommodate a peptide. To test the potential for this pocket to accommodate peptide, Alphafold3 was used to model in potential peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). The results indicate that the negatively charged end of the pocket (formed by sandwich 2 loop 2) accommodates the N-terminus of the peptide and a maximum of three or four residues at the N-terminus would allow the correct positioning of an asparagine in the active site. Furthermore, the C-terminal part of the peptide was accommodated in the positively charged part of the C-shaped pocket and threaded through to the open-end of this pocket. The C-terminal part of the peptide is clasped tightly by the Î²-sheet cradle and the loops of Î²-sandwich 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>).</p><p id="P26">To assess the conservation of the protein sequences across the structure, we used ConSurf (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). The results show that the highest conservation of residues is in and around the active site and in two areas on either side of the active site where the Î²-sheet cradle meets the active site module. On one side there are two cysteines that do not form a disulphide bond in this structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>) while on the other side there are two highly conserved arginine residues. These two arginine amino acids are also the residues generating the positive charge at the entrance to one of the pockets.</p><p id="P27">Notably, the C-shaped double pocket of PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> is formed where the catalytic module and the Î²-sheet cradle meet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>), therefore the presence of this sheet in other putative structures will likely indicate a preference for N-glycans attached to short peptides. To investigate this, we assessed models of other PNGaseA across species from Fungi, Bacteria, Archaea, Oomycota and Plant Kingdoms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>). The models predict that the two eight-stranded Î²-sandwich structures of the catalytic module and the large Î²-sheet cradle are highly conserved features in all structures assessed. There are some minor differences, such as a large extra loop in the <italic>Candida viswanathii</italic> structure and the incomplete cradle in the <italic>Cordyceps confragosa</italic> structure. The putative PNGaseA from <italic>Bifidobacterium leontopitheci</italic> was the only example of a putative structure where a small additional module was observed.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Carbohydrate-Active enzyme conservation across <italic>B. bifidum</italic> strains</title><p id="P28">The presence of a gene encoding a PNGaseA appears to be relatively uncommon among members of the <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> genus from the searches carried out during this work. To understand the wider biological context of where PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> fits into the glycan breakdown capacity of <italic>B. bifidum</italic> LMG13195, the conservation of other Carbohydrate-Active enZyme (CAZyme) families was assessed across different strains with different origins of isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The presence of putative GH family members, their frequency within a genome, and the conservation of different GH enzymes across different strains was assessed for host-associated CAZyme families (Table 2). Overall, the frequency of a given GH family is consistent across strains, especially for host-associated enzyme families. The most striking aspect of this analysis was the very high conservation of CAZymes between strains for the different CAZyme primary sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Those enzymes that were assessed had no less than 90 % identity.</p><p id="P29">The highest represented GH family is 13, with between six and ten putative enzymes. These enzymes likely degrade starch and other Î±-glucan polysaccharides, in addition to roles in energy storage within the cell.

The second most prevalent family is GH20 with a consistent four enzymes across strains and &gt;90 % identity in protein sequence. This family often plays a critical role in host glycan degradation in human commensal microbes, and, for example, it is the largest represented GH family in the mucinophilic human colonic commensal <italic>Akkermansia mucinophila</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.

A range of both exo- and endo-acting CAZymes are predicted to be on the surface.</p><p id="P31">Regarding the exo-acting enzymes, there are three Î±-sialidases (GH33), two Î±-fucosidases (GH29 and GH95), an Î±-galactosidase (GH110), a Î²-galactosidase (GH2), two Î²-HexNAcâases (GH84) and a putative Î±-GalNAcâase (GH123) predicted to be on the surface. The published activities are collated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref> and from this information a hypothesis can be proposed about the order different host glycans are broken down into their component sugars. All of these enzymes, bar the GH123, have had some level of specificity defined, which means that a fairly accurate glycan utilisation model can be proposed for the CAZymology taking place on the surface of <italic>B. bifidum</italic>. The first two CAZymes to act will be the GH33 and GH110 enzymes that will remove Î±-linked sialic acid and blood group B Î±-galactose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, respectively. Sialic acid decorates many different host glycans and blood group B is present in 0-30 % of the population, depending on genetics. The two GH29 and GH95 enzymes have been shown to act on Î±1,3/4- and Î±1,2-linkages, respectively, and human milk oligosaccharides, N-glycans and O-glycans are all commonly decorated with Î±-fucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Notably, there are no Î±-sialidases or Î±-fucosidases predicted to be inside the cell, so this process is compartmentalised to outside the cell, which means that the import machinery likely plays a selective role here. The GH2 Î²-galactosidase has been characterised as having Î²1,4 specificity and demonstrated to act on Lacto-N-<italic>neo</italic>tetraose, lactose and N-glycans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. The two GH84 family members have both been shown to have broad Î²-GlcNAcâase activity, including against N-glycans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Finally, GH123 family members are currently all characterised as having Î²-GalNAc activity, which is most common in ganglioside and globoside structures, but can be present in O- and N-glycans also.</p><p id="P32">The endo-acting CAZymes predicted to be on the surface of the cell include two Lacto-N-biosidases from families GH20 and GH136. The GH20 can remove Î²1,3 disaccharides from Lacto-N-tetraose, ganglioside GA1 and globoside Gb5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The products are likely then imported for further degradation, although the globotriose product from the Gb5 may be further broken down by the GH110. The GH136 has been shown to have the ability to remove both Lacto-N-biose and LacNAc from Lacto-N-tetrose and Lacto-N-<italic>neo</italic>tetraose, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. These are common human milk oligosaccharide and O-glycan structures and are likely imported, although products from both GH20 and GH136 enzymes with a Î²1,4-galactose at the non-reducing end may be hydrolysed by the GH2 Î²-galactosidase. Finally, in the case of <italic>B. bifidum</italic> LMG13195, the PNGaseA is predicted to also be on the surface and target N-glycans on short peptides which can then be sequentially broken down by the GH2 and GH84 enzymes. <italic>B. bifidum</italic> genomes do not encode GH families with Î±-mannosidase activities, so it is hypothesised that the mannose parts of these glycans are not accessed as a nutrient source but are instead cross-fed to other members of the microbiota.</p><p id="P33">Once the host glycans are imported into the cell, it is hypothesised that they can be broken down using the four Î²-galactosidase (2xGH2 and 2xGH42) and three Î²-GlcNAcâases (GH20)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Notably, one of these GH20 enzymes has specificity for 6S-GlcNAc common to mucins. In parallel with these enzymes, there are two GH112 putative Lacto-N-biose phosphorylases currently uncharacterised.

The reason why this enzyme is intracellular in comparison the sialidases and fucosidases, for example, remains poorly understood. In terms of mucin breakdown, <italic>B. bifidum</italic> has a GH101 and GH129 predicted to be intracellular. These enzyme families are characterised to act on the T and Tn antigen of O-glycan cores, which implies that <italic>B. bifidum</italic> can import O-glycoproteins. Finally, a GH36 is also predicted to be inside the cell and this family has been shown to have Î±-galactosidase/GalNAcâase activities.

This highlights how the protein component of glycoprotein substrates, rather than the glycan component, can influence the types of substrates microbes can access, which has not been explored before in microbial nutrient acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). In the case of colonic-dwelling <italic>B. bifidum</italic>, the breakdown of the protein component of a glycoprotein would occur either by proteolytic microbes or the host digestive enzymes and the remaining N-glycan:peptide would be a substrate for a PNGaseA.</p><p id="P37">Furthermore, we solved the structure of PNGaseA<sup>Bif</sup> to understand the origin of the observed specificity.

Towards the C-terminus of the protein a region of low complexity was highlighted by searches and is comprised of predominantly proline, threonine, serine and glutamine, which suggests this area is a linker region.
