Local condensates or transcription factor hubs are a proposed mechanism for facilitating gene activation by nuclear complexes. To investigate their importance in endogenous Notch signalling, we deployed multi-colour live-imaging to measure Notch transcription-complex enrichment at a target gene locus in combination with the transcription dynamics. The co-activator Mastermind (Mam) was present in signalling-dependent nuclear foci, during Notch active developmental stages. Tracking these highly-dynamic Mam hubs together with transcription in the same nucleus, revealed that their condensation precedes and correlates with the profile of transcription and becomes stabilized if transcription is inhibited. Manipulations to signalling levels had concordant effects on hub intensities and transcription profiles, altering their probability and amplitude. Together the results argue that signalling induces the formation of transcription hubs whose properties are instrumental in the quantitative gene expression response to Notch activation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">To make and organise different tissues, cells decipher information from developmental signalling pathways. Transmitting this information accurately, so that cell-surface signals are translated into correct transcriptional responses, is of critical importance. For example, dosage and dynamics of Notch activity are fundamentally important for developmental decisions, for sustaining stem cells and for tissue homeostasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Misregulation underlies many diseases including cancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Signalling is normally initiated when transmembrane ligands on adjacent cells interact with the Notch receptor at the membrane. This brings about proteolytic cleavages to release the intracellular domain, NICD, which forms a tripartite complex with the DNA binding protein CSL and coactivator Mastermind <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. The tripartite complex is recruited directly to regulated gene loci, where it promotes their transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. As there is no amplification step, the numbers of active transcription complexes directly relate to the number of receptors activated and it remains to be established how they efficiently and quantitatively elicit target gene transcription.</p><p id="P4">One model is that Notch transcription complexes form hubs, local zones of high-density clustering that facilitate the recruitment of transcription machinery and RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) to direct transcription <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Hubs, or condensates, have been detected in a range of contexts where their formation relies on protein-DNA and multivalent protein-protein interactions, often involving low-complexity regions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Broadly, they can be described as non-stoichiometric assemblies, which drive biological functions by transiently increasing local concentrations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Although initially detected under conditions of protein over-expression transcription factor hubs are increasingly observed in physiological conditions making it plausible that they perform an important step in transcriptional regulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Indeed, recent studies suggest that hub densities correlate with the transcriptional output from gene loci <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">There is mounting evidence that condensation of nuclear hormone receptors and coregulators play an important role in transcriptional regulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Assembly of nuclear condensates containing yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcription coactivators has also been seen in cells, where it is modulated by Hippo signalling or mechanical changes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Similarly, using live imaging approaches, we previously observed a hub-like enrichment of Notch transcription complexes around a target locus, in a tissue where ectopic Notch activity was induced <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. As with the YAP condensates, the zone of enrichment concentrated additional factors that included Mediator and Pol II in those nuclei where transcription was occurring <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. It is thus plausible that such hubs play an integral part in signalling responses.</p><p id="P6">To explore the role of transcription hubs in Notch signalling we focus here on a biological context where the Notch pathway is endogenously active, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicular epithelium. Through in vivo live imaging of endogenous members of Notch transcription complexes together with a method for labelling the Notch-regulated <italic>E(spl)</italic>-Complex [<italic>E(spl)-C</italic>] we could detect localised condensates or transcription hubs in the stages when Notch signalling is occurring. To investigate the role of these hubs in mediating the response to Notch, we tracked the co-activator Mam, a component of the Notch active transcription complexes, at the same time as measuring responding gene expression profiles using the MS2/MCP system with two Notch targets. This revealed that the Mam transcription hubs are dynamic and reach their maximal intensity just prior to transcription initiation. Hub intensity is altered by changes in Notch activity, indicating that they are signalling induced, and the consequential effects on transcription argue that gene-specific Mam transcription hubs have a key role in coordinating the probability and levels of gene activity in response to Notch activation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mastermind hubs are present during Notch active time-window</title><p id="P7">The active Notch transcription complex, containing Mastermind (Mam), forms a local hub of enrichment at a target gene complex under conditions of prolonged ectopic activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. To investigate whether similar hubs occur when the pathway is endogenously active, we chose to focus on the follicular epithelium (FE) in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary which undergoes a period of Notch signalling between stages 5 to 8 of egg chamber development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Notch activity in this monolayer follicular epithelium relies on ligands produced by the underlying germ-line cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, as illustrated by the expression of Delta:mScarlet, which is present in the membranes at the interface between the germline and the follicle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The broad distribution of Delta is consistent with the adjacent FE cells having an equivalent potential for Notch activity.</p><p id="P8">To investigate the formation of transcription hubs in this context, we analysed the distribution of endogenously tagged factors by live-imaging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The core transcription factor CSL and its partners the coactivator Mam and the corepressor Hairless are all present in follicular cell nuclei throughout the period analysed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). All exhibited a degree of heterogeneity within each nucleus, consistent with them forming condensates or “hubs”. To investigate if these hubs are associated with Notch regulated loci, we took advantage of the Par/Int system to identify the <italic>Enhancer of split complex [E(spl)-C]</italic> locus in live tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. This relies on recruitment of fluorescently tagged Par binding proteins to their cognate <italic>int</italic> sequences which have been engineered into the <italic>E(spl)-C</italic> locus and result in a locus-specific fluorescent spot within each nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). The levels of factors colocalising with this tagged locus were then compared to those elsewhere in the nucleus. Results from multiple nuclei were pooled and the average intensity centered on the locus region was visualised by heatmaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>).</p><p id="P9">All three members of Notch transcription complexes CSL, Mam and Hairless were significantly enriched at the <italic>E(spl)-C</italic> locus during the stages analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D,E</xref>) whereas an unrelated transcription factor, Sox 14, was not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>). The DNA-binding CSL was enriched from stages 5 to 10, and at broadly equivalent levels from stage 6 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, the coactivator Mam was enriched in a more restricted time window, from stage 5-8 with the highest levels detected during stage 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). The period of Mam recruitment corresponds to the time when the Notch pathway is active <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and the locus-specific enrichment of Mam was absent in tissues exposed to a gamma-secretase inhibitor for 4 hours to block the activating cleavage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>). These data demonstrate that Mam hub formation requires Notch activity. The average diameter of the Mam puncta is circa 500nm which is close to the diffraction limit of the microscope and the majority may be smaller based on estimates from single molecule tracking <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Overall, they have similar properties to the hubs formed by the Bicoid and Dorsal transcription factors in the embryo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> suggesting they correspond to similar transcription factor condensates.</p><p id="P10">In the absence of Notch activity, CSL is associated with the co-repressor Hairless and, in agreement, Hairless was associated with the target locus during a more prolonged period and became more highly enriched in stages 9-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). The fact that CSL and Hairless remain enriched after Notch is no longer active (stages 9 and 10) is consistent with a repressive role in those later stages and with evidence indicating that regulated loci retain a memory of Notch activity for several hours <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the presence of all 3 proteins during the period of Notch pathway activity fits with the proposal that dynamic exchange between activator and corepressor complexes tunes the response to signalling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Here we primarily focus on the striking recruitment of the co-activator Mam as a measure of a signalling-induced transcription hub at an endogenous locus.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Dynamics of Notch target-gene transcription in follicular cells</title><p id="P11">The live imaging indicates that Mam transcription complexes are enriched at <italic>E(spl)-C</italic> during the period of endogenous Notch activity. To investigate the relationship between the Mam hubs and target gene transcription, we began by characterising the transcriptional response in the FE using single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Using fluorescently labelled probes for <italic>E(spl)m7</italic> and <italic>E(spl)mβ</italic>, both of which are expressed in the FE in response to Notch signalling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, we focused our analysis on the bright nuclear foci that correspond to the Active Transcription Sites (ATS) as a measure of the actively transcribing cells at each time point (Robinson-Thiewes et al., 2020; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Only one ATS was detected per nucleus for each gene and contrary to expectations, only a low proportion of nuclei contained an ATS for one or both genes at any given time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). More nuclei contained ATS for <italic>E(spl)-mβ</italic>, (15-20% at stage 6) than for <italic>E(spl)m7</italic> (4-5% at stage 6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). However, the majority (&gt;90%) of <italic>E(spl)m7</italic> ATS co-localised with an <italic>E(spl)-mβ</italic> ATS suggesting they respond to the same signalling input, and that E(spl)<italic>mβ</italic> has a higher probability of transcription than E(spl)<italic>m7</italic>.</p><p id="P12">Given the requirement for Notch activity throughout the epithelium and the duration of the developmental stage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, all nuclei are likely to undergo one or more periods of transcriptional activity. The relatively low proportion of nuclei with ATS at any one time-point suggests that each nucleus transcribes for short “active” periods, interspersed with longer periods of inactivity. To investigate this possibility and further analyse the dynamics of transcription at stage 6 we employed the MS2/MCP system, to image transcription from <italic>E(spl)m7</italic> and <italic>E(spl)mβ</italic> in real time <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. MS2 loops were introduced into the endogenous genes by CRISPR-Cas9 engineering (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">methods</xref>) and the resulting strains combined with MCP::GFP and Histone::RFP so that transcribing nuclei could be identified and tracked in space and time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Confocal live imaging of isolated ovaries revealed bright puncta in follicle cell nuclei corresponding to nascent transcription of the endogenous genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Movies S1,S2</xref>). In both cases, transcription was highly asynchronous and stochastic between nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) as suggested by the distribution of ATS and despite Delta expression in all neighbouring cells and the requirement for Notch activity throughout the FE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">As illustrated by the kymographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), <italic>E(spl)m7-MS2</italic> and <italic>E(spl)mβ</italic>−<italic>MS2</italic> transcription profiles were characterised by active periods of several minutes, during which transcription foci could be detected, followed by periods of inactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). In agreement with the results from smFISH, only a low percentage of nuclei were active in any 5-minute time-window and a higher proportion of nuclei were transcribing <italic>E(spl)mβ-MS2</italic> than <italic>E(spl)m7-MS2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). The proportions are approximately half those detected by smFISH, a result that is consistent with only one of the two alleles being active at any time (since only one allele has MS2 loops). The two genes had active periods of similar durations, with those of <italic>E(spl)mβ-MS2</italic> on average slightly shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>) and most underwent a single period of activity within the circa 1hr timeframe of imaging. For the few nuclei with two active periods (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) the intervening periods of inactivity were highly variable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2D</xref>). Altogether, it is evident that the transcription profiles are highly dynamic with short periods of activity occurring with relatively low frequency. However, once nuclei initiate transcription, maximal levels are achieved very rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>), with <italic>E(spl)mβ -MS2</italic> reaching higher levels of mRNA production than <italic>E(spl)m7-MS2 (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref><italic>). B</italic>y calibrating accurately the MS2/MCP fluorescence against the measurements using smFISH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2B, C and E</xref>), we estimate that a maximum of 35 RNAs are actively being transcribed at any time point during the height of <italic>E(spl)mβ</italic> activity, with a detection threshold of 3 molecules.</p><p id="P14">Gene activity periods are usually comprised of multiple ON and OFF cycles known as transcriptional bursts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Consistent with this model, transcription levels of both genes fluctuated within each active period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E,F</xref>) and we therefore used a statistical inference method, BurstDECONV, to deconvolve the MS2/MCP signal traces into individual transcription initiation events <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2F</xref>). This generates a distribution of waiting times between successive polymerase initiation events and the number of exponentials required to fit these data then determines the number of promoter states in the model. As the resulting distributions for <italic>E(spl)mβ</italic> and <italic>E(spl)m7</italic> active periods could not be fitted by a bi-exponential model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2G</xref>) but could be fitted with 3-exponentials, our analysis suggests the existence of 3 promoter states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2G</xref>). These consist of a competent promoter-ON state and two distinct promoter-OFF states, one of which may correspond to a polymerase paused state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. The mean durations and probabilities of the 3 states were broadly similar for the two genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2I</xref>) and suggest that, within each active period, their promoters are rapidly switching between ON and OFF states with similar likelihoods.</p><p id="P15">In the competent, promoter-ON, state there is a variable probability of transcription being initiated, defined as kini. The main difference between <italic>E(spl)mβ and E(spl)m7</italic> transcription kinetics was the magnitude of kini, which was significantly larger for <italic>E(spl)mβ</italic>, consistent with the greater amplitude of its transcription intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I,J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2H</xref>). Thus, the two genes differ in the probability of PolII release once a promoter is in the ON state within each period of activity, as well as in the probability that a nucleus will enter into an active period.</p><p id="P16">In summary, these results demonstrate that the transcriptional response to Notch activity in the epithelium is probabilistic. Nuclei transcribe for short periods and then enter a variable inactive period before reinitiating. This pattern is not simple to reconcile with the ensemble averaging for Mam enrichment at this stage and was unexpected in a tissue where the cells are exposed to ligand over a prolonged period. Notably, it differs from the highly penetrant and synchronised response in the mesectoderm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Mam hubs are dynamic and precede transcription initiation</title><p id="P17">Having observed that Mam is enriched at <italic>E(spl)-C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) and that the transcriptional profiles are highly dynamic, we sought to investigate the relationship between the two. To achieve this, we performed live imaging in 3 channels, combining the ParB/Int labeled <italic>E(spl)-C</italic> locus with Halo::Mam and with <italic>E(spl)m7-MS2/MCP</italic> or <italic>E(spl)mβ</italic>-MS2/MCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A, Supplementary movies 3,4</xref>). The levels of Mam at <italic>E(spl)-C</italic> were tracked for up to 3 minutes before transcription was first detected and throughout the active period. Aligning these Mam intensity levels with the onset of MCP/MS2 transcription, revealed that there was a peak of Mam enrichment circa 2 minutes prior to transcription onset, whichever gene was tracked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Mam enrichment at <italic>E(spl)-C</italic> was evident in all nuclei where transcription was initiated but did not reach levels above the nuclear average in nuclei that were not actively transcribing <italic>E(spl)-C</italic> genes, suggesting a threshold mechanism might operate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that formation of a Mam hub is a fundamental step in Notch-dependent activation of transcription but are difficult to reconcile with the cumulative Mam enrichment detected at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), given the relatively low frequency of active nuclei. We therefore returned to cumulative intensities of Mam at <italic>E(spl)-C</italic> and ranked the enrichments in quartiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). This analysis revealed a gradation of enrichments, consistent with the dynamic fluctuations detected by live-imaging.</p><p id="P19">The dynamic changes in Mam enrichment at <italic>E(spl)-C</italic> raise the possibility of a quantitative relationship between Notch activation complexes, as represented by Mam, and the transcriptional output. To assess this, we performed a cross-correlation analysis between the dynamic Mam and MCP/MS2 profiles for each nucleus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. This tests the degree of similarity between two signals as a function of the time lag between them. Strikingly, there was a positive correlation between the Mam hubs and the transcription profiles for both genes, indicating that their rates of change are related to one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). The correlation was maximal when the intensity profiles were shifted relative to one another by 2-5 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F,G</xref>) which implies that the Mam hubs are maximal a few minutes prior to transcription being initiated. We also queried whether Mam enrichment levels correlated with the slope of the MS2/MCP transcription profiles, indicative of a direct relationship between Mam recruitment and PolII loading. There was a positive correlation for <italic>E(spl)m7</italic>, arguing that the two are quantitatively related for this gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3C</xref>). The lack of a similar correlation for <italic>E(spl)mβ</italic> suggests an “all or none” response occurs once a threshold level of Mam is reached.</p><p id="P20">We have previously detected Notch dependent Mam enrichments associated with <italic>E(spl)-C</italic> in another tissue, the salivary glands. In those conditions an additional signal, provided by the hormone ecdysone, was required to bring about robust transcription. To investigate whether the dynamics between the Mam hub and transcription are conserved in this tissue, we imaged the <italic>E(spl)-C</italic> locus in Notch-ON, ecdysone-treated nuclei in combination with <italic>E(spl)mβ</italic>-MS2/MCP at high resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). This tissue is unusual in having polytene chromosomes containing many aligned copies of the genome. When imaged at high resolution in cross-section we could detect heterogeneities within the large diffuse “nuage” of Mam recruited around <italic>E(spl)-C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 5</xref>).

As with Mam hubs in the FE, the maximum correlation was achieved when the two profiles were aligned with a lag, indicating that the Mam hub achieves maximal levels shortly before transcription is initiated and that the rates of change are related (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). To assess Mam behaviour in nuclei that were not transcribing, we imaged tissues without ecdysone treatment. These non-transcribing nuclei had a more homogeneous diffuse “nuage” of Mam enrichment across the chromosome, as described previously, and lacked the dense foci of transcribing nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4B, Supplementary movie 6</xref>; Deharo-Arbona et al., 2024). On this basis, we propose that the smaller dense condensates are analogous to those found in the FE. In both cases they are present transiently and achieve maximal levels prior to transcription. Additionally, a correlation analysis of the Mam profiles against themselves (autocorrelation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>) revealed a small positive correlation at circa 2.5 mins suggesting there is a periodicity in the dynamics of hub condensation under these conditions of ectopic Notch activity.</p><p id="P22">Overall, the results demonstrate that Mam becomes dynamically enriched into a condensed hub that precedes and correlates with transcription being initiated at the Notch regulated genes.

To distinguish whether it is a cause or a consequence of transcription being initiated, we tested the consequence of pretreating the tissues with the highly specific transcription inhibitor, Triptolide, which impedes preinitiation complex (PIC) formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Live imaging of <italic>E(spl)m7</italic>-MS2/MCP after tissues were treated with triptolide for one hour confirmed that transcription had been completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Strikingly however, Mam levels at <italic>E(spl)-C</italic> were enhanced under these conditions, giving rise to a more intense and compact Mam hub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). A second transcription inhibitor, DRB, which interferes with the release of paused PolII also brought about a similar increase in the intensity of the Mam hubs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5A, B</xref>). These results demonstrate that transcription per se is not required for recruitment of Mam into a hub.

Although there was little change in the diffuse Mam recruitment in non-transcribing nuclei following triptolide treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, we detected a significant increase in Mam intensities within condensed hubs of transcriptionally active nuclei, as in the FE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 7</xref>). As Mam is reported to interact with the histone acetylase CBP/p300 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> we also analysed the consequences of exposing tissues to A485, a potent inhibitor of its acetylase activity. CBP/p300 inhibition resulted in a significant decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the condensed Mam hubs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary movie 8</xref>). The A485 treatment did not fully eliminate the dense puncta and the surrounding “nuage” was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, suggesting that other factors also contribute to robust Mam recruitment. However, these data reveal that Mam condensation is slowed or less efficient in the presence of A485, implying that CBP/p300 normally plays an important role similar to its positive effects on Sox2 recruitment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P25">Together these data argue firstly that the formation of condensed Mam hubs at <italic>E(spl)-C</italic> is independent of transcription and is enhanced by the activity of CBP/p300.

We therefore hypothesised that the intensity of Mam hubs would be directed by the levels of Notch activity. To address this question, we used genetic strategies to increase or reduce Notch and monitored the consequences on Mam recruitment and transcription during stage 6.</p><p id="P27">To investigate the consequences from increasing Notch activity, a constitutively active form of Notch, NotchΔECD, was expressed at moderate levels throughout the tissue. Under these conditions, Mam enrichment levels at <italic>E(spl)-C</italic> were strongly elevated giving rise to a dense hub in many nuclei and less diffuse nucleoplasmic protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). The effects of elevated Notch on transcription were then analysed by smFISH and by tracking transcription live with MS2/MCP. In the latter case genetic constraints resulted in conditions with a lower level of NotchΔECD being present (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">methods</xref>). Two main consequences from elevated Notch were seen. First, there was an increase in the proportion of actively transcribing nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6A</xref>). This was most evident for <italic>E(spl)m7</italic>, which showed a marked increase using both approaches, while for <italic>E(spl)mβ</italic> the difference was only evident with in higher overexpression conditions, seen by smFISH, where the proportion and size of the ATS were both increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). Second, the amplitude of transcription, measured by <italic>E(spl)m7-MS2</italic> and <italic>E(spl)mβ-MS2</italic> transcription profile intensities, was increased for both genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6D</xref>) while the active and inactive period durations were unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6B,C</xref>). Thus, the elevated Notch activity results in a greater probability of nuclei entering an active phase and higher level of mRNA production within each active period, which correlates with the increase in Mam hubs.</p><p id="P28">To reduce Notch levels, we generated tissues that were heterozygous for a loss-of-function Notch allele (<italic>N</italic><sup><italic>55e11</italic></sup>).

But their role in endogenous cellular processes remains enigmatic because of the challenge from probing their existence in physiological contexts. Here, by live imaging the co-activator Mam in tissues with endogenous Notch signalling, we demonstrate that high density Mam enrichments, which we refer to as condensed hubs, are induced in conditions with active signalling and that their formation precedes and correlates with gene activity, specifically with the probability and levels of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). These mature transcription-competent hubs are the final step linking Mam recruitment to promoter activation and their stepwise assembly may be a common feature of transcription factor condensates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Understanding how cells decode signals and generate accurate transcription outcomes is of fundamental importance for development, adult homeostasis and disease. Our data implicating a key role for transcription hubs in implementing the Notch signal sheds new light on how activity levels inform the amount of mRNA transcribed from a target gene.</p><p id="P31">The characteristics of the Mam enriched condensed hubs are similar to those observed for synthetic (Gal4-VP16) and endogenous transcription factors in early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and in other contexts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. As in those examples, localised Mam enrichments of less than 500nm are present shortly before transcription onset and decrease in intensity as transcription progresses. Visualising the interplay between hubs and nascent transcription in single cells at high spatiotemporal resolution made it possible to uncover this relationship, which would be masked by ensemble averaging. The correlations between the hub intensities and the active transcription periods suggest that high density Mam hubs directly coordinate transcription initiation, likely through recruitment or release of RNA Pol II <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. The subsequent decrease in hub intensity may be a consequence of nascent RNA production, which has been shown to destabilize transcription factor condensates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. In agreement, the increased intensity/stability of Mam hubs we detect with triptolide or DRB treatment argues that their dynamics are regulated by the transcription cycle, as observed for Mediator condensates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. As degradation of NICD has also been linked to the transcription cycle this may also contribute to the dynamics of Mam recruitment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. In addition, CBP/p300 acetylase activity appears to promote the maturation into dense Mam hubs, similar to its’ roles in the assembly of other transcription hubs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Whichever the mechanisms, the temporal properties of Mam hub formation and dissolution provide a vehicle for transcriptional decoding of dynamic signalling inputs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P32">Since Mam requires NICD for assembly into the transcription complex with CSL we hypothesized that dynamic changes in Notch signalling would translate into Mam levels within the transcription hub. In agreement, locus-specific Mam enrichment was detected during stages when transcription of Notch responsive targets such as <italic>E(spl)m7</italic> and <italic>E(spl)mβ</italic> occurs and was correlated with the ensuing profiles of transcription. Furthermore, changes in levels of Notch activity altered the amount of Mam within the hub in a manner that related to the probability and amplitude of transcription response. In the multi-copy <italic>Drosophila</italic> polytene chromosomes, where we previously detected a diffuse Notch-signalling induced hub in the absence of transcription <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, a change in the local distribution of Mam heralds the transition to transcriptionally active nuclei when it becomes concentrated into condensed foci that prefigure and cross-correlate with sites of active transcription in a similar manner. All of these characteristics support the model that activator-coactivator hubs form in response to signalling and confer a probability of transcription that relates to their intensity and durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p id="P33">As endogenous Notch signalling is maintained over a prolonged period in the follicular epithelium, we were initially surprised to find that transcription of <italic>E(spl)mβ</italic> and <italic>E(spl)m7</italic> occurred sporadically.

As a result, one gene is more frequently activated than another under conditions where Notch activity levels are close to the threshold.

Similarly, inactive periods were quantified when found in between two active ones.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>MS2 signal calibration</title><p id="P52">To estimate the average number of mRNA molecules present in MS2 foci from <italic>in vivo</italic> movies, we first calculated the fluorescence of a single mRNA molecule, using a method similar to<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. Briefly, probe sets with different fluorophores for the gene of interest were hybridized to the samples. Then, after applying a threshold to avoid non-specific particles, the median intensity value of all detected particles was used as a proxy for the intensity of a single particle of mRNA. Active transcription sites (ATS) total intensities were divided by the intensity obtained for a single particle to determine the number of RNA molecules being transcribed. A Q-Q plot was then used to relate the intensities of ATSs, in terms of number of molecules from smFISH experiments, to the arbitrary fluorescence intensities of MS2 foci from the same gene. This yielded a linear relationship with similar parameters for each. The data for the two genes were therefore combined into a single Q-Q plot and the parameters obtained from the linear fit were used to provide the conversion factor to determine the number of mRNA molecules transcribed in the MS2 transcription data.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Modelling</title><p id="P53">Signal deconvolution and kinetic model inference were performed using the BurstDECONV framework <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>.

This pre-processing step ensured comparability between the two genes, as the inactive periods <italic>E(spl)m7-MS2</italic>, due to their long durations, were rarely captured within the timescale of our experiments.

First, confidence intervals for the empirical survival function were calculated using Greenwood’s formula. As an initial validation step, we confirmed whether the best-fit parametric survival curve fell within these confidence bounds. For both <italic>E(spl)m7-MS2</italic> and <italic>E(spl)mβ-MS2</italic>, the two-state model failed this criterion and was therefore excluded from further consideration while the three-state model satisfied this condition for both genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2G</xref>). To further assess model accuracy, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) test in combination with the mean squared deviation (used as the objective function) were employed as quantitative metrics of goodness-of-fit. Our analysis supports a non-sequential three-state model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>) but does not exclude a sequential alternative, where the promoter transitions obligatorily through the transient OFF1 state to move between the Prom ON and the long Prom OFF2 states. However, this sequential arrangement implies a strong dependence between the two inactive states, a relationship for which a plausible mechanistic basis is lacking.</p><p id="P57">The multiexponential distribution fits were used to infer kinetic parameters for Markovian models of transcriptional bursting under steady-state conditions.

These estimates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S7A</xref>) were subsequently used to initialise the linear regression procedure in BurstDECONV, substantially accelerating the fitting process.</p><p id="P59">As reliable extraction of kinetic parameters required that the system had reached a steady-state regime, we computed the average interval between successive Pol II initiation events (⟨τ⟩) within a narrow, temporal window. This average interval has been shown to be proportional to the reciprocal of the product of pON (the likelihood of the promoter being in Prom ON state) and kini, the initiation rate during the active state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. Hence stability in ⟨τ⟩ across different windows served as an indicator that the underlying kinetic parameters remained unchanged over time. A window width of 4 frames (corresponding to 80 seconds) was chosen, which provided enough initiation events to yield a robust estimate of ⟨τ⟩. To assess the precision of these estimates, we applied a bootstrap resampling approach to derive 95% confidence intervals for both genes under investigation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S7B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="P60">Two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test was applied in cases with n &gt; 30 for both conditions tested.
