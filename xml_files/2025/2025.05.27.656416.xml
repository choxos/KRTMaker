Using human iPSC-derived astrocytes, we show that astrocytes cell autonomously generate small, diffusible Aβ aggregates under baseline conditions. By combining ultrasensitive single-molecule imaging (DNA-PAINT) and immunoassays, we detect intracellular aggregates and their release into the media. Notably, lysosomal membrane damage induced by L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLOMe) significantly increases Aβ aggregate secretion without altering their size or morphology. Transcriptomic analysis and cytokine profiling reveal that lysosomal stress triggers a reactive astrocyte phenotype marked by upregulation of inflammatory genes and secreted cytokines. These findings suggest that astrocytes are not merely passive Aβ scavengers but can actively contribute to extracellular Aβ accumulation under lysosomal stress.

While neurons are considered as a major source of Aβ, emerging evidence suggests that glial cells, including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, may also contribute to Aβ pathology. Recent work has demonstrated that oligodendrocytes in both human tissue and mouse models possess the molecular machinery to produce Aβ and can contribute to early plaque formation and neuronal dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. However, whether astrocytes, despite their well-established role in Aβ clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, can themselves produce and release Aβ aggregates remains unclear.</p><p id="P4">Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell type in the central nervous system and play crucial roles in neuronal metabolism, maintenance, synaptic activity, and amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. They respond variably to a wide range of nervous system insults, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, stroke, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Astrocytes are known to undergo deleterious reactive transformation in a range of human neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, driven by proinflammatory factors from microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Notably, astrocyte-specific deletion of the sulfatase modifying factor 1 (<italic>Sumfl</italic>) gene, which is associated with multiple sulfatase deficiency, a lysosomal storage disease, is sufficient to induce degeneration of cortical neurons <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Lysosomal failure also underlies the pathogenesis of numerous congenital neurodegenerative disorders and is an early and progressive feature of AD pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Whether lysosomal damage can alter the handling of Aβ by astrocytes and shift them from clearing Aβ to potential contributors of pathologenesis remains unknown.</p><p id="P5">Different forms of cellular stress can induce permeabilization and rupture of lysosomes. To cope with the detrimental effects of lysosomal damage, cells possess mechanisms to either degrade or repair damaged endomembranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. If unchecked, lysosomal damage can result in the leakage of intralysosomal components, such as cathepsins, into the cytoplasm, inducing lysosome-dependent necroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Although the lysosomal system has been extensively studied in human neurons, the lysosomal membrane damage in glial cells, particularly astrocytes, remain understudied.</p><p id="P6">Here, we use human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes and super-resolution single-molecule imaging to demonstrate that astrocytes produce and secrete Aβ aggregates under basal conditions. We show that lysosomal membrane damage induced by L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLOMe) significantly enhances the release of Aβ aggregates, without altering their structural properties. In parallel, transcriptomic and cytokine profiling reveal that lysosomal stress triggers a reactive transformation in astrocytes, marked by pro-inflammatory gene expression and cytokine release. Together, these findings identify astrocytes as an unappreciated source of Aβ aggregates and establish a mechanistic link between lysosomal damage, reactive transformation, and Aβ aggregate release.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Human iPSC-derived astrocytes produce and release small diffusible Aβ aggregates</title><p id="P7">To determine whether human astrocytes can produce and release amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates, we first used a previously published directed differentiation method to generate highly enriched populations of human iPSC-derived astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and collected both the conditioned media and cell lysates for analysis. We then used a highly sensitive single-molecule pull-down (SiMPull) assay combined with DNA-PAINT super-resolution imaging to detect and characterize individual Aβ aggregates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). SiMPull relies on dual antibody binding and clustering analysis, requiring at least two closely positioned super-resolved assemblies to confirm the specific detection of soluble aggregates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. This highly sensitive approach allowed us to visualize aggregates at the nanometer scale and compare their abundance and structural features across compartments.</p><p id="P8">Majority of the Aβ aggregates are between 30 nm (resolution limit) and 200 nm in length, consistent with the reported size of synaptotoxic Aβ aggregates from human AD brains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we found a significantly higher number of Aβ aggregates in the cell lysates compared to the media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that astrocytes accumulate Aβ intracellularly but also release a portion into the extracellular space. Cumulative frequency analysis showed that aggregates in the media were shorter in length compared to those in the lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), and this was supported by significantly lower average lengths in media samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). We found that small aggregates (&lt;50 nm) were more frequent in the media, while larger aggregates (&gt;200 nm) were enriched in the lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We next examined aggregate shape by analyzing eccentricity, a measure of how elongated or circular the structures are. Aggregates in the media tended to be less elongated, as reflected by lower eccentricity values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). Lysate samples contained a greater proportion of highly elongated aggregates (eccentricity &gt;0.9), whereas more spherical aggregates (eccentricity &lt;0.2) were found in the media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). These data reveal that human astrocytes can produce Aβ aggregates and release a subset into the extracellular space, with secreted aggregates tending to be smaller and less elongated. This supports a model in which astrocytes are active contributors to extracellular Aβ accumulation in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Lysosomal membrane damage enhances amyloid-β aggregate release</title><p id="P10">Having established that human iPSC-derived astrocytes can produce and retain small, diffusible Aβ aggregates intracellularly, we next sought to investigate the cellular mechanisms that might govern their release. Lysosomes play a central role in degrading aggregated proteins, including Aβ, and impaired lysosomal function is increasingly recognized as an early driver of Alzheimer's disease pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. However, the impact of lysosomal membrane integrity on the intracellular retention or extracellular release of astrocyte-derived Aβ aggregates remains unknown. We therefore induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization using the lysosomotropic agent L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLOMe) and examined its consequences on Aβ aggregate distribution and astrocyte state.</p><p id="P11">To assess lysosomal damage in astrocytes, we performed super-resolution instant structured illumination microscopy (iSIM) imaging of Galectin-3 (Gal3), a cytosolic lectin that binds to exposed glycoproteins on the inner membrane of ruptured lysosomes. Treatment with LLOMe resulted in a significant increase in Gal3-positive puncta, confirming lysosomal membrane damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We then asked whether this lysosomal stress influences the release of Aβ aggregates using the highly sensitive single-molecule immunoassay, single molecule array (Simoa). The Simoa assay, a previously validated method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, employs antibody-coated beads to capture Aβ-containing aggregates, followed by incubation with a biotinylated detector antibody. This results in the formation of an immunocomplex with streptavidin β-galactosidase (SBG), which produces a fluorescent readout through resorufin β-d-galactopyranoside (RGP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The digital detection capability of Simoa allows precise quantification of low-abundance Aβ aggregates in the low picomolar range.</p><p id="P13">We observed a significant increase in secreted Aβ aggregates in the media of LLOMe-treated astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), coupled with a marked reduction of intracellular Aβ aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that lysosomal membrane damage promotes the extracellular release of Aβ.</p><p id="P14">To confirm and expand on this finding, we performed DNA-PAINT super-resolution imaging of Aβ aggregates isolated from both media and lysates. LLOMe treatment led to a significant increase in the number of aggregates detected in the media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), while aggregates within the cell lysate were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). These data corroborate the Simoa results and indicate that lysosomal stress facilitates the release of astrocyte-derived Aβ aggregates.</p><p id="P15">We next examined whether lysosomal damage alters the structural characteristics of the released aggregates. In the media, the average length and area of Aβ aggregates remained unchanged following LLOMe treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, in the cell lysates, the average length of intracellular aggregates was significantly reduced, while their area remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). These findings suggest that lysosomal damage promotes the release of aggregates without substantially altering their morphology in the extracellular environment.</p><p id="P16">Together, these results indicate that lysosomal membrane permeabilization triggers the release of Aβ aggregates from astrocytes into the extracellular space and may contribute to Aβ pathology under conditions of lysosomal stress.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Lysosomal damage triggers changes in the transcriptome and secretome suggestive of reactive transformation in hiPSC-derived astrocytes</title><p id="P17">Having established that lysosomal stress promotes the extracellular release of Aβ aggregates from human astrocytes, we next sought to investigate whether this stress also triggers a reactive transformation. Reactive astrocytes are known to upregulate inflammatory genes and secrete cytokines and chemokines in response to cellular stress. To explore these molecular changes in detail, we performed transcriptomic and secretory profile analyses to define the astrocytic response to lysosomal membrane damage.</p><p id="P18">RNA-seq revealed significant upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes, suggesting a transition to a reactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Key upregulated genes included <italic>CCL2, CCL20, CCL5, ICAM1, SERPINE1, HBEGF, IL6,</italic> and <italic>IL8,</italic> which are involved in immune response, cytokine signaling, and cellular stress responses. These findings indicate that LLOMe-treated astrocytes adopt a pro-inflammatory reactive state. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the RNA-seq data revealed significant enrichment of pathways associated with immune responses, chemokine signaling, and cellular stress, which are characteristic of reactive astrocyte transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The most enriched pathway was "response to chemokine" (NES = 2.09, FDR &lt; 0.001), highlighting the activation of genes involved in immune cell recruitment. Other enriched pathways included cytokine-mediated signaling (NES = 1.98, FDR &lt; 0.001) and regulation of apoptotic process (NES = 1.92, FDR &lt; 0.01), suggesting that LLOMe induces pro-inflammatory and stress-related responses in astrocytes.</p><p id="P19">To further characterize the functional impact of LLOMe treatment, we analyzed the release of cytokines, chemokines, metallopeptidases, and growth factors from the culture supernatant. This analysis revealed significant changes in the levels of key immune-related molecules, including IL-8, M-CSF, CXCL1, CCL2, IL-4, IL-17A, CXCL11, TGF-α, BDNF, CCL4, IL1-β, CCL7, IL-10, CCL20, VEGF-A, and CXCL10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). These findings support the conclusion that lysosomal damage promotes a reactive transformation in human astrocytes characterized by a transcriptionally and functionally proinflammatory phenotype.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">In this study, we demonstrate that human iPSC-derived astrocytes produce small, diffusible Aβ aggregates under basal conditions and that these aggregates are released into the extracellular space. Using DNA-PAINT super-resolution imaging, we characterized these structures in both cell lysates and conditioned media, revealing that the majority fall within the size range previously associated with synaptotoxicity in AD. Our findings challenge the prevailing view that Aβ aggregates originate primarily from neurons and support a growing body of evidence that glial cells, including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, may directly contribute to Aβ pathology.</p><p id="P21">Importantly, we show that lysosomal membrane permeabilization via LLOMe markedly enhances the extracellular release of Aβ aggregates from astrocytes. This was accompanied by a decrease in intracellular aggregates, suggesting that lysosomal damage facilitates the redistribution of intracellular Aβ pools into the extracellular environment. Although the structural properties of the aggregates remained largely unchanged, their increased release may exacerbate extracellular Aβ burden and toxicity.</p><p id="P22">We further demonstrate that lysosomal stress drives a reactive transformation in astrocytes, characterized by transcriptional upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and increased secretion of cytokines and chemokines. This dual response—release of potentially neurotoxic aggregates and induction of a reactive, inflammatory state—highlights lysosomal integrity as a central regulator of astrocyte behavior in AD-relevant contexts.</p><p id="P23">Our findings builds on recent studies implicating glial cells in Aβ pathology, including work showing that oligodendrocytes can generate Aβ and contribute to plaque formation in mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Together, these results broaden the understanding of cell-autonomous contributions to amyloid pathology and underscore the need to consider astrocytes not just as passive responders or clearance cells, but as active sources of Aβ under stress conditions.</p><p id="P24">Future studies are needed to explore the upstream triggers of astrocytic Aβ production, to validate these mechanisms <italic>in vivo,</italic> and to determine whether astrocyte-derived aggregates differ functionally or structurally from those of neuronal origin. Targeting lysosomal pathways in astrocytes may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to curb both amyloid accumulation and glial-mediated neuroinflammation in AD.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="T1" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Reagents and Tools Table</title></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top" style="background-color:#E6E6E6">Reagent/Resource</th><th align="left" valign="top" style="background-color:#E6E6E6">Reference or Source</th><th align="left" valign="top" style="background-color:#E6E6E6">Identifier or Catalog Number</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="background-color:#E6E6E6"/><td align="left" valign="top" style="background-color:#E6E6E6"/><td align="left" valign="top" style="background-color:#E6E6E6"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="background-color:#E6E6E6"><bold>Experimental Models</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top" style="background-color:#E6E6E6"/><td align="left" valign="top" style="background-color:#E6E6E6"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Human: CTRL1 iPSC line</td><td align="left" valign="top">This study</td><td align="left" valign="top">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Human: CTRL2 iPSC line</td><td align="left" valign="top">This study</td><td align="left" valign="top">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Human: CTRL3 iPSC line</td><td align="left" valign="top">This study</td><td align="left" valign="top">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="background-color:#E6E6E6"><bold>Antibodies</bold></td><td align="center" valign="middle" style="background-color:#E6E6E6"/><td align="center" valign="middle" style="background-color:#E6E6E6"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">anti-mouse Galectin-3</td><td align="left" valign="top">Biolegend</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#126702</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">anti-chicken GFPA</td><td align="left" valign="top">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#Ab4674</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="background-color:#E6E6E6"><bold>Chemicals, Enzymes and other reagents</bold></td><td align="center" valign="middle" style="background-color:#E6E6E6"/><td align="center" valign="middle" style="background-color:#E6E6E6"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Essential 8 Medium media</td><td align="left" valign="top">Life Technologies</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#A1517001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Geltrex</td><td align="left" valign="top">Life Technologies</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#A1413302</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">EDTA</td><td align="left" valign="top">Life Technologies</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#15575020</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Dorsomorphin</td><td align="left" valign="top">Tocris Bioscience</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#3093</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">SB431542</td><td align="left" valign="top">Tocris Bioscience</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#1614</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">RiboLock RNase Inhibitor</td><td align="left" valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#EO0381</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Formamide</td><td align="left" valign="top">Themo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#17899</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">UltraPure BSA</td><td align="left" valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat#AM2616</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="background-color:#E6E6E6"><bold>Software</bold></td><td align="center" valign="middle" style="background-color:#E6E6E6"/><td align="center" valign="middle" style="background-color:#E6E6E6"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">R project for Statistical Computing v4.2.0</td><td align="left" valign="top">CRAN</td><td align="left" valign="top">RRID: SCR_001905</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">DESeq2</td><td align="left" valign="top">Bioconductor</td><td align="left" valign="top">RRID: SCR_015687</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Salmon</td><td align="left" valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/">https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top">RRID: SCR_017036</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="S8"><title>Methods and Protocols</title><sec id="S9"><title>Differentiation of hiPSC-derived astrocytes</title><p id="P25">Human iPSCs were maintained on Geltrex (Life Technologies) with Essential 8 Medium media (Life Technologies) and passaged using EDTA.

The tools and software used during this process included FastQC (version 0.11.9) for quality control, Cutadapt (version 0.6.7) and Trim Galore (version 3.4) for trimming, and Salmon (version 1.10.1) for quantification. Custom scripts were used for various steps, written in Python (version 3.9.5) and YAML (version 6.0).</p><p id="P30">The mapping and alignment of reads were performed using STAR (version 2.7.10a), and Samtools (version 1.10) was used for post-alignment processing. Additionally, UMI-tools (version 1.1.4) was used for deduplication, and Bioconductor's tximeta (version 1.12.0) and Summarized Experiment (version 1.24.0) packages were employed for transcript quantification and gene expression analysis. All workflows were executed using Nextflow (version 22.10.7) with nf-core/rnaseq (version 3.12.0).</p><p id="P31">Mapped reads were de-duplicated and quantified to generate gene counts for differential expression analysis.

In brief, glass coverslips coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and biotin were treated with neutravidin (0.2 mg/ml) in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 10 minutes. The coverslips were then washed twice with TBST and once with TBS containing 1% Tween 20 (1%T).</p><p id="P33">Next, biotinylated 6E10 antibody (10 nM; BioLegend; 803007) was applied for 15 minutes, followed by two TBST washes and one with 1%T. Media samples were then added and incubated overnight at 4°C, followed by two additional TBST washes and one with 1%T. The coverslips were then incubated with a secondary 6E10 antibody (500 pM; BioLegend; 803020) conjugated to single-strand DNA (ACCACCA) for 45 minutes, followed by two washes with TBST and one with 1%T.</p><p id="P34">After washing, TetraSpeck microspheres (1:7,000 dilution in TBS, 10 μl; Thermo Scientific, Cat. T7279) were introduced to each well for 10 minutes. The TetraSpeck solution was subsequently removed, followed by two additional TBST washes. A second PDMS gasket (Merck, GBL-103250-10EA) was stacked onto the coverslip before adding 3 μl of a complementary imaging strand (TGGTGGT-Cy3B; atdbio) in TBS. Finally, the coverslip was sealed by placing another coverslip over the second PDMS gasket.</p><p id="P35">Images were captured using a custom-built TIRF microscope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> equipped with a 520 nm laser, with an exposure time of 100 milliseconds for 4,000 frames per field of view. Three fields of view were acquired per well. The acquired frames were stacked, reconstructed, drift-corrected, and analyzed to quantify aggregate number and length using ACT software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.

Simoa plates were prepared using a "3-step assay" format, following the Quanterix protocol. The final plate was processed using the Quanterix SR-X Instrument. To maintain a digital readout, we ensured that no sample or calibrant concentrations exceeded an fON value of 0.7, preventing the transition into an analog detection mode where signal intensity is influenced by bead brightness rather than bead count.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p id="P37">Unless otherwise specified, statistics analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (Version 10). Student's t test was used to compare differences between two groups. One-way ANOVA followed by post testing with Dunnett's method was used to analysis differences between more than two groups. For precise p value calculation, a multiple t test was performed after ANOVA calculations. Significance threshold was defined as adjusted p value &lt; 0.05. Error bars in all figures represent SEM.
