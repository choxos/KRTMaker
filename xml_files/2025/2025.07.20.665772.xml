The dynamic behavior of endogenous HSCs in their niches has been challenging to study due to the complexity of markers required to define pure HSCs. Multiple recently developed reporter strategies advanced our capacity to identify HSCs <italic>in situ</italic>. Yet, they provide different levels of HSC enrichment and are frequently not stable in situations of perturbed hematopoiesis, leading to contradictory observations of HSC migratory behavior. Here we employed a new double reporter strategy by combining the <italic>Hoxb5</italic>-mKO2 and <italic>Vwf</italic>-GFP reporters, that are stably expressed in homeostasis, stress and ageing. Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells represent a subset of highly pure and potent long-term HSCs with a platelet-biased pattern of differentiation, that are included in the populations identified by other reporter strategies. Intravital microscopy revealed Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells to be non-migratory in homeostasis, following platelet depletion when these cells are actively proliferating, and during ageing. This non-migratory behavior of HSCs in homeostasis and stress indicates that their activation does not inherently depend on relocation to alternative niches eliciting proliferation, as previously proposed. We found Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs in direct contact with vasculature and LepR<sup>+</sup> perivascular cells but not preferentially closer to megakaryocytes. Nevertheless, increased megakaryopoiesis following platelet depletion brings megakaryocytes into close proximity of Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs, revealing previously unrecognized niche dynamics in HSC regulation during regeneration.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) sustain homeostatic levels of blood cells throughout life thanks to their self-renewal and multilineage differentiation capacity. Additionally, they drive the regeneration of the hematopoietic system following acute stress conditions such as infection and bleeding, or clinical interventions like chemotherapy and bone marrow (BM) transplantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The BM microenvironments, or niches, occupied by HSCs play a critical role in regulating their key fate choices, including the decisions between remaining quiescent or initiating proliferation, and whether to self-renew or differentiate. Within the BM HSCs have been found in distinct anatomic regions and in close proximity to different stromal, endothelial and mature hematopoietic cell types, leading to the hypothesis that distinct HSC niches may exist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Yet, the precise cellular composition of these niches and how HSCs interact with them are still highly controversial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, likely owning to the different levels of HSC enrichment achieved with the multiple phenotypic definitions employed to investigate HSCs <italic>in situ</italic>, and an overall low resolution in the identification of highly heterogeneous niche cell compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">This led to a large effort in generating new reporter strategies to better identify HSCs <italic>in situ</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Ideally, such reporters will be specifically and uniformly expressed in HSCs, with specificity to only an HSC subset being preferable to broader expression that includes other cell types. They should be stable in homeostasis, ageing and in different scenarios of perturbed hematopoiesis, whilst also sufficient for HSC identification, circumventing the need for additional cell surface markers. This allows bypassing the requirement for transplantation and associated BM conditioning, thereby enabling longitudinal studies of the HSCs’ dynamic interactions with the native microenvironment in homeostasis and stress, which is made possible by intravital microscopy (IVM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Among these strategies, <italic>Hoxb5</italic> reporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> confer a high level of HSC enrichment, even though some very low long-term (LT) engraftment has been detected within the Hoxb5<sup>–</sup> HSC compartment, and Hoxb5<sup>+</sup> cells were shown to have a near homogenous perivascular localization in BM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. More recently, 3 new <italic>in vivo</italic> reporter strategies leading to high levels of HSC enrichment within the population of reporter-positive cells revealed contrasting behaviors of endogenous HSCs in homeostasis and following mobilization treatments. Using a <italic>Mds1</italic>-GFP reporter transgene that becomes inactivated following <italic>Flt3</italic>-Cre mediated recombination (MFG reporter), Christodoulou <italic>et al</italic>. reported low HSC motility in homeostasis, and a heterogenous, dynamic behavior following treatment with cyclophosphamide and G-CSF that leads to expansion and mobilization of HSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. This was in line with the stationary behavior of <italic>Hlf-</italic>TdTom<sup>hi</sup> cells in adult mice reported by Takihara <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Conversely, using a fate-mapping reporter strategy where HSCs are labelled following tamoxifen-induced <italic>Pdzk1ip1</italic>-CreER mediated recombination, Upadhaya <italic>et al</italic>. reported significant HSC motility, which is rapidly abrogated in response to mobilization induced through inhibition of Cxcr4 and integrin signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. While these differences might be explained by the different transgenic strategies employed labelling distinct HSC subsets, they highlight the need for new models to further investigate the behavior of endogenous HSCs <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P6">The HSC compartment is highly heterogeneous, comprising different subsets of lineage-biased HSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, and including a platelet-biased subset identified by single cell transplantations and <italic>in steady state by in vivo</italic> genetic barcoding assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Platelet-biased HSCs express the von Willebrand factor (<italic>Vwf</italic>) gene allowing their prospective identification <italic>in vivo</italic>, using <italic>Vwf</italic> reporter transgenes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Importantly, we recently showed that Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs are preferentially recruited into proliferation following acute platelet depletion, with the majority of Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs transitioning into S-G2-M phase of cell cycle within 24 hrs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. This is part of a feedback mechanism that contributes to reestablishing platelet homeostasis and that depends on IL-1 signaling in LepR<sup>+</sup> perivascular niche cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Megakaryocytes (MKs), have been implicated as critical regulators of HSC quiescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and, importantly, Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs have been suggested to occupy a distinct niche, closer to MKs and farther from arterioles in BM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Distinct niche occupancy for quiescent and activated HSCs has been proposed, implying a dynamic behavior where HSCs may migrate from quiescence reinforcing niches to alternative environments eliciting proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. The specific response of Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs to platelet depletion offers the unique opportunity to test if their preferential activation results from changes in HSC-niche interactions, due to HSC relocation or changes in niche composition.</p><p id="P7">Here we employed a new double reporter strategy by combining the <italic>Hoxb5</italic>-mKO2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and the <italic>Vwf</italic>-GFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> reporters to identify highly enriched HSCs <italic>in situ</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and longitudinally investigate their behavior in homeostasis, stress and ageing. IVM revealed Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs to be highly confined within the BM niche in homeostasis, following platelet depletion and during ageing, demonstrating that relocation to a separate niche is not essential for activation of HSC proliferation. Yet, highly dynamic megakaryopoiesis leads to increased proximity between MKs and Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs following platelet depletion, unravelling a novel aspect of BM niche dynamics in the regulation of HSCs under stress conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Combined expression of <italic>Hoxb</italic>5-mKO2 and <italic>Vwf</italic>-GFP defines a highly enriched LT-HSC population</title><p id="P8">To increase the purity of reporter-labeled HSCs compared to existing strategies and achieve greater precision in tracking HSCs by IVM, we crossed <italic>Hoxb5</italic>-mKO2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> with <italic>Vwf</italic>-GFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> transgenic reporter mice and analyzed the expression of Kusabira Orange (mKO2) and GFP in HSCs. The expression of <italic>Hoxb</italic>5-mKO2 and <italic>Vwf</italic>-GFP reporter transgenes within Lin<sup>–</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>cKit<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>–</sup> CD150<sup>+</sup> (LSK-SLAM) HSCs of young adult mice in homeostasis defines 3 main subsets of cells, with 17.5±5.2% of cells co-expressing both reporters (LSK-SLAM Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup>), 18.3±2.1% of cells expressing only <italic>Hoxb5</italic>-mKO2 (LSK-SLAM Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup>), and 60.2±6.5% of cells expressing neither (LSK-SLAM Hoxb5<sup>–</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A-B</xref>).

Remarkably, combined expression of <italic>Hoxb</italic>5-mKO2 and <italic>Vwf</italic>-GFP defines an extremely rare population representing 0.0017±0.0006% of total live cells in BM that is highly enriched for phenotypically defined HSCs (83±2.5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1F</xref>) and homogeneously express high levels of the SLAM HSC marker CD150 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E</xref>). The minor non-HSC fraction of the total Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> population (17±2.5%) is mostly constituted by LSK Flt3<sup>–</sup>CD48<sup>+</sup>CD150<sup>+</sup> megakaryocyte-primed multipotent progenitors 2 (MPP2), Lin<sup>–</sup>Kit<sup>+</sup>Sca1<sup>–</sup>CD41<sup>+</sup>CD150<sup>+</sup> megakaryocyte progenitors (MkP) and Lin<sup>+</sup>/cKit<sup>–</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.1A</xref>). Conversely, the Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells constitute a more abundant (0.0055±0.0017%) and more heterogeneous population constituted of 34±3.3% LSK-SLAM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E-F</xref>) and, within the non-HSC fraction, of LSK Flt3<sup>–</sup>CD48<sup>–</sup>CD150<sup>–</sup> MPP1 (or short-term HSCs; ST-HSCs), lymphoid-primed LSK Flt3<sup>+</sup> MPP4 and Lin<sup>+</sup>/cKit<sup>–</sup> cells in approximately similar proportions. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1G</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To obtain further evidence at transcriptional level for differences in stemness between Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> and Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cell populations identified by the expression of the 2 reporters alone we next analyzed a previous single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data set performed on total hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC; LSK cells)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> Cells expressing <italic>Hoxb5</italic> or <italic>Vwf</italic> were identified based on transcript levels across the entire data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.1B</xref>). Co-expression of both genes identified a small population of cells mostly confined within the LT-HSC population, while cells expressing only <italic>Hoxb5</italic> were more dispersed throughout the HSPC landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2A</xref>). Of note, using the previously developed HSC score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> and Repopulation score (RepopSig)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, we observed increased expression of these transcriptional signatures in <italic>Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf</italic><sup>+</sup> cells, when compared with <italic>Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf</italic><sup>–</sup> cells or even to the total LT-HSC population, suggesting higher HSC function in the <italic>Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf</italic><sup>+</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2B-C</xref>). Since by flow cytometry the Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells only represented 17.5% of the total LSK-SLAM population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>) we further interrogated the Nestorowa <italic>et al</italic>. dataset to compare the overlap between <italic>Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf</italic><sup>+</sup> cells and other reporter-based definitions used to identify HSCs <italic>in situ</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We identified <italic>Mds1<sup>+</sup>Flt3<sup>–</sup></italic>, <italic>Tcf15<sup>+</sup></italic>, <italic>Pdzk1p1<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ctnnal1<sup>+</sup>Hlf<sup>+</sup></italic> cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2D</xref>) based on transcript levels of these genes across the data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.1C</xref>). To better reflect the expression of the MFG (<italic>Mds1<sup>+</sup>Flt3<sup>–</sup></italic>) reporter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, expression of <italic>Mds1</italic> was analyzed by quantifying reads specifically within the first 2 <italic>Mds1</italic> exons, rather than the whole <italic>Mecom</italic> complex locus, that also includes <italic>Evi1</italic> and is more broadly expressed throughout the HSPC landscape (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.1D-E</xref>). <italic>Hlf</italic> was used in combination with <italic>Ctnnal1</italic> as a proxy for <italic>Kit</italic> expression. Of note, 96% of <italic>Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup></italic> cells overlapped with cells identified by the other HSC definitions, although they only constitute a minor fraction of the populations identified by these other strategies (10.6% of <italic>Mds1<sup>+</sup>Flt3<sup>–</sup></italic> cells, 9.5% of <italic>Pdzk1p1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells, 7.4% of <italic>Tcf15<sup>+</sup></italic> cells and 14.3% of <italic>Ctnnal1<sup>+</sup>Hlf<sup>+</sup></italic> cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2E-H</xref>). Furthermore, approximately 50% of <italic>Mds1<sup>+</sup>Flt3<sup>–</sup></italic> and <italic>Pdzk1p1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells, and 40% of <italic>Tcf15<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ctnnal1<sup>+</sup>Hlf<sup>+</sup></italic> cells were not overlapping with any other identification strategy, and importantly, we did not find any cell in common between all 5 HSC definitions analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2E-H</xref>). In line with the lower enrichment of LSK-SLAM cells within the Hoxb5<sup><italic>+</italic></sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> population defined by reporters’ expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1F</xref>), 40% of <italic>Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup></italic> cells did not overlap with any other HSC definition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2F, H</xref>). Together, this analysis demonstrates a high level of heterogeneity in the cells identified by different reporter strategies. Common to all strategies is the fact that each identifies only a subset of total HSCs. The new Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> definition identifies the totality of the Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSC subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>) that has been functionally linked with platelet-MK differentiation bias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, and these cells express combinations of all other reporters used, rather than constituting their own HSC subset. Thus, this dual reporter strategy allows easy identification and purification of HSCs expressing a core HSC signature, akin to the MolO HSCs previously identifiable solely by transcriptomic analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">To confirm the high LT-HSC activity of Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells, we competitively transplanted limiting numbers of double and single positive cells (CD45.2) isolated based on reporters’ expression alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.2A</xref>), into lethally irradiated mice (CD45.1). Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells revealed a 1/5.8 frequency of reconstitution units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3A</xref>).

While <italic>in vivo</italic> limiting dilution analysis of Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells revealed a non-statistically significant difference in the frequency of reconstitution units when compared to Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3A</xref>), the level of lineage reconstitution was significantly lower, particularly in the platelets and myeloid lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3B</xref>). Furthermore, Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells conferred a more robust and significantly higher reconstitution of the LSK-SLAM HSC compartment of primary recipient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3D</xref>) and were able to reconstitute all 3 subsets defined by <italic>Hoxb</italic>5-mKO2 and <italic>Vwf</italic>-GFP expression within the LSK-SLAM HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig,1B</xref>). By contrast, the Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells failed to reconstitute the Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSC compartment, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Lastly, to confirm the high frequency of functional LT-HSCs within the Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> compartment, we performed secondary transplants. Whole BM from primary recipients transplanted with 10 Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells conferred high LT multilineage reconstitution of both peripheral blood and the HSC compartment in secondary recipient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3F-G</xref>). Contrarily, whole BM from primary recipients reconstituted with 10 Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells mostly failed to reconstitute secondary recipients. This is in agreement with the higher heterogeneity and higher frequency of MPP1/ST-HSCs and MMP4 cells observed in the Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1F-G</xref>) and lower HSC and repopulation scores in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2B-C</xref>).

Therefore, in addition to analyzing the dynamics of HSCs in homeostasis, we also investigated the behavior of these cells post platelet depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4A</xref>). We performed IVM immediately following anti-GPIbα antibody administration, when platelet activation and subsequent depletion are taking place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4B</xref>), and 24 hrs post platelet depletion, when the majority of Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs have exited quiescence and are actively cycling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Longitudinal IVM preformed prior to and immediately after anti-GPIbα antibody administration confirmed platelet depletion: in steady state platelets generated GFP<sup>+</sup> signals within BM vessels, often distorted into lines because of the effect of blood flow and speed of confocal acquisition. However, this signal entirely disappeared within minutes post anti-GPIbα antibody administration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.3A</xref>). Flow cytometric characterization of the BM of double reporter mice 24 hrs post platelet depletion revealed no major changes in the SLAM-HSC compartment in terms of the composition of subsets defined by <italic>Hoxb5</italic>-mKO2 and <italic>Vwf</italic>-GFP expression. Apart from a reduction in the frequency of Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells and a corresponding increase in the frequency of Hoxb5<sup>–</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells, there was no significant change in the frequency of Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.3B-C</xref>). The frequencies of EPCR<sup>hi</sup> cells within LSK-SLAM Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> and Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> subsets also remained comparable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.3D-E</xref>). Finally, we confirmed similar enrichment of LSK-SLAM HSCs within the Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> and Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cell populations defined exclusively based on the reporters’ expression in total live BM cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.3F-G</xref>). The composition of the non-HSC fraction of the Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> population remained unchanged, while we observed a significant increase in MPP4 cells in the Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> non-HSC population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.3H</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We then imaged Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs contained within frontal bone cavities in calvarium BM and compared them to Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells from the same mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.4A</xref>). Hoxb5<sup>+</sup> cells were identified by subtracting the autofluorescence from the mKO2 signal and subsequently assessed for GFP expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.4B</xref>). In line with the low frequency of Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells in total BM and high enrichment for HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2A</xref>), these cells were extremely rare in the calvarium and we could typically not image more than 1 cell per mouse calvarium in homeostasis and immediately after depletion. Yet, in agreement with the strong cell cycle activation post platelet depletion, 2 and 3 Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells could be observed in the same field of view in 2 out of 6 mice analyzed 24 hrs post anti-GPIbα antibody administration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.4C</xref>). Remarkably, 3D time-lapse imaging of these cells during a 1 hr time window revealed that Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs homogenously exhibited a stationary behavior in homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4C</xref>) at both time points following platelet depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4D-E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Movies 1-6</xref>), and only rarely moved somewhere else within the field of view (e.g. red track in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4E</xref> top rose plot). Compatible with the higher cell heterogeneity found within the Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E-G</xref>), these cells revealed a more heterogeneous behavior, with the majority of the cells appearing migratory and moving within the field of view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4C</xref>). Supporting these observations, track analysis of individual Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs in homeostasis showed that these cells had no or very little maximum displacement, which measures the furthest distance from the starting point of each track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5A</xref>) and a very high arrest coefficient, measured as the percentage of time cells move less than 2 μm/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5B</xref>). This confirmed that they remained within small, confined BM regions. Conversely, Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells covered significantly longer distances within the observation period and displayed a wider range of arrest coefficients, with a trend towards a higher proportion of cells displaying low arrest coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5A-B</xref>). Interestingly, observation of timelapse data compiled into movie format clearly indicated that Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells were not entirely immobile and rather wiggled, engaging with the immediate microenvironment with dynamic and most often oscillatory interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Movies 1-6</xref>). This type of oscillatory movement generates circulatory tracks without net migration. As a result, despite the significantly lower maximum displacement of the Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells, both Vwf<sup>+</sup> and Vwf<sup>–</sup> cell subsets displayed comparable total track lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5C</xref>) and mean speed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.5A</xref>). Consistent with this, Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells showed significantly reduced linearity coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5D</xref>), which measures the directionality of the movement, and mean squared displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5E</xref>), reflecting a reduced diffusion, when compared to Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells. Lastly, both Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> and Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells showed a low and similar variance of speed, indicating a persistent behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5F</xref>). Remarkably, following platelet depletion the behavior of both Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> and Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells remained mostly unchanged, with neither population becoming more motile, which would be consistent with niche relocations. Instead, Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells exhibited reduced track length and mean speed immediately following depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.5A</xref>), and Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells presented reduced maximum displacement, linearity coefficient and mean square displacement at 24 hrs post platelet depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5A, D-E</xref>). Altogether, this analysis revealed an unexpected non-migratory, yet oscillatory behavior of Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs and demonstrated that activation of Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs following platelet depletion is not associated with their relocation to a different niche, unlinking changes in HSC cell cycle status with migration towards specialized niches that would support either HSC quiescence or proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Niche dynamics are linked with Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs activation</title><p id="P14">We next sought to characterize the bone marrow niche of Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs. We started by measuring the distance of HSC subsets to blood vessels and MKs (defined as large <italic>Vwf</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells). Distances were determined in segmented 3D images from the first timeframe of movies or in tilescans of calvarium BM cavities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6A</xref>). As expected, given the high abundance of sinusoidal vessels in BM, both Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> and Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells were equally found in close proximity (&lt;10 μm) to blood vessels, both in homeostasis and 24 hrs post platelet depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6A-B</xref>). Of note, in homeostasis the Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells were not preferentially found near MKs when compared with Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells, in contrast to a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. However, 24 hrs post platelet depletion the Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> localized closer to MKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6A, C</xref>). While this finding was unexpected given the non-migratory behavior of these cells, we hypothesized that MKs’ distribution post platelet depletion could change instead. We previously reported increased MK numbers in the sternum BM of mice 24 hrs post platelet depletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and we could confirm this was also happening in the calvarium BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6D</xref>). This is likely explaining the closer proximity Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells to MKs post platelet depletion. Yet, the fact that Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells are not found in closer proximity to MKs in the same mice post platelet depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6B</xref>) suggests the higher proximity of Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells to MKs is not just stochastically happening due to increased MK numbers and prompted a more detailed analysis of MK behavior. IVM movies from mice post platelet depletion already suggested a highly dynamic megakaryopoiesis, with MKs growing and disintegrating into pro-platelets within the 1 hr observation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4D-E</xref>, green arrows; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Movie 4</xref>). Remarkably, the comparison of tilescans from unchallenged mice imaged twice, 24 hrs apart, showed only approximately 30% overlap in MKs, indicating megakaryopoiesis is a highly dynamic process even in homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6E</xref>). Repeated calvarium imaging of chimeric mice stably reconstituted with BM from <italic>Vwf</italic>-TdTomato mice prior to and 24 hrs following platelet depletion confirmed this highly dynamic behavior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.5B</xref>). We previously demonstrated a role of Lepr<sup>+</sup> perivascular cells in regulating the response of Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs to platelet depletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Similarly to vasculature, Lepr<sup>+</sup> cells are highly abundant in BM and therefore, the majority of Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> and Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells were equally found in direct contact with these cells, as observed in thick femur sections from mice in homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6F-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.5C-D</xref>). All together, these analyses revealed that while Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs essentially do not migrate, the surrounding niche cellular composition may change following acute perturbations in hematopoiesis to regulate the response of these cells to stress.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs remain non-migratory during ageing</title><p id="P15">Ageing is associated with the expansion of the HSC compartment, increased HSC bias towards the platelet/MK lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, and increased platelet numbers in mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.6A</xref>). Unlike acute platelet depletion, changes in hematopoiesis develop slowly and continuously, and we wondered whether it would be linked to changes in Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs’ interactions with their niche. To assess this, we investigated the behavior and localization of Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs in 1 year old mice, when the main hallmarks of ageing in HSCs and hematopoiesis are already observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. The analysis of the HSC compartment of ageing <italic>Hoxb</italic>5-mKO2<sup>Tg/+</sup><italic>Vwf</italic>-GFP<sup>Tg/+</sup> mice revealed a 15-fold expansion in the number of total SLAM-HSCs, particularly affecting the Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> compartment, which became the most represented HSC subset, comprising 66.4±6.6% of all SLAM-HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.6B-C</xref>). Furthermore, in agreement with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, both Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> and Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> SLAM-HSC subsets from ageing mice showed increased EPCR expression, in comparison to young mice, with the increase more prominent in the Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> subset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.6D-E</xref>). Of note, analysis of cell populations solely defined by the expression of <italic>Hoxb5</italic> and <italic>Vwf</italic> reporters revealed a small but significant increase in the frequency of phenotypic HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.6F</xref>), which constituted 87.3±3.9% and 53±8.9% of the total Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> and Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells, respectively. No major differences were observed in the cellular composition of the remaining non-HSC cells within the total Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> and Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> populations, despite a small increase in the proportion of Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> MkPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.6G</xref>), overall confirming the suitability of our double reporter strategy to identify phenotypic Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSC also in ageing mice.</p><p id="P16">We next compared the dynamic behavior of Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> and Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> in the calvarium BM of ageing mice using the same experimental approach previously applied to young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Movies 7-8</xref>). Remarkably, and similarly to our observations in young mice, ageing Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells exhibited a stationary yet wiggly behavior, characterized by oscillatory movements that lead to mean track lengths of 75μm/hr, but without resulting in a significant displacement of the cells within the BM niche. Consistently, these cells displayed a high arrest coefficient and low linearity coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7D-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.7A-D</xref>). While in ageing mice the Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> population still has a more heterogenous cellular composition when compared with the Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.6F-G</xref>) aged Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> were less motile than their young counterparts, indicated by their reduced maximum displacement and linearity coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig.7C-D</xref>).

Importantly, we found little overlap in the cells identified between each of the other HSC definitions tested and did not find any cells Identified by all definitions together, highlighting significant differences between HSC reporter strategies.

Our time-lapse imaging of Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells in the calvarium BM revealed their non-migratory behavior, which despites the low level of overlap between transcriptional definitions is however in line with the low motility previously described for MFG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and <italic>Hlf</italic>-tdTom<sup>hi</sup> cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> in homeostasis.

This wiggling behavior was previously described but only in transplantation settings, and suggests an active engagement of these cells with the niche<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In contrast, Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells show a more heterogenous behavior including both immobile and migratory cells, which likely reflects the heterogeneous composition of the Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> population, including a higher proportion of downstream progenitors. This suggests that immature progenitors are more motile when compared to LT-HSCs, which is consistent with the more static behavior of MFG cells when compared with the broader <italic>Mds1</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup> population, that is highly represented by progenitor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and with earlier studies comparing the dynamics of human stem and progenitor cells following transplantation in non-irradiated recipients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Contrarily to our observations, Upadhaya et al., previously reported higher motility of cells identified by <italic>Pdzk1ip1</italic>-CreER mediated recombination of a R26<sup>LSL-Tom</sup> reporter (Pdzk1ip1-Tom<sup>+</sup> cells).

The different behavior of Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> and Pdzk1ip1-Tom<sup>+</sup> cells may therefore reflect different populations of cells being analyzed or result from the requirement for Tamoxifen administration to induce reporter activation in this model, which may interfere with HSCs dynamics and lead to variable levels of HSC purity within the labeled cell population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.

Whether the highly mobile cells observed in other studies represent different HSC subsets, downstream progenitors included within the identified populations or, stress-specific response behaviors will require further investigation.</p><p id="P22">Although Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs have been previously suggested to localize nearer MKs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, we did not find a preferential localization of Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs closer to those cells, compared to Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>-</sup> cells, which would have been expected. However, despite their immobile behavior, Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells appear closer to MKs after platelet depletion, partially due to increased megakaryopoiesis and MK numbers in BM. The increased proximity post platelet depletion is not entirely stochastic as it was only observed for Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> cells. Understanding why Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> but not Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells appear closer to MKs will require further investigation and the recent studies describing an alternative pathway for fast MK differentiation during regeneration and ageing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> raise the possibility that Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs may quickly and directly generate MKs post platelet depletion thereby explaining the close localization of these cells. In fact, sequential imaging of the calvarium BM revealed notorious changes in MK localization uncovering a new aspect of niche dynamics in response to stress. MKs play a critical role in instructing HSC quiescence through TGFb and PF4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Following cell cycle activation in response to platelet depletion Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs rapidly return to quiescence and the closer proximity of Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs to MKs at 24 hrs may underly a role of MKs themselves in reestablishing HSC quiescence. Both Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> and Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>–</sup> cells were found adjacent to blood vessels and LepR<sup>+</sup> perivascular cells, in line with the high abundance of these niche cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and reflecting the need to identify markers to explore niche cells heterogeneity to precisely define HSC niches. Previous studies suggested the existence of different niches supporting quiescent and activated HSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. However, despite the high proliferation rate after platelet depletion Hoxb5<sup>+</sup>Vwf<sup>+</sup> HSCs retain a highly immobile behavior in the BM niche. Although we cannot exclude that in different scenarios of stress hematopoiesis HSCs may relocate to a different niche, our findings unlink cell cycle activation and the requirement to occupy an alternative niche eliciting proliferation. Nevertheless, the surrounding niche may change both molecularly and in cellular composition as observed here with the expansion of MKs, indicating the need for a better understanding of niche remodeling in situations of perturbed hematopoiesis.</p><p id="P23">We reported a new strategy that stably identifies highly enriched LT-HSC <italic>in situ</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.
