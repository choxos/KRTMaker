To address this issue, we employed Ewing sarcoma (EwS) as a model as it is driven by a single driver oncogene, namely chimeric EWSR1::ETS fusion transcription factors, whose fluctuating expression levels promote diverse transcriptional programs. While EWSR1::ETS-high cells display a rather sessile but proliferative phenotype and EWSR1::ETS-low cells are more invasive, the mechanisms underlying these different phenotypes remain poorly characterized. Here, using an integrative functional genomics approach, we show that low EWSR1::ETS fusion activity in patient tumors associates with poor outcome and increased signaling of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). AHR signaling enrichment correlates with increased tumor infiltration by immunosuppressive cells and worse overall patient survival. Knockdown of EWSR1::ETS in EwS spheroid models cultured in human plasma-like media strongly alters tryptophan metabolism resulting in increased secretion of the AHR ligand kynurenine. Silencing of EWSR1::ETS reduced killing of EwS cells by natural killer (NK) cells, while AHR silencing increases NK cell-mediated killing. From a cell-intrinsic perspective, AHR knockdown inhibits proliferation, clonogenic, and spheroidal growth of EwS cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, which can be recapitulated by pharmacological AHR inhibition. Furthermore, <italic>AHR</italic> knockdown decreases tumor growth and metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Collectively, our results illustrate how oncogene-mediated metabolic reprogramming of amino acid metabolism can translate into more aggressive disease phenotypes in cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ewing sarcoma</kwd><kwd>AHR</kwd><kwd>Kynurenine</kwd><kwd>EWSR1::ETS</kwd><kwd>NK cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Ewing sarcoma (EwS) is the second most common bone and soft tissue tumor in children, adolescents, and young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Grünewald <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).

Interestingly, there are recent reports of cell-to-cell fluctuations in the EWSR1::ETS fusion levels, where high EWSR1::ETS expression is associated with a more sessile but proliferative phenotype and low EWSR1::ETS expression with a more migratory and invasive phenotype and an enhanced ability to form metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chaturvedi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Wiles <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Franzetti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Sannino <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Aynaud <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P4">EwS, like other sarcomas, has been shown to be immunologically ‘cold’, with few tumor infiltrating immune effector cells including T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Evdokimova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). While the degree of CD8 T cell infiltration and immunosuppressive macrophage infiltration has been found to negatively influence EwS patient outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Fujiwara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Stahl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), immunotherapies, such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and cixutumumab, have thus far shown limited success in early clinical trials for EwS. A variety of factors has been attributed to these failures, including low immunogenicity of EwS tumors, MHC class I downregulation, presence of immunosuppressive cells (MDSCs, M2-like tumor associated macrophages, regulatory T cells), and low infiltration of cytotoxic T and NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Malempati <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Tawbi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Evdokimova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). Understanding the mechanism by which EwS tumors directly influence their local immune microenvironment and the potential role that fluctuating EWSR1::ETS fusion levels may play in maintaining an immunosuppressive state is therefore crucial to advance immunotherapeutic approaches.</p><p id="P5">Recent profiling studies have revealed that EWSR1::ETS fusions in EwS regulate the expression of many metabolism-related genes/proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Sen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Issaq <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Orth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>), including enzymes involved in the catabolism of tryptophan (Trp) via the kynurenine (Kyn) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Mutz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Metabolites generated from this pathway, such as Kyn and kynurenic acid (KynA), are known to activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">DiNatale <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Opitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), a ligand-activated transcription factor, which has recently emerged as a key regulator of anti-tumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Gutiérrez-Vázquez and Quintana, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Rothhammer and Quintana, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Opitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). The functional significance of AHR activation for the EwS oncophenotype and the potential role of the Trp-Kyn-AHR axis in mediating the EwS immune environment, however, is unknown.</p><p id="P6">Here, we use an integrative functional genomics approach in EwS cell and mouse models to uncover the relevance and therapeutic potential of targeting the Trp-Kyn-AHR axis in EwS. We show that AHR signaling is strongly associated with poor outcome and immune infiltration scoring in EwS tumors and is upregulated upon induction of a low EWSR1::ETS expression state in EwS cells. Consistent with activation of AHR signaling in EWSR1::ETS-low cells, we observed significantly increased Kyn levels and found lowered sensitivity to killing by natural killer (NK) cells. Targeting of AHR restored NK cell-mediated killing of EwS cells, reduced EwS cell viability and clonogenicity <italic>in vitro</italic>, and nearly completely ablated EwS tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, activation of AHR in EWSR1::ETS-low EwS cells may represent a targetable vulnerability that, when inhibited, can restore NK cell killing and halt tumor growth.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>High AHR activity confers worse overall survival in EwS patients and correlates with EWSR1::ETS low activity</title><p id="P7">A prior study linked EWSR1::FLI1 with Trp and Kyn metabolism in EwS cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Mutz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether this relationship holds true in EwS patient tumors, across EWSR1::ETS fusion types, or in cell models cultured under more physiological conditions, which better recapitulate human EwS tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Ceranski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2025</xref>). Hence, we first took advantage of a patient cohort with matched transcriptome data and clinical information (n=166 EwS patients) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Musa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Assessment of the transcriptomic enrichment of an EWSR1::ETS activity score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Aynaud <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>) and subsequent K-means clustering across these patient tumors demonstrated that patients with low EWSR1::ETS activity had significantly shorter overall survival than those with high EWSR1::ETS activity (log-rank test; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We then employed a newly defined pan-tissue AHR activity signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Sadik <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>) comprising 166 genes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1b,c</xref>, consensus K-means clustering of the patients according to their AHR activity scores could identify two distinct clusters labeled K1 (AHR-low) and K2 (AHR-high). Next, we evaluated the association of newly defined AHR-clusters and showed that patients with high AHR scores (K2) had a significantly shorter overall survival than those with low AHR scores (K1) (log-rank test; <italic>P</italic>=0.031) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Consistent with AHR activity signature clustering, patients with high AHR scores (K2) exhibited significantly higher intratumoral expression levels of <italic>AHR</italic> and significantly altered mRNA expression levels of key enzymes (<italic>IL4I1</italic>, <italic>TDO2</italic>, <italic>IDO1</italic>, <italic>KYAT1</italic>) involved in Trp metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1e,f</xref>) indicating a metabolic shift toward increased Trp catabolism and production of the AHR ligand Kyn. Strikingly, assessing transcriptomic enrichment of an EWSR1::ETS activity score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Aynaud <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>) across these patient tumors and associating it with the previously calculated AHR scores showed a significant negative correlation between the two (<italic>P</italic>=0.0006, Fisher’s exact test; relative risk = 0.64) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). These effects observed in patients were mirrored <italic>in vitro</italic> in three-dimensional (3D) spheroids grown in human plasma-like medium (HPLMax) and reduced fetal calf serum (FCS) conditions (7%) in two EwS cell lines harboring doxycycline (DOX)-inducible shRNAs against their respective fusions (EWSR1::FLI1 in MHH-ES-1 cells, EWSR1::ERG in TC-106 cells). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 h</xref>, silencing of either fusion for 96 h led to a significant deregulation of key enzymes in the Trp-Kyn pathway, including <italic>TDO2</italic>, <italic>IL4I1</italic>, and <italic>KMO</italic>. Specifically, <italic>TDO2</italic> (Kyn-synthesizing) was upregulated while <italic>KMO</italic> (Kyn-catabolizing) was downregulated. Consistent with this, we observed increased Kyn secretion in the supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). Levels of <italic>AHR</italic> itself were not robustly altered by EWSR1::ETS knockdown (data not shown), which is in line with observations that low EWSR1::ETS expression enhances AHR nucleus translocation rather than mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Mutz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P8">In sum, these data validate previous findings on EWSR1::FLI1 and Trp-Kyn metabolism and extend them to a clinically relevant phenotype in patient tumors with increased AHR signaling and enrichment in EWSR1::ETS-low cells.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>High AHR activity correlates with higher infiltration of immune cells in EwS patients and contributes to an immunoprotective EwS phenotype <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p id="P9">Since increased AHR activity has previously been linked to an immunosuppressive microenvironment that fostered tumor growth in other cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Quintana <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Mezrich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Neamah, Nagarkatti and Nagarkatti, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Greene <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Sadik <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>), we hypothesized that EwS tumors with increased AHR scores might exhibit an altered composition of the immune cell infiltrate. Interestingly, correlating computational Immune Pediatric Signature Scores (IPASS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Mayoh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>) inferred from our patient transcriptome data with the AHR scores revealed a significantly higher T cell infiltration of AHR-high EwS tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). However, a more fine-grained analysis of the immune cell composition (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>) revealed not only an enrichment of B cells, (CD8+) T cells, and NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), but also a strong enrichment for immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells, increased presence of which have been observed in immunotherapy non-responders patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Oweida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Weber <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Petrova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">van Gulijk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). This dual pattern may explain why the outcome of patients with AHR-high scores have worse outcomes despite displaying diverse immune infiltration overall.</p><p id="P10">Given that we observed increased Kyn secretion by EWSR1::ETS-low cells and that Kyn can inhibit surface expressed activating receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chiesa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and suppress the lytic function of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Trikha <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>), we tested whether EWSR1::ETS levels might influence NK cell activity against EwS cells. To this end, we carried out NK cell killing assays by co-culturing NK-92 cells with our EwS models with/without DOX-induced silencing of the respective EWSR1::ETS fusion. MHH-ES-1/TR/shEF1 and TC-106/TR/shERG cells were treated with or without DOX for 72 h then seeded at equal cell numbers for co-culture with NK-92 cells and subsequent viability normalized to their respective DOX controls to account for the influence of DOX.

While novel immunotherapies have seen improvement in patient outcomes for other difficult to treat cancers, EwS has shown poor responses in early clinical trials for immunotherapies, largely due to their immunologically cold nature. While metabolic crosstalk in the tumor microenvironment regulates immunogenicity, there is very little known about how metabolic regulation by the EwS driver fusion may influence anti-tumor immunity.</p><p id="P14">Trp metabolism via the Kyn pathway has gained attention in past years given the direct connection of its downstream metabolites (Kyn, KynA) to AHR activation, tumor progression, and immunosuppression in glioblastoma, and breast, liver, and non-small cell lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Opitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Ye <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Solvay <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Holfelder <italic>et al.</italic>, 2024</xref>). Increased AHR nuclear translocation upon silencing of EWSR1::FLI1 in EwS cell lines had previously established a role of this fusion as a repressor of AHR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Mutz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Here, we show for the first time that EwS patients with higher AHR activity have worse overall survival and increased infiltration signatures for activated innate and adaptive immune cells as well as important immunosuppressive cells (MDSCs and regulatory T cells). As high AHR activity EwS tumors were found to have increased signatures for activated B and T cells and CD56dim NK cells, further investigation of how AHR activity in EwS influences the activation and function of immune cells is warranted. Indeed, we observed reduced killing of EWSR1::ETS-low cells by NK-92 cells despite increased interferon-γ levels in the co-culture. Whether this effect is driven by reduced function of the NK cells, intrinsic resistance of the EWSR1::ETS-low cells to NK cell killing, or a combination of both is unclear. While it has been established that Kyn has a direct negative impact on NK cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chiesa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Trikha <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>), induction of potential immunoprotective mechanisms upon low EWSR1::ETS expression is less well understood. Several immune evasive mechanisms have been identified on EwS tumor cells, such as high cell surface expression of phagocytic inhibitory signals such as CD47 overexpression and downregulation of pro-phagocytic signals such as cell surface calreticulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Luo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2024</xref>), and upregulation of non-classical HLA types such as HLA-E or HLA-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Spurny <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Altvater <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>), but these have not been studied in the context of fluctuating EWSR1::ETS levels. The present study is therefore significant in establishing a link between EWSR1::FLI1 as well as EWSR1::ERG expression, AHR activation, and reduced NK cell killing, though the precise molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Characterization of cell surface markers expressed on both immune and EwS cells will be important to better understand the mechanism by which EWSR1::ETS-low EwS cells evade NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. It should be noted that, while NK-92 cells are widely used as adequate models for NK cell studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Klingemann, 2023</xref>), future studies in the EwS context should also include and test non-transformed primary NK cells as well as other cytotoxic immune cells.</p><p id="P15">Further to its role in mediating immune evasion of EWSR1::ETS-low EwS cells, we also demonstrated that AHR signaling is important for proliferation, clonogenicity, and cell cycle progression of EwS cells.

Few selective and potent inhibitors, however, have been described for TDO2, none of which have progressed to clinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kozlova and and Frédérick, 2019</xref>) and some additionally act as AHR agonists and are therefore of limited use in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Opitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>).

For NK-92 co-culture experiments, 200 μL resazurin was added to wells containing 500 μL media. For drug response assays, 50 μL resazurin was added to wells containing 200 μL media. Following resazurin addition, plates were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, and fluorescence readout was performed in the microplate reader GloMax®-Multi Detection System (Promega, USA) with a 560 nm excitation–590 emission filter. Wells without seeded cells (only medium) were use for background subtraction.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Interferon-γ measurement after EwS and NK-92 co-culture</title><p id="P29">Similar to the NK-92 killing assay, EwS cell lines were first DOX treated to knockdown the respective <italic>EWSR1::ETS</italic> fusion for 72 h. In this case, EwS cells were seeded in a 96-well white plate (clear bottom with lid) for luminescence readout (MHH-ES-1/TR/shEF1, 20,000 cells/well). After 4 h, NK-92 cells were added in a 1:1 ratio and co-cultured for 24 h.

Design of the shRNA sequences were obtained from the database GPP Web Portal. Different criteria for selection were followed: Match position (CDS [coding sequence], 3’UTR [untranslated region]), intrinsic score (&lt;10) and Specificity-Defining Region (SDR) Match (100%). In addition, five shRNA sequences were obtained from the online tool SplashRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Pelossof <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Sequences with a Splash score of 1.5 or higher were selected.
