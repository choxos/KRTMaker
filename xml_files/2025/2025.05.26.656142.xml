A recent discovery of a multi-subunit insertase in eukaryotes has raised the question about the architecture of the putative bacterial ortholog SecYEG-YidC and its functional mechanism. Here, we combine cryogenic electron microscopy with cell-free protein synthesis in nanodiscs to visualize biogenesis of the polytopic membrane protein NuoK, the subunit K of NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, that requires both SecYEG and YidC for insertion. We demonstrate that YidC is recruited to the back of the translocon at the late stage of the substrate insertion, in resemblance to the eukaryotic system, and in vivo experiments indicate that the complex assembly is vital for the cells. The nascent chain does not utilize the lateral gate of SecYEG, but enters the lipid membrane at the SecYE-YidC interface, with YidC being the primary insertase. SecYEG-YidC complex promotes folding of the nascent helices at the interface prior their insertion, so the examined cellular pathway follows the fundamental thermodynamic principles of membrane protein folding. Our data provide the first detailed insight on the elusive insertase machinery in the physiologically relevant environment, highlight the importance of the nascent chain for its assembly, and prove the evolutionary conservation of the gate-independent insertion route.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P6">Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) constitute up to 30 % of a genome content for each organism and determine the functionality of the cellular membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Biogenesis of α-helical IMPs at the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotes typically occurs in a co-translational manner: The nascent transmembrane helices (TMHs) emerging from the ribosome are identified by the signal recognition particle (SRP) and delivered in the form of ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs) to the universally conserved Sec translocon that facilitates their insertion in the lipid bilayer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The translocon of <italic>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</italic> is a heterotrimeric complex composed of SecY, SecE and SecG proteins forming a central pore. N- and C-terminal halves of the central subunit SecY may open laterally in a clam-shell manner, thus opening a lipid-exposed gap between the opposing TMHs 2b and 7. This gap, commonly referred as the "lateral gate", has been seen as the exclusive site for the nascent TMHs to partition into the lipid phase, both for bacterial SecYEG and the homologous Sec61αβγ in eukaryotes. This model was supported by extensive biochemical studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and more recently by structural insights, commonly focusing on signal peptides of secretory proteins and single-span IMPs exposing their N-terminal end into the cytoplasm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, polytopic IMPs have their TMHs in alternating topology, suggesting higher complexity within the biogenesis pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Folding of numerous bacterial IMPs relies on a cooperative action between SecYEG and the essential and ubiquitous membrane protein insertase YidC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. YidC may distort the cytoplasmic lipid leaflet and facilitate folding and membrane insertion of the nascent IMPs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Extensive intermolecular cross-linking studies suggested that YidC is located in front of the lateral gate of SecYEG where it could access the nascent TMHs emerging from the lateral gate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and the model was further supported by low-resolution cryo-EM analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Remarkably, the AlphaFold model predicts a position of YidC of <italic>E. coli</italic> and other Gram-negative bacteria at the back of SecYEG, and diverse architectures are predicted for the homologs from Gram-positive bacteria, such as <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 1</xref>). In all the cases, the model confidence is low, suggesting that other factors, such as the bound ribosome and/or the nascent chain may be required for the complex assembly.</p><p id="P8">Recent biochemical and high-resolution cryo-EM studies of the eukaryotic insertase machinery revealed that the YidC homolog TMCO1 was located at the back of the Sec61 complex, being a component of the large multi-subunit complex BOS-GEL-PAT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Furthermore, insertion of a nascent polytopic IMP occurred not via the lateral gate, but between Sec61 and the BOS complex, thus challenging the long-standing paradigm in the field. The accumulated controversy between the insights from the eukaryotic homologs and the conventional model of the SecYEG-YidC complex has raised the question about the mechanism of IMP folding in bacteria and the architecture and dynamics of the insertion machinery. To tackle this issue, here we employed nanodisc-reconstituted SecYEG-YidC and cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) to analyze the biogenesis of the polytopic IMP NuoK, the subunit K of the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase that requires both insertases for proper membrane integration and folding in <italic>E. coli</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. By means of cryo-EM, we describe the detailed architecture of the RNC-bound SecYEG-YidC complex, where YidC is recruited to the back of SecYEG in the substrate-dependent manner thus indeed resembling the architecture of the eukaryotic insertase machinery. The nascent chain emerging from the SecY-bound ribosome is routed away from the lateral gate to the crossed SecY TMH 10 and SecE TMH 3 and then handed over to YidC to be inserted into the lipid bilayer via the dedicated groove. Overall, the data elucidate the functional architecture of the bacterial cotranslational IMP insertion machinery and reveal the evolutionary conservation of the "back-of-Sec" insertion route, thereby offering a new perspective on membrane protein biogenesis in bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>SecYEG and YidC-dependent insertion in nanodiscs</title><p id="P9">We set out to elucidate the architecture of the SecYEG-YidC complex by means of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) using lipid-based nanodiscs as a well-defined system for studying IMP insertion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). To co-reconstitute both SecYEG and YidC in the relevant topology and to avoid their stochastic distribution among the nanodiscs, YidC and SecE were genetically fused via a cleavable linker (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 2A</xref>), while the non-essential catioinic C-terminal end of YidC was removed to exclude spontaneous electrostatic interactions with the ribosome observed <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The fusion protein was expressed and isolated together with SecY and SecG subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The complex was reconstituted into a sufficiently large nanodisc formed by MSP2N2 scaffold protein (expected diameter up to 17 nm) and treated with the HRV-3C protease to release YidC from SecE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

As a result, each nanodisc contained one copy of both SecYEG and YidC, presumably in the correct orientation, while the dimensions of the surrounding lipid bilayer would allow for lateral diffusion of the proteins, assembly of the functional complex and insertion of the nascent TMHs. Supporting this notion, the molecular weight distribution of the nanodisc-embedded SecYEG-YidC complexes centered at 290 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), and the difference from the calculated total protein weight of ~225 kDa likely reflected the presence of the co-reconstituted lipids.</p><p id="P10">We focused on biogenesis of <italic>E. coli</italic> NuoK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

To ensure sequential incorporation of nascent NuoK TMHs into the membrane and reduce the risk of erroneous insertase:substrate complexes, we supplied the SecYEG-YidC nanodiscs to the CFPS reaction based on <italic>E. coli</italic> S30 extract. With that, the translating ribosomes were targeted to SecYEG-YidC, presumably by the endogenous SRP and the SRP receptor FtsY, to initiate nascent IMP insertion.

With this construct, after CFPS, the SecM* peptide and the linker/tag would occupy the exit tunnel of the stalled ribosome, while all three NuoK TMHs would be exposed and accessible for the insertase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Visualiation of the active RNC:insertase complex</title><p id="P11">The purified NuoK<sup>86</sup>-RNC:SecYEG-YidC complexes were stabilized by rapid glutaraldehyde crosslinking before vitrification and cryo-EM analysis. After 3D classification followed by focused classification and refinement of the tunnel exit region, we obtained a structure of this complex with an average resolution of 2.4 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 4</xref>). The reconstruction showed a ribosome programmed with tRNAs in the A- and P-sites, a continuous nascent chain density ranging from the CCA-end of P-site tRNA to the tunnel exit and a clear density below the exit tunnel accounting for SecYEG and YidC embedded into a nanodisc of approx. 15 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Focused refinement of the nanodisc density resulted in a local resolution of 3 to 5 Å for SecYEG and 4 to 7 Å for most parts of YidC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 4B and C</xref>) and allowed unambiguous docking of the modelled SecYEG-YidC complex with only minor adjustments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 5</xref>). The structure shows the RNC-bound SecYEG in the center of the nanodisc, while YidC is positioned at the back side of SecYEG near SecE TMH 3, with the large P1 domain of YidC exposed to the "periplasmic" side of the nanodisc. An additional density accounting for TMH 2 and TMH 3 of NuoK appears between SecYEG and YidC, building extensive interactions with both proteins within the membrane and at the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). At lower contour levels, an additional transmembrane density appeared near NuoK TMH 2, which likely represents NuoK TMH 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 5F</xref>), though YidC TMH 1 could not be excluded.</p><p id="P12">As YidC was initially fused with SecE TMH 1 near the lateral gate, it must have relocated substantially within the lipid-filled nanodisc after the linker cleavage. To test whether the localization of YidC was not artificially induced by the chemical crosslinking, we carried out cryo-EM analysis of the non-crosslinked NuoK<sup>86</sup>-RNC:SecYEG-YidC sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 6</xref>). Though somewhat weaker and less well resolved, YidC density was clearly present in the same position at the back of SecYEG, implying that the crosslinked sample reflects the endogenous architecture of the substrate-bound SecYEG-YidC machinery.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Architecture of the SecYEG-YidC insertase</title><p id="P13">The clear density for all TMHs of SecY, SecE and SecG present in the local refined map offered the by now best-resolved view on the translocon structure in the physiologically relevant lipid environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 5</xref>). As observed previously for SecYEG-only assemblies, SecY is anchored via its cytoplasmic loops 6/7 and 8/9 to the tunnel exit of the large ribosomal subunit 50S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Interestingly, SecY loop 6/7 is somewhat remodeled compared to the previously reported RNC-FtsQ:SecYEG assembly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. To avoid a clash with the NuoK nascent chain, the loop shifts away from the exit tunnel towards H6/7 and uL23 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 7A</xref>). Here, Tyr-258 is tightly accommodated in a pocket formed by bases A91, U92 and G93 of H7, while Arg-256 stacks on A63 of H6, and Arg-255 interacts with the loop of uL23 (His-70/Gly-71/Gln-72) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In fact, this distortion in loop 6/7 leads to a global re-positioning of SecYEG with respect to the ribosome, with the 50S tilting by ~10° towards the N-terminal half of SecYEG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 7B</xref>). Contacts between the loop 8/9 with 50S are established via Lys-348 with the flipped-out base C490 of 23S rRNA helix H24 and a stacking interaction between SecY Arg-357 with A1392 (H53) that may be stabilized by a salt bridge with Glu-18 of the proximate ribosomal protein uL23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Further interactions are via the backbone of SecY Lys-347 with U1318 (H50) and Arg-340, Lys-364 with the flipped-out base A1535 of H59. The C-terminal cytoplasmic extension of SecY TMH 10 is bowed at Met-425/Ser-426 toward the SecY loop 8/9, so another contact is formed with the flipped-out base C490 of rRNA H24 (likely via Ala-436) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). As this SecY:ribosome contact was absent in earlier SecYEG:ribosome structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, we speculated that its formation is associated with the specific nascent chain routed for insertion. Notably, the lateral gate formed by TMHs 2b and 7 is in a tightly closed conformation indicating that it is not employed by the NuoK nascent chain, and the central pore is sealed by the “plug“ domain, TMH 2a of SecY (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 7B and C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The conformation of YidC within the RNC-bound complex clearly deviates from the structure of isolated YidC obtained via X-ray crystallography <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 5E</xref>). The paddle domain, i.e. the hairpin built of helices CH1 and CH2 at the cytoplasmic interface, shifts by 1 nm to the periphery of the complex. There, it appears in close vicinity to the ribosomal protein uL24, but does not form a direct contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). With that, it allows the passage of the nascent chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), as described below. Furthermore, YidC TMH 6 is located at the periphery of the nanodisc, and its C-terminal extension is not required for the ribosome:SecYEG-YidC assembly, though this polypeptide is essential for binding to an RNC in absence of SecYEG <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, and it is also important for the homologous ribosome:Oxa1 interactions in mitochondria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. The large density at the periplasmic side matched the structure of the YidC P1 domain known from crystallography studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. With respect to SecYEG, YidC is oriented with its TMH 3 facing TMH 3 of SecE, and the tip of the paddle domain faces the N-terminal end of SecY, in agreement with the efficient crosslinks observed in <italic>E. coli</italic> membranes between the residue 399 of YidC and SecY <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. At the periplasmic side, the essential amphipathic helix EH1 and SecY TMH 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) form the only pronounced direct contact between these two proteins. In agreement with the AlphaFold2 model and our map in this region, this contact is mediated by SecY Arg-211 and YidC Asp-329 forming a salt bridge (discussed below). Apart from the salt bridge, SecYEG and YidC are held together mainly by the NuoK<sup>86</sup> nascent chain, i.e. TMH 3 at the cytoplasmic interface and TMH 2 within the membrane region, suggesting that YidC is likely recruited to the RNC-bound SecYEG in a substrate-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Routing and insertion of the nascent NuoK</title><p id="P15">The nascent chain could be unambiguously traced from the CCA-end of P-site tRNA to the tunnel exit site within the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). All side chains of the SecM* stalling element (<sub>111</sub><monospace>WWWPRIRGPP</monospace><sub>120</sub>) were resolved with Pro-120 attached to the CCA-end of the A-site tRNA, while the preceding modified motif <sub>117</sub><monospace>RGP</monospace><sub>119</sub> (<sub>163</sub><monospace>RAG</monospace><sub>165</sub> in SecM) was coupled to the CCA-end of the P-site tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The conformation of the stalling peptide, tRNAs and critical bases in the peptidyl-transferase center were highly similar to the structure of SecM-stalled <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, indicating the same trapping mechanism as described for the <monospace>RAG/P</monospace> motif and its modified versions. Further, residues Arg-115 and Arg-117 interacted with PSU2504 and A2062, and the aromatic rings of the tryptophan motif (<sub>112</sub><monospace>WWW</monospace><sub>114</sub>) with bases A2059 and U2586 in the 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Less resolved density accounting for the linker and the HA-tag continues from the constriction by uL4 and uL22 towards the tunnel exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p id="P16">At the mouth of the tunnel exit, the NuoK nascent chain acquires a helical fold accounting for three C-terminal turns of its TMH 3 docked between the SecY loops 6/7, 8/9 and C-terminal TMH 10 extension and the tip of uL24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). This newly formed arrangement of SecY creates a hydrophobic pocket in the otherwise hydrophilic environment of the tunnel exit and the solvent, that allows early folding and accommodation of a short hydrophobic TMH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Strikingly, the emerging nascent chain is not routed into the central channel or the lateral gate of SecY. Once approaching the cytoplasmic funnel of SecY, NuoK TMH 3 density is kinked by approx. 120° towards the back side of the SecYEG, and so it acquires an interfacial topology laying over TMH 3 of SecE and TMH 10 of SecY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). These crossed TMHs form a sawhorse-like crevice at the membrane interface oriented toward YidC. In its turn, the paddle domain of YidC covers the nascent NuoK helix from the cytoplasmic side and completes a triangular window for the hydrophobic substrate. This observation is also consistent with previously proposed interactions of the evolutionary conserved paddle with substrates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Like the SRP M-domain or Get3/TRC40, the YidC paddle contains a "methionine bristle" for client binding and indeed, our structure now shows how the membrane-facing Met-408 and Met-409 in CH2 interact with NuoK TMH 3 prior its insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Notably, replacing these methionine residues with lysines, but not alanine, rendered a cold-sensitive phenotype in <italic>E. coli</italic> upon depletion of the wild-type YidC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 8</xref>). We speculate that the effect originates from defects in IMP biogenesis, and that the apolar environment provided by the paddle domain is an important factor for the nascent IMP folding at the lipid membrane interface prior the insertion, in agreement with the physical considerations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">The close association of YidC with SecYEG ensures immediate hand-over of the nascent chain to the YidC insertase, and the position of NuoK TMH 2 in our structure elucidates the insertion route (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The membrane-inserted NuoK TMH 2 is separated from TMH 3 by the kink, likely the short flexible loop, in a close contact with YidC TMH 3 at the level of Cys-423 of the insertase. NuoK TMH 2 occupies the wide groove between YidC TMHs 3 and 5, i.e. the functional insertase site described in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. As the groove narrows towards the periplasm, the N-terminal end of NuoK TMH 2 is expelled from the helical bundle of YidC, being fully exposed to the lipid environment. Notably, the visualized NuoK does not reach YidC TMH 2 and does not interact with Arg-366 located deep in the YidC groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). This residue was shown to be important for YidC functionality, as it destabilizes the lipid membrane and potentially interacts with charged/polar insertion substrates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Although not observed in our structure, we cannot exclude that this interaction is formed at other stages of NuoK insertion, or it may be specific for particular nascent IMPs.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Determinants for the SecYEG-YidC assembly</title><p id="P18">Since the structure of SecYEG-YidC is organized around the NuoK insertion intermediate, we next asked how specific elements of the nascent chain may affect the complexes' assembly. As YidC involvement in NuoK biogenesis was previously linked to Glu-36 and Glu-72 residues within TMH 2 and TMH 3 of the nascent IMP, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, we substituted both glutamates with lysines and performed cryo-EM analysis of the NuoK<sup>86mut</sup>-RNC:SecYEG-YidC complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 9</xref>). Despite the charge inversion and without the glutaraldehyde stabilization, the YidC density was observed in the same position at the back of SecYEG as upon wild-type NuoK insertion. However, when the length of the nascent chain was reduced to 48 amino acids, so only TMH 1 and TMH 2 of NuoK were exposed from the ribosome (NuoK<sup>48</sup>-RNC), only the RNC-bound SecYEG was resolved within the nanodisc. The signal for YidC was lost, so the insertase remained mobile within the surrounding membrane, and the nanodisc manifested the characteristic tilt by ~10° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 10</xref>). Thus, we concluded that the SecYEG-YidC complex is dynamically assembled to mediate insertion of a nascent IMPs emerging via the "back of Sec" route, and the YidC recruitment may not depend on specific charge within the substrate, but may rely on other determinants, such as the length and the folding status of the emerging chain.</p><p id="P19">Interestingly, the sequence-based prediction of the SecYEG-YidC assembly by AlphaFold showed a very similar arrangement of YidC versus SecYEG as observed in our insertion intermediate in nanodiscs, despite the absence of the ribosome and the nascent chain. Here, the salt bridge between SecY Arg-211 (TMH 5) and YidC Asp-329 (end of EH1) may be a key interaction between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 11A</xref>). This salt bridge is found among multiple distant Gram-negative species, but it is absent in Gram-positives, such as <italic>B. subtilis,</italic> which correlated with differences in the AlphaFold predictions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 1</xref>). This further suggested that the charged interaction is not essential but may serve to stabilize the dynamic complex. Thus, we speculated that disrupting this interaction may be detrimental for IMP biogenesis and affect the cell viability. Accordingly, we tested the importance of the salt bridge by replacing YidC Asp-329 with either alanine or arginine. Both YidC variants could be recombinantly expressed and purified, suggesting that the mutated proteins were correctly folded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 11B and C</xref>). When testing the functional complementation of these YidC variants in <italic>E.coli</italic> FTL10 strain, we observed that the plasmid-encoded YidC<sup>D329A</sup> fully supported the cell growth under depletion of the wild-type YidC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

Strikingly, introducing a positive charge was detrimental for the cellular viability, similar to the known effect of a minor deletion within the proximate EH1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Thus, we concluded that the salt bridge indeed plays a stabilizing role upon the assembly of the dynamic SecYEG-YidC complex, while the electrostatic repulsion rendered via the YidC<sup>D329R</sup> mutation prohibits YidC docking, causing defects in IMP folding, either at the insertion or intramembrane assembly stage.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Comparison of bacterial and eukaryotic insertases</title><p id="P20">Guiding of the NuoK nascent chain to the back side of SecYEG for YidC-mediated insertion manifests an obvious resemblance to the route of multi-spanning IMP biogenesis in the ER of eukaryotes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Here, the ribosome-bound Sec61 translocon serves as a core for the substrate-dependent assembly of a super-complex including BOS (back-of-Sec61) and GEL (GET- and EMC-like) complexes. We thus compared the arrangement of the <italic>E. coli</italic> SecYEG-YidC insertase with the human Sec61-BOS-GEL-PAT machinery trapped with a nascent chain of rhodopsin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The bacterial insertase forms a compact assembly, where YidC is tightly packed against SecYEG and the inserted part of NuoK, providing a simple solution for transferring the nascent chain from the ribosome to the insertion-competent groove of YidC. In contrast, the loosely packed eukaryotic super-complex extends far from the Sec61 core and the resolved nascent chain, and it forms a lipid-filled "peninsula". Remarkably, the YidC homolog TMCO1 (a constituent of the GEL complex) is found more than 3 nm away from Sec61 with its paddle domain oriented towards the rest of GEL. The interaction with the core translocon is mediated via the BOS subunit TMEM147 that largely overlaps with the position of YidC in the bacterial machinery. Interestingly, also the route of the nascent chain differs between two structures: While the membrane-inserted opsin TMH 3 and the RNC-bound linker were found in the orthogonal geometry to the membrane without interactions with the BOS-GEL subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), we report here that the TMHs of NuoK required distinct YidC domains for insertion and folding at the interface. The involvement of YidC at different stages of NuoK biogenesis correlates with its dual role as insertase and as chaperone for nascent IMPs.</p><p id="P21">The structure of the eukaryotic machinery suggests that blockade of the lateral gate by the CCDC47 protein of the PAT complex is a possible determinant to guide a nascent chain to the alternative exit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Here, the extended helices of CCDC47 at the cytoplasmic interface reach the N-terminal half of Sec61α, the SecY homolog, and restrict its mobility required for opening the gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), so the nascent IMP is forced to follow the Sec61-GEL-BOS insertion route. Within the bacterial insertase, the C-terminal end of SecY at the RNC:SecYEG interface may play a similar role, though using a different mechanism. In presence of the NuoK TMH 3 emerging from the tunnel mouth, this SecY extension forms a contact with the rRNA base C490 and hinders the access to the lateral gate. Thus, it may favor the alternative route for the growing nascent chain to the back of SecYEG. Strikingly, shortening of the SecY C-terminus and deletion of Lys-433 and Lys-434 involved in RNA binding appeared lethal for the cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, highlighting the importance of this poorly studied element of SecYEG.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">Variations in TMH topologies and lengths, appearance of partially unfolded regions and charged residues within the membrane core, point to the complexity in IMP biogenesis across the kingdoms of life. Membrane insertion of hydrophobic TMHs via the lateral gate of the SecYEG/Sec61αβγ translocon has been described as a general route towards IMP folding and assembly. The universal paradigm has been lately challenged by the discovery of the eukaryotic insertase machinery, the novel multi-subunit complex BOS-GEL-PAT, that facilitates IMP insertion at the back of the ribosome-bound Sec61 away from the lateral gate. The discovery of a novel insertion route in eukaryotes has immediately raised a question about the evolutionary conservation of the mechanism. Here, we describe how the bacterial machinery composed of SecYEG and YidC insertases mediates the biogenesis of the multi-spanning IMP NuoK. Cryo-EM of the lipid-embedded complex has revealed the substrate-dependent recruitment of YidC to the ribosome-bound SecYEG and visualized the route taken by the nascent chain from the ribosome to the lipid membrane. Differently to the lactose permease folding intermediates assessed in a recent study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, the NuoK nascent chain does not pass the lateral gate, but it folds within the hydrophobic pocket formed by SecY loops and leaves via the sawhorse-shaped crevice at the back, where it is encountered and inserted by YidC. Here, the conserved and partially hydrophobic paddle domain of YidC assists in handover of the pre-folded nascent chain from SecYEG to YidC. The SecYEG-YidC assembly is induced by the nascent chain of sufficient length, and it is stabilized by the salt bridge between SecY and YidC at the periplasmic interface. Although somewhat different in details and complexity level, the overall architecture of the active SecYEG-YidC complex manifests a conceptual similarity to the eukaryotic Sec61-BOS-GEL-PAT insertase machinery. Thus, our results not only validate the existence of the alternative insertion pathway in bacteria and reveal the path of the nascent chain but also strongly suggest an evolutionary link between the distant systems.</p><p id="P23">Multiple studies have described interactions of nascent IMPs with the lateral gate of SecYEG and suggested that YidC is located in proximity to access the emerging nascent TMHs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Our findings do not exclude such architecture, though no relevant classes were observed in the acquired cryo-EM data sets in this study. It remains to be explained what factors determine the route of nascent IMPs, i.e. the triage between the lateral gate and the "back-of-Sec" insertion, and also what features of the nascent chain serve as signals for YidC recruitment. For NuoK biogenesis, the necessity of YidC was previously linked to the anionic residues within the substrate, e.g. via interactions with YidC Arg-366 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. However, we show that YidC is docked at the back of SecYEG also when the charges within the NuoK TMHs are inverted, while no contact with Arg-366 is observed. Notably, the involvement of YidC at the late stage of NuoK biogenesis correlates with the recent findings that both YidC and the evolutionary related EMC complex facilitate insertion of the C-terminal TMHs of polytopic IMPs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. This final insertion event would occur post-translationally when the translation termination happens soon after the synthesis of the last TMH. NuoK would be an example of such IMP: In absence of the stalling introduced here for the purpose of the structural analysis, the nascent polypeptide chain would be released from the peptidyl transferase center, and the membrane insertion of NuoK TMH 3 complex would occur post-translationally. As both YidC and EMC ensure folding of post-translationally delivered clients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, the C-terminal TMHs of polytopic IMPs may utilize the same recognition and insertion routes, while the SecYEG-YidC assembly would facilitate the efficient substrate delivery.</p><p id="P24">The topology acquired by NuoK in the nanodisc is another puzzling outcome of our study. The model based on the resolved TMHs suggests that the N-terminus of the insertion intermediate is oriented into the cytoplasm, thus being inverted in comparison to NuoK within the assembled complex I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 3A</xref>). One explanation may be that the non-native topology originated from the experimental <italic>in vitro</italic> setup, as the employed nanodiscs lack the physiological trans-membrane electrostatic potential, an important factor for the IMP orientation. However, if the electrostatic potential was a decisive factor, we would expect to find NuoK in two different topologies in cryo-EM reconstructions, possibly utilizing different insertion routes, while only one class was experimentally observed. Thus, an alternative scenario seems plausible: Several IMPs, such as four-TMH EmrE, were shown to undergo the complete topology inversion in the last step of their folding, and a single charged residue here can be decisive for the final orientation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. As NuoK does not contain long loops between the TMHs but contains a stretch of three arginine residues within its C-terminal end, it is tempting to speculate that the protein acquires its correct topology in the cellular membrane once the complete polypeptide chain is released from the ribosome. The flip-flop of the inserted TMHs may be promoted by the proximate YidC, as the insertase would distort the lipid bilayer and so destabilize the NuoK intermediate that eventually results in the new topology.</p><p id="P25">Our study delivers a new, direct view on the organization of the bacterial SecYEG-YidC insertase machinery, and the revealed architecture is calling for detailed investigation on its dynamics, as well as re-evaluation of the earlier data. One current limitation of the employed nanodisc-based system is the pre-defined stoichiometry of SecYEG and YidC within the complex, while YidC is substantially more abundant in the bacterial membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.

A consensus refinement with a set of 217,418 particles resulted in a map of 70S ribosome with clear extra density below the tunnel exit. Focused sorting into five classes in the tunnel exit region yielded a class of 33,912 particles showing density for the extramembrane P1 domain of YidC. These particles were used to train a TOPAZ picking model, which resulted in 360,610 particles. The particles were further curated and focused sorted into a final class of 70,670 particles. This class was refined to a final resolution of 2.73 Å (EMD-53587). A local refinement in the SecYEG-YidC region yielded a map with a final resolution of 3.19 Å (EMD-53589).

The particles were curated and after 2D classification, a subset of 287,399 particles was used to generate an ab-initio reconstruction (two classes) of 70S ribosomes with extra density for the insertase complex. The same set was further used to generate templates for template picking, which resulted in 2,057,403 particles, from which a final set of 56,980 particles was obtained after extensive 2D and 3D classification. The particles were fed into a TOPAZ training job, obtaining 433,249 particles after picking and extraction. These particles were used to generate a consensus refinement and focused sorted into eight classes. The class with the best resolved insertase region, comprising 48,952 particles, was further refined to generate a reconstruction with final resolution of 2.87 Å (EMD-53584).

For the 70S ribosome a previously released model based of high-esolution cryo-EM maps of a 70S ribosome and a SecM-stalled RNC were used as templates (PDB IDs 7K00, 8QOA) 29,47. The model for the tRNA-Gly (in SecM) was changed to tRNA-Pro and the mRNA model was adusted from GCU-GGC-CCU (Ala-Gly-Pro in SecM) to GGU-CCU-CCG (Gly-Pro-Pro in SecM*). A model for the SecYEG-YidC assembly was generated based on the rigid body fitting the AlphaFold3 prediction of this complex (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 4</xref>) that was fitted into the locally refined cryo-EM density with only minor adjustments (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 5</xref>). For the nascent chain, the modified SecM* sequence could be modelled de novo based on well-resolved density for this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figue 3A</xref>). Less-resolved density was present to fit the backbone and a few bulky side chains for major parts of glycine-serine linker and the HA-tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). The NuoK TMH 2 and 3 were identified based on the rod-like shape of extra density present at the mouth of the exit tunnel and between SecY and YidC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). While at the given resolution we cannot be sure about the exact register, we positioned residues 73-82 of NuoK THM 3 into the corresponding density supporting the predeicted α-helical conformation. 70S ribosome and SecYEG-YidC atomic models were processed independently in multiple rounds of manual real-space refinement in Coot v0.9.8.95 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.
