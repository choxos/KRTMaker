Cannabis contains delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is thought to underlie its main psychoactive effects, and cannabidiol (CBD), which has been proposed to modulate the effects of THC on the brain. Both have activity at CB1 receptors, whilst THC also binds to CB2 receptors. However, it is unclear how THC’s effects on brain function are related to cannabinoid receptors, or how CBD co-administration affects this. We aimed to investigate the effects of vaporised THC and the moderating effects of CBD on CB1 and CB2 receptor-enriched functional connectivity.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods</title><p id="P2">Forty-eight participants (24 adolescents and 24 adults) who used cannabis 0.5–3 days/week (mean=1.5 days/week) participated in a randomised, crossover, placebo-controlled, double-blind experiment where they inhaled vaporised cannabis containing either THC-only (8mg/75kg person), THC+CBD (8 mg THC + 24 mg CBD/75 kg person) or no psychoactive compounds (placebo). Resting-state functional MRI data were collected approximately 50 minutes post-administration. Receptor distribution maps were derived from positron emission tomography (PET) imaging for CB1 receptors and the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) for CB2 receptors. Receptor-Enriched Analysis of Connectivity by Targets (REACT) analytical methodology was used to investigate changes in functional connectivity related to specific receptor targets.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Results</title><p id="P3">Inhalation of both THC-only and THC+CBD cannabis induced significant decreases in CB1 and CB2 receptor-enriched functional connectivity compared to placebo. The THC+CBD condition showed more extensive reductions than THC-only cannabis for both CB1- and CB2-enriched functional connectivity, affecting regions including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, insula, hippocampus, amygdala, and putamen. Higher THC plasma levels were associated with greater decreases in functional connectivity in the THC+CBD condition. Exploratory analyses identified significant positive and negative relationships between subjective drug effects and receptor-enriched functional connectivity in a region-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P4">Cannabis with and without CBD decreased resting-state functional connectivity in networks associated with CB1 and CB2 receptor distribution. Co-administration of CBD with THC appears to enhance these effects. The REACT analytical methodology identified changes in CB1- and CB2-enriched functional connectivity are related to THC and CBD plasma levels as well as subjective drug effects across a range of regions.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S5" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">The pharmacology of cannabis is complex due to the presence of multiple cannabinoids that can interact with each other and act on a range of targets. Of these, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are two major, naturally occurring cannabinoids that may exhibit polypharmacological effects when administered together. THC produces most of the psychotropic effects of cannabis, mostly through partial agonism of the Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) (<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> = 5.05–80.3 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Pertwee 2008</xref>). CB1 is the most abundant G protein-coupled receptor in the brain, widely expressed in neurons throughout the central nervous system and is primarily localised to presynaptic terminals, where it regulates neurotransmitter release through inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Mackie 2008</xref>). Activation of CB1 by THC underpins THC’s acute psychotropic effects: euphoria, appetite stimulation, memory impairment, and analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Pertwee 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P6">THC also has activity at CB2 receptors (<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> = 1.73–75.3 nM), where it acts as a partial agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Pertwee 2008</xref>). Initially characterised as a receptor involved in peripheral immune responses, CB2 is now suggested to play a role in the central nervous system. CB2 is expressed at low levels in neurons and glial cells in the healthy brain, and its activation exerts anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and modulating microglial activity (for review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Grabon, Rheims et al. 2023</xref>)).</p><p id="P7">Evidence also suggests CB2 activation modulates synaptic transmission <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kano, Ohno-Shosaku et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Morgan, Stanford et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Atwood, Straiker et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Franklin and Carrasco 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hwang, Kim et al. 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sadanandan, Kreko-Pierce et al. 2020</xref>) and decreases neuronal excitability both <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">den Boon, Chameau et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Zhang, Gao et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Zhang, Gao et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ma, Gao et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Yu, Liu et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Zhang, Shen et al. 2021</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Sokal, Elmes et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Elmes, Jhaveri et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Nackley, Zvonok et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jhaveri, Elmes et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Zhang, Gao et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Stempel, Stumpf et al. 2016</xref>). Rodent studies further suggest CB2R activation modulates feeding, motor function, memory, learning and mood (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Grabon, Rheims et al. 2023</xref>)). The role of CB2 in mediating the psychotropic effects of THC remains poorly understood.</p><p id="P8">CBD, in contrast, acts as a negative allosteric modulator of CB1 receptors (Kb = 0.27-0.35μM, Ki&gt;4μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Laprairie, Bagher et al. 2015</xref>), and there is evidence to show it has anxiolytic, antipsychotic, and anti-addictive properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">White 2019</xref>). CBD has been hypothesised to be oppositional to THC in its actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Curran, Freeman et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wall, Pope et al. 2019</xref>), however, studies co-administering THC and CBD have produced mixed results dependent on factors including routes of administration, relative doses and timing of assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Freeman, Petrilli et al. 2019</xref>). The most recent evidence comes from a study that co-administered inhaled CBD and THC in different ratios ranging from 0:1 to 3:1 CBD:THC to healthy volunteers in a double-blind, within-subject, randomised manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Englund, Oliver et al. 2023</xref>). The study reports that CBD did not modulate the effects of THC on cognitive and psychotic side effects, even at the highest dose, suggesting it does not have protective effects against the acute adverse effects of cannabis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Englund, Oliver et al. 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Studies using fMRI following acute inhaled cannabinoid administration can provide insight into the neuropsychopharmacology of THC and CBD. For example, a network connectivity analysis of the present study, which included 24 adolescents and 24 adults, found that THC reduced functional connectivity compared to placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ertl, Freeman et al. 2024</xref>). The authors found that coadministration of CBD with THC may enhance the effects of THC, resulting in a greater reduction in functional connectivity, in regions of the executive control and salience networks, than that caused by administration of THC alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ertl, Freeman et al. 2024</xref>). In contrast to this, a prior study using a similar design showed that CBD restored disruption of the salience network by THC in a group of 17 adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wall, Pope et al. 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Informing drug-induced changes in brain function with biological information is an active area of research. For example, one study found that the COMT genotype modulated fMRI responses to THC, suggesting prefrontal dopamine levels may relate to the acute effects of the drug. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Pelgrim, Ramaekers et al. 2023</xref>)</p><p id="P11">However, a more powerful approach to this is Receptor-Enriched Analysis of Connectivity by Targets (REACT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dipasquale, Selvaggi et al. 2019</xref>). This method evaluates drug-induced changes in functional connectivity that relate to the receptor target(s) of the drug by integrating data on the spatial distribution of the drug target into the analyses. For example, by using a reference image produced by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with a tracer that binds to a relevant target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dipasquale, Selvaggi et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Dipasquale, Martins et al. 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lawn, Dipasquale et al. 2022</xref>). In summary, REACT uses maps of receptor expression, which allows researchers to explore the effects of drugs on functional connectivity in brain networks related to those receptors, deriving a measure of brain function related to the drug acting on a specific receptor target.</p><p id="P12">Previous work using the method has linked receptor-enriched connectivity to subjective drug effects and drug plasma levels. For example, MDMA-induced functional connectivity changes were found to be primarily mediated by the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and 5-HT1A receptor, with MDMA plasma levels correlating with connectivity increases in 5-HT1A-enriched maps and MDMA-induced decreases in 5-HT2A-enriched connectivity correlating with subjective experience of spirituality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dipasquale, Selvaggi et al. 2019</xref>). Similarly, work on LSD showed that while 5HT2a activity is central to changes in connectivity, LSD also alters 5HT1a, 5HT1b, D1, and D2 receptor-enriched functional connectivity, with serotonergic systems driving perceptual effects and dopaminergic systems modulating cognition and selfhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lawn, Dipasquale et al. 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Human PET data availability is limited as only a restricted number of ligands are available, and therefore, most receptor targets in the brain cannot be imaged non-invasively, however, the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) is a unique resource that provides whole-brain genome-wide transcriptomic data suitable for REACT analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Shen, Overly et al. 2012</xref>). The atlas contains expression levels of &gt;20,000 genes profiled by ~60,000 microarray probes across different brain regions. Importantly, the data are spatially resolved in the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate system, allowing for a one-to-one spatial matching with neuroimaging data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Shen, Overly et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Selvaggi, Rizzo et al. 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P14">In our present study, we build on the functional connectivity work on this cohort published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ertl et al. (2024)</xref> to explore the effects of THC-only and THC+CBD-containing cannabis on the CB1 and CB2 receptor-enriched functional connectivity in groups of young adults and adolescents. We additionally include validation analyses of using AHBA data for REACT analyses by comparing the results of analyses that use a PET-derived and AHBA-derived version of CB1 distribution maps.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P15">The data presented here is from the CannTeen-Acute study.

Adult users were excluded if they had used cannabis regularly before the age of 18. Volunteers were excluded if there was a history of or current psychosis or an immediate family member with a psychotic disorder, as well as if there were any other medical problems considered clinically significant for the study.

The cannabis was administered with a Volcano Medic Vaporiser (Storz and Bickel) set at 210 °C. Three types of cannabis were used to create the formulations: Bedrocan (20.2% THC, 0.1% CBD), Bedrolite (0.4% THC, 8.5% CBD), and Bedrobinol (no THC or CBD). There was an absence of microbes, yeasts, aflatoxins, pesticides, and heavy metals in both Bedrolite and Bedrobinol, and there was the presence of cannabinol at 0.1%. Appropriate quantities of these three cannabis types were combined to produce the following treatments, matched for overall weight of cannabis: 0.107 mg/kg THC in the “THC only” condition (e.g. 8 mg THC for a 75 kg person), 0.107 mg/kg THC plus 0.320 mg/kg CBD in the “THC + CBD” condition (e.g. 8mg THC and 24 mg CBD for a 75 kg person), or placebo cannabis (0 mg THC, 0 mg CBD). The dose of THC used was equivalent to 1.6 standard units of THC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Freeman and Lorenzetti 2020</xref>). Subjects inhaled two balloons (each within nine minutes, a total of 18 min), with the experimenters monitoring standard timings for inhalation. This method of administration has been extensively used in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Mokrysz, Freeman et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mokrysz, Shaban et al. 2021</xref>) and is safe and effective at delivering cannabinoids and producing well-documented behavioural and subjective effects. Placebo cannabis was closely matched to the active drug conditions in both appearance and smell, and all researchers present (as well as the participant) were blinded to the drug conditions. Additional staff (not present at the testing sessions) blinded the treatment conditions in advance of the testing sessions. The minimum washout period between testing sessions was three days, the mode was seven days, and the maximum was 51 days.</p><p id="P22">Participants received video training for the vaporiser during their baseline/screening session. Approximately 30 minutes following drug administration, participants were situated in the MRI scanner for a ~one-hour scanning session. Blood samples were collected at -5, +20, +30, +160 minutes of cannabis administration as detailed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lawn, Trinci et al. 2023</xref>). For this sub-study, blood samples collected at +20 minutes were used as they reflected plasma concentrations closest to the resting state fMRI data acquisition. THC plasma levels were compared between THC-only and THC+CBD visits.</p><p id="P23">The resting-state scan was eight minutes long and was acquired towards the beginning of the scanning session, approximately 50 minutes after the start of drug administration. Previous work has shown that subjective effects of vaporised cannabis have a fast onset, and stay at a high level for approximately 60–90 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Spindle, Cone et al. 2018</xref>). The timing of the resting-state scan was therefore close to the expected time of peak effects.

However, to provide additional validation of using gene expression data for REACT-based analysis of fMRI data, we additionally derived the CB1 receptor expression map from the AHBA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://neurosynth.org/genes/CNR1">neurosynth.org/genes/CNR1</ext-link>) to compare results to those using the PET-derived map.</p><p id="P28">The AHBA-derived receptor maps were processed to more closely resemble the CB1 PET atlas image we used in this study. Specifically, the gene expression images were smoothed with a 6mm FWHM kernel to match the smoothness of the PET data and normalised to have values ranging from 0–100 to match the CB1 PET-derived atlas map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dukart, Holiga et al. 2021</xref>).

All target maps were entered into the first step of a dual regression analysis implemented using fsl_glm. This uses the receptor maps as a set of spatial regressors to estimate functional connectivity with voxels in the receptor maps, weighed by the level of target expression. The rs-fMRI data and the design matrix were demeaned to improve the model fit, as is standard for dual regression analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Filippini, MacIntosh et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Smith, Utevsky et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Nickerson, Smith et al. 2017</xref>).

These tests were performed using randomise (Winkler, Ridgway et al. 2014) with 5000 permutations per test and contrast, and thresholded using the Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) algorithm.

The Z-score images were then processed using Conn’s TFCE module (apply_tfce, E=0.5, H=2, Hmin=0). To carry out whole-brain correction consistent with the group-level randomise analyses, small clusters below 15 voxels (with connectivity set to 26) were removed using SPM’s spm_bwlabel. A Bonferroni correction was applied to the TFCE p-value. For THC and CBD levels, p&lt;0.025 was used; for analyses of subjective drug effects, p&lt;0.0125 was used.

These results extend previous work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ertl et al. (2024)</xref>, where the authors report decreases in functional connectivity in a number of networks, including the executive control and salience networks, as well as several subcortical networks. Specifically, Ertl and al. reported decreased DLPFC and cingulate connectivity with other regions of the executive control network, decreased insula connectivity within the executive control and salience networks, decreased hippocampus-frontal and hippocampus-PCC connectivity, as well as decreased connectivity of the temporal regions within limbic and salience networks. The overlap with regions identified by REACT suggests these effects may be CB1-mediated. In addition, we identified reductions in CB1-enriched connectivity of the putamen and the amygdala, which Ertl et al did not see effects using a traditional functional connectivity approach.</p><p id="P45">We further found that CB2-enriched functional connectivity was also decreased following both the administration of THC-only and THC+CBD compared to placebo, spanning similar regions to changes observed in CB1-enriched functional connectivity. In the THC+CBD treatment, additional effects were seen in the frontal pole, with no reductions in functional connectivity in the amygdala, putamen and DLPFC that were seen with the CB1-enriched maps. These results extend prior work by indicating that functional connectivity decreases in different regions may be mediated via different receptors.</p><p id="P46">We found that THC+CBD cannabis caused decreases in functional connectivity that had a greater spatial extent than in the THC-only treatment, in both CB1 and CB2-enriched functional connectivity. This is consistent with results reported by Ertl et al., where THC+CBD similarly induced greater decreases in functional connectivity, but in opposition to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wall et al. (2019)</xref>, where the authors found THC-only treatment caused greater decreases in functional connectivity than THC co-administered with CBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wall, Pope et al. 2019</xref>). We also saw that THC plasma levels were significantly higher in the THC+CBD condition compared to the THC-only condition, despite the same controlled method of administration. As discussed by Ertl et al., this may be due to CBD and THC competing for metabolism at CYP450 enzymes, which results in significantly higher THC plasma levels when it is co-administered with CBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Arkell, Lintzeris et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Zamarripa, Spindle et al. 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ertl, Freeman et al. 2024</xref>). Other recent work has provided additional evidence for this, showing that co-administration of 450mg of CBD with 9mg of THC significantly increased subjective and behavioural effects of THC, along with increases in blood-plasma levels and elimination half-life of THC (Gorbenko, Heuberger et al.), and that THC co-administered with CBD resulted in higher THC levels than when administered alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Arkell, Lintzeris et al. 2019</xref>). Thus, it is most likely that we are observing a THC dose-response effect across both receptors. Supporting this interpretation, in the THC+CBD condition, plasma levels of both THC and CBD were correlated with decreases in CB1-enriched functional connectivity in regions including the postcentral gyrus, planum temporale, inferior frontal gyrus, and insular cortex, as well as with decreases in CB2-enriched connectivity in the precentral and postcentral gyrus. Since THC and CBD plasma levels were correlated across subjects due to co-administration, it is difficult to test which one may be driving the positive relationship in these regions and indicate future studies would benefit from a CBD-only condition.</p><p id="P47">Taken together, these results are consistent with greater THC dose driving greater decreases in receptor-enriched functional connectivity. However, we did not observe a similar correlation between THC levels and receptor-enriched connectivity in the THC-only condition. One explanation for this is the smaller number of voxels included in the analysis, as we only analysed voxels showing significant drug (THC&gt;placebo) effects (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). Thus, following cluster-correction, there is a very low likelihood that there would be significant overlapping clusters, additionally, lower variation in THC plasma levels in the THC-only condition could further reduce our ability to detect an association.</p><p id="P48">We found that subjective drug effects were related to both CB1 and CB2-enriched functional connectivity in a region-specific manner in the CBD+THC condition only. Similarly to analyses with THC and CBD levels, correlations were performed only in regions where there was a significant effect of the drug. Thus, this may explain why there were no effects in the THC-only condition, which was also associated with lower THC levels. In exploratory analyses, we found that greater decreases in CB1-enriched connectivity in the opercular cortex were associated with lower feel “drug scores”, while greater decreases in CB1-enriched connectivity in the middle frontal gyrus were associated with higher “feel drug” scores. One interpretation of the negative correlation with interoceptive/sensorimotor regions is that CB1 activations may be linked to lower awareness of the effect of the drug, resulting in a lower “feel drug” rating. Additionally, a greater decrease of CB2 enriched connectivity was associated with lower “feel drug” scores in the frontal pole, cingulate, superior frontal gyrus, as well as in the angular gyrus, temporal pole, superior and middle temporal gyri regions. This raises questions around the roles CB2 may play in mediating the subjective effects of cannabis.</p><p id="P49">Previous fMRI studies have linked THC-induced changes in perceived euphoria/high states with altered connectivity, specifically with increases in frontostriatal connectivity (Van Hell, Bossong et al. 2011) and PCC-sensorimotor/precentral gyrus connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kleinloog, Rombouts et al. 2015</xref>). In opposition to this, a study co-administering CBD with THC found ratings of how “high” participants felt were related to greater reductions in PCC connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wall, Pope et al. 2019</xref>). Our findings add to this body of literature by identifying associations with brain function related to specific receptor systems.</p><sec id="S20"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="P50">This data set has a number of strengths, including groups of adolescents and adults with an equal split of males and females, a relatively large sample size compared to previous studies of this type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Winton-Brown, Allen et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Klumpers, Cole et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bossong, van Hell et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wall, Pope et al. 2019</xref>), and a well-matched placebo control treatment. The two groups were also well-matched in terms of cannabis use frequency. In addition, vaporised cannabis ensures better absorption and ecological validity than oral THC and CBD challenges, avoiding first-pass metabolism and achieving a relevant concentration of CBD to achieve negative-allosteric modulation of CB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lawn, Trinci et al. 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P51">A key consideration for this study is the absence of a PET tracer for CB2 receptors, which led us to use the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) to define CB2-mediated changes in functional connectivity. Previous validation studies have demonstrated good concordance between PET imaging and AHBA maps for receptors that do not undergo significant post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Rizzo, Veronese et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Selvaggi, Rizzo et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hansen, Markello et al. 2022</xref>). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, or ubiquitination, can alter the structure, function, or localisation of receptor proteins, potentially affecting their availability and binding properties. As receptors like CB1 and CB2 do not undergo substantial post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Carruthers and Grimsey 2024</xref>), they are less likely to show variability in receptor expression or distribution due to these molecular changes, supporting the use of AHBA data to represent CB2 receptor distribution in this study. We additionally included an analysis of CB1-mediated changes using the AHBA to define CB1-receptor distribution. A comparison of the CB1 AHBA and CB1 PET REACT pipelines showed a high degree of spatial overlap in the results, further suggesting AHBA data is suitable for these analyses. However, it must be cautioned that AHBA data is derived from 6 subjects only, and has limited spatial sampling, and thus, results should be interpreted with some caution.</p><p id="P52">Another key consideration is that this study included participants who were (semi-)regular cannabis users, while the PET/AHBA reference maps were acquired from averages of normal “healthy” subjects. Repeated administration of receptor agonists may result in receptor internalisation and/or a reduction in receptor protein signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Pertwee 2006</xref>) and significant CB1 density alteration has been seen in daily cannabis users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Ceccarini, Kuepper et al. 2015</xref>). However, given that participants in this study used cannabis 1.5 days/week on average, it is likely that any receptor alterations would be relatively minimal and the ‘normal’ spatial distribution of receptors would be preserved. Replicating these results in a multimodal PET-fMRI study where individual receptor distribution data are available for each subject would answer to what extent individual variability in receptor distribution affects REACT results.</p><p id="P53">Finally, it is important to note that the co-administration of CBD+THC resulted in higher plasma THC levels than in the THC-only condition, meaning that in the THC+CBD condition, two key variables changed, affecting the ability to make a clear interpretation of the results. Results from previous studies are mixed and conclude that CBD may be both oppositional to THC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Winton-Brown, Allen et al. 2011</xref>), enhance its effects (Gorbenko, Heuberger et al.), or have no effects at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Englund, Oliver et al. 2023</xref>). Overall, while the increase in THC plasma level we saw confounds the pharmacological interpretation of the study, the comparison is still instructive as it effectively mimics what happens in real-world cannabis use.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Implications and conclusions</title><p id="P54">The results show that cannabinoids reliably decrease resting-state activity in a broad network of regions associated with the distribution maps of both CB1 and CB2 receptors and suggest that co-administration of CBD with THC enhances these effects. This is evidence that cannabis with high CBD levels may not necessarily attenuate the neural effects of THC (and may in fact produce stronger effects). The negative finding of no interaction between cannabis treatments and age group suggests that effects on resting-state activity related to cannabinoid receptor distribution do not significantly differ between adolescents and adults. This indicates that adolescents do not appear to be more at risk for negative effects than adults. Further work in this area using multi-modal imaging (PET with suitable cannabinoid ligands, and fMRI) in the same cohort of subjects would be highly valuable and would further advance our understanding of the effects of cannabinoids on brain function and physiology.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS206249-supplement-Supplementary_materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d38aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded by a grant from the Medical Research Council, MR/P012728/1, to HVC and TPF</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="conflict"><p id="P55"><bold>Financial disclosures</bold>: MBW and NE’s primary employer is Perceptive LLC, a contract research organisation that performs commercial research for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.
