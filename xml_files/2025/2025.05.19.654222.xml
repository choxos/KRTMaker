However, significant within-person variability in spindle attributes complicates their utility in predicting cognitive deterioration. This study aimed to uncover distinct spindle types and their relevance to memory decline using data-driven clustering.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods</title><p id="P2">Polysomnography was collected from younger (n = 43, ages 20-45 years) and older cognitively healthy adults (n = 34, ages 60-81 years).

Stage N3 spindles (15%; predominantly coinciding with slow oscillations) formed a distinct group, followed by N2 spindles coinciding with slow oscillations (27%). Remaining N2 spindles were categorized into unilateral (41%) and bilateral clusters (17%). In older adults, there was a reduced proportion of N2 bilateral spindles and an increased proportion of N2 spindles concurrent with slow oscillations. Reduced proportion of N2 bilateral spindles was associated with better composite memory performance in younger adults, whereas higher spindle power, regardless of cluster belonging, was associated with reduced memory benefit from sleep compared with wakefulness.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P4">Our results indicate differing expression of spatiotemporal spindle clusters in older age, as well as intertwined dynamics between spindle propagation, SO concurrence, and frequency shifts in ageing.

These include alterations in the duration and quality of various sleep stages, as well as in specific physiological features such as sleep spindles and slow oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. At the same time, aging is often accompanied by a decline in memory capabilities, significantly impacting daily life and overall well-being<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that sleep plays a crucial role in memory consolidation across the human lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Consequently, establishing a link between quantifiable sleep markers and memory could be promising for the early detection of cognitive decline in the older adults. Sleep spindles, in particular, have emerged as promising candidates for predicting memory decline in both healthy and pathological aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. However, the ability to predict memory changes across individuals may be compromised by the significant within-individual heterogeneity in spindle attributes throughout the night<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Sleep spindles are distinctive bursts of oscillatory brain activity that can be recorded by electroencephalography (EEG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. These events occur during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and are characterized by a frequency range of approximately 9-16 Hz and a duration of about 0.5-2 seconds. The rapid changes in cellular Ca2+ concentrations triggered by spindle events make them relevant for various types of neural reorganization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, including spike-time dependent plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, long-term potentiation and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, and dendritic spine formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Sleep spindles also play a significant role in active systems consolidation theory, where, alongside concurrent slow oscillations (SOs) and hippocampal ripples, it is speculated that they facilitate communication between the hippocampus and the neocortex, essential for the transfer and long-term storage of new information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Compared to young adults, the older adults have reduced spindle density, power, duration, and dominant frequency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. While age may influence the spindle-memory association in healthy individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, deficiencies in spindle expression could precede age-related brain changes as deterioration progresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. To identify healthy adults at risk for dementia, Orlando et al. (2023)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> utilized a clustering approach on averaged spindle attributes and found a group of individuals with low spindle density, duration, and power, who had the greatest memory decline. This approach could be enhanced by considering the extensive spindle heterogeneity within individuals. In our study, we adopted a similar clustering approach but focused on clustering at the level of individual spindles to capture their variability within each person.</p><p id="P8">The sources of spindle variability throughout the night are manifold. The most commonly considered attribute is spindle frequency, distinguishing between slow (9-12 Hz) and fast (12-16 Hz) spindles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. There is ongoing debate about whether these spindles represent functionally distinct types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Generally, stronger associations are found between memory and fast spindles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, although a recent large-scale study suggests that both spindle types may predict cognitive performance in older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">A related approach differentiates spindles based on their scalp topography, distinguishing between frontal and parietal spindles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. However, findings from larger electrode coverages and intracranial recordings indicate more variable spatial organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, suggesting that a coarse distinction between local and global spindles might also be appropriate.</p><p id="P10">The temporal context of spindles is another significant factor. Spindles occurring on the up-phase of SOs are particularly relevant for memory and appear to deteriorate with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. This presents a paradox, as SOs are the hallmark of stage N3 sleep, while spindles are most prominent in N2 sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, making their co-occurrence, as measured by EEG, relatively rare<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. The timing of spindle events during the night is also pertinent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, as spindle power varies non-linearly throughout the night<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Additionally, the timing within sleep cycles is relevant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">Furthermore, spindle characteristics may be influenced by the type of thalamocortical projections; core projections are limited to deeper cortical layers, while matrix projections reach the upper layers and are more likely captured by EEG electrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">Lastly, the information in the post-spindle signal might be as critical as the spindle attributes. Given that spindles are highly synchronous oscillatory events, they may have limited information-processing capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> and may rather serve as gating phenomena<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> that initiate subsequent information transfer in the cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. This is indirectly evidenced by the so-called spindle refractory period, during which incoming information seems not to be processed within a few seconds after a spindle event, as if blocked by ongoing computations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">In sum, there are significant sources of variability in spindle expression throughout the night within each person. Notably, this variability is not random, as specific features tend to co-occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. For example, slow spindles are more localized to the frontal areas, while faster spindles are more prominent in the temporo-parietal regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. At the same time, stage N2 spindles generally exhibit higher power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> or faster frequency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> compared to those in N3. Therefore, data-driven clustering of single spindles based on an array of different attributes may uncover functionally distinct spindle types.</p><p id="P14">On the other side of the equation, it remains unclear which aspects of age-related memory decline are most influenced by changes in sleep. Whereas sleep spindles may be preferably associated with procedural memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, ageing appears to affect more profoundly sleep based consolidation of declarative memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. In addition, several moderating factors have been identified, including older age, where the beneficial effects of sleep on memory performance diminish or even disappear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Studies on long-term declarative memory suggest that aging also affects the durability of already learned associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. However, the role of sleep on the longevity of episodic memories in older adults, and how these sleep-memory interactions influence daily functioning, remains an open question.</p><p id="P15">In this study, we leveraged single spindle activity and various memory tasks to identify spindle types relevant to age-related memory decline in healthy participants. Specifically, we used multiple episodic memory tasks, combining specific memory gain in sleep over wakefulness with delayed recall assessments and subjective memory problems. While our analysis was data-driven and exploratory, it was guided by three core hypotheses. First, we anticipated heterogeneity in spindle characteristics, which would allow them to be grouped into distinct types. Second, we expected age differences in the expression of these spindle types. Third, we expected that parsing this spindle heterogeneity into distinct clusters may help to pinpoint which spindle types are the best predictors of age-related memory decline as composite score and for sleep-associated memory consolidation.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Sample</title><p id="P16">Data was analyzed from 77 healthy adults, divided into younger (n = 43; 20-45 years, mean age = 27, sd = 5, 23/20 males/females) and older (n = 34; 60-81 years, mean age = 68, sd = 5, 20/14 males/females) age groups. Initially, 92 individuals were enrolled in the study, of which 82 had PSG data available. From these, data was discarded due to bad EEG quality (n = 2) and high depression scores (n = 3; Becks Depression Inventory &gt;= 16 or Geriatric Depression Scale &gt;= 9). All participants were fluent in Norwegian, right-handed, with normal or corrected vision and no history of severe psychiatric or neurological disorders, traumatic or enhanced brain injury, sleep disorders, and no current use of medications known to affect the nervous system. All participants signed an informed consent approved by the Regional Ethical Committee of South Norway (REK 2010/3407). The main recruiting strategies included targeted Social Media advertisement, flyers, and posters at selected places (e.g. senior centers). Participants received monetary compensation for the participation.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>General procedure</title><p id="P17">This study is part of a larger project investigating memory consolidation processes at different timescales and their possible relation to memory decline in aging. The project design included two experimental sessions per participant, divided into an awake and a sleep condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Each session consisted of several elements occurring in this order: memory encoding task, eight-alternative forced choice retrieval task (AFC-1), 12 hours waiting period, memory retrieval task, AFC-2, and online AFC-3 around six days later. The experimental encoding and retrieval tasks took place within MRI scanner, with results reported elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">The order of the experimental sessions (wake vs. sleep) was counterbalanced across participants. During the sleep condition, participants arrived at the hospital either 7 or 9 p.m. and subsequently began the memory encoding task at approximately 8 or 10 p.m., respectively. After completing the evening memory tasks in the MRI scanner, they were equipped with a polysomnography (PSG) device and directed to sleep in the hotel next to the hospital. They returned next morning at 8 or 10 a.m. to complete the memory retrieval tasks. Prior to the experimental night, the participants had a habituation night with the PSG at the same hotel.</p><p id="P19">In addition to the experimental sessions, participants filled online questionnaires and visited the lab for neuropsychological testing. Relevant for this study, they filled in Becks Depression Inventory, Geriatric Depression Inventory, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Everyday Memory Questionnaire. A custom ecological memory test procedure was integrated into this testing session, probing participants at the end of the first session and four weeks later by phone.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Memory evaluation</title><p id="P20">Six different memory scores were extracted from the different memory evaluation procedures, which were later combined using principal component analysis (PCA).</p><sec id="S10"><title>Source memory experiment</title><p id="P21">The source memory experiment contributed with three conceptually different scores, named “source recall”, “delayed source recall”, and “sleep gain”. The details of the source memory task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) are described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. Shortly, during the encoding phase, participants were shown pictures of 128 items, each together with a specific face or place (4 faces and 4 places in total). They were instructed to imagine an association between the item and the face/place, and then to evaluate the vividness of this association on the scale 1-4. Directly after the encoding task, their learning performance was tested with a forced choice task (AFC), in which the participant had to indicate, for each item, which face or place it had been paired with. After 12 hours, participants returned for a retrieval test, in which they were shown each item and several new items, and they had to indicate whether it had been previously associated with a face, place, they did not remember, or the item was new. The experimental memory score (“source recall”) was calculated by counting the correctly remembered face/place associations, subtracting the number of incorrect associations, divided by the total number of items, and lastly, averaged over the wake and sleep sessions for more robust estimation. This score thus reflects the percentage of correctly remembered associations after 12 hours, corrected for guessing. Given that the retrieval task prompts for the context in which each item association was formed, it is putatively reflecting episodic source memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">The second memory score (“dealyed source recall”) was also derived from the experimental procedure, particularly the 8-alternative forced choice tasks (AFC-1-2-3). In this task, participants were shown each item together with all four faces and four places. They had to choose, which face or place the item had been associated with during the encoding phase. This test was administered three times: first directly after encoding, then after the 12-hour period (directly after the in-scanner retrieval task described previously), and lastly, after about six days using an online version of the task. The memory score was calculated as the percentage of accurate associations in all three timepoints (hit-hit-hit), thus indicating the percentage of associations correctly remembered after six days, putatively reflecting the ability to form durable memories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">The third memory score, “sleep gain,” represents the benefit of a 12-hour sleep period compared to the same duration of wakefulness and is calculated as the difference in source recall accuracy (corrected for guessing) between sleep and wake conditions. A positive value indicates improved memory performance after sleep relative to the awake period, serving as an index of sleep-driven memory consolidation. This retrieval test focused on category associations rather than specific faces and places, making it well-suited for assessing gist memory formation and consolidation, typically linked to sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. However, since this test was not administered immediately after learning, the sleep-wake difference might be influenced by baseline variations before the 12-hour period. To address this, we additionally calculated the sleep gain effect using AFC-1 (baseline) and AFC-2 test performances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). First, AFC-2 performance was calculated as the percentage of items remembered at both time points, relative to baseline AFC-1 performance. Then, difference scores between sleep and wake conditions were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Ecological memory task</title><p id="P24">This task was a custom ecological memory test, designed to objectively measure everyday attentional and memory performance, and contributed with two memory scores: “everyday recall”, and “dealyed everyday recall”. This was implemented in the separate lab-visit, when the participants came in for neuropsychological testing (not used in this study). During this session, the experimenters highlighted ten previously scripted specific behaviors or details in the environment, for example asking the participant to hold a pen during a procedure, pointing out the location of the restrooms, commenting on the type of the music played during waiting, etc. At the end of the session, the participants were asked to recall what they did from the beginning of session until the start of the session, including as much detail as possible. After this spontaneous narration, participants were probed directly about specific episodes that they had omitted from their narratives. This procedure was repeated four weeks later via a phone call. With participants’ consent, their narratives were recorded and later transcribed by the experimenter following a 13-item questionnaire. The items were coded ‘correct’ if remembered correctly, ‘incorrect’ if participant indicated they had forgotten or gave a wrong answer, or ‘irrelevant’ if the answer was indefinite or too abstract for direct transcription, or when there was ambiguity whether this action was correctly performed during the session. All irrelevant items were discarded, and the percentage of correct responses to the remaining items served as the fourth (“everyday recall”) and fifth (“dealyed everyday recall”) memory score, reflecting immediate and delayed recall, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Everyday Memory Questionnaire</title><p id="P25">The last score (“emq”) was derived from the Everyday Memory Questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>, which measures self-reported memory failures in everyday life. This 28-item questionnaire probes participants for the frequency of daily memory lapses, such as loosing items, forgetting appointments, etc. We calculated the sum of all items, and higher sum scores indicate worse perceived memory problems.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Principal component analysis</title><p id="P26">All six scores were combined into a single memory score using PCA in R (v. 4.2.1). The calculation was done by a singular value decomposition on the zero-centered and scaled (to have unit variance) data matrix.

Data was sampled at 256 Hz, and bandpass software filters for EEG (0.1-35 Hz) and EMG (0.1-100 Hz) were applied during data export. With Nox A1 device (n = 13), data was sampled at 500 Hz over 8 EEG electrodes (C3, C4, F3, F4, O1, O2, M1, M2), 3 chin-EMG electrodes and 2 EOG electrodes.

For reproducible workflow, automatic sleep staging was implemented using the YASA toolbox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup> (0.6.3) in Python 3.8, in which each segment was assigned a sleep stage based on the AASM guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. Manually staged data is available, scored by a student lab member. The average overlap between automatic and human staged data was 77% (sd = 11), which rose to 80% (sd = 7) after discarding three outliers with &lt;60% overlap, and is in the range of overlap between different human raters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Event detection</title><p id="P30">Sleep spindles were also detected with the YASA toolbox. Spindle detection was limited to stage N2 and N3 and was applied to both C3 and C4 electrodes, with the frequency band of 9-16 Hz. The algorithm follows coarsely Lacourse et. al. 2018<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>, with major diversions explained in YASA online tutorial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>. The raw signal was bandpass filtered between 1-30 Hz. Then, data was segmented into consecutive epochs of 2 seconds with 200 ms overlap, and submitted to short-term Fourier Transform to calculate the frequency power spectrum per epoch. We adopted two thresholds to detect potential spindle events. The first threshold was based on a sliding window (300 ms in steps of 100 ms) correlation between the sigma-filtered signal and the bandpass filtered EEG. Specifically, the Pearson correlation coefficient had to be &gt;=0.65, ensuring that the detected spindles would also be visible in the raw EEG − the main criteria for manual detection based on visual inspection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. The second threshold was based on a sliding window root mean square (RMS) of the sigma-filtered EEG (300 ms in steps of 100 ms). This threshold was exceeded, if the RMS exceeded 1.5 standard deviations from the mean RMS, calculated without the 10% of highest and lowest values to reduce the bias due to potential artefacts. Note that the third threshold (implemented by default in YASA) that considers the relative power of the sigma frequency band with respect to the total broadband power was discarded in our implementation. This is because we intended the algorithm to be also sensitive to spindles in the deep sleep stage N3, in which the strong contribution of lower frequencies tends to reduce the relative sigma peak. This is especially relevant in the context of the known age-related differences in the low frequency power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>, which may bias the algorithm towards more lenient detection in older adults. Lastly, spindles that were too close to each other (&lt;500 ms) were merged, and spindles that were too short (&lt; 500 ms) or too long (&gt; 2 sec) were removed.</p><p id="P31">Slow oscillations (SOs) were also detected with the YASA software, based on algorithms from Massimini et. al.

Data was bandpass filtered between 0.3 and 1.5 Hz. In the first step, no amplitude threshold was set, detecting all zero-crossings with pre-defined durations as potential SOs. Then, individual thresholds were calculated per person, so that the final SOs had to exceed 1.25 times of the negative peak and 1.25 times the peak-to-peak amplitude of all initial detections.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Feature selection</title><p id="P32">Multistep procedure was applied for feature selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). First, 24 initial features were extracted (20 continuous and 4 categorical). These could be broadly classified into 4 themes: spindle-specific attributes (n=8), temporal context (n=6), post-spindle period variables (n=9), and topography (n=1). Then, variables were discarded based on multicollinearity (bivariate Pearson’s r &gt; 0.7) and conceptual overlap. Lastly, some variables were discarded on a post hoc basis after initial analysis due to apparent biases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials 1</xref>). Altogether, 8 continuous and 3 categorical features were retained for the main clustering analysis.</p><p id="P33">The spindle-specific features were extracted from the YASA automatic output and included the duration, peak-to-peak amplitude, root mean square, median absolute power, median relative power, median frequency, number of oscillations, and symmetry. The absolute power and instantaneous frequency were derived from the Hilbert-transform of the sigma-filtered signal, and the relative power was derived from the short-term Fourier transform of the preprocessed signal, expressed as the percentage of power in the sigma band relative to the total power of the broadband signal. The symmetry indicates the location of the most prominent sigma peak, with 0 at the start and 1 at the end of the spindle, thus values around 0.5 indicating symmetric spindles.</p><p id="P34">A set of features were calculated reflecting the temporal context of each spindle. These included the stage in which the spindle occurred, sleep cycle, onset time relative to the sleep onset (first indication of N1 sleep), onset relative to the beginning of the cycle, inter-spindle interval, and co-occurrence with slow oscillations. Sleep cycle was determined by the adapted Feinberg’s criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup> and only spindles within the first five cycles were retained. Spindles with an inter-spindle interval &gt;3 min were discarded. The previously detected SOs were used to indicate their co-occurrence with the spindle. If the spindle start occurred within the time period between negative and positive peak of any of the detected SOs, the spindle was marked as occurring on the up-phase of the slow oscillation. Assuming symmetry of the slow oscillations, if a spindle occurred within the same time-window following the positive peak or preceding the negative peak, the spindle was marked as occurring on the down-phase. If neither of these conditions were met, the spindle was marked as not co-occurring with a SO.</p><p id="P35">The single topographical variable captured hemispheric distribution, as only electrodes C3 and C4 were available for all participants. Hemisphere was coded to indicate whether the spindle was detected in the left (C3), right (C4), or both hemispheres. The co-occurrence was determined if there was any overlap within the start and end time of the spindles in both electrodes, and only leading spindles were retained for the analysis. That is, if a spindle was detected simultaneously in both electrodes, only the spindle with an earlier start was included in the analysis.</p><p id="P36">The signal directly after the spindle may be informative regarding local cortical processing, thus the next set of features described the post-spindle period of two seconds. Welch’s method was used to calculate the power spectrum of the post-spindle period and relative power with respect to the total power was extracted for the canonic frequency bands in human sleep: delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and sigma (12-16 Hz). Next, the offset and the exponent of the frequency spectra were estimated using Python <italic>fooof</italic> package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref></sup> (v. 1.0.0).

Permutation entropy was chosen due it computational efficiency and Petrosian fractal dimension as it was ranking relatively high among the features for automatic sleep stage classification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. Katz fractal dimension was calculated, as it is considered more appropriate for detecting within participant state changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref></sup> For all continuous variables, spindles +/-5 standard deviations were discarded to remove extreme outliers. Skewed variables (duration, amplitude, root mean square, relative power, number of oscillations, theta, alpha, sigma, onset to cycle, and inter-spindle interval) were log-transformed. Pearson correlation matrix was calculated across all continuous features and, of the pairs with r &gt; 0.70, only one of the features were retained. Second pruning of the feature matrix was done after initial results were obtained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials 1</xref>). These pruning steps were necessary to avoid artificially biasing the clustering algorithm towards features that conceptually capture the same phenomena, and to reduce the influence of sleep stage due to the inclusion of the post-spindle signal characteristics. However, as the post-spindle event attributes had a good a-priori explanation to be included and may reflect relevant processes for memory consolidation, we report the differences in these features between the age groups, as well as summarize the clustering results that included these variables in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials 4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>K-mean clustering</title><p id="P37">We applied a k-means clustering algorithm for mixed numeric and categorical data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref></sup>, implemented in MATLAB v2023a.

This included a custom ecological memory test. Whereas it was designed specifically to capture memory functioning in everyday activities, it has not been commonly used, is not standardized, and may add noise due to the narrative-based transcription procedure. This is partially evident in the higher scores in the delayed test, compared with the immediate, which likely derives from practice effects and higher number or items that were difficult to transcribe (deemed ‘irrelevant’ and discarded from the analysis) from the delayed narration four weeks later. In addition, we included the Everyday Memory Questionnaire, which unexpectedly indicated more subjective memory problems in the younger age group than in the older. This may be due to reporting bias or busier schedules of the younger participants with more chances for errors, indicating that this may not be the best instrument for assessing differences between groups with different lifestyles. We therefore repeated the analysis, using only the sleep gain effect, captured by the difference in memory performance after sleep, compared with the equivalent period of wakefulness. Note that this measure did not have age differences to start with. We found no significant memory effects for cluster densities and proportional distributions using this variable. Notably, the R<sup>2</sup> of all models dropped to &lt;0.07, likely since age group no longer was a significant predictor.

Although this relationship was significant at the corrected alpha level only in two clusters (N2-SO<sup>+</sup> and N2-SO<sup>-</sup>-bi), the power was highly correlated between clusters, and therefore likely reflecting spindle power and memory associations regardless of the cluster belonging. We therefore additionally predicted the sleep consolidation effect from the general spindle power (that is, averages across all participant’s spindles from 9-16 Hz) and found a significant association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>; b = -29.38, standardized beta = -0.34, p = 0.047), in which participants with higher spindle power had reduced sleep gain, when adjusted for age group differences. This relationship remained qualitatively similar if sleep gain was calculated on the forced choice test performance relative to the baseline performance (for cluster-specific models, all beta’s between -0.27 to -0.33, p-values between 0.029 to 0.064; for all spindles between 9-16 Hz, beta = -0.39, p = 0.029).

Notably, these spindles were clustered based on sleep stage, slow oscillation (SO) coupling, and hemispheric involvement (unilateral vs. bilateral). Among the older adults, there was a reduced proportion of N2 bilateral spindles, which was compensated by an increase in N2 spindles coupled with SOs. No density or proportional differences were observed in stage N3 and N2 unilateral spindles. Despite demonstrating non-random spindle heterogeneity and cluster-specific differences in spindle expression with age, the continuous variation of spindle attributes complicates the interpretation of the clusters as functionally distinct spindle types. Instead, the spindle heterogeneity better aligned with global signal differences between different NREM sleep stages.</p><sec id="S43"><title>Parsing spindle heterogeneity</title><p id="P83">The categorical attributes − sleep stage, SO concurrence, and hemisphere − defined the final clustering solution hierarchically. First, all stage N3 spindles formed a distinct group, irrespective of SO concurrence or hemispheric involvement. Next, all stage N2 spindles that coincided with SOs formed a separate cluster, regardless of hemisphere. Finally, the remaining stage N2 spindles were divided into unilateral and bilateral clusters. The latter is reminiscent of a recent clustering attempt based on whole-head topography, which identified one global and several locally expressed clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. While our approach cannot precisely determine the topographical range of these emerged clusters, the bilateral spindles demonstrate the capacity to propagate across hemispheres, at a minimum.</p><p id="P84">In addition to categorical features, spindles within each cluster significantly differed in attributes such as frequency, duration, and relative power. The bilateral stage N2 spindles were notable for having the highest frequencies and longest durations, potentially corresponding to the ‘fast spindles’ distinction in the literature. However, consistent with previous clustering work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, we observed wide frequency distributions across all clusters, including, for instance, a bimodal distribution in stage N2 unilateral spindles. N3 spindles and those in N2 coupled with SOs tended towards lower frequencies but still included a small proportion of spindles with frequencies ≥ 13 Hz, particularly in the young age group. Intriguingly, human intracranial recordings have shown narrow unimodal frequencies at each cortical location, against the backdrop of broader frequency distributions between different sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Additionally, an early simultaneous EEG and fMRI study on predefined fast and slow spindles identified several cortical differences in hemodynamic activity but found no differences in the thalamus, where spindle activity originates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref></sup>. Collectively, these observations may suggest associations between spindling frequency and their capacity to propagate across multiple sites, possibly influenced by the structural or neurochemical architecture of these sites, which changes during ageing.</p></sec><sec id="S44"><title>Differences in spindle profiles in ageing</title><p id="P85">Known age-related differences in sleep architecture and spindle attributes were well captured in our sample. Specifically, we observed reduced sleep duration, a decreased proportion of stage N3 sleep, and lower spindle frequencies and absolute amplitudes. Unlike several previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref></sup>, we found no differences in spindle densities. This discrepancy may be explained by our inclusive approach, which combined all potential spindle types into a single density measure and normalization to the durations of specific sleep stages, along with our use of data-driven clustering rather than a priori selection of spindles based on specific attributes (e.g., slow or fast spindles).</p><p id="P86">As a novel aspect, we also explored post-spindle signal attributes. Despite spindles being optimal states for cellular-level plasticity, it has been noted that highly synchronous oscillatory events typically indicate periods of low information processing capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Therefore, processes related to cortical replay may occur immediately after spindle events. We found that the global post-spindle signal dynamics differed between young and older age groups, with the older exhibiting a reduced 1/f slope of the power spectrum and decreased delta along with increased alpha and sigma frequencies. While non-linear signal complexity is typically decreased during sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref></sup> we found higher Katz fractal dimension in older adults, suggesting increased signal complexity. However, even though we extracted these values specifically after each spindle event, they were not distinguished from the broader context of the sleep stage. Therefore, the age differences in post-spindle signals possibly reflect global signal changes related to the transition between sleep stages and reduction of slow-wave sleep in ageing, rather than specific deviations in brain processing after each spindle event.</p><p id="P87">Data-driven clustering revealed novel insights into age-related changes in spindle activity. Specifically, we identified a proportional shift in older adults, characterized by a decline in bilateral stage N2 spindles and a comparative increase in N2 spindles that co-occurred with SOs. We speculate that this proportional shift was driven by a reduction in N2-SO<sup>-</sup>-bi clusters among older adults. Specifically increased proportion of N2-SO<sup>+</sup> likely reflects the reduced deep sleep power, which makes it more likely for a given epoch to be scored as N2, rather than N3 stage in older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P88">The reduction of N2-SO<sup>-</sup>-bi spindles is particularly intriguing, given the age-group-specific cluster attributes.

Additionally, a decline in frequency and power was observed among older adults across all clusters. These findings suggest that multiple mechanisms may contribute to the age-related decline of fast spindles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>: deficiencies in spindle generation or propagation mechanisms, as well as a general slowing of all spindles, including those that otherwise display cluster-concurrent spatiotemporal profiles similar to the fast spindles found in young adults.</p></sec><sec id="S45"><title>Spindle associations with age-related memory decline and sleep consolidation effect</title><p id="P89">By combining several experimental procedures with assessments of subjective everyday memory complaints, we isolated age-related variance across multiple memory instruments.

Notably, this is the same cluster that also showed age-related proportional shifts. After adjusting for age group differences, better memory in younger adults was associated with reduced proportion of N2-SO<sup>-</sup>-bi spindles, whereas older adults generally had lower proportion of those spindles. We speculate that this is reflects age-related shifts in the interdependent proportions of the N2-SO<sup>+</sup> and N2-SO<sup>-</sup>-bi spindles, where the combination of the underlying SO phase angle and the ability to propagate across cortical areas may be relevant attributes for declarative memory.</p><p id="P90">Adding complexity to these findings, we observed associations between spindle power − irrespective of cluster membership − and the sleep-dependent memory effect, despite no age differences in this measure. The negative direction of this association (higher power related to reduced sleep gain), contrasts with previous findings. However, we calculated the sleep gain effect as the difference between sleep and awake conditions (in the absence of pre-learning baseline differences). Often, the sleep consolidation effect is calculated relative to pre-sleep learning performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Given the high correlations between performance after 12 hours of sleep and wakefulness (r ≈ 0.75), this difference measure may better capture sleep’s specific impact on memory consolidation. Here, this measure was positive, indicating reduced forgetting oversleep compared to wakefulness, consistent for both younger and older age groups. The modulation of the sleep consolidation effect by age remains controversial. Some studies report no sleep-related gains in older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, while others show similar gain in younger and older age groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">103</xref></sup>. Furthermore, potential publication bias for positive effects in young adults has been noted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. In conclusion, while our results affirm potential links between sleep spindles and memory performance, there is significant heterogeneity in these associations, and they seem vulnerable to subtle variations in memory assessment procedures.</p><p id="P91">The specific phase angle of SOs at the point of maximum spindle amplitude has gained feasibility as a potential predictor of age-related memory recline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">104</xref></sup>. Overall, we replicated previous findings, in which the spindles preferably occur in the up-phase closer to the positive peak in younger adults, whereas this distribution was more spread and shifted towards the negative peak in older adults. However, our clustering results revealed some paradoxes on spindle SO-coupling and aging.</p><p id="P92">Specifically, deviant coupling and its related memory decline have only been demonstrated for fast spindles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. However, concurrent spindle and SO events are relatively rare. In our results, stage N3 spindles (with increased SO activity) and stage N2 spindles that coincided with SOs had frequency distributions skewed towards the typical range of slow spindles (&lt; 13 Hz). Additionally, aging significantly affected frequencies across all clusters, resulting in a notably reduced high-frequency peak in the probability density functions compared to the younger age group. These factors diminish the concurrence of fast spindles and SOs in aging on top of an already small baseline. In this vein, findings from a large community sample showed that only about half of individuals over 50 years of age had above-chance concurrence of SOs and sleep spindles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Thus, despite the concept of deviant SO and fast spindle phase coupling in aging being well-documented and replicated here, the rarity of these events in older adults suggests caution in interpreting this measure mechanistically. In the context of recent large-scale findings indicating that many interrelated sleep parameters similarly predict cognitive decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, it’s plausible that deviant SO-spindle coupling is an epiphenomenon reflecting a breakdown of global network dynamics, potentially driven by structural brain changes or functional alterations in deep sleep during aging. Nonetheless, as SO-spindle coupling has been associated with increased beta-amyloid burden and predicted cognitive decline at least two years in advance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">105</xref></sup>, it may still hold promise as a biomarker to detect accelerated aging and pathology risk in midlife, when the deterioration of fast spindles is only beginning to emerge.</p></sec><sec id="S46"><title>Spindle attributes are intertwined with global sleep dynamics</title><p id="P93">Our study elucidates the intricate relationship between spindle attributes and global sleep dynamics, particularly as they change with aging. The calculation of absolute spindle power is inherently influenced by the 1/f power spectrum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">106</xref></sup>, while relative spindle power tends to decrease as low frequencies in deep sleep start to dominate. The global power spectrum and the proportion of slow wave sleep shifts significantly with aging, complicating the interpretation of spindle power measurements. Additionally, the power fluctuations across the night and spindling frequency also seem to align with sleep stage transitions from light N2 towards periods with more SO until reaching stage N3, which is dominated by SOs. While some spindles exhibit unique propagation across the brain, possibly indicating specialized functions, this too appears influenced by SO dynamics that facilitate cortical travel under specific conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">107</xref></sup>. Taken together, these insights suggest that many previously noted spindle-specific attributes may be more accurately seen as manifestations of broader changes in sleep architecture with aging.</p></sec><sec id="S47"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P94">Our study has several limitations. First, although we focused our analysis on the electrodes most used in clinical polysomnography, the absence of frontal and parietal electrodes may limit our ability to distinguish between slow and fast spindles. Second, the spindle heterogeneity is likely even greater than presented here, as EEG cannot detect local spindles captured intracranially or propagation through core thalamocortical projections, which can be observed with magnetoencephalography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Third, the final clustering solution heavily depends on the initial features and the criteria used to determine the number of clusters. By including interrelated temporal features, our analysis might be biased toward sleep stage information. Therefore, it is unlikely that the resulting clusters capture spindles that are truly mechanistically and/or functionally distinct. However, the spatiotemporal clustering revealed in our analysis underscores that spindle attributes are not independent of the global spectral context. Lastly, our sample size lacks sufficient statistical power to reliably detect small memory associations, particularly across multiple features. At the same time, testing multiple interrelated measures hampers the interpretation of significance due to reduced control over type I error. This is a broader issue in the field, especially in studies comparing several spindle features in small patient groups. A recent large-scale study suggests that multiple interrelated spindle features are related to cognitive function in aging, but also to other sleep variables<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. This challenges the proposition that sleep spindles could serve as more specific biomarkers of early pathological aging than other sleep parameters.</p></sec><sec id="S48" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P95">In conclusion, our data-driven clustering approach sought to identify distinct spindle types with functional significance in relation to aging and memory decline. We identified several spatiotemporal clusters, highlighting notable age-related differences, such as a reduced proportion of stage N2 bilateral spindles and an increased proportion of N2 SO-concurrent spindles, along with a general decline in frequency and power. However, our clustering solution represents just one possible way of categorizing spindles, influenced by the initial feature set and the final choice of cluster numbers. Whereas none of the clusters emerged as a definitive predictor of memory decline in older age, the observed age differences and memory associations in the younger age group highlight the intertwined dynamics between spindle propagation, SO concurrence, and frequency shifts in ageing. Moreover, our findings emphasize the importance of considering spindle activity within the broader context of sleep architecture, recognizing their role within global network dynamics and overall sleep patterns.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS205740-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d20aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S49"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This project was funded by European Research Council to A.M.F under grant agreements no. 725025 and the Norwegian Research Council no. 325878.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Statement of significance</title></caption><p>This study used data-driven clustering to explore sleep spindles as potential markers for age-related memory decline. We identified spindle clusters determined by sleep stage, slow oscillation concurrence, and hemisphere propagation. Notably, older adults showed altered expression of these clusters, indicating age-specific dynamics. Further research should focus on distinguishing spindle deterioration from broader sleep changes in older age. Such insights could pave the way for early detection and intervention strategies in cognitive decline, highlighting sleep’s crucial role in maintaining cognitive health and resilience in aging populations. These findings hold promise for developing targeted approaches to enhance mental wellness and quality of life in older adults.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(A) Timelines of the experimental ecological and source memory tasks. The source memory experiment was admitted in two conditions, once with awake 12-hour period during the day and once during the night. In the latter condition, participants wore ambulatory polysomnography device to record sleep-EEG. The scripted part of the ecological memory task and the immediate testing were incorporated in a separate session for neuropsychological testing. (B) Experimental source memory task phases. During encoding, an item was represented with a face or a place (visually and auditorily) and participants were asked to form a mental association between the two. The vividness of the association was rated after each trial. In AFC, participants were shown each item and made to choose which face/place it was associated with. During the retrieval phase, the participants received audio-visual presentation of each item and were asked whether it had been previously associated with a face (F), place (P), they did not remember (?), or the item is new (N).
