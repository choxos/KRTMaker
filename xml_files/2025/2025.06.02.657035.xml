Although Greatwall represents a potential oncogene and prospective therapeutic target, our understanding of cellular and molecular consequences of chemical Greatwall inactivation remains limited. To address this, we introduce C-604, a highly selective Greatwall inhibitor, and characterise both immediate and long-term cellular responses to the chemical attenuation of Greatwall activity. We demonstrate that Greatwall inhibition causes systemic destabilisation of the mitotic phosphoproteome, premature mitotic exit and pleiotropic cellular pathologies. Importantly, we demonstrate that the cellular and molecular abnormalities linked to reduced Greatwall activity are specifically dependent on the B55α isoform rather than other B55 variants, underscoring PP2A-B55α phosphatases as key mediators of cytotoxic effects of Greatwall-targeting agents in human cells. Additionally, we show that sensitivity to Greatwall inhibition varies in different cell line models and that dependency on Greatwall activity reflects the balance between Greatwall and B55α expression levels. Our findings highlight Greatwall dependency as a cell-specific vulnerability and propose the B55α-to-Greatwall expression ratio as a predictive biomarker of cellular responses to Greatwall-targeted therapeutics.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Greatwall (GWL), also known as microtubule-associated serine/threonine-like (MASTL) kinase, promotes mitotic phosphorylation by suppressing PP2A-B55 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Activated during the G2 phase by Cdk1, GWL phosphorylates two highly unstructured homologous proteins, ENSA and ARPP19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Phosphorylated ENSA(S67) and ARPP19(S62) act as poor PP2A-B55 substrates and inhibit the Cdk1-counteracting PP2A-B55 complexes via an unfair competition mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The feedback loop involving Cdk1, GWL and PP2A-B55 integrates into the broader mitotic entry network and plays a crucial role in stabilising the phosphorylation of mitotic Cdk1 substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.

In addition to its canonical role as the PP2A-B55 suppressor, GWL has been implicated in the modulation of metabolic homeostasis via the mTOR and Akt pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, regulation of DNA replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, DNA damage signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and promotion of Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Beyond its fundamental cellular functions, GWL has emerged as a potential oncogene and therapeutic target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.

Depletion of GWL exhibits variable cytostatic effects in different breast cancer cell lines, indicating a therapeutic window for targeting cancer subtypes with increased GWL dependency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Three independent groups have reported the development of small molecule GWL inhibitors with variable inhibitory potential and antiproliferative effects in cancer cell line models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and mouse xenografts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. These reports, however, provide only minimal insight into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlining the cytotoxicity of GWL inhibition, leaving several key questions unanswered. What are the molecular and cellular consequences of chemically attenuated GWL activity? Are cellular phenotypes associated with GWL inhibition cell type-specific? Is the cytotoxicity of GWL inactivation purely driven by the deregulated PP2A-B55 phosphatases? And can cellular dependency on GWL activity be predicted?</p><p id="P4">In this study, we report a new highly selective GWL inhibitor, C-604, and present a comprehensive classification of cellular pathologies and phosphoproteomic changes associated with chemical GWL inactivation. We demonstrate that cytotoxic effects of GLW-targeting compounds originate from the untimely activation of PP2A-B55α phosphatases and consequential premature mitotic exit. Additionally, we characterise differential cellular dependencies on GWL activity and propose relative GWL and B55α expression levels as predictive biomarkers of sensitivity to GWL inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Development of the novel GWL kinase inhibitor C-604</title><p id="P5">To discover new small molecules interfering with GWL activity, we screened a kinase-focussed subset of the AstraZeneca compound collection in the full-length GWL (K72M) homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay. The kinase screening collection comprised around 40,000 samples of interest augmented by exemplars of kinase hingebinding motifs, literature-reported kinase actives and screening catalogue purchases (mean MW ≈ 360, mean clogP ≈ 2.8), aiming to achieve as wide a coverage of the kinome as possible. Initially, we selected potential active molecules with z-score ≤ -5 (equivalent to ca. 25% inhibition or better) and performed compound clustering followed by near-neighbour testing and determination of relevant median inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. Subsequent re-clustering based on GWL inhibitory potency, Cdk1 selectivity, broad kinome selectivity and additional known factors influencing drug developability, such as molecular weight, lipophilicity and the number of hydrogen donors and acceptors, generated six prioritised compound clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1a, b</xref>). Clusters 2, 4, and 6 exhibited poor selectivity towards Cdk1 and other kinases, disqualifying them from further drug development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1a, b</xref>). Cluster 1 (n = 421) exhibited a reasonable selectivity profile across a broad range of kinases; however, initial testing of 50 representative compounds indicated that eliminating the inhibitory activity against Cdk1 may prove challenging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1a, b</xref>). Despite the favourable kinase selectivity profile of cluster 5, we considered this series less attractive due to the limited number of compounds (n = 5) and suboptimal molecular properties for a hit, such as higher lipophilicity, lower binding efficiency (as indicated by LLE) and greater molecular weight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1a, b</xref>). Cluster 3 (n = 20) emerged as the most promising compound group, demonstrating an outstanding selectivity against Cdk1 and across a broader kinase panel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1a-c</xref>).</p><p id="P6">We selected compound 1 as the lead exemplar of cluster 3 and leveraged it as a foundation for subsequent drug development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Structure-activity relationship studies and pharmacokinetic profiling produced several derivative molecules, of which compound 21 provided the best combination of outstanding inhibitory potential, low clearance in mouse microsomes and acceptable solubility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Tables 1-3</xref>). According to the HTRF-based IC<sub>50</sub> evaluation, both stereoisomers (L, R) of compound 21 exhibited equivalent inhibitory potential (<sup>L/R</sup>IC<sub>50</sub> = 9.0 ± 7.7 nM; <sup>L</sup>IC<sub>50</sub> = 10.9 ± 2.0 nM; <sup>R</sup>IC<sub>50</sub> = 13.3 ± 6.4 nM), demonstrating that compound 21 inhibited GWL in a non-stereospecific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). This assessment was supported by structural modelling of the interaction between compound 21 and the active site of GWL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). In further support of its GWL-targeting properties, compound 21 diminished the phosphorylation of the canonical GWL substrate ENSA(S67) in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> cytostatic factor (CSF) egg extract (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Having satisfied the criteria of prospective GWL inhibitor, the racemic compound 21 was registered as UOS-00054604 and, for the remainder of the manuscript, is referred to as C-604.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Compound C-604 interferes with GWL activity and inhibits proliferation in human cells</title><p id="P7">To determine whether C-604 inhibited GWL in human cells, we measured phosphorylation levels of canonical GWL substrates ENSA(S67) and ARPP19(S62) in prometaphase-arrested HCC1395 (breast cancer), U2OS (osteosarcoma), RPE-1 (non-transformed) and HeLa (cervical cancer) cells treated with C-604. We induced prometaphase arrest by treating the cells with S-trityl-L-cysteine (STLC) for 20 h and collected mitotic cells by mitotic shake-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e, f</xref>). To minimise the impact of potential indirect effects, we analysed changes in ENSA(S67) and ARPP19(S62) phosphorylation levels 30 min after the administration of C-604 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). In all four cell line models, exposure to increasing doses of C-604 resulted in gradual dephosphorylation of ENSA(S67) and ARPP19(S62) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g, h</xref>). Compound C-604 operated with a sub-micromolar median effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>), implying an outstanding potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Importantly, estimated cellular EC<sub>50</sub> values (<sup>HCC1395</sup>EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.28 ± 0.21 μM; <sup>U2OS</sup>EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.43 ± 0.15 μM; <sup>RPE-1</sup>EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.24 ± 0.01 μM; <sup>HeLa</sup>EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.31 ± 0.20 μM) displayed only minor, statistically insignificant variations, indicating that C-604 acted consistently in different cellular models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P8">A high dose of C-604 (2 μM) demonstrated strong cytostatic properties, effectively inhibiting colony formation in RPE-1 and HeLa cells exposed to the compound for 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i, j</xref>). Interestingly, a lower concentration (0.5 μM) of C-604 partially inhibited proliferation in HeLa, but not RPE-1 cells, suggesting a possibility of cell-specific sensitivities to C-604 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i, j</xref>). A partial (c.a. 60%) knockdown of GWL by siRNAs significantly amplified the cytostatic potential of C-604 in both RPE-1 and HeLa cells, indicating a direct link between C-604-induced loss of viability and low GWL activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i, j</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2b, c</xref>). Notably, siRNA-mediated depletion of B55α, the dominant isoform of PP2A regulatory subunit B55, had the opposite effect and significantly rescued the proliferative capacity of C-604-treated RPE-1 and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i, j</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2b, c</xref>).

Our preliminary biological characterisation thus strongly suggested that C-604 inhibited GWL and displayed a strong PP2A-B55-dependent cytostatic potential in human cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Greatwall inhibitor C-604 causes pleiotropic B55α-dependent cellular pathologies</title><p id="P9">Several independent studies have demonstrated that disruption of GWL activity by genetic approaches causes defective mitotic progression with detrimental cellular consequences such as polyploidisation, cell cycle arrest, aberrant nuclear morphology and apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. To determine whether C-604 induced analogous physiological defects, we utilised high-throughput immunofluorescence microscopy combined with custom image analysis software to quantify fundamental characteristics of cell populations subjected to increasing doses of C-604. We employed a four-channel fluorescent staining procedure involving (1) immuno-labelling of α-tubulin, (2) immuno-labelling of the cell cycle inhibitor p21, (3) Click-iT-based EdU-labelling, and (4) DNA staining with Hoechst. To accurately segment cells and nuclei, we utilised the Cellpose segmentation algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and custom cell-specific segmentation models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). For each identified cell, we extracted key features, including cell area, nuclear count and intensities of DNA staining, EdU-labelling and p21 immuno-labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). An assessment of cell areas and nuclear counts provided insight into general changes in cellular and nuclear morphology. Thresholding of integrated Hoechst intensities discriminated between distinct relative states of ploidy, including 2N, 4N and polyploid 8N+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Additionally, distributions of EdU and p21 intensities allowed the identification of EdU-positive (EdU+) S-phase cells and p21-positive (p21+) quiescent or senescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To capture potential cell-specific differences in responses to C-604, we analysed a diverse panel of cell lines representative of different solid tumour types, including HCC1395, U2OS, RPE-1, and HeLa, as well as two additional breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 (MM231) and BT-549 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Consistent with the reported outcomes of genetic GWL manipulations, chronic exposure to C-604 caused pleiotropic physiological abnormalities, including polyploidisation, upregulation of p21, nuclear fragmentation and a significant increase in cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).

Following a 72-hour exposure to C-604, cancer cells, including HCC1395, U2OS, MM231, HeLa and BT-549, retained replicative proficiency and accumulated large, often multinucleated, cells with 4N or polyploid 8N+ DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).

C-604-treated cancer cells also exhibited varying levels of p21 expression; however, upregulation of this cell cycle inhibitor appeared to have a minimal impact on their replicative proficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). C-604-treated non-transformed RPE-1 cells exhibited a robust p21 upregulation, the suppression of DNA replication and the accommodation of a senescence-like cellular state with 2N or 4N DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Most C-604-treated RPE-1 cells maintained an unperturbed nuclear architecture, with only a minor proportion displaying multinucleation (up to 16%) and polyploidisation (up to 11%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, d</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Considering that all tested cancer cell lines carried genetic perturbations negatively impacting p53 function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>), we hypothesised that the fundamental differences in cellular responses to C-604 represented a direct consequence of defective p53 signalling. This premise was only partly supported by the experimental evidence, as C-604-treated RPE-1 cells lacking p53 (p53-null) showed significantly weaker induction of p21, did not fully inhibit DNA replication, but displayed only minor, statistically insignificant (p = 0.06), increase in polyploidisation frequency when compared with WT RPE-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e, f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5b, c</xref>).

To assess these differences quantitatively, we calculated Euclidean distances between proportions of different cell cycle groups (2N, S, 4N, 8N+) of control and C-604-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). To approximate cell-specific C-604 sensitivities, we represented each Euclidean C-604 response profile by its area under the curve (AUC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). The calculated AUC values varied substantially, with more than a five-fold difference between the least responsive HCC1395 and U2OS cells and the most sensitive BT-549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). The observed variation in C-604 sensitivities could not be attributed to different histological origins of tested cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>), foreshadowing the existence of other cellular mechanisms that influence the susceptibility to C-604-mediated GWL inhibition.</p><p id="P13">In agreement with the results of colony formation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i, j</xref>), reduction of GWL expression by GWL-specific siRNAs increased the general sensitivity to C-604 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).

Notably, the siRNA-mediated targeting of other B55 isoforms B55β, B55γ, and B55δ had only a minimal impact on the phenotypic outcomes of the C-604 treatment, highlighting a unique role of PP2A-B55α phosphatases in the disruption of cellular functions following GWL inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).

The absence of a rescue effect in cells transfected with B55γ-specific siRNAs was consistent with previous reports indicating that B55γ expression is restricted to brain tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Accordingly, B55γ RNA was undetectable even in cells transfected with control siRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>). These results strongly implied that C-604-induced cellular pathologies resulted from GWL inhibition and consequential de-repression of PP2A-B55α.

We reasoned that depletion of any genuine off-target would cause at least one of the three effects, including (1) full or partial recapitulation of the C-604-induced phenotypes, (2) synergy with the low (0.5 μM) dose of C-604 and (3) no further amplification or alteration of the effects caused by the high dose (2 μM) of C-604. To evaluate these hypothetical scenarios, we analysed 500 randomly selected cells from each tested population, quantifying DNA staining intensity, EdU incorporation, p21 immunolabelling intensity, cell area, and nuclear count (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8g</xref>). Then, we used the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm to project these five characteristics onto a two-dimensional space (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8g, h</xref>). Finally, for each UMAP projection, we calculated the Wasserstein distance from the UMAP representation of cells transfected with the control siRNA (siCTR) and treated with a high dose of C-604 (2 μM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8g, i</xref>). The low Wasserstein distance values indicated similarity and implied that given siRNA treatment did not alter the character of phenotypes caused by C-604. In contrast, the high Wasserstein distance values suggested phenotypic differences consequential to the lack of detectable phenotype or distinct siRNA-specific effects. UMAP representations of cell populations depleted of NUAK1, MAP3K9, MELK, ULK2, HIPK2, and CHEK1 displayed increased Wasserstein distances in untreated populations as well as in cells exposed to low (0.5 μM) and high (2 μM) doses of C-604 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8h, i</xref>). This indicated that that suppression of the suspected off-targets (1) did not replicate the effects of C-604, (2) did not synergise with the low dose (0.5 μM) of C-604, and (3) further modified phenotypes specific to the high dose (2 μM) of C-604. Notably, UMAP projections of HeLa and RPE-1 cells transfected with GWL-specific siRNAs showed the smallest Wasserstein distance values, both under normal conditions and in populations treated with low (0.5 μM) or high (2 μM) doses of C-604.

Notably, the presented results also raised important questions. First, how does C-604 compare with alternative GWL-targeting drugs?

Consistent with previous characterisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, 30 min exposure to MKI-2 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in ENSA(S67) and ARPP19(S62) phosphorylation levels (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.114 μM), indicating that MKI-2 interfered with GWL activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9a-c</xref>). To evaluate the effects of MKI-2 inhibitor on cellular physiology, we analysed phenotypes of MKI-2-treated HeLa and RPE-1 cells transfected with siRNAs targeting GWL or B55α (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9d-g</xref>). MKI-2 induced evident cellular pathologies and suppressed proliferation in both analysed cell lines at a relatively low dose (0.031 μM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9d, e</xref>). Notably, the minimum cytostatic MKI-2 dose (0.031 μM) did not impact mitotic ENSA(S67) and ARPP19(S62) phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9a-c</xref>), suggesting that the observed cytotoxicity may represent an off-target effect. In line with this assessment, 0.031 μM MKI-2 did not cause accumulation of 4N or 8N+ cells, a well-characterised consequence of low GWL activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9f, g</xref>). Instead, the minimum cytostatic dose of MKI-2 arrested RPE-1 cells in a p21-positive 2N state and induced only minor signs of polyploidisation in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9f, g</xref>). At this dose, MKI-2 caused accumulation of 4N or 8N+ cells only in cell populations transfected with GWL-specific siRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9f</xref>). At higher concentrations (0.125–2 μM), MKI-2 induced a broad range of dose-dependent phenotypes, including S-phase inhibition and accumulation of 4N or 8N+ cellular states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9f, g</xref>). Importantly, siRNA-mediated depletion of B55α did not rescue MKI-2-induced pathologies across the entire range of tested concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9d-g</xref>). The only effect of B55α-specific siRNAs was the attenuation of the elevated proportions of 4N and 8N+ cells induced by the combined action of GWL depletion and the minimal cytostatic concentration of MKI-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9f</xref>). Nonetheless, cells co-transfected with siRNAs targeting both B55α and GWL continued to exhibit pronounced proliferation defects and, in the case of RPE-1 cells, a marked upregulation of p21 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9d-g</xref>). Unlike the impacts of MKI-2, phenotypes associated with C-604 treatment, including inhibition of proliferation, accumulation of 4N or 8N+ cells and, in the case of RPE-1 cells, upregulation of p21, were entirely dependent on B55α (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9d-g</xref>). These observations indicated that, unlike the effects of C-604, the primary cytotoxicity of MKI-2 did not represent a direct consequence of GWL inhibition. Consequently, we concluded that, although MKI-2 interfered with GWL activity, its limited specificity rendered it unsuitable for the reliable assessment of cellular GWL function. Since other available GWL inhibitors lacked comprehensive biological characterisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, C-604 emerged as the only sufficiently scrutinised GWL-targeting tool compound.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Inhibition of GWL causes premature mitotic exit and cytokinetic failure</title><p id="P19">To determine the mechanistic origin(s) of long-term C-604-induced pathologies, we utilised live-cell imaging and analysed the immediate effect of C-604 in HCC1395, U2OS, MM231, RPE-1, HeLa and BT-549 cells expressing α-tubulin-GFP and H2B-mCherry. In all tested cell lines, administration of C-604 triggered premature mitotic exit, leading to mitotic slippage or defective cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). While mitotic slippage was relatively rare, cytokinetic failure represented the dominant outcome of the C-604 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The inability to resolve newborn daughters typically caused an immediate or delayed collapse into a large polyploid body with an aberrant nuclear architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Alternatively, in RPE-1 cells, incomplete cytokinesis occasionally produced sister cells connected by an extended cytoplasmic bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Exposure to C-604 also extended mitotic timing; however, prolonged mitosis did not always precede mitotic catastrophe, suggesting that changes in mitotic duration represented an accompanying phenomenon rather than the cause of observed cell division defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The occurrence of C-604-induced mitotic pathologies was dose-dependent and varied across distinct cell line models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Notably, varying frequencies of aberrant mitotic outcomes correlated with the established magnitudes of long-term C-604 effects, implying a direct link between the untimely mitotic exit and the broad spectrum of cellular defects associated with the long-term exposure to C-604 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Based on the visual inspection of generated movies, premature mitotic exit inhibited or considerably delayed subsequent mitotic commitments in HCC1395, U2OS, MM231, and RPE-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In contrast, HeLa and BT-549 cells readily attempted secondary, highly deleterious cell divisions characterised by the formation of multipolar mitotic spindles, extensive nuclear damage and further polyploidisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Intriguingly, polyploidisation events in HeLa cells infrequently involved cousin rather than sister cell fusions, further contributing to pathological genomic rearrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). To quantify the impact of defective mitotic exit on subsequent cell cycle progression, we employed a custom cell tracking software and analysed cell lineage development in C-604-treated HCC1395, RPE-1 and HeLa cells. In all three cell line models, exposure to increasing doses of C-604 gradually decreased the number of cell divisions per lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f, g</xref>). In agreement with our preliminary assessment, mitotic failure in HCC1395 and RPE-1 cells appeared to suppress further mitotic commitments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f, g, h</xref>). Notably, some C-604-treated HCC1395 and RPE-1 cells did not divide during the entire course of imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). These cells showed only subtle signs of mitotic entry, including cell rounding as well as maturation and separation of centrosomes, followed by reversal into the interphase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). In stark contrast to HCC1395 and RPE-1 cells, HeLa cells maintained proliferative capacity and underwent a series of unsuccessful divisions and cellular fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f, g, h</xref>). In agreement with our analysis of long-term C-604 effects, this sequence of futile cell cycles led to pronounced polyploidisation and deterioration of nuclear architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Overall, the live-cell imaging analysis established the premature mitotic exit and defective cytokinesis as the root causes of pleiotropic pathologies associated with C-604-mediated GWL inhibition. The cell-tracking-based assessment of cell lineage development also demonstrated that the extensive polyploidisation observed in HeLa and BT-549 cells arose from the inability to stall cell cycle progression following the defective mitotic resolution.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Inhibition of GWL destabilises mitotic phosphoproteome</title><p id="P20">To determine the molecular foundations of cellular pathologies associated with C-604-mediated GWL inhibition, we analysed the phosphoproteomes of prometaphase-arrested HeLa, HCC1395 and RPE-1 cells treated with C-604.

The most prominently represented C-604-sensitive phosphosites included the known PP2A-B55 substrates ENSA(S67) and ARPP19(S62), as well as phosphoresidues with hypothetical roles in chromosome segregation and metaphase-anaphase progression, such as TTK(S321), TPR(S379) and TOP2B(S1236) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 12c, d</xref>).

We believe the significant discrepancy between our study and other analysed datasets originates from fundamental differences in employed experimental designs and models used in these studies. While our experiments measured changes in phosphorylation levels during prometaphase following a brief (~30-minute) inhibition of GWL, the PP2A-B55 substrates identified by Cundell et al. were inferred from nocodazole-arrested HeLa cells depleted of all B55 subunits (B55α–δ) or GWL for 72 hours before sample collection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.

To uncover mechanisms underlying differences in cellular GWL dependencies, we quantified the impact of GWL inhibition on colony formation in a larger experimental panel composed of 12 distinct cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). The analysed cell line panel displayed a broad range of C-604 median effective doses (ED<sub>50</sub>), ranging from 0.09 ± 0.04 μM in the most sensitive BT-549 cells to 2.03 ± 0.48 μM in the most resistant HCC1143 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Looking for the simplest plausible explanation, we speculated that observed differences reflected varying intracellular levels of GWL, PP2A-B55α and, possibly, ENSA/ARPP19. To test this hypothesis, we correlated established C-604 ED<sub>50</sub> values with protein expression levels of GWL, B55α, PP2A catalytic subunit isoforms α and β (PPP2Cα/β) and ENSA/ARPP19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c, d</xref>). Strikingly, cellular sensitivity to GWL inhibition (represented by established C-604 ED<sub>50</sub> values) strongly correlated with GWL and B55α protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Established C-604 ED<sub>50</sub> values also correlated with expressions of PPP2Cα/β and ENSA/ARPP19, albeit to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>).</p><p id="P27">We employed linear modelling without weighting and ordinary least squares regression and established a mathematical model predicting the cellular sensitivity to GWL inhibition.

Differential upregulation of B55α was not associated with significant changes in GWL expression levels and thus represented the primary driver of predicted C-604 sensitivities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7f</xref>). To determine whether model C-604 *ED<sub>50</sub> values predicted the cellular responses to GWL inhibition, we assessed the colony formation capacity in all eleven B55α-overexpressing cell lines exposed to increasing doses of C-604 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7g, h</xref>). Our model accurately predicted cellular sensitivity to C-604-mediated GWL inhibition in WT U2OS cells and 8 out of 11 B55α-overexpressing clones, further reinforcing the potential of GWL and B55α expression levels as robust predictors of cellular GWL dependency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7i</xref>). The discrepancy between predicted and experimental GWL dependencies in 3 out of 11 B55α-overexpressing clones suggested that other factors may shape cellular sensitivity to GWL inhibition.

First, we examined the differences in median B55α and GWL expression levels in tumours and matched normal tissues. Strikingly, the combination of elevated B55α and reduced GWL expression levels, indicative of high sensitivity to GWL inhibition, did not appear in any of the 21 analysed cancer groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>). This result suggested that B55α overexpression concomitant with GWL downregulation represents a systemic feature selected against during tumour development. Next, we used GWL and B55α RNA expression levels to predict susceptibility to GWL inhibition in individual samples. Most biopsies exhibited moderate or low predicted sensitivity to GWL inhibition, with only a marginal increase in 5% of the cases with the highest projected sensitivity scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8d, e</xref>). Notably, the biopsies predicted to be most sensitive to GWL inhibition were overrepresented in kidney chromophobes (KICH) and, possibly, in low-grade glioma (LGG) and uveal melanoma (UVM) cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8f</xref>). However, due to the lack of matched normal tissue samples, we could not validate whether the over-representation of samples sensitive to GWL inhibition (by prediction) in LGG and UVM represented a relevant observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8f</xref>). Collectively, the analysis of TCGA expression data strongly indicated that the hyper-sensitivity to GWL inhibition driven by high B55α and low GWL expression levels represents a rare biological occurrence. However, since B55α and GWL are unlikely the only determinants of cellular sensitivity to GWL inhibition, further studies are required to determine the true clinical potential of chemical GWL inhibition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">The key mitotic regulator, GWL kinase, has received increasing attention as a putative oncogene and prospective chemotherapeutic target; however, our understanding of the effects of chemical GWL inactivation on fundamental cellular processes remains incomplete. This work presents a detailed classification of cellular and molecular responses to chemical suppression of GWL activity and proposes new predictive biomarkers of cellular GWL dependency.</p><p id="P32">To characterise cellular phenotypes associated with chemical GWL inactivation, we developed and validated a new tool compound, C-604, which interferes with GWL activity in prometaphase-arrested human cells and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts. We identified the potential C-604 off-targets and demonstrated that the effects of C-604 stem from inhibition of GWL rather than other kinases. Our characterisation of the alternative GWL inhibitor MKI-2 demonstrated that MKI-2 exhibits strong off-target activity, rendering C-604 the only GWL-targeting tool compound accompanied by sufficient biological characterisation.</p><p id="P33">Using live cell imaging and high-throughput immunofluorescence microscopy, we determined that GWL inhibition triggers premature mitotic exit followed by an incomplete separation or fusion of newborn daughter cells. The observed mitotic defects were highly reminiscent of the phenotypes associated with genetic GWL depletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, indicating that genetic and chemical means of GWL inhibition result in equivalent cellular consequences. Cell division defects consequential to reduced GWL activity did not cause immediate cell death but led to polyploidisation, nuclear fragmentation and a gradual increase in cell size. Notably, the impact of C-604-induced mitotic exit defects on subsequent cell cycle progression varied in different cell line models. For instance, HeLa and BT-549 cells retained proliferative potential and underwent additional cycles of defective cell divisions and fusions, leading to further physiological pathologies and pronounced genomic amplification. The long-term C-604-induced phenotypes were considerably different in untransformed RPE-1 cells, which upregulated the cell cycle inhibitor p21, suppressed DNA replication and entered a cell cycle arrest with 2N or 4N DNA content. Regardless of the long-term phenotypic outcome, C-604-induced mitotic exit defects prevented normal cellular proliferation in all analysed cell line models, strongly implying that mitotic failure represents the root cause of the cytostatic effects accompanying GWL inhibition.</p><p id="P34">Interestingly, the fundamental differences in long-term phenotypic responses to C-604 treatment did not reflect cellular p53 status and the ability to upregulate p21, suggesting the involvement of p53- and p21-independent cell cycle control. While this remains speculative, this regulation may involve the p53 family member p73, which has been shown to suppress aneuploidy and polyploidy in p53-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts through a p21-independent mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Although potential p53-independent cell cycle control responding to signs of genomic instability represents a highly relevant subject, investigation of this phenomenon did not fall into the scope of this manuscript and will be further explored in future studies.</p><p id="P35">We present substantial evidence that cellular pathologies associated with GWL inhibition stem from the cytotoxic activation of PP2A-B55α phosphatases. The depletion of B55α by siRNAs decreased the cellular dependency on GWL activity and resulted in the near-complete rescue of C-604-induced pathologies and proliferation defects. This result strongly indicated that C-604 acted on-target and interfered with the GWL/PP2A-B55 regulatory axis. Notably, cellular responses to C-604 treatment were unaffected by the depletion of other B55 isoforms (B55β, B55γ and B55δ), implying that PP2A-B55α complexes are the primary drivers of cellular susceptibility to GWL inhibition. In agreement with this assessment, an in-depth analysis of mitotic phosphoproteomes revealed that PP2A-B55α phosphatases are responsible for the majority of phosphoproteomic changes accompanying the acute loss of GWL activity. Importantly, in support of the primary mitotic role of GWL as a PP2A-B55 suppressor, we identified GWL autophosphorylation site, MASTL(T873, S878), and PP2A-B55 inhibitors ENSA(S67) and ARPP19(S62) as the only high-confidence mitotic GWL substrates. Consequently, we argue that the cytotoxic potential of GWL inhibition manifests through the dephosphorylation of canonical GWL substrates ENSA(S67) and ARPP19(S62) and the resulting de-inhibition of PP2A-B55α. We hypothesise that the untimely increase in PP2A-B55α activity triggers futile phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles, which destabilise the phosphorylation of Cdk1 substrates, functionally deteriorate cell division machinery and ultimately result in a premature mitotic exit with deleterious consequences.</p><p id="P36">Our assessment of cellular responses to C-604 treatment indicates that sensitivity to GWL inhibition differs in distinct cell line models. We identified cell-specific variations in C-604-induced proliferation defects and significant inconsistencies in the frequency of aberrant mitotic events. Additionally, we documented quantitatively and qualitatively distinct impacts of acute GWL inhibition on mitotic phosphorylation in prometaphase-arrested HCC1395, RPE-1 and HeLa cells. We demonstrated that these cell-specific discrepancies reflect differences in B55α and GWL expression levels and postulated a mathematical model predicting cellular sensitivity to GWL inhibition. We propose that a high abundance of intracellular B55α stimulates the cytotoxic potential of unscheduled mitotic PP2A-B55α activation and increases cellular dependency on the PP2A-B55-counteracting GWL activity. This model aligns with the fundamental principles of the GWL/PP2A/Cdk1 signalling circuit and highlights B55α-incorporating PP2A complexes as determinants of cellular sensitivity to GWL-targeting compounds with potential utility in oncological studies.</p><p id="P37">The functional and clinical significance of B55α in tumour development is currently unclear, with contradicting evidence suggesting oncogenic properties in pancreatic malignancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> and tumour-suppressing roles in prostate, ovarian, and breast cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. In addition to these roles, we propose that B55α determines cellular dependency on GWL activity and drives cellular susceptibility to GWL inhibition.

Consequently, the application of GWL-targeting therapeutics might be limited to a small group of tumours with uncommon genetic architecture. However, further research is required to investigate the existence of additional predictive markers and combinatorial vulnerabilities, which could enhance our understanding of the true clinical potential of GWL-targeted interventions. Ultimately, broader development and detailed characterisation of GWL-targeting compounds will be invaluable in identifying new biological roles of GWL and their functional significance in diverse physiological and disease-related contexts.</p></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S15"><title>Homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence screening</title><p id="P39">4 μL of the assay buffer (30 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween-20, 0.5 mM TCEP added at the time of use) were introduced into each well of 384-well white assay plates.

After 24 hours, transfected cells were collected by trypsinisation, diluted to a desired density and plated in a 60 mm dish, which was later processed as described in the colony formation assay protocol.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>siRNA sequences</title><table-wrap id="T1" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th align="left"
