To uncover key downstream targets of this fusion involved in cell differentiation, we combined transcriptomic profiling of EwS cell lines following <italic>EWSR1::FLI1</italic> inhibition with gene ontology analysis, a clinically annotated gene expression dataset derived from EwS patient material and network analyses. This integrative approach identified inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (<italic>cIAP1</italic>, alias <italic>BIRC2</italic>) as an EWSR1::FLI1-suppresed gene. Despite its known oncogenic role in many cancers, <italic>cIAP1</italic> showed minimal expression in EwS. Using inducible <italic>cIAP1</italic> re-expression models in EwS cells, we demonstrated that <italic>cIAP1</italic> re-expression suppresses proliferation, clonogenic growth, and 3D spheroid formation in vitro. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that low <italic>cIAP1</italic> expression enhances proliferation-related gene signatures, which are inhibited upon <italic>cIAP1</italic> re-expression. <italic>In vivo</italic> xenograft models revealed that <italic>cIAP1</italic> re-expression significantly reduces tumor growth, mitotic activity, and Ki-67 positivity, while increasing tumor necrosis and apoptosis. These findings highlight an unexpected tumor-suppressive role for <italic>cIAP1</italic> in fusion-driven sarcomas, contrasting with its pro-survival function in other cancers. Collectively, our results identify <italic>cIAP1</italic> as a prognostically relevant, EWSR1::FLI1-regulated hub whose re-expression disrupts tumor progression, offering a potential therapeutic strategy to restore tumor-suppressive pathways in EwS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ewing sarcoma</kwd><kwd>cIAP1</kwd><kwd>BIRC2</kwd><kwd>pediatric sarcoma</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Ewing sarcoma (EwS) is an aggressive pediatric cancer with dismal overall survival rates for patients with relapsed or metastatic disease (&lt;30% overall survival rates) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). It is mainly characterized by a single genetic alteration: a chromosomal translocation fusing a member of the FET (<italic>FUS, EWSR1, TAF15</italic>) family of genes with an ETS transcription factor (mainly <italic>FLI1</italic> or <italic>ERG</italic>). The encoded FET:: ETS fusion proteins (in ~85% of cases EWSR1::FLI1 and in ~10% EWSR1::ERG) act as aberrant transcription factors that deregulate a plethora of genes involved in inhibition of cell differentiation, cell-cycle regulation, cell migration and proliferation among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>).</p><p id="P3">To identify key <italic>EWSR1::ETS</italic> target genes we devised a systems biology approach where we first analyzed transcriptome profiles of eight EwS cell lines with or without shRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of <italic>EWSR1::FLI1</italic> (KD &lt;30% of baseline expression) for 96 h according to the workflow depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>. This analysis yielded a list of 1,318 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) being up- or downregulated (|log2 FC|≥0.75) after KD of <italic>EWSR1::FLI1</italic> across all cell lines. These DEGs were filtered for genes annotated with the gene ontology (GO) term ‘Regulation of Cell Differentiation’ using PantherDB, which was significantly enriched among the <italic>EWSR1::ETS</italic> regulated DEGs (<italic>P</italic>=8.77×10<sup>-10</sup>, false-discovery rate (FDR)=1.05×10<sup>-7</sup>). Using the obtained 167 DEGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), we carried out a network analysis using <italic>Cytoscape</italic> and the <italic>GeneMania</italic> plugin highlighting pathway, physical, and genetic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). To identify key hubs within this network with potential clinical relevance, we further considered those genes whose expression significantly correlated with overall survival in a cohort of 196 EwS patients with matched gene expression and clinical data (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01). This analysis resulted in 26 network hubs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), out of which the single hub with the strongest correlation with patient overall survival was cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1; alias baculoviral IAP repeat containing 2, <italic>BIRC2)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>; <italic>P</italic>=0.0001).</p><p id="P4">Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins are frequently overexpressed in cancer and contribute to therapeutic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). To explore the specific expression pattern of cIAP1 in other cancers compared to EwS, we analyzed 15 cancer entities comprising pediatric tumors and EwS morphological mimics using well-curated microarray data from a prior study of our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Interestingly, EwS ranked as the tumor entity with the lowest <italic>cIAP1</italic> expression in primary tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). To illuminate the underlying cause of this expression pattern, we re-analyzed scRNA-seq data from three EwS patient-derived xenografts (EWSR1::FLI1 expression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), and two primary cultures of mesenchymal stem cells –proposed cells of EwS origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>)–negative for EWSR1::FLI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). A comparative analysis showed a significantly lower <italic>cIAP1</italic> expression in the EwS-derived samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism between <italic>EWSR1::FLI1</italic> and <italic>cIAP1</italic>. To explore this possibility, we reanalyzed the <italic>cIAP1</italic> locus in ChIP-seq data derived from the same eight EwS cell lines as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>. Inspection of the <italic>cIAP1</italic> promoter region revealed a specific EWSR1::FLI1 binding in this region in 7/8 cell lines analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1a</xref>). This peak coincided with a H3K27ac mark that became specifically active upon inhibition of EWSR1::FLI1 in both A-673 and SK-N-MC cell lines, indicating a potential repressive activity of EWSR1::FLI1 on <italic>cIAP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1a</xref>). Further correlation analyses on a published gene expression dataset comprising 18 EwS cell lines with shRNA-mediated KD of <italic>EWSR1::FLI1/ERG</italic> for 96 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) showed that stronger EWSR1::ETS KD significantly correlated with higher <italic>cIAP1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, <italic>P</italic>=0.0183; <italic>r</italic>=0.5). Collectively, these data suggested a strong and likely direct repressive regulation of <italic>cIAP1</italic> by EWSR1::FLI1 and EWSR1::ERG.</p><p id="P5">To better understand the interplay between <italic>cIAP1</italic> and EWSR1::ETS, we generated cell line models containing a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible re-expression of <italic>cIAP1</italic> in two EwS cell lines (SK-N-MC and TC-71), which we found previously to display a high genomic and phenotypic stability contributing to reproducibility of experimental results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>, addition of DOX to the culture medium induced a median of 2.7–3.6-fold re-expression of <italic>cIAP1</italic> at the mRNA level. Consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>cIAP1</italic> may be a repressed EWSR1::ETS downstream effector, transcriptome profiling of two EwS cell lines after either KD of EWSR1::FLI1 or re-expression of <italic>cIAP1</italic> showed a highly significant (<italic>P</italic>=5.15×10<sup>-75</sup> or <italic>P</italic>=1.4×10<sup>-84</sup>) overlap of concordant DEGs supporting the idea that cIAP1 acts as a regulatory downstream hub of the fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To further investigate the consequences of <italic>cIAP1</italic> suppression in EwS, we performed transcriptome profiling coupled with gene-set enrichment and weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) of SK-N-MC and TC-71 EwS cells with/without conditional re-expression of <italic>cIAP1</italic>. These analyses demonstrated that low <italic>cIAP1</italic> levels promote the overrepresentation of gene-sets involved in cell proliferation-related signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>), which was completely abrogated by <italic>cIAP1</italic> re-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). In agreement with these results, correlation analysis of publicly available proteomic data of four EwS cell lines (including TC-71 and SK-N-MC) showed a striking overrepresentation of proliferation-related signatures being anti-correlated with cIAP1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Although <italic>cIAP1</italic> overexpression is associated with promoting cancer cell survival and therapy resistance in carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), its role in fusion-driven sarcomas is less clear. To explore the functional role(s) of <italic>cIAP1</italic> in EwS, we employed our DOX-inducible <italic>cIAP1</italic> re-expression models (SK-N-MC and TC-71). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k</xref>, <italic>cIAP1</italic> re-expression significantly reduced (<italic>P</italic>=0.0022) proliferation in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k</xref>), which was not observed in empty vector controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Moreover, long-term re-expression of <italic>cIAP1</italic> significantly inhibited the capacity for clonogenic growth in two-dimensional (2D) cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1l</xref>), and anchorage-independent spheroidal growth in 3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1m</xref>). Interestingly, when the same two EwS cell lines were engineered to conditionally re-express a <italic>cIAP1</italic> deletion mutant affecting their RING domain (ΔRING), which regulates its stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), the <italic>cIAP1</italic>-mediated inhibition on EwS clonogenic growth was reverted, suggesting that the RING domain is required to suppress the tumorigenic phenotype of EwS cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1b, c</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To investigate whether the strong <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-tumorigenic role of cIAP1 could be recapitulated in an <italic>in vivo</italic> setting, TC-71 and SK-N-MC cells with conditional re-expression of <italic>cIAP1</italic> were tested in a pre-clinical xenotransplantation mouse model. For this, each cell line was subcutaneously injected in the right flanks of immunocompromised mice, and once tumors were palpable, DOX (treatment) or sucrose (control) were delivered via the drinking water. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1n</xref>, cIAP1 re-expression significantly impaired local tumor growth in both EwS cell lines, which was mirrored by significant decrease in tumor weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1o</xref>). Ex vivo immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluation of the tumors showed that cIAP1 re-expression drastically decreased the mitotic index and Ki-67 immunopositivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1p,q</xref>). Strikingly, the xenografts showed a significant difference in tumor necrotic area (<italic>P</italic>=0.0051 or <italic>P=</italic>0.0012) and a tendency to presenting higher apoptotic indices in histological sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1r,s</xref>). Similar experiments performed with both cell lines transduced with empty control vectors exhibited no significant differences in these phenotypes upon DOX-treatment as demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). These results indicated that EWSR1::ETS-meditated downregulation of <italic>cIAP1</italic> promotes clonogenic and anchorage-independent growth as well as tumorgenicity and suppression of cell death of EwS cells.</p><p id="P9">Collectively, our data show that <italic>cIAP1</italic> is a prognostically-relevant, EWSR1::ETS-regulated network hub in EwS, and that its re-expression severely impairs tumor fitness in vitro and in vivo.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S2"><title>Provenience of cell lines and cell culture conditions</title><p id="P10">Human EwS SK-N-MC (CVCL_0530) and TC-71 (CVCL_2213) cell lines were provided by the German Collection of Microorganism and Cell Cultures (DSMZ).

Lentiviral particles were generated in HEK293T cells and used for transduction of SK-N-MC and TC-71 EwS cells using polybrene (8 μg/mL). Transduced cells were selected with 0.5 μg/mL puromycin. Re-expression of <italic>cIAP1</italic> in SK-N-MC and TC-71 cells was achieved by addition of DOX (1 μg/mL) to the culture medium. Cells were single-cell cloned and specific clones were selected and tested for re-expression of <italic>cIAP1</italic>. Only the clones exhibiting re-expression levels comparable to the expression FCs after <italic>EWSR1::FLI1</italic> silencing (see above) were selected for functional assays. Cells transfected with the empty vector were used as additional controls as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Transcriptome analyses</title><p id="P19">To assess the potential effect of <italic>cIAP1</italic> on gene expression in EwS cells, microarray analysis was performed. To this end, 1.2×10<sup>4</sup> cells per well were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with 1μg/μl DOX for 72 h (DOX-refreshment after 48 h). Thereafter, total RNA was extracted with the ReliaPrep miRNA Cell and Tissue Miniprep System (Promega) and RNA quality was assessed with a Bioanalyzer. All samples had an RNA integrity number (RIN)&gt;9 and were hybridized to Human Affymetrix Clariom D microarrays. Gene expression data were quantile normalized with Transcriptome Analysis Console (v4.0; Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the SST-RMA algorithm as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Annotation of the data was performed using the Affymetrix library for Clariom D Array (version 2, <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>) on gene level. DEGs with consistent and significant FCs across cell lines were identified as follows: Normalized gene expression signals were log2 transformed. To avoid false discovery artifacts due to the detection of only minimally expressed genes, we excluded all genes with a lower expression value than that observed for <italic>ERG</italic> of the respective cell lines (log2 expression signal of 7.08 for SK-N-MC and 6.57 for TC-71), which is known to be virtually not expressed in EWSR1::FLI1 positive EwS cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). The FCs of both <italic>cIAP1</italic> re-expressing EwS cell lines were calculated for each cell line separately. Then the FCs in the <italic>cIAP1</italic> re-expressing samples were normalized to that of the empty control cells. Then both FCs were averaged to obtain the mean FC per gene across cell lines. DEGs were determined as having a log2 FC &gt;0.5 or &lt;–0.5, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA)</title><p id="P20">To identify enriched gene-sets, genes were ranked by their expression FC between the groups DOX (−) and DOX (+).

GO terms were filtered for statistical significance (adjusted <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) and a normalized enrichment score |(NES)|&gt;2 or |(NES)|&gt;1.25 (10,000 permutations), depending on the dataset. In order to construct a network, the Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis R package (WGCNA R)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) was used. Briefly, a binary matrix of GO-terms × genes (where 1 indicates the gene is present in the GO term and 0 indicates it is not) was created. Then, the Jaccard’s distance for all possible pairs was computed to create a symmetric GO adjacent matrix. Clusters of similar GO terms were identified using dynamicTreeCut algorithm, and the top 20 % highest edges were selected for visualization. The highest scoring node in each cluster was determined as the cluster label (rName). The obtained network and nodes files were fed into Cytoscape (v 3.8.0) for network design and visualization as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Proliferation assays</title><p id="P21">For proliferation assays, 5–8×10<sup>5</sup> EwS cells per well (depending on the cell line) were seeded in triplicates per group in 6-well plates and treated with 1 μg/mL DOX for 72 h.

Once tumors of control groups nearly reached an average volume of 1,500 mm<sup>3</sup>, all mice of the experiment were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Other humane endpoints were determined as follows: Ulcerated tumors, loss of 20% body weight, constant curved or crouched body posture, bloody diarrhea or rectal prolapse, abnormal breathing, severe dehydration, visible abdominal distention, obese Body Condition Scores (BCS), apathy, and self-isolation. All tumor-bearing mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at the predefined experimental endpoint, when the mice reached a humane endpoint as listed above. After extraction of the tumors, they were weighted, and a small fraction of each tumor was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen to preserve the RNA isolation, while the remaining tumor tissue was fixed in 4 % formalin and embedded in paraffin for immunohistology.
