Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a subtype of NSCLC and is characterized by distinct molecular and genetic features. Despite significant advances in the understanding of lung cancer biology, the prognosis for patients diagnosed with LUAD remains poor, especially in advanced stages[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. The overall five-year survival rate for LUAD patients is low, making it essential to identify novel biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic targeting[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. One of the critical microenvironments influencing cancer progression, metastasis, and resistance to therapy is tumor hypoxia. Hypoxia refers to the state of low oxygen availability within the tumor, often resulting from an imbalance between the rapid growth of tumor cells and the insufficient development of blood vessels to supply oxygen[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Hypoxia is a hallmark feature of many solid tumors, including lung adenocarcinoma, and it is associated with aggressive tumor behavior, poor prognosis, and resistance to conventional therapies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The development of therapeutic strategies targeting hypoxic tumor cells remains an area of active research.</p><p id="P6">The Role of Hypoxia in Tumorigenesis Hypoxia plays a crucial role in driving various aspects of tumor biology, such as tumor angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. It activates a range of adaptive cellular responses through hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), primarily HIF-1α and HIF-2α. These transcription factors regulate the expression of genes that mediate critical processes such as angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), glycolysis, metastasis, and drug resistance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Tumor cells exposed to hypoxic conditions undergo metabolic shifts that favor anaerobic glycolysis, which allows them to survive and proliferate despite low oxygen availability. The HIF signaling pathway is essential for the regulation of genes involved in cellular survival, metabolism, and tumor progression[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Among the most well-known hypoxia-regulated genes are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose transporter proteins (e.g., GLUT1), and matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., MMPs)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. These genes promote tumor growth and metastasis by facilitating the adaptation of tumor cells to low-oxygen conditions. Additionally, hypoxia is implicated in the regulation of immune evasion and resistance to chemotherapies and radiation therapy, further complicating treatment strategies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Therefore, the identification of key hypoxia-related genes and their role in LUAD progression and prognosis is crucial for improving the clinical management of lung adenocarcinoma.</p><p id="P7">The link between hypoxia and poor prognosis in LUAD has been well established through various studies. Tumors with hypoxic regions have been shown to have a higher potential for metastasis, increased tumor aggressiveness, and reduced sensitivity to treatment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Patients with high expression levels of hypoxia-related genes often exhibit shorter overall survival and progression-free survival compared to those with low expression levels of these genes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Several studies have sought to identify specific hypoxia-related biomarkers that could serve as predictors of patient outcomes in LUAD. However, the heterogeneity of LUAD, coupled with the complexity of hypoxia-induced changes in gene expression, presents challenges in pinpointing specific prognostic genes. Additionally, the tumor microenvironment in LUAD is influenced by various factors, such as genetic mutations, immune responses, and stromal interactions, which may confound the impact of hypoxia on survival.</p><p id="P8">In this context, a comprehensive analysis of hypoxia-related genes and their potential prognostic value in LUAD is crucial. Identifying genes that are consistently associated with poor prognosis, regardless of other clinical variables, will allow for the development of better prognostic models. These models could guide personalized treatment strategies, such as targeting hypoxic regions of the tumor with hypoxia-activated prodrugs, or improving the efficacy of therapies through the modulation of the HIF pathway. To achieve this goal, we will utilize a combination of computational and statistical approaches to analyze large-scale genomic datasets.</p><p id="P9">The analysis will be conducted in a stepwise manner, beginning with a differential expression analysis to identify hypoxia-related genes that are differentially expressed in lung adenocarcinoma. Following this, functional analysis will be performed to explore the biological pathways and roles of these genes. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network will then be constructed to identify key hub genes involved in hypoxia-related interactions. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis will be conducted to assess the association between the expression of hub genes and overall survival. Univariate Cox regression analysis will evaluate the individual impact of each gene on survival, while Lasso regression will refine the list by selecting genes with non-zero coefficients, eliminating those with no significant impact. Finally, multivariate Cox regression will adjust for potential confounders, providing a more robust estimate of independent prognostic factors. This comprehensive approach aims to identify key hypoxia-related biomarkers that can be used for prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Data downloading and processing</title><p id="P10">The analysis utilized two distinct datasets: the TCGA LUAD cohort and GSE18842. The TCGA LUAD cohort comprised 517 tumor samples and 59 control samples, representing lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients and normal controls, respectively. Clinical data from this cohort were incorporated for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, univariate regression analysis, and multivariate regression analysis to investigate the relationship between gene expression and survival outcomes. For the GSE18842 dataset, which contains 46 tumor samples and 45 control samples. data normalization was performed using a log2 transformation. To account for multiple probes corresponding to individual genes, the data was averaged, resulting in a single expression value for each gene.

The LUAD dataset, consisting of 517 tumor samples, was compared with 59 normal tissue samples from TCGA, while additional data from the GSE18842 dataset, comprising 91 samples (46 tumors and 45 controls), were also incorporated. To identify DEGs between tumor and normal samples, we employed the LIMMA package, applying a stringent cutoff of |log2FC| &gt; 0.585 and an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05. Following DEG identification, we specifically targeted hypoxia-related differentially expressed genes (HRDEGs), which were selected through a Venn diagram approach. This method allowed us to cross-reference the LUAD DEGs and further refine the set of genes related to hypoxia, thus providing a focused analysis of the genes potentially involved in the tumor microenvironment’s hypoxic conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Curation of hypoxia related genes and identification of hypoxia related differentially expressed genes (HRDEGs)</title><p id="P12">To curate a comprehensive list of hypoxia-related genes, we integrated data from several established resources. First, we retrieved hypoxia-related genes from Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp">https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp</ext-link>), focusing on the following gene sets: GOBP HYPOXIA INDUCIBLE FACTOR 1ALPHA SIGNALING PATHWAY, GOBP INTRINSIC APOPTOTIC SIGNALING PATHWAY IN RESPONSE TO HYPOXIA, GOBP NEGATIVE REGULATION OF CELLULAR RESPONSE TO HYPOXIA, GOBP NEGATIVE REGULATION OF HYPOXIA INDUCED INTRINSIC APOPTOTIC SIGNALING PATHWAY,GOBP REGULATION OF CELLULAR RESPONSE TO HYPOXIA, HALLMARK HYPOXIA, and REACTOME REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION BY HYPOXIA INDUCIBLE FACTOR. We then performed a search on OMIM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/?term=HYPOXIA">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/?term=HYPOXIA</ext-link>) using the term “HYPOXIA” to identify genes associated with hypoxia-related genetic disorders. Additionally, we retrieved genes from the hsa04066: HIF-1 signaling pathway in the KEGG database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genome.jp/kegg/">https://www.genome.jp/kegg/</ext-link>).

After compiling the data from these sources, we performed deduplication to ensure that only unique genes were included.

This platform allowed us to categorize the genes into various biological contexts, such as significantly enriched KEGG pathways, biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. These functional analyses provided valuable insights into the roles and interactions of the genes in key cellular mechanisms. To assess the statistical significance of the enrichment, we applied a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of &lt; 0.05, calculated using the Benjamini–Hochberg method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], ensuring that only robust and biologically relevant findings were included.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Exploration of hub HRDEGs</title><p id="P14">We constructed Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using STRING v11.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://string-db.org/">https://string-db.org/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]). Both upregulated and downregulated genes were entered into the STRING search module to generate the interaction networks. To identify key hub genes within these networks, we utilized the cytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cytoscape.org/">https://cytoscape.org/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], which ranks genes based on their interaction degree. A medium interaction score threshold of ≥0.40 was applied to build the PPI network, and genes with an interaction degree of ≥10 were selected for further analysis. This approach enabled us to focus on the most significant hub genes, highlighting those with strong interactions relevant to lung cancer.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Exploration of survival associated hub HRDEGs</title><p id="P15">We retrieved clinical data from TCGA LUAD to perform an analysis of overall survival (OS) in relation to gene expression. Patients were categorized into two groups based on their gene expression levels, either above or below the median, and survival rates between these groups were compared. To further explore survival differences, patients were also stratified into risk groups based on their gene expression profiles. The log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were utilized to evaluate and visualize differences in survival outcomes. For a more detailed survival analysis, we used the R package “survival” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], performing both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to assess the independent effects of genes on survival. Additionally, we applied LASSO-Cox regression via the “glmnet” package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], incorporating 10-fold cross-validation to optimize the selection of penalty parameters and minimize the risk of overfitting. This comprehensive approach allowed us to identify significant survival-associated genes while controlling for potential biases and overfitting, ensuring robust and reliable findings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Result and discussion</title><sec id="S14"><title>Identification of hypoxia related differentially expressed genes (HRDEGs) in Lung adeno carcinoma</title><p id="P16">We explored differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the TCGA LUAD cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) and identified additional DEGs from the GSE18842 dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Volcano plots depicting the results of both analyses are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A and Figure 1B</xref>, respectively. These plots provide a visual representation of the relationship between fold changes (logFC) and adjusted p-values, helping to identify genes with significant differential expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Next, we compared the identified DEGs with hypoxia-related genes to determine the hypoxia-related differentially expressed genes (HRDEGs). This comparison revealed a total of 283 upregulated HRDEGs and 322 downregulated HRDEGs in LUAD, which are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-D</xref> and detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>. These findings indicate that specific hypoxia-related genes are significantly altered in LUAD, providing potential insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease.

These pathways highlight key biological processes and molecular mechanisms potentially associated with tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Notably, the cell cycle (hsa04110), biosynthesis of amino acids (hsa01230), and carbon metabolism (hsa01200) are central to cellular growth and energy production. The p53 signaling pathway (hsa04115) and cellular senescence (hsa04218) are also implicated, reflecting the regulation of cell death and aging processes. Other enriched pathways, such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (hsa00010) and HIF-1 signaling (hsa04066), suggest alterations in metabolic pathways and hypoxic responses often observed in cancer. Additionally, pathways related to cancer progression, such as central carbon metabolism in cancer (hsa05230), pathways in cancer (hsa05200), and microRNAs in cancer (hsa05206), are also prominently featured, highlighting the complex molecular interactions in cancer biology. Other enriched pathways include DNA replication (hsa03030), mismatch repair (hsa03430), and glutathione metabolism (hsa00480), which are critical for genome stability and oxidative stress responses.

These results emphasize the multifaceted nature of the upregulated genes and their involvement in various cellular functions relevant to cancer development.</p><p id="P18">The top enriched pathway, the Cell Cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), with a highly significant p-value of 4.51E-06. This pathway is critical for regulating cell division and proliferation. The genes identified within this pathway, including <italic>PCNA, MCM7, CDKN2A, PRKDC, HDAC1, CDC6, and others such as CDK4, CHEK1</italic>, and <italic>E2F3</italic>, play pivotal roles in DNA replication, cell cycle progression, and checkpoint control. These genes are integral to maintaining proper cell cycle regulation, and their upregulation suggests a potential disruption in normal cell division processes, which is commonly associated with tumorigenesis. The enrichment of these genes further underscores the importance of the cell cycle in cancer biology.</p><p id="P19">Similar to the Cell Cycle pathway, another significantly enriched pathway is the HIF-1 signaling pathway (hsa04066), with genes such as <italic>LDHA, EGLN3, SLC2A1, EIF4EBP1, PGK1, TIMP1, ENO1, ALDOA, GAPDH, PFKP</italic>, and <italic>PDK1</italic> being upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The upregulation of these genes suggests a critical role of hypoxia in lung cancer, as these genes are involved in metabolic adaptation to low oxygen conditions. This highlights the importance of hypoxia-induced signaling in promoting tumor survival and progression through altered cellular metabolism.</p><p id="P20">In addition to the upregulated genes, we observed that the downregulated genes are predominantly associated with immune-related pathways and signaling processes. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, several immune-related pathways are significantly affected, indicating a potential suppression of immune responses in lung cancer. Key pathways include the TNF signaling pathway (hsa04668), Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (hsa04060), and IL-17 signaling pathway (hsa04657), all of which play essential roles in immune activation and inflammation. Other important pathways such as Toll-like receptor signaling (hsa04620), JAK-STAT signaling (hsa04630), and Natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity (hsa04650) are also downregulated, suggesting that the immune system’s ability to recognize and eliminate cancer cells may be impaired. The statistical analysis of upregulated pathways is tabulated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>.

The results indicated that <italic>DSG2, EIF6</italic>, and <italic>EXO1</italic> emerged as independent prognostic factors. The multivariate model demonstrated a significant fit, with the following statistics: Concordance = 0.657 (SE = 0.024), Likelihood ratio test = 50.39 on 17 degrees of freedom (df), p = 4e-05, Wald test = 48.47 on 17 df (p = 7e-05), and Score (logrank) test = 48.73 on 17 df (p = 7e-05). <italic>DSG2</italic> (HR = 1.238, p = 0.012), <italic>EIF6</italic> (HR = 1.387, p = 0.046), and <italic>EXO1</italic> (HR = 1.257, p = 0.047) all have hazard ratios greater than 1, indicating that higher expression of these genes is associated with poorer survival outcomes. These results further support the robustness of <italic>DSG2, EIF6</italic>, and <italic>EXO1</italic> as key genes in the prediction of survival, making them critical targets for future therapeutic strategies and prognostic modeling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P27">In conclusion, our analysis identifies <italic>DSG2, EIF6</italic>, and <italic>EXO1</italic> as key hypoxia-related genes with significant prognostic value in lung adenocarcinoma. These genes, through their involvement in hypoxia-related pathways, may play critical roles in tumor progression and patient survival. The findings suggest that <italic>DSG2, EIF6</italic>, and <italic>EXO1</italic> could serve as potential biomarkers for predicting patient outcomes and may offer novel therapeutic targets for improving prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma. Further validation of these genes in larger cohorts and clinical settings is necessary to confirm their utility in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"

By analyzing gene expression data, this study identified 283 upregulated and 322 downregulated hypoxia-related differentially expressed genes (HRDEGs). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the upregulated genes are largely involved in cancer progression and cell signaling, while the downregulated ones are linked to immune responses. A set of key hub genes was identified through protein-protein interaction analysis. Using survival analysis tool, 17 genes significantly associated with patient outcomes in two different patient cohorts. Among these, confirmed three genes—DSG2, EIF6, and EXO1—were confirmed as independent prognostic markers. These findings suggest that these genes may serve as valuable biomarkers for predicting survival and developing targeted therapies in LUAD, offering new avenues for improving patient management in hypoxia-driven tumors.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Volcano plots and Venn diagrams depicting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and hypoxia-related differentially expressed genes (HRDEGs) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).</title><p>(A) Volcano plot of DEGs in the TCGA LUAD cohort, highlighting genes with significant changes in expression based on log fold change (logFC) and adjusted p-values.

This figure presents the results from multivariate Cox regression, highlighting <italic>DSG2, EIF6</italic>, and <italic>EXO1</italic> as independent prognostic factors. The analysis was performed on the 17 key genes identified through Lasso regression. Statistical tests, including the Likelihood Ratio Test, Wald Test, and Score Test, demonstrated that the multivariate model was statistically significant (p &lt;4e-05), indicating that these three genes are key independent predictors of survival in lung cancer patients.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207249-f012"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait"
