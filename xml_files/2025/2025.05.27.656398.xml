While occlusions of penetrating arteries and ascending veins can disrupt blood supply and homeostasis in large brain tissue regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, the impact of single capillary injury and subsequent occlusion remains understudied. Notably, capillary occlusions have been observed in patients with cerebrovascular and neurological conditions, including vascular dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, cerebral microinfarcts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, type 1 diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and Alzheimer's disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, underscoring the need for better understanding their pathophysiology. Furthermore, microvascular pathology is hypothesized to both precede and contribute to age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Multiple experimental approaches have been used to induce capillary occlusions, including vascular injection of small occlusive microbeads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and cholesterol crystals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, as well as optical methods, such as laser-induced injury and photothrombosis using Rose Bengal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. However, these approaches lack the ability to create microvascular lesions with sufficient spatiotemporal accuracy, frequently leading to extensive non-local vascular injuries. Achieving precise, single-capillary occlusion in the living mouse brain remains technically challenging, hindering efforts to explore the molecular and cellular dynamics of capillary injury and repair across the interconnected neuron-glia-vasculature network.</p><p id="P5">Here, we report the development of a new technique, termed ECgo (Endothelial Cell guided obliteration), that allows targeting of single capillaries by inducing endothelial cell (EC) damage with high spatiotemporal control. ECgo makes use of a two-photon-excitable photosensitizer (termed <italic>Ps2P),</italic> based on the Zn complex of tetraarylphthalimidoporphyrin (TAPIP), which is closely related, both structurally and spectroscopically, to the two-photon oxygen probe Oxyphor 2P developed by us previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.

The photodynamic effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) entails photoexcitation of a photosensitizer compound (Ps), usually to its lowest singlet excited state (S1), followed by a fast (pico-to-nanosecond) intersystem crossing <italic>(isc)</italic> with the formation of the Ps triplet state (T1). The T1 state is usually long-lived (microseconds), and, therefore, prior to its spontaneous deactivation (associated with rate constant <italic>k</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), it can undergo diffusional encounters and subsequent reactions with molecules in the environment. Direct interactions of the triplet with biological molecules (shown as RH in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>; damaged species shown as RH*) fall under the umbrella of reactions classified as PDT Type I (electron transfer processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>). Since both the biomolecule and the sensitizer are typically large, slowly diffusing species, this mechanism usually requires close proximity of the Ps molecule to a biological target prior to photoexcitation.</p><p id="P7">Another more common mechanism, known as PDT Type II, involves energy transfer from the Ps triplet to the ground state molecular oxygen (<sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub>), resulting in the conversion of the latter to its singlet state. Singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) is a rapidly diffusing, highly reactive species (lifetime ~3.5 ms in H<sub>2</sub>O at ambient temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>) that can readily oxidize almost any molecule in the biological milieu. Thus, contributions of Type I via direct oxidation of organic targets and Type II pathways to the overall photodamage depend on the availability of O2, with Type II being the dominant pathway under normoxic conditions.</p><p id="P8">The combination of photosensitization with two-photon (2P) excitation gives rise to a 2P photodynamic effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, whereby 2P excitation makes it possible to confine photodamage to the immediate vicinity of the laser focus, permitting targeting of microscopic regions many microns deep in the tissue. For example, 2P excitation of a popular sensitizer called Rose Bengal has been used to create targeted damage in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Porphyrins and phthalocyanines form a prominent group of photosensitizers due to their well-documented ability to generate triplet states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. However, thanks to their centrosymmetric electronic structures, regular cyclic tetrapyrroles typically possess extremely low two-photon absorption (2PA) cross-sections in the spectral region suitable for <italic>in vivo</italic> optical excitation. Much effort has been devoted over the years to the enhancement of 2PA in porphyrins and related compounds. A number of molecular systems have been developed that are able to act as efficient 2P absorbers and simultaneously singlet oxygen sensitizers. One relevant example is a porphyrin dyad with the peak 2PA cross-section (σ<sup>2</sup>) of ~17,000 GM at 920 nm (Göppert-Mayer units: 1GM = 10<sup>-50</sup> cm<sup>4</sup>s), which has been successfully used to occlude a single pial artery in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">In our previous work, we used aromatic π-extension combined with substitution by electron-withdrawing groups as a means to stabilize 2P-active <italic>gerade</italic> symmetry states (g-states) in porphyrins, creating compact, highly 2P-active porphyrinoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. The Pt(II) complex of one such porphyrin, Pt tetraarylphthalimidoporphyrin (PtTAPIP), was used to construct a high-performance two-photon oxygen probe Oxyphor 2P<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Due to the strong heavy metal-induced spin-orbit coupling, S<sub>1</sub>→T<sub>1</sub> intersystem crossing (<italic>isc</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) in Pt and Pd porphyrins is extremely fast (picoseconds), and the triplet states are formed with nearly unity efficiency. However, the same spin-orbit coupling accelerates both radiative and non-radiative decays (rate constant <italic>k</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) of the triplet (T<sub>1</sub>→S<sub>0</sub>), effectively shortening its lifetime, which varies from tens to hundreds of microseconds (ms) for e.g. Pt and Pd TAPIPs, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We reasoned that using a lighter metal, such as Zn, could be beneficial for photochemical reactions involving the triplet state (both Type I and II pathways; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) since weaker spin-orbit coupling should elongate the T1 lifetime and thus increase the probability of diffusional encounters and subsequent photochemical transformations. Importantly, Zn is still able to promote efficient S<sub>1</sub>→T<sub>1</sub> <italic>isc</italic> in porphyrins (albeit not as efficient as heavier metals) while not fully eliminating fluorescence, which is instrumental for imaging photosensitizer distributions in biological tissue.</p><p id="P11">The structure of the two-photon photosensitizer developed in this work, termed <italic>Ps2P,</italic> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>. <italic>Ps2P</italic> is ZnTAPIP modified at the periphery with eight glutamic acid residues. The electronic absorption spectrum of the parent porphyrin, recorded in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), shows a familiar pattern consisting of two narrow transitions, Q (662 nm) and B or Soret (475 nm) bands, which are bathochromically shifted compared to the respective transitions of Pt and Pd TAPIPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. The 16 carboxylate groups are able to solubilize <italic>Ps2P</italic> in aqueous media, although the corresponding absorption spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) clearly shows signs of aggregation, manifested by broadening and bathochromic shifts of the absorption bands (490 and 673 nm for B and Q bands, respectively) relative to the spectrum of the parent porphyrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P12">The 2PA spectrum of <italic>Ps2P</italic> was measured in D2O, which has significantly weaker absorption near 900-1000 nm. The key spectral feature is the transition to a strongly 2P-allowed state (λmax~1020 nm), which is reminiscent of the bands seen in the 2PA spectra of Oxyphor 2P<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> as well as of parent Pt and Pd TAPIPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. This <italic>g</italic>-symmetry state, termed Δ-state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, is forbidden for one-photon (1P) excitation, since the ground state in ZnTAPIP is also a <italic>g</italic>-state, and it is not seen in 1PA spectra. The energy of the Δ-state is below that of the 1P-allowed B (Soret) state. The strong 2PA to the blue of the Δ-peak allowed us to carry out efficient off-peak 2P photosensitization simultaneously with oxygen measurements using Oxyphor 2P without changing the laser wavelength. The 2PA maximum of Oxyphor 2P is near 960 nm, while at 1020 nm, its absorption is very low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">Both <italic>Ps2P</italic> and its parent ZnTAPIP exhibit prompt and thermally activated (E-type) delayed fluorescence (TADF). In aerated NMP, ZnTAPIP fluoresces (λ<sub>max</sub> = 665 nm) with a quantum yield (φ<sub>fl</sub>) of 0.14, showing a clear single-exponential fluorescence decay (τ<sub>fl</sub> = 1.81 ns). Upon deoxygenation, the fluorescence quantum yield rises up to 0.46, and an additional band emerges (λ<sub>max</sub> = 806 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, inset), which corresponds to T<sub>1</sub>→S<sub>0</sub> phosphorescence (ϕ<sub>phos</sub>~0.015). The triplet lifetime obtained from either TADF (665 nm, S<sub>1</sub>→S<sub>0</sub>) or phosphorescence (806 nm, T<sub>1</sub>→S<sub>0</sub>) decays was found to be ~9.4 ms, suggesting that the triplet of ZnTAPIP is efficiently quenched by O<sub>2</sub>. Indeed, no traces of the emission could be detected in air-saturated solutions.</p><p id="P14">The fluorescence quantum yield of <italic>Ps2P</italic> in aerated PBS was found to be reduced to 0.02, and the emission decay, which became profoundly non-single exponential, was considerably shortened (<italic>τ</italic><sub>av</sub> = 0.66 ns, λ<sub>max</sub> = 695 nm). The reduction in fluorescence is likely caused in part by aggregation. Indeed, upon dissolving <italic>Ps2P</italic> in PBS containing bovine serum albumin (BSA; 4% by mass concentration), the spectral bands sharpened over time, and the fluorescence quantum yield increases by more than 3-fold, reaching ~0.07, showing that BSA helps to prevent the aggregation of <italic>Ps2P</italic> and suggesting that in the blood <italic>Ps2P</italic> is predominantly bound to albumin and/or other hydrophobic/amphiphilic components.

While the phosphorescence of the <italic>Ps2P</italic> band could not be detected explicitly, the long-lived decay is most certainly a signature of its triplet state, which gives rise to the delayed fluorescence <italic>via</italic> reverse intersystem crossing (T<sub>1</sub>→S<sub>1</sub>).</p><p id="P16">To verify that <italic>Ps2P</italic> is capable of a Type II photodynamic action, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> emission was recorded upon irradiation of a <italic>Ps2P</italic> solution at 475 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).

To visualize the vascular network, we first intravenously injected the dye Texas Red-dextran (70 kDa, 2.5% in NaCl). Blood vessels were mapped through the cranial window at successive depths in the cortex, and the resulting images were used to construct a maximum intensity projection (MIP) image. Using the MIP image, several capillaries were selected for targeted occlusion based on their diameter (3-6 μm) and the depth from the surface (50-200 μm). In order to induce localized injury, <italic>Ps2P</italic> was injected intravenously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) through a tail vein catheter (3 mg/ml PBS; estimated blood concentration 30 μM, assumed blood amount 0.078 ml/g body weight) and 2P-excited by scanning the laser focus along the vessel midline of a selected capillary (2-3 μm-long line, average power 30 mW under the objective, 960 nm), until blood flow ceased. Red blood cell (RBC) velocity (V<sub>RBC</sub>) in the capillary was measured before and after the irradiation scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). The first indication of the injury was detected as a slow-down and subsequent cessation of RBC passage through the capillary, occurring on average ~60 s after the start of irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-C</xref>).</p><p id="P18">In the absence of <italic>Ps2P</italic> or other dyes, even prolonged irradiation (300 s; other irradiation parameters unchanged) did not lead to capillary occlusion and/or injury, as verified by label-free imaging using third-harmonic generation (THG) imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Similarly, irradiation in the presence of conventional intravascular dyes, e.g., Texas Red-dextran (2.5% in NaCl; 70 kDa), FITC dextran (2.5% in NaCl; 70 kDa), or quantum dot-based vascular dye (Qtracker655™; 2 μM), under identical conditions (300 s, 30 mW under the objective, 960 nm), resulted neither in a reduction in V<sub>RBC</sub> nor in capillary stalling (25 capillaries tested; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). At the same time, induction of photothrombotic occlusion using Rose Bengal under comparable conditions (30 mW under the objective, 720 nm) led to a dramatic capillary insult, manifested by vessel rupture and leakage of the blood plasma and dye into the parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). This is in stark contrast to occlusions using <italic>Ps2P</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C-D</xref>), where the injury could be induced with high precision without vessel rupture.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Irradiation in the Presence of <italic>Ps2P</italic> Leads to Blood Flow Stalling and EC Injury, but Not Clot Formation</title><p id="P19">Next, we sought to gain insight into the mechanism behind capillary blood flow stalls induced by photodynamic treatment using <italic>Ps2P.</italic> Vascular occlusions are commonly driven by (i) thrombus formation, particularly in large vessels, or (ii) stalling of blood cells in brain capillaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. First, we tested whether capillaries irradiated in the presence of <italic>Ps2P</italic> showed signs of platelet activation or fibrin aggregation. Animals were pretreated with anticoagulants, such as aspirin, heparin, or clopidogrel, before irradiation. Capillary occlusion occurred in 90% of aspirin-, 94% of heparin-, and 100% of clopidogrel-treated capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). Furthermore, we tested whether a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), an FDA-approved reperfusion drug, injected 30 min after the occlusion, could restore blood flow. In all cases, rtPA did not lead to capillary recanalization, confirming that capillary stalls in our model are not due to fibrin-driven intravascular clot formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-B</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Next, we tested whether capillary stalls were caused by a specific type of transiting cells. Leukocytes, platelets, and red blood cells (RBCs) were labeled using well-established cellular markers Rhodamine 6G, Hoechst 33342, and Alexa Fluor 488 TER-119 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Leukocytes exhibited dual staining with Rhodamine 6G and Hoechst 33342<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>; platelets were stained with Rhodamine 6G only, and RBCs were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 TER-119. In addition, Texas Red-dextran was injected to label the blood plasma. Subsequent capillary irradiation in the presence of <italic>Ps2P</italic> led to clogging of capillaries by individual cells, including leukocytes, RBCs, or platelets. However, the stalling cells were random, and no specific cell type could be identified as the cause of the occlusion.

Within the examined two-dimensional circular region (50 μm in diameter) surrounding the occlusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>), mean tissue pO<sub>2</sub> decreased by 26.6% (from 29.1 mmHg to 21.4 mmHg) immediately after the occlusion but returned to the baseline level within 24-48 h upon blood flow recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Notably, the observed pO<sub>2</sub> drop did not reach hypoxic levels (&lt;10 mmHg), indicating that the surrounding microvascular network was able to compensate for the local damage and maintain oxygen delivery to tissue.</p><p id="P25">Next, we examined how the occlusion of a single capillary impacts hemodynamics in the surrounding capillary network. A selected capillary was irradiated, and V<sub>RBC</sub> was measured in the adjacent capillaries. Following the occlusion, the direction of blood flow changed such that the flow in one of the feeding capillaries, located upstream from the occluded capillary, increased (capillary 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). The analysis of the flow in the wider capillary network surrounding the occlusion revealed that overall V<sub>RBC</sub> in the affected area increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>), suggesting that upon a single capillary occlusion, the collateral flow compensates for the local perfusion deficit. Importantly, our data show that while blood flow ceased in the targeted capillary, neighboring vessels remained patent, highlighting the robustness of the cortical capillary network and suggesting the presence of a mechanism that signals the adjacent network to compensate for single capillary occlusion.</p><p id="P26">Local microglial cells are known to react rapidly to local cell damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.

This microglial activation was seen both in cells directly next to the occluded capillary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>) and in nearby microglia that were not in direct contact with it, suggesting that local inflammatory signaling occurs in response to EC injury.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">Here, we have introduced a new porphyrin-based photosensitizer, <italic>Ps2P,</italic> and demonstrated its use for induction of single-EC injury and capillary occlusion in the living brain under 2P excitation, an approach we termed ECgo. Compared to methods employing conventional photosensitizers, ECgo is characterized by greater precision, lower off-target damage, and overall, appears to have broader applicability for longitudinal studies of microvascular dysfunction. The most important feature of ECgo is that it allows for a highly accurate single capillary occlusion, avoiding vessel rupture and collateral damage to neighboring vessels and tissue. Interestingly, we report that the damaged capillaries undergo fast repair and regain blood flow within 24-48 h after injury. Detailed investigation of this remarkable endothelial repair is the focus of a separate study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Thus, ECgo provides a new, useful tool for studying the effects of single capillary injury on local blood flow, oxygenation, and neuroinflammatory responses.</p><p id="P28">Photodynamic methods have been used previously to create capillary occlusions. Perhaps the most known photosensitizer is Rose Bengal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, which is widely used for producing large vessel occlusions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. However, the use of Rose Bengal is associated with thrombosis and is often followed by vessel rupture even upon focused 2P-excitation of the sensitizer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. In contrast, occlusion with <italic>Ps2P</italic> did not lead to thrombosis or cause rupture. In fact, our results indicate that the injury could be localized to the endothelium, such that the passage of blood cells was impeded. In our hands, using the photosensitizer Rose Bengal, it was not possible to create such precise single-capillary injuries. In this regard, a pertinent question arises: what properties of <italic>Ps2P</italic> are responsible for its unique ability to induce such a precise single EC injury? A separate study would be required to delineate the exact mechanism of action of <italic>Ps2P;</italic> however, its relatively large aromatic structure and resulting hydrophobicity suggest that it could be partially distributed into the membranes and/or interiors of ECs that make up capillary walls. This contrasts with smaller, more hydrophilic sensitizers (e.g., Rose Bengal), which are presumably localized to the vascular lumen. Once associated with an EC and subjected to 2P excitation, <italic>Ps2P</italic> can operate <italic>via</italic> Type I and/or Type II photodynamic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), leading to selective destruction of the targeted cell. Importantly, the excitation volume in which the triplet state of <italic>Ps2P</italic> is produced and engages in subsequent photochemistry can be adjusted by regulating the photon flux<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, such that at mild excitation fluxes, the damage can be confined to a single EC. On the other hand, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generated by <italic>Ps2P</italic> within the capillary lumen is expected to be scavenged by albumin molecules, to which <italic>Ps2P</italic> is likely to be bound. These partially damaged albumin molecules would be carried away and dispersed by the blood flow, not leading to the formation of a clot. The above scenario is speculative at this point, but it suggests one potentially testable hypothesis behind the highly selective action of <italic>Ps2P</italic>.</p><p id="P29">Capillary stalls are common in many cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, the development of reliable and precise techniques for inducing targeted single-capillary stalls in the rodent brain has remained an unmet challenge.

However, such methods do not permit targeting of a single capillary in a pre-selected location. In contrast, the two-photon photodynamic approach using <italic>Ps2P</italic> makes it possible to induce occlusions one at a time at desired cortical depths while avoiding widespread clot formation and/or systemic vascular damage. These properties constitute a distinct advantage of ECgo compared to conventional methods.</p><p id="P30">From a hemodynamic point of view, single capillary occlusions have been previously modeled <italic>in silico</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, demonstrating that changes in local capillary flow depend on baseline flow and local capillary network topology. Occlusion of a capillary segment with two inlet and two outlet vessels has the most severe impact on local tissue perfusion. In that case, blood flow is reduced by more than 30% in capillaries located within two branching orders from the occlusion site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Our current experimental results are in line with these modeling studies, showing that a single capillary occlusion causes redistribution of flow, suggesting that oxygen delivery is compensated by the local microvascular network. Indeed, while occlusion of a single capillary led to a drop in tissue oxygenation in the area surrounding the capillary, pO<sub>2</sub> did not reach hypoxic levels. However, occlusion of multiple capillaries could cause local hypoxic regions, resulting in tissue damage.

For rtPA (Human t-PA; Actilyse; Boehringer Ingelheim) administration, intravenous injection via the tail vein was performed post-irradiation (10 mg/kg; 10% bolus; 90% perfusion; i.v.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. After starting the rtPA infusion, the targeted vasculature was monitored for at least 125 min to assess recanalization.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title><italic>In Vivo</italic> Staining of Blood Cells</title><p id="P50">Cells within blood vessels were identified based on their morphology and staining patterns using Rhodamine 6G and Hoechst 33342. Blockages caused by red blood cells (RBCs) appeared as dark, hollow areas, while platelets were observed as clusters of small green particles. Neutrophils were the only cells that exhibited double staining with Rhodamine 6G and Hoechst 33342<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Photothrombosis using Rose Bengal</title><p id="P51">Rose Bengal (100 μl, i.v., 20 mg/ml in saline; Thermo Fisher Scientific, A17053) was injected via a tail vein catheter. The dye was then photoactivated by performing line scans along the midline of the target vessel at an excitation wavelength of 720 nm and a power of 30 mW (measured under the objective) until blood flow ceased.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Behavioral Training for Awake Two-Photon Imaging</title><p id="P52">Training for awake imaging started once the animals had fully recovered from the craniotomy. The animals were familiarized with the experimenter and the head fixation procedure. By gradually increasing the fixation time over several days, animals became accustomed to the head fixation. Once animals were comfortable with the head fixation procedure, a water deprivation paradigm was introduced. In this paradigm, animals only received water droplets from a spout while remaining still for a specific duration. This training aimed to encourage animals to sit still during the experimental oxygen measurements, minimizing movement-induced artifacts. Most animals learned to tolerate head fixation without movement, eliminating the necessity for the water deprivation paradigm during the actual experimental imaging session.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>pO<sub>2</sub> Measurements in Awake Animals</title><p id="P53">Animals trained for awake imaging were briefly anesthetized with 1.5-2% isoflurane on the baseline imaging day to inject Oxyphor 2P (10 μl, initial conc. 1.2 mM) via the cisterna magna according to a previously described protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. While under anesthesia, 50 μl of 70 kDa Texas Red dextran or QTracker655TM was additionally injected via the tail vein. Oxyphor 2P remained in the brain tissue for several days, allowing consecutive imaging sessions without needing probe reinjection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. After cisterna magna injection, animals were allowed to recover for a minimum of 30 min before the awake imaging started. pO<sub>2</sub> measurements were performed on 4 consecutive days (pre-irradiation, post-irradiation, 24 h post, 48 h post).</p><p id="P54">A 28 × 28 point grid was positioned over the region of interest and centered on the capillary of interest. Each point in the grid was excited at 960 nm for 10 μs, and the emitted phosphorescent signal was collected for 260 μs. One excitation-collection cycle had a total duration of 270 μs, and each cycle was repeated 300 times before moving to the next point in the grid. The entire grid measuring cycle was repeated 12 times, resulting in the collection of 2600 decay points used to calculate absolute O<sub>2</sub> values throughout the grid. To account for the cooling effect of two-photon imaging through a chronic cranial window using a water immersion objective, absolute pO<sub>2</sub> values were calculated based on a brain temperature of 34.5 °C. A more detailed description of O<sub>2</sub> data extraction and calculation can be found in previous publications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Imaging Data Analysis</title><p id="P55">All two-photon imaging data were processed using FIJI (ImageJ 2.1.0). The individual imaging channels were merged, and maximum intensity projections were generated following the specifications outlined in the figure legend. For images that were not quantitative, gamma values were adjusted non-linearly to enhance the visibility of low-intensity structures. Graphical illustrations were created using Affinity Designer (Serif Europe, UK) and Biorender (Biorender, Toronto, Canada).</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="P56">Quantitative datasets were managed in Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA), while statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 10.0; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). The statistical tests applied, along with the number of animals (N) and capillaries (n), are detailed in the figure legends. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). The D'Agostino-Pearson omnibus normality test was used to assess data distribution. For datasets that were found to be normally distributed, an unpaired or paired Student's t-test was used to compare two groups. Non-normally distributed data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. Comparisons involving three groups were assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) or, for non-parametric data, the Kruskal-Wallis test (unpaired data) or the Friedman test (paired data), with Dunn's test applied for multiple comparisons.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS206073-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d122aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the past and present laboratory members for their contributions to this project.

Statement</title></caption><p>Brain capillary injury is a common feature of aging and many neurological disorders. While a single capillary lesion may appear inconsequential, the cumulative effect of repeated and spatially dispersed capillary insults can lead to substantial brain dysfunction. Understanding how single capillary injuries contribute cumulatively to long-term brain damage requires tools that can precisely target individual capillaries in the living brain. Here, we introduce an optical method that uses a new light-activatable compound to selectively injure single brain capillaries with high spatial accuracy. Our method enables detailed, longitudinal studies of capillary repair, blood flow recovery, local oxygen dynamics, and glial responses following microvascular injury.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>(A)</bold> Energy diagram showing one-photon (<italic>hω</italic><sub>1</sub>) excitation of a photosensitizer to its lowest excited singlet state (S<sub>1</sub>), followed by intersystem crossing (<italic>isc</italic>) to the triplet state (T<sub>1</sub>), which reacts with biomolecules (RH) directly (Type I PDT), or sensitizes molecular oxygen, which subsequently reacts with biomolecules (Type II PDT), causing their damage.
