Annual plants can bridge this period as a seed and sprout once conditions are more favorable for growth. Perennials require a developmental strategy in order to survive the adverse conditions until the next growing season. Typically, this strategy consists of a period of reduced or halted growth, referred to as dormancy, to protect meristematic tissues from harsh conditions.</p><p id="P3">In cultivated strawberry (<italic>Fragaria</italic> x <italic>ananassa</italic> Duch.) and its wild ancestor woodland strawberry (<italic>F. vesca</italic>), induction of winter dormancy does not lead to cessation of meristem growth. This has prompted the term semi-dormancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Between the summer and winter, leaf development changes, resulting in a different phenotype. Winter leaves are smaller, thicker, have shorter petioles, and contain more chlorophyll per unit area than their summer counterparts, giving semi-dormant plants a stunted appearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The difference in phenotype between the summer and winter is known as seasonal dimorphism. These adaptations allow winter leaves to survive the winter cold and drought, whereas summer leaves senesce in sufficiently cold temperatures. The development of winter-hardy leaves allows for photosynthesis in the autumn and mild winter conditions, extending the growing season.</p><p id="P4">The induction of semi-dormancy is a quantitative process, which, simultaneously with flower initiation, occurs under short day conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Similar to many species which exhibit a form of winter-dormancy, exposure to cold breaks semi-dormancy and reverts vegetative growth to the summer phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Interestingly, exposure to sufficient amounts of chilling results in inhibition of subsequent flower initiation, which prevents induction of generative meristem under exposure to short photoperiod in early spring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The transition from annuals to perennials in Rosaceous plants is speculated to have been facilitated by the diversification of SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), a protein family of MADS-box transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. DORMANCY ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX (DAM), a subfamily of the SVP family, was first described after a knock-out of several <italic>DAM</italic> genes was found to be responsible for the naturally occurring peach (<italic>Prunus persica</italic>) <italic>evergrowing</italic> mutant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. This mutant does not exhibit winter dormancy and retains activity of terminal buds when exposed to conditions which are normally dormancy-inductive. Several genes have been identified in strawberry as homologs of the peach <italic>DAM</italic> genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Previously, we showed that <italic>DAM3</italic> and <italic>DAM4</italic> are up- and downregulated in strawberry plants when exposed to short day conditions and chilling respectively, alluding to their role as dormancy regulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. We also found potential differential expression of <italic>DAM1</italic> and <italic>DAM2</italic> between summer leaves and winter leaves. Two cultivars with different chill requirements were included in this previous work, but no clear difference in <italic>DAM</italic> expression was found between them.</p><p id="P6">Based on our earlier findings, we hypothesize that <italic>DAM3</italic> and <italic>DAM4</italic> expression correlates negatively with vegetative growth during endodormancy induction and breaking. We hypothesize that there is no correlation between the chill requirement of different cultivars and <italic>DAM3</italic> and <italic>DAM4</italic> expression. Lastly, we hypothesize that with increased accumulation of chilling hours, the expression of <italic>DAM1</italic> and <italic>DAM2</italic> increases in summer leaves compared to winter leaves.</p><p id="P7">The endodormancy status of the plants was not considered in the analysis of the previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In the current work, we aim to examine the correlation between vegetative growth as influenced by the endodormancy status of the plant, and <italic>DAM3</italic> and <italic>DAM4</italic> expression. We also explore the relationship between the chill requirement of a cultivar and the expression of <italic>DAM3</italic> and <italic>DAM4</italic>. Lastly, we wanted to find out whether there is differential expression of any of the <italic>DAM</italic> genes between concurrently growing winter and summer leaves. To this end, four strawberry cultivars were grown in a greenhouse under controlled conditions, designed to induce, inhibit or break endodormancy. Plant morphology and <italic>DAM</italic> expression were measured and analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Plant material</title><p id="P8">Four seasonal flowering strawberry (<italic>F. ananassa</italic>) cultivars with different chill requirements from breeding company Fresh Forward (Huissen, The Netherlands) were used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

Short day and far-red extended treatments took place in the same greenhouse. Opaque plastic sheets reaching from the ceiling to the floor were hung around the far-red extended treatment to create two compartments and prevent light pollution.

The far-red extended treatment was included to show that the changes in plant morphology, physiology and gene expression in the induction phase were caused by exposure to short day conditions, thereby excluding other factors, such as plant age or ambient temperature.</p><p id="P34">We observed a decrease in petiole length and leaf area of newly grown leaves during the dormancy induction phase in plants exposed to short day conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-D</xref>). This decrease in vegetative growth is consistent with the induction of semi-dormancy and the transition to the winter morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Although slightly delayed, the decrease in vegetative growth of plants in far-red extended conditions was comparable to that of the plants in short day conditions. This is corroborated by the decrease in runner formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G, H</xref>), the increase in flower emergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), and the increase in crowns and generative meristem during the induction phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B, C</xref>), which were observed in both growing conditions. Together, these results point to a short day developmental response which is linked to the induction of semi-dormancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P35">Besides short day conditions, generative development in strawberry can be induced by exposure to sufficiently low temperatures, which overrides the photoperiodic effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. However, in <italic>F. ananassa</italic> cultivar Korona, a 16 hour photoperiod was reported not to result in generative growth at a day temperature of 12°C, and ‘Elsanta’ plants in long day conditions did not flower after being exposed to 9°C for over a month<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In our experiment, average daily temperatures (combining day and night) of 13°C or lower did not occur until October 25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Meristem analysis showed that flower initiation in both conditions had already occurred by October 24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). It is therefore more likely that the daylength extension with far-red was not sufficient to elicit a long day response of the plants, rather than that low temperatures induced generative growth. Lamps emitting a mixture of white, red, and far-red light were used for extension of the photoperiod. A potential reason that a long day response was not observed in the plants in these conditions is that the light intensity of the day length extension was too low to elicit this response.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Chilling broke endodormancy during the breaking phase</title><p id="P36">During the dormancy breaking phase, extended exposure to cold temperatures, restored petiole length and leaf area to levels similar to the start of the experiment, indicating endodormancy breaking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-D</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Although, similar to the induction, the breaking of semi-dormancy shows a quantitative response, this response only initiated after an initial accumulation of 336 to 552 chill hours. Below this amount, there were no or only minimal effects of chilling on plant morphology. We also observed gradually decreasing chlorophyll content in the leaves of plants that received the chilling treatment, compared to those in the far-red extended treatment, consistent with the transition of winter morphology to summer morphology that accompanies the breaking of endodormancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title><italic>DAM3</italic> and <italic>DAM4</italic> are downregulated by chilling</title><p id="P37">Chilling reduced <italic>DAM3</italic> and <italic>DAM4</italic> expression during the breaking phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). The expression levels did not change or even increased in plants in far-red extended conditions. The drop in <italic>DAM3</italic> and <italic>DAM4</italic> expression after accumulation of more than 552 chill hours, and the concurrent increase in vegetative growth, coincides with accumulated amount of chill hours after which flower initiation under short day conditions is no longer possible (T. van Dijk, Fresh Forward, personal communication). This suggests that high expression of <italic>DAM3</italic> and/or <italic>DAM4</italic> may be a requirement for flower initiation. A similar effect was described by Sønsteby and Heide (2006), who reported that avoidance of the winter morphology, by exposing the plants to temperatures of 6°C or lower while in short day conditions, simultaneously inhibited flower initiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. These results suggest that <italic>DAM3</italic> and <italic>DAM4</italic> do not only regulate winter morphology, but rather act as a switch between vegetative and generative development. In peach, a natural knock-out of several <italic>DAM</italic> genes resulted in an <italic>evergrowing</italic> phenotype which maintained bud growth in conditions that are otherwise inductive for endodormancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.

The higher variability in ambient temperature during the induction phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), may explain the lack of correlation between <italic>DAM</italic> expression and vegetative growth in this phase of the experiment. This suggests that the effect of temperature on vegetative growth overrides that of <italic>DAM</italic> expression. Moreover, is it possible that the decreased correlation between <italic>DAM</italic> expression and vegetative growth during the induction phase has a plant developmental reason, but this cannot be inferred from the current dataset. In the dormancy breaking phase, the high significance and R-squared values of <italic>DAM4</italic> compared to <italic>DAM3</italic> indicate that <italic>DAM4</italic> expression is a better predictor of vegetative growth than <italic>DAM3</italic> expression.

We found differences between cultivars in peak expression of <italic>DAM3</italic> and <italic>DAM4</italic> during the dormancy induction phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). However, these differences did not correlate with the chill requirement of the cultivars. In addition, the differences in expression were not consistent between the two genes. We also did not observe differences in the rate of gene up- or downregulation during induction and breaking respectively. Taken together, the data suggest that the chill requirement is not a function of <italic>DAM3</italic> or <italic>DAM4</italic> expression.</p><p id="P40">The cultivar ‘Fandango’ is reported to need fewer chilling hours than the cultivar ‘Elsanta’, which is why they are referred to as low-chill and high-chill cultivars respectively. However, morphological measurements as well as gene expression analysis suggest that both cultivars require in excess of 552 hours at 2°C to substantially reduce <italic>DAM</italic> expression and increase vegetative growth. We found that for a certain amount of exposure to short days or chilling, ‘Fandango’ plants always had larger leaves and longer petioles than ‘Elsanta’ plants. For example: after accumulation of 336 chilling hours, the petiole length of ‘Fandango’ was 9.9 cm; after chilling for 888 hours, the petiole length of ‘Elsanta’ was only 9.1 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-B</xref>). Without the context of how vegetative growth behaves at different amounts of chilling, ‘Fandango’ plants appear to need less cold exposure to break endodormancy, while in reality ‘Fandango’ has increased vegetative growth (at least pertaining to petiole length and leaf area) compared to ‘Elsanta’, regardless of dormancy status. Our findings suggest that both cultivars require over 552 hours of chilling exposure to break endodormancy, and around 1296 hours to fully restore vegetative growth.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>No difference in <italic>DAM</italic> expression was found between winter and summer leaves</title><p id="P41">In an earlier work, differential expression of <italic>DAM1</italic> and <italic>DAM2</italic> was found between summer and winter leaves after five weeks of forcing (at 1140 accumulated chill hours), suggesting a role for these genes in the developmental regulation of these leaf types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In the current study we expanded on this analysis by including multiple time points with increasing amounts of accumulated chilling hours. Because increasing the amount of chilling hours leads to increased morphological differences between the leaf types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, breaking phase), we would expect the difference in gene expression between these leaf types to increase concurrently. However, in the current study no such differences were found. The relative expression of <italic>DAM1</italic> and <italic>DAM2</italic> fluctuated, which resulted in differential expression between winter and summer leaves at some time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>), which may explain the preliminary results.</p><p id="P42"><italic>DAM4</italic> expression in ‘Elsanta’ was found to be consistently lower in summer leaves compared to winter leaves.

The pattern of expression over time was found to be highly similar between leaf types for <italic>DAM3</italic> and <italic>DAM4</italic>, which suggests that any leaf type can be used to comment on <italic>DAM</italic> expression in the leaves of the plant as a whole.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S30" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P43">We conclude that the expression of <italic>DAM3</italic> and <italic>DAM4</italic> negatively correlates with vegetative growth during the breaking of endodormancy.

The chill requirement of strawberry cultivars does not correlate with <italic>DAM3</italic> or <italic>DAM4</italic> expression level or pattern, and likely is a measure of vegetative growth independent from dormancy status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS207285-supplement-Supplemental_figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d17aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S31"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research is part of the TTW Perspectief programme “Sky High”, which is supported by AMS Institute, Bayer, Bosman van Zaal, Certhon, Fresh Forward, Grodan, Growy, Own Greens/Vitroplus, Priva, Signify, Solynta, Unilever, van Bergen Kolpa Architects, and the Dutch Research Council (NWO).</p></ack><sec id="S32" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p id="P44">The morphological, physiological and flowering data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), meristem data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>), and gene expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) are publicly available in the figshare repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28981544">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28981544</ext-link>.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kurokura</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Mimida</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Battey</surname><given-names>NH</given-names></name><name><surname>Hytönen</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The regulation of seasonal flowering in the Rosaceae</article-title><source>Journal of Experimental Botany</source><year>2013</year><volume>64</volume><fpage>4131</fpage><lpage>4141</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23929655</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sønsteby</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Heide</surname><given-names>OM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dormancy relations and flowering of the strawberry cultivars Korona and ‘Elsanta’ as influenced by photoperiod and temperature</article-title><source>Scientia Horticulturae</source><year>2006</year><volume>110</volume><fpage>57</fpage><lpage>67</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="R3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Åström</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Metsovuori</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Saarinen</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Lundell</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Hänninen</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Morphological characteristics and photosynthetic capacity of Fragaria vesca L. winter and summer leaves</article-title><source>Flora -
