They can be activated by tissue injury as well as the accompanying local immune response. We have shown that following nerve injury in mice cytotoxic Natural Killer (NK) cells infiltrate the peripheral nerve and interact with stress-induced ligands of the activating receptor NKG2D (<italic>Klrk1</italic>). However, the diversity and specificity of NKG2D receptor ligands among sensory neuron subtypes, and translation of this mechanism to humans, remains unknown.</p><p id="P3">We used dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons cultured from C57BL/6J mice of both sexes with fluorescently-labelled sensory neuron lineages (<italic>Scn10a, Mrgprd, Calca, Trpv1, Th, Thy1</italic>), as well as human induced pluripotent stem cell derived (hiPSCd)-sensory neurons after laser ablation, as <italic>in vitro</italic> models of axonal injury. We assessed expression of NKG2D ligands by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) corroborated by publicly available RNA sequencing datasets and validated with single-cell PCR. Recombinant NKG2D receptor proteins in live cell-based assays were used to reveal the subcellular membrane localisation of NKG2D ligands with quantification by a semi-automated image analysis. Functional interactions between human NK cells and sensory neurons were confirmed with co-cultures in microfluidic devices.</p><p id="P4">We show that NKG2D ligands are expressed exclusively in unmyelinated DRG neurons after injury. NKG2D-receptors bound to puncta along distal neurites of injured axons enriched predominantly in <italic>Mrgprd</italic>-expressing non-peptidergic nociceptors. We observed low-level binding of human NKG2D-receptors to neurites of hiPSCd sensory neurons that increased after axonal laser ablation.

After injury or disease, peripheral nerves may undergo Wallerian degeneration followed by regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], as well as alterations to their biochemical and functional properties that are thought to contribute to peripheral sensitization and neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Despite substantial evidence from preclinical studies, many novel, neuronally-targeted treatments for neuropathic pain have failed in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The current situation is reinforced by a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trial data on pharmacotherapeutic interventions which found a persistent reliance on existing drugs such as tricyclic anti-depressants, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and α2δ-ligands as first list treatments for neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], guidance which has not changed significantly in the last 10 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Understanding the broader changes in nociceptor form and function after nerve injury is therefore crucial for uncovering the mechanisms of neuropathic pain and developing effective treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P7">Recent developments in single cell sequencing technologies have greatly deepened our understanding of sensory neuron heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], as well as key differences between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. However, our understanding of the pathological changes that occur to DRG neurons is hindered by the loss of transcriptional identity after nerve injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. The resulting changes in expression of sensory neuron-specific drug targets for pain, such as Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], are therefore likely to limit the re-purposing of promising pharmacological treatments for acute pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] to chronic neuropathic pain. Knowledge of an injury-specific biomarker, particular one expressed at the cell surface, would therefore greatly enhance our ability to identify and target pathological sensory nerves for potential therapeutic intervention.</p><p id="P8">In addition to intrinsic neuronal changes, the immune system has a critical role in peripheral sensitization and pain following nerve injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], with bidirectional neuro-immune crosstalk between nociceptors and immune cells influencing the outcomes of pain and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Our previous work has highlighted the role of cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells in the immune response to nerve injury and neuropathic pain resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], suggesting immunotherapies targeting innate cytotoxic cells as a novel potential strategy for neuropathic pain treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P9">NK cells, a key component of innate immune system and member of the innate lymphoid cell (ILC) family, perform immuno-surveillance for transformed, virus-infected and stress cells within the body, as well as regulate adaptive immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Among NK cells’ direct functions are the recognition of stress-induced molecules, or “altered-self”, through their activating receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. The archetypal activating receptor Natural Killer group 2D (NKG2D), encoded by the gene <italic>Klrk1</italic> in mice (<italic>KLRK1</italic> in humans) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], serves as an evolutionarily conserved a “master switch” regulating NK cell activation in both species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. In mice, NKG2D ligands are encoded by the <italic>Raet1</italic> gene family consisting of five gene isoforms: α, β, γ, δ and ε [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Other known NKG2D ligands include the multi-gene family histocompatibility 60 (<italic>H60)</italic> a-c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] and murine UL16-binding protein-like transcript 1 <italic>Mult1 (Ulbp1)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], which also contribute to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Lanier, 2015). In humans, NKG2D ligands include MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) and MICB, and the UL16-binding protein family: ULBP1 (RAET1I), ULBP2 (RAET1H), ULBP3 (RAET1N), ULBP4 (RAET1E), ULBP5 (RAET1G), and ULBP6 (RAET1L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Engagement of the NKG2D receptor with ligands expressed at the cell surface as transmembrane or glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI]-linked membrane proteins may render the target susceptible to cell-mediated cytotoxicity by NK or CD8+ T cells, and as well as subsets of NKT and γδ T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</p><p id="P10">We have previously demonstrated that genes for the <italic>Raet1</italic> family of ligands are upregulated within dorsal root ganglia (DRG) following peripheral nerve injury in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. However, the diversity of the changes in NKG2D ligand expression across sensory neuron subtypes, and therefore the cellular specificity of targeting by NK cells after nerve injury, remains undefined. In this study, we aimed to identify the subpopulation of sensory neurons expressing activating ligands for NKG2D after injury, as well as examine the potential for translation of this cytotoxic neuro-immune interaction from mice to humans.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods | materials"><title>Methods and Materials</title><p id="P11">This study is reported in accordance with the RIVER (Reporting In Vitro Experiments Responsibly) recommendations for <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] and ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines for animal experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>].</p><sec id="S3"><title>Ethical approvals</title><p id="P12">Human NK cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors collected by the UK National Health Service (NHS) Blood and Transplant service and distributed by Non-Clinical Issue (NCI) with the approval of the University of Oxford Medical Sciences Interdivisional Research Ethics Committee (MS IDREC) (Reference: R70042/RE002) and stored under a Human Tissue Authority site licence (HTA_12217; Project 00122).

Questionnaire-based screening tools such as DN4 (douleur neuropathique 4 questions), NPSI (Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory) and PainDETECT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R123">123</xref>] are helpful, but still rely on a detailed and labour-intensive clinical assessment to identify a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R124">124</xref>]. There has therefore been a recent focus on obtaining objective biomarkers to better understand the subjective experience of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R125">125</xref>]. Composite factors can be applied at the population level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R126">126</xref>] but diagnosis at the patient level remains challenging. The search for biochemical biomarkers of nerve injury has therefore typically focussed on easily accessible analytes in the peripheral blood. For example, a recent systematic review highlighted significantly higher levels of neurofilament light chain in cases of peripheral neuropathy compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R127">127</xref>]. A cell surface-expressed protein biomarker that is found at low levels in ‘healthy’ individuals and upregulated by peripheral nerve injury - as identified here in the form of Raet1e (mouse) and ULBP2 (human) - could pave the way for identifying and intervention in nerve damage via non-invasive imaging or radiolabelling techniques.</p></sec><sec id="S40"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P96">This study was performed in mice of both sexes on a C57BL/6J background using animals sourced from suppliers at three geographical locations (UK, South Korea and US). While the sex and supplier variables enhance the external validity of our findings, the use of a single genetic background, which are known to express different NKG2D ligands compared to other strains such as Balb/c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], is a significant limitation. An examination of NKG2D ligands after nerve injury in other strains of mice would strengthen the claims of the evolutionary conservation of this particular neuro-immune interaction.</p><p id="P97">Several of the cre recombinase-driven reporter mouse lines used, including <italic>Trpv1</italic>-cre, restricts our interpretation to sensory neurons of a particular genetic lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. This was overcome by the use of tamoxifen inducible cre lines, in which Cre recombinase is fused to a mutant oestrogen ligand-binding domain (ERT2), allows for developmental control of reporter transgene (TdTomato) expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. However, we cannot exclude a potential discrepancy between lineage markers and functional identity of sensory neurons that express NKG2D ligands in the adult mouse, nor a potential effect of tamoxifen itself on driving cellular stress in addition to the effect of injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R128">128</xref>]. These findings therefore emphasise the importance of cross-validating potential receptor-ligand interactions at multiple molecular and cellular levels, especially when genes expressed even at low levels can have powerful neuro-immune modulatory functions.</p><p id="P98">The small sample size for single cell PCR experiment (18-20 <italic>Gapdh+Advillin+</italic> DRG neurons per group) limits interpretation of the minimal detection of <italic>Mult1</italic>. The high proportion of small diameter neurons among those collected also emphasises the sample bias inherent in DRG neuron culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>].</p><p id="P99">We focussed our receptor binding analysis on the neurites of DRG neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>. The purpose of the soma extraction step in our analysis was to avoid the confound of dead/dying cells, which non-specifically attract recombinant protein and antibody binding. Although we provide anecdotal evidence for NKG2D ligand expression predominantly at distal neurites, there remains a potential for functional receptor expression at DRG soma. Further work investigating ligand dynamics will help shed light on their subcellar distribution, and whether cytotoxic neuroimmune interactions at the soma may have consequences for neuron viability after nerve injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>].</p><p id="P100">Our use of primary human NK cells inevitably results in a mismatch between donor and recipient human leukocyte antigen (HLA), which may affect the influence the neuro-immune interaction we observe <italic>in vitro</italic> in a way that would not occur within an individual with nerve injury. Exposure of host immune system to tissue from an HLA-mismatched individual – as occurs in organ transplants – can result in graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) that is typically the result of alloreactive T cell activity. Although the role of NK cells is more complex, which in some cases are thought to offer protection from GvHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R129">129</xref>], we cannot exclude the possibility of alloreactive NK cells responding to HLA-mismatch with the iPSC lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R130">130</xref>] contributing to the axon degeneration we observed after IL-2 priming.</p></sec><sec id="S41" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P101">The functional expression of NKG2D receptor ligands at the cell surface of unmyelinated nerve fibres may represent an anatomically restricted marker of injury, or other nerve pathology. De novo display of ligands for receptors of immune surveillance on non-peptidergic nociceptors in particular, is likely to result in reciprocal neuro-immune interactions that influence somatosensation and pain, as well as the local immune microenvironment, in injury or disease.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S42"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Dr Chul-Kyu Park for assistance with nested primer design, Dr Demetrio Labate and Dr Cihan Bilge Kayasandik for guidance and implementation of the Directional Ratio method, and Dr Alan Wainman for assistance with the SoRa confocal microscopy.
