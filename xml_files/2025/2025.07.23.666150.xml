This behavior is likely due to the reduced fluid velocity in the outlet channel, which may reduce the intensity of the fluid vortex. Looking at the bottom row, from panel (d) to panel (f), we see that as the stenosis aspect ratio is increased, the vorticity magnitude also decreases. This trend is likely due to the the increased stenosis aspect ratio leading to a lower fluid velocity at the junction entrance, which in turn imparts less kinetic energy to the vortex.</p><p id="P12">These observations will be used to inform the interpretation of the bead behavior in the following sections.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>2.2.2</label><title>Simulated Trajectory Metrics</title><p id="P13">To quantify the differences in the trajectories as a function of the outlet width and stenosis width, we consider three metrics which have previously been used to characterize bead trajectories in cross-slot junctions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> namely the residence time, the average angular velocity of the bead centroid around the outlet axis, and the number of turning points in the trajectory. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> shows the variation of these metrics with changes in outlet aspect ratio and stenosis aspect ratio for our simulations. Also included is a linear fit to the data, which is shown as a dashed line. For a visual representation of the trajectories themselves, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>.</p><p id="P14">The residence time is defined as the time which a bead’s centroid spends in the junction region (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S32">Section 4.6.1</xref>). It is intuitive to expect the residence time to increase with increasing outlet aspect ratio, as a higher aspect ratio, i.e., wider channel, will result in lower average fluid velocity in the outlet channel. The behavior of the residence time with changes in stenosis aspect ratio is less intuitive, but is likely due to a narrower stenosis causing beads to enter the junction closer to the lateral center of the junction, which has previously been shown to result in a higher residence time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> due to the competing effects of drag from each outlet direction being balanced.</p><p id="P15">The average angular velocity is the average angular velocity of the bead’s centroid around the outlet axis while it is in the junction region. Similar to the residence time, the average angular velocity is linearly dependent on the outlet and stenosis aspect ratios. However, unlike the residence time, the average angular velocity is negatively correlated with the outlet aspect ratio and the stenosis aspect ratio. We hypothesize that the negative correlation of the average bead angular velocity with the outlet aspect ratio is due to the decreased average fluid velocity in the outlet channel leading to a reduced intensity of the fluid vortex. The negative correlation of the average angular velocity with the stenosis aspect ratio is likely due to a larger stenosis width resulting in a lower fluid velocity at the inlet to the junction, which is also likely to reduce the intensity of the fluid vortex.</p><p id="P16">The number of turning points in the trajectory is the number of turning points (defined in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S31">Section 4.5.1</xref>) which a bead completes while in the junction region. The number of turning points is not as clearly linear with respect to channel aspect ratios as the residence time or average angular velocity, but still shows an approximate linear relationship with both the outlet and stenosis aspect ratios, which is likely due to the integer constraint on the number of turning points. The number of turning points has no strong correlation with the outlet aspect ratio and a negative correlation with the stenosis aspect ratio. We can use the model given by,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> which states that the number of turning points is linearly correlated with both the residence time and the average angular velocity, to explain these trends. Increasing the outlet aspect ratio results in an increased residence time and decreased average angular velocity, which will cancel one another out, resulting in a smaller dependence of the number of turning points on the outlet aspect ratio. Increasing the stenosis width results in a smaller increase in the residence time and a larger decrease in the average angular velocity, which will result in a negative correlation between the number of turning points and the stenosis aspect ratio.</p><p id="P17">The case where both the inlet and outlet aspect ratios are increased is shown as a square in each panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. To assess whether the effects of changing both parameters are additive, we also show an estimated value based on the linear fits of the metrics at fixed stenosis and outlet aspect ratios, which are shown as a triangle marker on each panel. If the effects of changing both parameters were additive, then the estimated (triangle) values should be equal to the measured (square) values. Clearly, this is not the case, which suggests that the effect of changing both parameters is not purely additive.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7"><label>2.3</label><title>Microfluidic Chip Characterization</title><p id="P18">The utility of 2PP 3D printing as a prototyping method to validate CFD models of microfluidic chips is dependent on its ability to form channels that meet the assumptions of the CFD models.

For the junction measurements, height was averaged over the entire area of the shallow channel region, or junction layer; as such, the measurement area differs between junction geometries (wider channel designs have a larger measurement area than narrower channel designs). Because the channel height is not perfectly uniform across the junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>), this resulted in slightly elevated variability in the average height of the junction region relative to the variability in the deeper inlet and outlet channel regions.</p><p id="P21">For the junction region, the channel height standard deviation was 0.04 <italic>µ</italic>m, just 0.23% of the mean channel height.

To assess how closely the physical chips meet this assumption, SEM images of channel cross sections were analyzed. One chip of each geometry variation (and two chips of the geometry variation in which both outlet width and stenosis width were varied) was sectioned along the channel axis perpendicular to the feature with a unique width. Across all designs, a slight curvature in the channel walls was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).

As the channel height of the prototype chips is very tightly controlled, the fluidic resistance depends primarily on variability in the printed structures. Velocity variability is thus representative of overall geometric consistency of the printed structures.</p><p id="P30">For each individual chip, we considered the velocity measurement from the first run on that chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4g</xref>). Each velocity measurement indicates the mean of individual particle velocities for a run measured immediately prior to the start of that run; velocities ranged from 3.55 to 3.80 m/s. We then calculated the standard deviation of the velocities for runs on three chips of each design (except for ‘<italic>α</italic><sub><italic>st</italic></sub> = 2.03’ for which runs were successful on only two chips). The median velocity standard deviation for chips with printed designs was 0.014 m/s, while the average velocity standard deviation for ‘production’ chips (injection molded junctions) was 0.008 m/s. The latter reflects variability in velocity not attributable to variability in printing, such as variability in channel height or inlet pressure. Of note, however, is that the range of standard deviations for velocity on chips with printed designs was [0.004, 0.034], indicating that in some cases, print reproducibility across three chips was comparable to that of chips with an injection molded junction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13"><label>2.4</label><title>Experimental Validation of CFD Simulations</title><p id="P31">Using the method described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S31">Section 4.5.1</xref>, we estimated the turning points from the experimental data. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> shows the experimental turning points compared with the corresponding bead trajectories.

VEIR is more sensitive to the outlet aspect ratio than the stenosis aspect ratio, which is likely due to the larger magnitude of the outlet aspect ratio.</p><p id="P33">The experimental VEIR was consistently about 8% higher than the predicted values, but the trend of VEIR with respect to the aspect ratios is predicted well by the simulations.

Pioneering work demonstrating printing inside COP channels used devices that were hot embossed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> a process that is less reproducible and lower throughput than injection molding. Additionally, previous demonstrations used devices sealed with a thin COP foil, which would be expected to deform at the high pressures used in the Cytovale System. Printing with high accuracy through the relatively thick COP slide necessary for this application is inherently more challenging than either printing through a COP film or printing inside of PDMS channels bonded to a cover slip for several reasons: the requirement to use an objective with longer working distance to print through 1 mm-thick COP, reduced flatness of molded parts, lower effective resolution due to surface finish and potential bonding-induced internal stresses, and poor heat dissipation of COP resulting in localized heating of the resin.</p><p id="P35">We show that a high degree of precision and accuracy can be obtained even when 2PP 3D printing through a 1 mm-thick COP slide in sealed channels. Using multiple metrology techniques, we demonstrate that highly reproducible and accurate structures can be realized via this method. Sub-micron accuracy was achieved in channel width, the feature under investigation, and accuracy could be improved further were another batch of chips to be printed by compensating the printed design by the +0.65 <italic>µ</italic>m mean offset measured via optical microscopy in the outlet channel width.</p><p id="P36">As a functional demonstration of the reproducibility of printing, velocity measurements show variability approaching that of chips on which all features were injection molded, the gold standard for feature reproducibility in rigid microfluidic devices. This reproducibility is made possible by relying on established injection molding and solvent bonding processes to achieve channel height consistency across printed junction designs not possible via other methods. Even if standard SU-8 photolithography and PDMS soft lithography processes were used to prototype chips with different junction designs, <italic>even if</italic> all designs were patterned on the same wafer, achieving a standard deviation in channel height of just 40 <italic>n</italic>m on channels large enough to permit leukocyte transit would approach impossibility. We know of no other method with which 10 different 2.5D microfluidic channel designs could be prototyped with such consistent channel heights.</p><p id="P37">Using 2PP 3D printing to form critical structures has the additional benefit over injection molding of near-vertical sidewalls, as releasing parts from a mold with near-vertical sidewalls without introducing mold release defects is not always possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> It should be noted, however, that the ideality of the channel cross-section shape for 3D printed structures may decrease as channel height increases.</p><p id="P38">The ability of a simulation to predict real-world performance is only possible if the realized geometry closely matches the simulated geometry. The agreement of VEIR predicted by simulations and measured experimentally on chips with printed features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6g</xref>) demonstrates that 2PP 3D printing inside sealed thermoplastic chips is sufficiently reproducible to enable the experimental validation of a lattice-Boltzmann CFD model of rigid particle trajectories in a microfluidic cross slot. This model accurately predicts particle trajectories as the cross-slot geometry is varied, providing a powerful tool for the optimization of cross-slot geometries to achieve specific particle trajectories.</p><p id="P39">The offset observed between simulated and measured VEIR has a few possible explanations and illustrates limitations of this technique (and, more broadly, experimental validation of CFD simulations in microfluidics). First, simulations assumed a uniform channel height throughout the junction. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, channel height, and therefore channel aspect ratio, varies radially within an approximately 300 nm range with distance from the junction center. Second, simulations were run assuming a channel aspect ratio equal to the target, but the measured stenosis aspect ratio differed by up to 4.0% and the measured outlet channel aspect ratio differed by up to 2.0%. Third, while the channel sidewalls were nearly vertical, they were not perfectly vertical, and the simulation does not take into account the effect of non-vertical channel sidewalls. Fourth, simulated geometries lack radii on the channel wall corners in the junction, the effect of which is difficult to predict.

Methods for prototyping these devices have significant drawbacks: cost and turn-around time of tooling for thermoplastic devices, cost and throughput for glass or glass-silicon chips, resolution and optical clarity for traditional 3D printing (e.g., SLA), and autofluoresence, throughput, and solvent compatibility for epoxy resins.</p><p id="P42">2PP 3D printing inside sealed thermoplastic microfluidic channels is a powerful tool for cost-effective rapid prototyping, especially when rigid channel walls and high-precision geometries are necessary. While the injection-molded and solvent-bonded chip used in this work is a custom design, it is also possible to print structures in commercially-available thermoplastic chips, making this approach exceptionally accessible and obviating the need for capital investments in micro-manufacturing equipment for prototyping.

For each frame where a bead is present, its outline is identified using a neural network, and this outline is processed to determine the bead’s centroid coordinates (<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>). The high frame rate yields approximately 10 centroid measurements per bead during a single transit.</p><p id="P65">Due to the steady-state nature of the flow field and the precise particle grouping achieved by upstream inertial focusing, a scatter plot overlaying all recorded bead centroids from an experiment reveals a welldefined helical trajectory shape (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7a</xref>). To estimate the locations of this trajectory’s turning points, we first transform the discrete point cloud of centroids into a continuous function <italic>y</italic> = <italic>f</italic>(<italic>x</italic>). This is achieved using a moving window approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7b</xref>). For any given x-coordinate <italic>x</italic>, we consider all centroid points (<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) that fall within a window of width <italic>δ</italic>, specifically where the <italic>x</italic>-coordinate <italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic> is between <italic>x − δ</italic>/2 and <italic>x</italic> + <italic>δ</italic>/2.</p><p id="P66">From the set of corresponding <italic>y</italic>-values <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> within this window, we compute a one-dimensional Gaussian Kernel Density Estimate (KDE). This KDE gives us a smooth probability distribution indicating where <italic>y</italic>-values are most likely to occur within that specific window. The function <italic>f</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) is then defined as the <italic>y</italic>-value where this calculated KDE reaches its maximum peak. In simpler terms, <italic>f</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) is the y-coordinate with the highest estimated density of points within the local <italic>x</italic>-window. By selecting a sufficiently small window width delta, this method provides a robust estimate of the underlying trajectory function <italic>y</italic> = <italic>f</italic>(<italic>x</italic>), from which the positions of the turning points can be readily calculated. The black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7a</xref> represents the continuous trajectory.</p><p id="P67">Similarly, we can estimate the corresponding time for each point in the trajectory.
