This sets new frontiers for the field, including designing proteins that bind small molecules tightly and specifically, and understanding the non-covalent interactions that underpin such designs to make binding predictable and tunable. Here we address these challenges with a rapid physics-based computational method to generate isosteric and chemically complementary binding pockets for small-molecule targets in <italic>de novo</italic> designed proteins. We test this experimentally by constructing and characterizing binding proteins for several synthetic and natural chromophores. By evaluating only single-digit numbers of designs, the pipeline delivers stable proteins with pre-organized binding sites confirmed by X-ray crystallography, which bind the targets selectively with micromolar affinities or better. To illustrate the scope and applications of this approach, we incorporate distinct and coupled chromophore-binding sites in a two-domain <italic>de novo</italic> protein enabling controlled energy transfer between the two sites, and we develop a small <italic>de novo</italic> binding protein that can be used in live mammalian cells to visualize sub-cellular structures.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">For some time, protein designers have explored the modelling and construction of small molecule-binding sites in natural and <italic>de novo</italic> protein scaffolds to enable functions like sensing and catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Such studies have highlighted the difficulty of achieving high-affinity and highly specific interactions. The routes taken have encompassed all approaches in <italic>de novo</italic> design, including minimal, rational, and computational strategies. Many of these focus on specific ligands rather than small-molecule binding in general and the need to validate selectivity. For example, Hecht et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) show that combinatorial libraries of sequences tailored to fold into 4-helix bundles have a propensity for heme binding, without embedded design specifications for this. The DeGrado and Dutton groups have successfully incorporated heme binding into <italic>de novo</italic> 4-helix bundles through rational design and by incorporating nature-inspired binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Baker et al. have used Rosetta to computationally design binders for the steroid digoxigenin into a natural scaffold, initially achieving low-to-mid micromolar affinity, and then improving this to picomolar with library-based mutagenesis and selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). De Grado et al. have applied a similar approach to design heme-binding proteins, which are then evolved to achieve high catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Kortemme et al. have expanded the scope of computational binding-site design by fragmenting ligands and using the fragments in PDB searches to identify optimal contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Polizzi and De Grado combine fragment-based binding-site design with parametric scaffold generation to develop an apixaban binder with sub-micromolar affinity, and low-nanomolar binders for rucaparib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Also, Höcker and Jürgens have engineered the <italic>E. coli</italic> tryptophan repressor to bind auxin as a component of a biosensor in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Despite these and other successes, these largely physics- and knowledge-based methods are computationally slow, can have limited ligand scope, and usually require careful input and filtering from an expert user (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Currently, protein design is undergoing a step-change with the application of deep-learning methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). While AI promises to accelerate and simplify <italic>de novo</italic> binder design, its black-box nature may limit practical and mechanistic understanding of the process. Moreover, early applications of deep-learning methods to deliver small molecule-binding proteins, whilst achieving low-micromolar affinities for cholic acid and methotrexate for instance, still require experimental screening of large numbers of designs per target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). New pipelines based on scaffold generation using RFDiffusionAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) do show improvement for targets that are well represented in structural databases such as heme and bilin. Whilst impressive advances, these studies highlight the considerable challenges that remain in the computational design of small molecule-binding proteins, with even the most advanced methods requiring extensive optimization and screening to achieve experimental successes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).</p><p id="P4">To address these issues, we introduce RASSCCoL, a computational pipeline for the Rapid Assessment of Size, Shape, and Chemical Complementarity of Ligands in protein design. This is a robust and interpretable physics-based method for incorporating small molecule-binding sites into protein scaffolds. RASSCCoL’s streamlined pipeline uses the volume and functional groups of the ligand to etch complementary pockets into the proteins. Two key aspects of the work are: (i) the use of fast volume calculations to limit the number of side-chain combinations that need to be assessed, and (ii) the leveraging of a robust, highly stable, and large family of <italic>de novo</italic> designed α-helical scaffolds. Effectively, this approach allows near-exhaustive sampling of sequences that are most likely to generate pre-organized, isosteric binding sites for the target ligand while bypassing the sampling of backbone flexibility. The resulting sequences are repacked onto the input backbone and are evaluated by ligand docking using AutoDock Vina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), and then by regenerating the protein folds and binding pockets using AlphaFold2 predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). To address the challenge of exponential scaling for larger ligands and concomitant sequence spaces, we employ machine learning to score designs at the sequence level. This restricts the computationally expensive explicit modelling of structures to the most-promising sequences.</p><p id="P5">To validate this approach, we create binding sites in single-chain coiled coil-based scaffolds generated through rationally seeded computational protein design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). These scaffolds have advantages of small size, stability, and well-understood sequence-to-structure relationships. Specifically, they have layered hydrophobic cores that facilitate ligand alignment and side-chain replacement in the computational design. Coiled-coil proteins and protein-protein interfaces are ubiquitous in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), and are amongst the most successful <italic>de novo</italic> designed proteins targeted to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). In principle, however, RASSCCoL can be applied to any protein scaffold. Combined, this pipeline simplifies the design process, requires minimal user input, produces robust <italic>in silico</italic> models that are chemically derived and interpretable, limits the number of constructs for experimental testing, and yields high success rates of confirmed binders. We show that RASSCCoL can be used to introduce orthogonal but coupled binding sites to produce more-complex, functional <italic>de novo</italic> proteins; and to deliver small <italic>de novo</italic> chromophore-binding proteins for use as fluorescent reporters in cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>A physics-based computational pipeline for binding-site design</title><p id="P6">Initially to develop and illustrate RASSCCoL, we chose a compact and stable <italic>de novo</italic> designed 4-helix bundle, sc-apCC-4 (PDB id 8a3k), as the protein scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>); and two synthetic, environment-sensitive dyes—1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and Nile red—as the target ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Our computational pipeline for generating small molecule-binding sites had three generalizable steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>): (i) binding-site selection; (ii) sequence generation and culling; (iii) model building, ligand docking, and evaluation.</p><p id="P7">First, the positions of binding-site residues were identified based on ligand length. The core packing in sc-apCC-4 is layered with four side chains per layer and a spacing of ≈5 Å between layers. Thus, the number of layers that need to be redesigned to accommodate a ligand can be estimated as ligand length in Å divided by 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Second, a volume calculation based on Bondi radii (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) was used to identify side-chain permutations to generate voids that match the ligand’s volume most closely. The 2-fold symmetric and entirely hydrophobic ligand DPH (length, L ≈ 15 Å; and volume, V ≈ 274 Å<sup>3</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) spans three 4-residue layers of sc-apCC-4. Within these layers, we retained some of the Ile residues important for fold stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). This left ten designable positions in total, which we restricted to combinations of the aliphatic residues, Gly, Ala, Val, Leu and Ile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Thus, potentially, ≈10 million sequence combinations (5<sup>10</sup>) could have been searched. However, this reduced to ≈3,200 sequences by applying the ligand-volume and ligand-symmetry constraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Third, using FASPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) each sequence was repacked into the scaffold structure, and DPH was docked into the resulting models using AutoDock Vina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). AutoDock Vina employs a physics-based scoring function to predict ligand-binding poses and affinities, which we used to score the models. Combined, these computational steps took tenths of a second for each sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>), enabling the entire design protocol to finish within 30 minutes on a single CPU core (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Finally, AlphaFold2 (AF2) was used to predict structures for a small number of the top-scoring sequences, followed by docking to evaluate ligand-pose recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). These provided assessment metrics to choose only a small number of designs for experimental production and characterization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3, Table S3</xref>). To evaluate how RASSCCoL extended to asymmetric ligands we targeted Nile red (L ≈ 13 Å; V ≈ 324 Å<sup>3</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). In this case, the sequence space was significantly larger at ≈400,000 possible sequences after applying the volume constraint (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S1, Figure S4</xref>). By parallelizing this approach to utilize multiple CPU threads, the computations for Nile red were completed in less than 2 hours.</p><p id="P8">In summary, RASSCCoL enables <italic>in silico</italic> screening of hundreds of thousands of designed sequences within hours even with modest computational resources (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1, Figure S1</xref>). This allows users to embellish the RASSCCoL pipeline as needed, for instance to include molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore wider backbone and side-chain conformational space (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S8 – 9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Direct, rapid, and robust generation of small molecule-binding proteins</title><p id="P9">For experimental testing, we chose five target ligands of varying volume, polarity, and heteroatom content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>): the aforementioned hydrophobic fluorophores DPH (L ≈ 15 Å; V ≈ 274 Å<sup>3</sup>) and Nile red (L ≈ 13 Å; V ≈ 324 Å<sup>3</sup>); more-hydrophilic and biologically relevant lumiflavin (L ≈ 11 Å; V ≈ 257 Å<sup>3</sup>); and biologically active arcyriaflavin A (L ≈ 12 Å; V ≈ 310 Å<sup>3</sup>) and SN38 (L ≈ 14 Å; V ≈ 396 Å<sup>3</sup>). For each ligand, we introduced up to ten mutations into three layers of the sc-apCC-4 scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). For lumiflavin, arcyriaflavin A and SN38, the side-chain libraries were diversified to include small polar residues, Ser, Thr, Asn, and Asp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). In this way, we aimed to accommodate the polar functional groups of these ligands, hypothesizing that these would be captured by the AutoDock scores in the RASSCCoL pipeline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S5 – 8</xref>). Indeed, binding-site sequences with polar amino acids were returned for these ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>). RASSCCoL calculations and full-length sequences of designs made as synthetic genes are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S1 and S3</xref>.</p><p id="P10">To test the robustness of both RASSCCoL and the sc-apCC-4 scaffold, we selected just thirteen sequences for characterization based on the docking scores: two for DPH, with clockwise and anticlockwise arrangements of the helices predicted by AF2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11</xref>) but with the same binding-site solution; two each for Nile red and arcyriaflavin A; three for lumiflavin; and four for SN38 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3 and Figures S3 – 8</xref>). All proteins expressed well, were monomeric, α helical, and thermally stable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S12 – 14</xref>). Binding assays using fluorescence intensity (FI) or fluorescence polarization (FP) measurements returned sub-micromolar affinities for DPH and arcyriaflavin A, low-micromolar affinities for Nile red and SN38, and a weaker ≈50 uM affinity for lumiflavin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S15 – 19</xref>). Interestingly, and although ligand selectivity was not explicitly included in the RASSCCoL pipeline, we found that many of the designed proteins discriminated between the different small molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5, Figure S20</xref>). Notably, the sc-apCC-4-DPH-1 and sc-apCC-4-NR-1 proteins, with designed hydrophobic binding pockets, did not bind the more hydrophilic lumiflavin—despite its smaller molecular volume compared to DPH and Nile red—consistent with the lack of chemical complementarity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5, Figure S20</xref>).</p><p id="P11">As controls to test the robustness of the scaffold and any ligand binding through non-specific interactions, we mutated the targeted binding site residues to either all Gly or all Ala to give sc-apCC-4-Gly and sc-apCC-4-Ala, respectively. Despite high AF2 confidence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>), the sc-apCC-4-Gly was completely unfolded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S13</xref>, top). However, the sc-apCC-4-Ala mutant was monomeric, α helical, and thermally stable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S12 – 14</xref>). It bound target ligands at least one order of magnitude weaker than the best designed binders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5, Figures S15 – 20</xref>). Interestingly, arcyriaflavin A was the most promiscuous ligand in our panel, and it was the only ligand to bind the Ala-based control with μM affinity.</p><p id="P12">We determined high-resolution crystal structures of the ligand-free forms for all five <italic>de novo</italic> binders. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6 – 7</xref>). The DPH binder crystalized as a domain-swapped dimer despite being monomeric in solution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S21 – 22</xref>). Nonetheless, each domain aligned well with the AF2 model, with the designed binding site geometry maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The Nile red, lumiflavin, arcyriaflavin A and SN38 binders matched the respective AF2 models closely with overall root-mean square differences between the C<sub>α</sub> atoms (C<sub>α</sub>-RMSDs) of &lt; 0.5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B – E</xref>). All five apo-proteins structures revealed solvent accessible, pre-organized binding pockets with side-chain geometries close to those predicted by AF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A – E</xref>) and binding-site heavy atom RMSDs of &lt; 0.5 Å. Thus, the observed cavity shapes and volumes matched the computational designs closely. Despite multiple attempts, we did not obtain any crystals for the ligand:protein complexes. However, redocking the ligands into the crystal structures returned almost identical poses to the computational design models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A – D</xref>). The only exception was the SN38 binder, where docking positioned the ligand within the binding pocket of the crystal structure, but not in the AF2 model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Moreover, for lumiflavin, arcyriaflavin A and SN38, inspection of the structures and docking predictions revealed hydrogen bonds between the ligands and introduced polar side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C – E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>RASSCCoL can be scaled for larger ligands and <italic>de novo</italic> scaffolds</title><p id="P13">Traditional protein design methods that explore combinations of side chains do not scale well with increasing number of designable positions and large amino-acid palettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). For our <italic>de novo</italic> scaffolds, significant reduction of the sequence space is possible by exploiting the symmetry, layered structures, and well-understood sequence-to-structure relationships of α-helical bundles. However, in more general cases using RASSCCoL, even with its optimized and relatively fast model-building and docking steps, the process would become computationally expensive once sequence space exceeded a few million. To mitigate this, we implemented an active sequence sampling strategy using Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). This prioritizes the most-informative data points rather than exhaustively docking all possible sequences, significantly reducing computational cost and time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S23 – 24</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To test this approach, we used a recently designed antiparallel 6-α-helix barrel, sc-apCC-6 (PDB id 8qad) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Unlike sc-apCC-4, this has a central hydrophobic cavity that binds DPH with low-micromolar affinity but has a weaker affinity for Nile red (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S25</xref>). We aimed to reverse this selectively and design a variant that bound Nile red but not DPH by exploiting only shape complementarity using RASSCCoL. The smaller 4-helix bundle required redesigning both <bold><italic>a</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>d</italic></bold> core positions of the <bold><italic>a→g</italic></bold> coiled-coil sequence repeats to generate binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S26A – C</xref>). However, due to the increased radius and changes in core packing of the 6-helix barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), we reasoned that redesigning only <bold><italic>a</italic></bold> positions should accommodate the ligands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S26D – F</xref>). In addition, the larger scaffold allowed the amino-acid pallet to be expanded to include Phe, which the 4-helix bundle cannot accommodate. Even by restricting designs to just the <bold><italic>a</italic></bold> sites of three layers and a subset of hydrophobic residues (Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, and Phe), this still generated ≈1.3 million sequences after the cavity volume filter. Using active sampling with GBT, only 100,000 sequences were evaluated using Auto Dock Vina, thus reducing the computation by over tenfold.</p><p id="P15">In more detail, GBT predictors were initially trained on a small, randomly selected subset of RASSCCoL designs of Nile red binders in the sc-apCC-6 background, and these were used to predict AutoDock Vina scores for the remaining sequences. The training set was then iteratively expanded by explicitly docking sequences with the highest prediction uncertainty (i.e., knowledge gaps), the lowest predicted docking scores (i.e., most-promising binders), and randomly chosen sequences to ensure smooth sampling of the sequence space. This process of docking and retraining continued until no further improvement in predictor’s mean-squared error was observed on a randomly selected validation set. At this stage, any remaining unsampled sequences with predicted docking scores below a user-defined cutoff were explicitly docked and passed to the final stages of the RASSCCoL pipeline — filtering and refolding.</p><p id="P16">Again, we only tested two of the resulting designs experimentally: one intended to bind both ligands equally well (sc-apCC-6-DPH-NR, labelled P for promiscuous), and another specific for Nile red (sc-apCC-6-NR, labelled S for specific) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Both proteins expressed well, were monomeric, α helical, and thermally stable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S12 – 14</xref>). As predicted, we observed low-μM affinities for DPH and Nile red in the promiscuous binder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, panel P). By contrast, the selective binder exhibited 170-fold tighter binding for Nile red compared to DPH, with a sub-μM dissociation constant for the former (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, panel S). Inspection of the docked AF2 models suggests that selectivity against DPH—which is ≈2 Å longer than Nile red—arises from subtle shortening of the binding pocket, causing steric clashes between DPH and residues at the extremes of the binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Nile red is an environment-sensitive probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). This is apparent in changes in its emission spectrum upon binding to the P and S designs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>): <italic>i.e</italic>., the resolved vibronic bands similar to those seen in n-hexane; and the blue-shifted fluorescence peak relative to that observed in dioxane and the more-solvent-exposed binding site of sc-apCC-4-NR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). This infers binding to tight hydrophobic pockets of the P and S designs. Finally, we solved a structure of P without ligand to 3.2 Å. This matched the AF2 model with Cα-RMSD of 0.3 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>, PDB id 9R1O). Despite the medium resolution, electron density for the designed residues—particularly the Phe side chains—was well-resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Redocking the ligands into this structure produced poses that closely aligned with the designed models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>RASSCCoL yields modular fluorescent proteins for applications <italic>in vitro</italic> and in mammalian cell</title><p id="P18">Building beyond single-domain, small molecule-binding proteins will require generating binding sites (or binding modules) that are orthogonal and can be co-assembled in modular manner into more-complex <italic>de novo</italic> frameworks. To explore this, we used two of the designed 4-helix bundles that bind DPH and Nile red selectively (sc-apCC-4-DPH-1 and sc-apCC4-NR-1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5, Figure S20</xref>) to construct a two-domain <italic>de novo</italic> protein with the domains fused <italic>via</italic> a rigid, read-through helical linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Since DPH and Nile red are a known Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S27</xref>), we designed this construct to position the two dyes strategically at the Förster distance of ≈50 Å. The resulting protein was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and was monomeric, α-helical and thermally stable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S12 – 14</xref>). Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) indicated an extended overall conformation consistent with the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A &amp; B</xref>). The protein retained its affinities for both ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, with both ligands present, selective excitation of DPH resulted in both DPH and Nile red fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S29 - 30</xref>). The latter must arise from FRET and thus indicates a population of the protein with both DPH and Nile red bound. The FRET lifetime of ≈2 ns gave a predicted distance of ≈51 Å, consistent with MD simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S31</xref>) and experimentally confirming the design of the dual binder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Finally, we explored the potential for using the <italic>de novo</italic> synthetic chromophore-binding proteins to target and visualize subcellular structures in mammalian cells. There are advantages of using <italic>de novo</italic> fluorescent proteins for such applications. For instance, at ≈130 residues and ≈15 kDa, sc-apCC-4 variants are approximately half the size of commonly used GFP variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) and on par with some of the smallest FPs, such as: iLOV (13 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>); SNAP-tag FP mimics (20 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>); <italic>de novo</italic> β-barrels (14 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>); and transmembrane 4-helix bundles (21 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Moreover, bright fluorophore encapsulation within proteins generally leads to improved and tunable spectral properties compared to conventional FPs. To examine this, we found that Nile red bound to sc-apCC-4-SN38-1, had a high fluorescence quantum yield and thus brightness (ε<sub>552</sub> = 52 400 cm<sup>-1</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>; Φ= 0.9), and a long fluorescence lifetime (τ = 4.5 ns) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S8 &amp; Figure S32</xref>). This is brighter and longer lived than conventional fluorescent proteins in the same spectral region, such as mCherry (ε<sub>587</sub> = 72 000 cm<sup>-1</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>; Φ= 0.2; τ = 1.4 ns) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Furthermore, emission wavelengths can be tuned toward the near-infrared (NIR) by substituting Nile red for derivatives with similarly high quantum yields, brightness and long fluorescence lifetimes; e.g., Nile blue (ε<sub>627</sub> = 34 400 cm<sub>-1</sub> M<sub>-1</sub>; Φ= 0.74; τ = 4.2 ns) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S8 &amp; Figures S33 – 35</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). On this basis, we tested several of our <italic>de novo</italic> protein modules directly in HeLa cells as fusions to GFP, without and with peptide tags for directing the constructs to different subcellular regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4, Figure S36</xref>). This is illustrated below for sc-apCC-4-SN38-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>), which binds both Nile red and Nile blue; K<sub>D,Nile Red</sub> ≈ 0.2 μM and K<sub>D</sub>,<sub>Nile blue</sub> ≈ 0.4 μM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5, Figure S20 &amp; 33</xref>).</p><p id="P20">As a control, we fused the parent sc-apCC-4 to the <italic>N</italic> terminus of mEmerald variant of the green fluorescent protein and transformed the construct into HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4, Figure S36</xref>). The transiently expressed fusion protein was dispersed throughout the cell. Next, we added short, <italic>N</italic>-terminal peptide sequences to the fusion to target: the nucleus with a nuclear-localization signal (NLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>); the plasma membrane with a Fyn-tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>); and the actin network with LifeAct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). In all cases, the mEmerald signal was redistributed and located as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S36</xref>). These experiments were performed with 0.1 μM Nile red added to the cell media 30 minutes before imaging. However, with these non-Nile-red-binding controls, none of the images showed any coincidence of the mEmerald and Nile red signals. By contrast, when sc-apCC-4 was substituted with sc-apCC-4-NR-1 or sc-apCC-4-SN38-1, the mEmerald and Nile red signals were coincident as evident in the merged images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5F</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S36</xref>). These indicate that the dye was taken up by cells and sequestered by the designed Nile red-binding components of the fusion proteins. Interestingly, the images were sharper and clearer with the sc-apCC-4-SN38-1 design. We attribute this to its sub-μM affinity for Nile red, which is 10-fold tighter than for sc-apCC-4-NR-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5 and Figure S20</xref>). Finally, to demonstrate that sc-apCC-4 alone is sufficient as a <italic>de novo</italic> fluorescent protein chassis, we repeated the experiments without the mEmerald reporter, and these worked similarly to the fusion constructs showing robust staining of targeted subcellular structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S37</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P21">Designing proteins that bind small molecules tightly and specifically is a key challenge for protein design and synthetic biology, with potential applications including bioimaging, <italic>in vivo</italic> sensing, catalysis and therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Here we present RASSCCoL, a fast, efficient, and intuitive computational strategy for introducing small molecule-binding sites into <italic>de novo</italic> designed proteins. This works by replacing side chains of the <italic>de novo</italic> scaffold to create cavities that are isosteric with the target ligand. The calculations are vastly accelerated by: i) using a volume filter to enrich for sequences most likely to accommodate the ligand; ii) rapid modelling with FASPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) and AutoDock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>); (iii) evaluation of the models using statistical and physical metrics; and iv), where needed for large targets, an active-learning procedure to reduce the number of explicit modelling steps. To put this approach into practice, we leverage well-understood, mutable, and thermostable <italic>de novo</italic> proteins as the scaffolds; namely, a growing family of single-chain α-helical bundles and barrels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). This streamlines the design process even further by bypassing backbone optimization and focusing on sequence design and refinement.</p><p id="P22">Specifically, we have designed low-to-sub-micromolar protein binders for two hydrophobic fluorophores, DPH and Nile red; for lumiflavin, a proxy for flavin-based cofactors; and for two cytotoxic compounds, arcyriaflavin A and SN38. The last three feature polar functional groups that RASSCCoL accommodates with complementary polar side chains. In each case, successful designs are achieved by testing just 1 - 4 expressed genes in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The approach scales well to larger scaffolds, or with additional design constraints such as ligand selectivity, which we also demonstrate experimentally. To test the modularity of some of the resulting designs, we combine two different binding modules for DPH and Nile red (a known FRET pair) in a two-domain protein that holds the chromophores in a specified orientation and at a set distance to enable energy transfer between the two sites. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our designs as small (≈15 kDa), stable, mutable, and adaptable fluorescent protein tags for visualizing subcellular structures and processes in mammalian cells.</p><p id="P23">Together with advances by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), our findings reinforce how the use of straightforward, well-understood, and fully characterized <italic>de novo</italic> scaffolds can accelerate functional protein design. In this way, RASSCCoL offers a robust and interpretable platform for creating next-generation protein-based tools and modules for broader applications in cell and synthetic biology, diagnostics, and therapeutics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supporting Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS207088-supplement-Supporting_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d110aAcDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S8"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>T.A.A.O., D.N.W. and R.P. thank Olivia Hawkins and Camilla Gajo for assisting with the fluorescence lifetime measurements.

The delayed rise in Nile red emission over the first few nanoseconds originates from Förster resonance energy transfer between DPH and Nile red. In contrast, control measurements that excited only Nile red (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S30</xref>) showed no delayed emission. Bi-exponential fit of the data returned τ<sub>FRET</sub> = 2.0 ± 0.2 ns, yielding an inter-ligand distance of 51.0 ± 1.3 Å.
