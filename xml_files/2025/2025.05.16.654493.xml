Here, we obtained 4.86 terabases of HiFi reads with an average read N50 of 16.3 Kb from 120 <italic>Bos taurus taurus</italic> bulls, yielding a mean coverage depth of 13.5-fold. We genotyped 23.8 M small variants and 79.3 k SVs to perform association testing with molecular phenotypes derived from a subset of 117 bulls with total RNA sequencing data from testis tissue. We identified 27.3 k molecular QTL including 316 for which SVs were the top variants. This corresponds to a 2.1- and 5.6-fold enrichment of SVs among expression and splicing QTL, respectively. When considering SVs in perfect LD with the lead small variant, the enrichment increased to 6.1- and 12-fold for expression and splicing QTL, respectively. Imperfect genotyping for large SVs and other variants limited our ability to detect all SV top variants, suggesting that the true enrichment of SVs among molecular QTL may be even higher. These results demonstrate that SVs have profound impacts on gene expression and splicing variation in cattle but highlight the necessity of improved SV genotyping to fully leverage long-read sequencing cohorts for dissecting complex traits.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Understanding the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases requires comprehensive exploration of genomic variation within and between individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.

We collected 4.86 terabases of HiFi reads from 49 8M SMRT cells sequenced on Sequel IIe and 41 25M SMRT cells sequenced on Revio. The mean depth of coverage was 13.8-fold and 13.5-fold for the existing Illumina and newly created HiFi reads, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>), enabling a fair comparison for variant discovery. The mean read N50 was 16.3 Kb with a mean Phred quality score of 33.7, demonstrating the expected strong negative correlation between read length and quality for HiFi reads (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>:-0.80, p=5.87 × 10<sup>-37</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We aligned the 120 HiFi and Illumina samples to the ARS-UCD2.0 <italic>Bos taurus</italic> reference genome, which included the new T2T assembly of a Y chromosome from a Wagyu bull, whereas the remaining genome is from a Hereford cow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Alignment depth of both the short and long read sequencing was comparable across the autosomes, with only minor increase in the fraction of autosomal sequence covered by alignments suitable for variant calling for HiFi reads (99.4% versus 99.0%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Conversely, the alignment improvement was noticeable for the X chromosome (90.0% versus 86.0%) and substantial for the Y chromosome (58.9% versus 32.0%). In the former case, this was largely due to the improved mapping of HiFi reads distinguishing high sequence similarity of X:19309231-28499819 to the unplaced contig NKLS02002208.1, while the latter was due to a large fraction of sequence containing higher order repeats, which was almost completely inaccessible with short read sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). However, the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) still displayed uneven and inconsistent alignment with the HiFi reads due to the repeat structure typically exceeding the length of the sequenced long reads which poses substantial challenges to unambiguous read alignment.</p><p id="P9">We called small variants with DeepVariant separately for HiFi and Illumina reads, again finding minor differences in the number of detected variants and called genotypes on autosomes and larger differences on sex chromosomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The increased number of variants called on X from the HiFi alignments was evenly distributed across the chromosome, while the larger number of variants discovered on Y primarily resulted from the increase in bases covered with HiFi reads in the MSY, with a substantial increase in variants called in newly accessible regions that were almost entirely uncalled from short read sequencing. Given all the samples are male, we specified that variants could have heterozygous genotypes in the pseudo-autosomal region (PAR) of the Y chromosome, while they could only be hemizygous in the X or MSY regions. However, there were “real” signals of heterozygous variants in the hemizygous region, primarily due to copy number variants of amplicon genes (e.g., <italic>TSPY</italic>, <italic>HSFY2</italic>, and <italic>RBMY)</italic> relative to the reference, where the variant allele frequency could estimate the copy number in addition to coverage-based estimates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We assessed potential functional consequences of small variants with the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), finding 247 and 166 biallelic SNPs with “HIGH” impacts respectively private to HiFi- and Illumina-based variant calls, with 2,013 common to both. After manual inspection of 15 HIGH impact variants private to each group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), we identified poor mapping of Illumina reads as the primary cause for the discrepancy between the variants called from short and long reads. All but one Illumina-only HIGH impact variant were likely genotyping artifacts as evidenced by implausible insert sizes and interchromosomal-mapping reads, with the sole exception of a singleton variant missed by the HiFi reads due to an uneven balance of alleles (7:1 read depth for the alleles). Conversely, all HiFi-only HIGH impact variants appeared correct, mostly missed by Illumina reads due to mapping quality of 0 or highly diverged regions potentially leading to local reference bias (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We found generally high genotyping concordance for SNPs on the autosomes (F1=0.93±0.02), taking the HiFi variants as truth and short read variants as query, although there was a moderate drop (F1=0.86±0.03) in genomic regions classified as tandem repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). There was no such drop for regions containing transposable elements, suggesting that there was sufficient variation within different transposable elements for short reads to correctly align, while they struggle in long tandem repeats with little motif variation. Variants genotyped on the X chromosome (F1=0.84±0.04) and the PAR of the Y chromosome (F1=0.85±0.02) were less concordant across all types of regions, while the limited number of short read-based variant calls in the MSY region led to a substantial drop in F1 score (F1=0.27±0.02). Indels behaved similarly, with an even more pronounced drop in accuracy around tandem repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). Given the observed improvements in small variant genotyping from long reads, we only retained the HiFi-based small variants for downstream use.</p><p id="P12">We also called structural variants from the HiFi read alignments with sniffles2, finding 75,164 and 4,111 SVs on the autosomes and sex chromosomes, respectively. We found approximately 23.9±0.6 k SVs per genome, with only on the order of 100s of novel SVs for each additional individual after 100 samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Given the predominant Braunvieh breed ancestry of the cohort, which has an estimated effective population size of 70, we likely captured the bulk of non-rare SVs present in this breed. SVs were overrepresented in regions annotated as tandem repeats, totalling just 3.2% of the genome, with 30.2% of SVs having at least half of their sequence contained within these regions. We observed a disproportionately large number of SVs of length ~300 bp, ~1.3 Kb, ~5.5 Kb, and ~8.4 Kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>), corresponding to known transposable elements like Bov-A2 (SINE), BTLTR1B (LTR), and BovB (LINE). Given the average read N50 of 16 Kb for this cohort, there is likely a small number of longer SVs that remains unidentified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). We further found that 7,944 SVs (10.02%) were present in only one sample (6,988 singletons and 956 doubletons), ranging between 6 and 573 SVs unique to each sample.</p><p id="P13">We found 37,380 novel autosomal SVs compared to a previous autosome-only, pangenome-derived SV panel constructed from 15 Braunvieh haplotypes, including 19,507 SVs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) between 1% and 15% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>), as well as 376 duplications and 422 inversions which cannot be easily genotyped through the previously applied <italic>k</italic>-mer approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">During sniffles2 joint-calling, “similar” SVs were merged into single alleles, collapsing multiallelic SVs. This overwhelmingly homogenised SVs that might only differ by small differences in length or position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Approximately 82% of the merged alleles had allele length standard deviations below 10, while only approximately 6% were above 100. However, SVs overlapping tandem repeats were particularly affected by merging alleles, either incorrectly treating different tandem repeat allele lengths as distinct SVs (rather than distinct alleles) or treating different tandem repeat allele lengths as a single consensus allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). Several large tandem repeats contained multiple SVs, primarily differing only by the start coordinate (corresponding to inserting/removing identical motifs at different locations within the tandemly duplicated sequence), which were not merged. On the other hand, smaller tandem repeats tended to be merged too aggressively, picking a consensus allele length which did not accurately reflect the copynumber diversity present in individual, pre-merged alleles.</p><p id="P15">Joint-calling SVs across the entire cohort resulted in a relatively high proportion of missing genotypes (mean of 6.8%), with duplications having the highest missingness (mean of 9.9%). The force-calling of candidate SVs from the original alignments substantially reduced the missingness to a mean of 1.2% (with the lowest mean missingness now observed in duplications at 0.7%), comparable to the missingness of joint-called SNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). Genotypes that remained missing after force-calling were significantly associated with low alignment coverage (p=5.0 × 10<sup>-23</sup>) and, to a much lesser extent, mean read length (p=2.9 × 10<sup>-6</sup>) after conducting a Type II ANOVA. Missingness was elevated at the start and end of chromosomes, roughly corresponding to centromeric and telomeric regions in the acrocentric cattle autosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>), with other peaks corresponding to regions known to be highly polymorphic (e.g., BoLA on BTA23) or challenging for alignment (e.g., large segmental duplication on BTA10). Approximately 4% of the SV genotypes (380,911 genotypes across 54,561 unique SVs) changed during force-calling. The overwhelming majority of these changes (89.7%) were newly filled missing values, while 9.6% were changes between non-missing genotypes, and the remaining 0.7% changed from non-missing to missing genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). A disproportionately high number of non-missing genotype changes were within centromeric-like regions (the first 200 Kb of chromosomes, corresponding to 0.2% of the genome), accounting for 11% of these unexpected changes. Other non-missing genotype changes occurred in regions where even manual assignment of genotypes was not obvious from the alignments, with instances of force-calling either improving or worsening genotype accuracy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Given the near-complete catalogue of SVs established for the cohort, we further examined the linkage disequilibrium between small variants and SVs. Even with the improved resolution of small variants within tandem repeats, we still found SVs overlapping tandem repeats as the most poorly tagged class of SVs. Over half of SVs (52%) containing tandem repeats were not in high linkage disequilibrium (r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.8) with any small variant within a ±1 Mb window, compared to only 17% of SVs which did not contain tandem repeats or transposable elements.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>molQTL mapping with HiFi data reveals the influence of structural variation on gene expression and splicing</title><p id="P17">The contribution of SVs detected from long read sequencing to complex trait variability has not been investigated in large cohorts of cattle.

After quality control on the RNA sequencing data, we considered 117 bulls for expression QTL (eQTL) and splicing QTL (sQTL) identification. Molecular phenotypes were estimated for 24,281 expressed genes and 16,975 spliced genes (corresponding to 50,853 intron clusters and 207,773 splice junctions), enabling association testing with 20,308,853 small variants (SNPs and small INDELs) and 61,861 SVs that were within 1 Mb of a molecular feature’s start site and had a MAF of at least 1% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Half of the expressed genes had at least one eQTL (12,584 genes; eGenes), corresponding to 16,644 independent-acting eQTL and 3,621,855 variants that passed the nominal significant threshold (eVariants; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). This included 261 eQTL (218 eGenes) on the X chromosome and 15 eQTL (13 eGenes) on the Y chromosome. Approximately 40% of eGenes had at least one eVariant that was an SV. SVs were lead variants for 105 eQTL (hereafter referred to as SV eQTL; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), i.e. they either had the smallest p-value or the same p-value as the top small variant for an eGene. Three SVs were lead variants for multiple eGenes, including an 85,550 bp duplication on chromosome 8 (8:103486033–103571583) that was associated with <italic>ORM1</italic> and <italic>COL27A1</italic> expression. This SV was previously described as a likely causal variant for an increased expression of <italic>ORM1</italic> in liver tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.

We identified 23 SV eQTL that were not in strong LD (r<sup>2</sup> &gt;= 0.8) with a small variant, including a deletion that was associated with the expression of <italic>ATXN7L3B</italic> on chromosome 5. Notably, this 218 bp deletion was seven orders of magnitude more significant than the next eVariant (SV nominal p-value = 1.55 × 10<sup>-17</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b,c</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Nearly half of the alternatively spliced genes possessed sQTL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). We detected at least one sQTL for 10,388 intron clusters (23,292 splice junctions) within 7,567 genes (sGenes), which totalled to 2,363,353 significant variants (sVariants) and 10,611 independent-acting sQTL. The X chromosome had 80 sQTL for 77 genes while the Y chromosome had 9 sQTL for 7 genes. Approximately 9% of the SVs considered for association testing were sVariants, totalling to 5,535 SV sVariants. SVs were lead variants (hereafter referred to as SV sQTL; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) for 211 independent-acting sQTL for 173 genes and included 176 unique variants. One SV was associated with multiple intron clusters within the same gene, while 30 SVs were associated with multiple junctions from the same cluster. Only one SVs was associated with multiple sGenes; a 783 bp deletion on chromosome 25 (17,283,696 bp) was an SV sQTL for VPS35L, where the SV was located within an intron, and an sQTL for KNOP, which was approximately 23 Kb upstream of the variant. SV sQTL were enriched in introns, exons, and splice sites, but depleted in intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Approximately 16% of SV sQTL were not in strong LD with a small variant (r<sup>2</sup> &gt;= 0.8), though some of these SVs were much more significant than the next sVariant, such as a 514 bp deletion on chromosome 23 that was associated with alternative splicing of ADGRF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d,e</xref>). One SV sQTL was not tagged (r<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.2) by any nearby small variants—a 120 bp insertion on chromosome 21 which was the only variant that passed the significance threshold for LOC112443211. The significant SV and gene both resided within a complex region near the beginning of the chromosome with over 150-fold coverage (at least 10 times higher than average) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 12</xref>). The lack of LD with nearby SNPs is almost certainly driven by the SV and gene residing in a poorly resolved region of the reference genome, although the sQTL may still reflect a valid association.</p><p id="P20">We found that SV eQTL and SV sQTL exhibited similar characteristics. Specifically, low frequency variants had larger effect sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f,g</xref>), as did variants that were within the feature’s boundary (gene for eQTL, intron cluster and gene for sQTL; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 13</xref>). Both eQTL and sQTL were underrepresented among low-frequency variants, reflecting the reduced statistical power to detect rare molecular QTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3h</xref>). This underrepresentation was stronger for SVs than small variants. We observed no statistical difference in effect size between SVs and small variants for eQTL (p = 0.23; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3j</xref>), but insertions and deletions had slightly smaller effect sizes than small variants for sQTL (p = 2.7 × 10<sup>-8</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3j</xref>).

LTRs were also depleted when considering their overall abundance, while DNA and RNA transposable elements were slightly enriched among SV molQTL, though not significantly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). There was no statistical difference in effect size across transposable element classes for both SV molQTL; though, when considering classes with more than two observations, median effect size was slightly larger for RNA and LTR SV eQTL and LTR and SINE SV sQTL. Only 8% and 12% of SV eQTL and SV sQTL contained tandemly repeated motifs, which was lower than the overall proportion of SVs containing such repetitive sequence.

This difference in p-values between two variants in perfect LD was often a result of an unbalanced proportion of missing genotypes. Nearly all (97%) of these 335 molQTL had at least one “missing” call for the most significantly associated small variant, while 12 of the 289 SVs in LD had at least one “missing” call.

This SNP had a “missing” genotype in one sample and was in perfect LD with a 6,966 bp insertion that was within an intron of <italic>MAGI3</italic> but had non-missing genotypes for all samples. The nominal p-value (p-value = 1.03 × 10<sup>-14</sup>) of the SNP was slightly lower than that of the SV (nominal p-value = 1.14 × 10<sup>-14</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 15</xref>), demonstrating that an unequal number of samples with missing genotypes across variants introduces bias in association tests. We also identified instances where “missing” genotypes for SVs resulted in missed SV molQTL. For instance, we observed an 8,790 bp insertion that had “missing” genotypes in four samples, which we identified as homozygous for the reference allele upon manual inspection of the overlapping read alignments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 16</xref>). This insertion was in complete LD with a small variant sQTL for <italic>LOC768028</italic>. Exclusion of the “missed” genotype samples for this SV during association testing had a substantial impact on the estimated p-value (nominal p-value = 4.97 × 10<sup>-12</sup>), which was consequentially fifteen orders of magnitude larger than the p-value of the top SNP (nominal p-value = 3.60 × 10<sup>-27</sup>).</p><p id="P25">The effect size distributions for both sQTL and eQTL revealed that the most extreme molecular QTL effects were primarily driven by small variants rather than SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3h,i</xref>). We manually examined the top 1% of large effect molQTL with at least one SV passing the feature’s significance threshold to determine whether erroneously genotyped SVs prevented their identification as molQTL. Among the 33 eQTL and 31 sQTL that passed these criteria, we identified genotyping errors for SVs that were strong causal candidates for 9 eQTL and 10 sQTL (27.3% and 32.3% of the manually examined large effect eQTL and sQTL, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a,b,c,d</xref>). Most genotyping errors stemmed from low overall coverage, reads failing to span the length of the variant, and insufficient coverage of one haplotype (often leading to heterozygous genotypes being miscalled as homozygous; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 17</xref>). Large insertions were particularly susceptible to misgenotyping, and we observed multiple instances of insertions exceeding 8 Kb being missed as SV molQTL. Notably, the set of eVariants and sVariants were depleted for insertions between 8–9Kb, highlighting the broader effects of misgenotyping variants of this size (eVariants: OR = 0.41, p = 5.82 × 10<sup>-18</sup>; sVariants: OR = 0.27, p = 1.08 × 10<sup>-18</sup>). For example, we identified an 8,573 bp insertion that contained an L1 LINE element and was associated with an alternative splicing event of <italic>PPM1H.</italic> This variant was nearly ten orders of magnitude less significant than the top SNP (SV nominal p-value = 5.20 × 10<sup>-24</sup>; SNP nominal p-value = 5.13 × 10<sup>-33</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c,d</xref>), despite being located within the intron that was affected by differential splicing. Inspection of the HiFi alignments revealed that two samples were misgenotyped as homozygous insertion carriers due to low coverage of the reference haplotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 18</xref>). Correcting the two misgenotyped samples resulted in a stronger association between the splicing event and the SV (corrected SV nominal p-value = 1.31 × 10<sup>-26</sup>).</p><p id="P26">Our SV catalogue contained 43 duplications spanning from 3 to 956 Kb that completely overlapped 135 testis-expressed genes, yet only four were identified as molQTL. This low proportion is unexpected, considering that previous studies have highlighted the substantial impact of such duplications on gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Nineteen of these 43 duplications could be confidently verified though coverage-based genotyping, corroborating that sniffles can identify duplications that are much larger than the HiFi reads. Taking the coverage-based genotypes as truth and the sniffles-called genotypes as query, we found that at least one sample was misgenotyped for all nineteen variants examined. Overall, we found that a substantial fraction of the sniffles-called genotypes for these long duplications were erroneous in both lowly and highly covered samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 19</xref>). We identified a relatively common 682 Kb duplication on chromosome 2 (2:27313972–27995694), which overlaps the entire coding sequences of <italic>CERS6</italic> and <italic>STK39</italic>. This duplication was called as heterozygous by sniffles in 16 samples; however, the coverage-based genotyping indicated that 4 heterozygous samples were incorrectly genotyped as homozygous reference (i.e., did not have the duplication; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 20</xref>). These genotyping errors resulted in this duplication being missed as an SV eQTL for both overlapped genes. We observed that the top small variants for these genes were one to three orders of magnitude more significantly associated than the erroneously genotyped duplication (top small variant p-value <italic>CERS6</italic> = 3.31 × 10<sup>-15</sup>, <italic>STK39</italic> = 1.90 × 10<sup>-14</sup>; duplication p-value <italic>CERS6</italic> = 8.34 × 10<sup>-12</sup>, <italic>STK39</italic> = 7.17 × 10<sup>-13</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4f</xref>). However, if genotyped correctly, the duplication is the top variant for both genes (corrected duplication p-value <italic>CERS6</italic> = 1.33 × 10<sup>-15</sup>, <italic>STK39</italic> = 3.96 × 10<sup>-15</sup>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">We have generated and analysed a cohort of Braunvieh cattle that exceeded the effective population size with long and accurate HiFi reads, representing one of the largest long-read datasets available for a non-model organism. Notably, this is the first bovine long-read DNA cohort which also has paired functional data, providing the opportunity to investigate the consequences of small and structural variation on molecular phenotypes. This cohort enabled us to detect and characterize 23,789,890 small variants and 79,275 SVs, including tens of thousands of previously unidentified SVs. Our collection of SVs is almost twice as large as that identified in a previously built 16-sample cattle pangenome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and substantially larger than previously reported in similar-sized, or larger, short-read sequenced cattle cohorts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. While short-read based SV cohorts are either depleted for insertions or lack them completely<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, we identified—as expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>—more insertions than deletions from the long read alignments, thereby providing comprehensive access to a vastly understudied variant type. A saturation analysis corroborated that our SV set is a near complete catalogue of common SVs segregating within the Braunvieh population. However, we suspect that longer SVs (&gt;15,000 bp) were missed for samples with shorter average read lengths. Long-read sequence data also improved alignments to the X and Y chromosomes—which are often neglected in genome-wide association studies due to their repetitiveness—and thereby facilitated the identification of over one hundred thousand small variants that were previously inaccessible with short-read sequencing, including 7 SNPs predicted as HIGH impact. We also demonstrated improved small variant calling on the autosomes, particularly in tandem repeat regions, when using long reads over short reads, thereby creating a comprehensive genetic resource for genome-wide association testing.</p><p id="P28">Our expression and splicing QTL analyses revealed that molQTL are enriched for SVs, emphasizing their crucial role in complex trait variation, as previously reported in cattle and other species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. We observed that 0.6% of eQTL and 1.9% of sQTL had an SV as the top variant. These proportions of SV molQTL were between 2.1-times and 14-times greater than those reported in short-read-based studies in bulls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. More than half of the SV molQTL were due to insertions that were largely inaccessible with short reads. Notably, the number of the SV molQTL nearly doubled when accounting for SVs in complete LD with a lead small variant, increasing to 1.4% of eQTL and 3.6% of sQTL. These estimates are more comparable to short- and long-read based SV molQTL studies that were conducted in humans with higher coverage sequence data and larger sample sizes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Contrary to other SV molQTL studies, we did not observe a statistical difference in effect size magnitude between small variants and SVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. However, we identified multiple large effect molQTL where small variants were prioritized as candidate causal variants despite the presence of compelling candidate causal SVs. We suspect that several large allelic substitution effects were erroneously attributed to the small variants due to imperfect SV and small variant genotyping, which introduces some bias in this assessment.</p><p id="P29">The forced genotyping approach substantially reduced the proportion of missing genotypes for all types of SVs. Yet, many SVs were missed as molQTL due to erroneous SV genotypes and an unequal distribution of missing genotypes between SVs and small variants. Almost one-third of the manually examined molQTL and all manually examined large duplications were affected by imperfectly genotyped small variants and SVs. Using the manually revised genotypes, we identified compelling candidate causal SVs in many of the examined molQTL where the summary statistics from the association tests initially prioritized small variants. We were able to attribute some of the genotyping errors to insufficient coverage. This suggests that an average HiFi coverage higher than the 13.5-fold obtained for our cohort will produce more accurate genotypes for both small variants and SVs which will benefit association testing. Such findings also indicate that SVs are even stronger enriched among molQTLs than reflected by the results from the statistical association testing. Imputation can enhance statistical power and mitigate some of the missing genotype biases in association testing that we observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. However, the accuracy of imputation can be much lower for SVs than small variants, which negatively impacts association testing and causal variant identification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Since it remains unclear whether the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, we did not attempt to impute missing genotypes neither for SVs nor for small variants. Generating high coverage long-read data at the sample-sizes required for detecting QTL is becoming increasingly feasible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, which will reduce the missingness, thereby improving the statistical power of association studies utilising long-reads for variant discovery and genotyping.</p><p id="P30">Genotyping errors within complex regions, such as those containing multiallelic SVs or tandem repeats, and an inappropriate merging of SVs within these regions likely caused the observed underrepresentation of SV molQTL annotated as tandem repeats. In addition, the lack of reads spanning large variants resulted in erroneously genotyped large SVs, including some molecular phenotype-associated variants, which remained undetected by our association analyses. This contributed to the lack of association of gene-containing duplications and likely contributed to the observed underrepresentation of LINE and LTR transposable element molQTL, which have previously been associated with large impacts on gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.
