However, its clinical translation is hindered by the lack of rapid, reliable, and label-free techniques for quantifying and characterizing freshly isolated mitochondria. Current methods are often time-consuming, costly, or require pre-labeled sample, limiting their suitability for routine quality control in mitochondrial research, engineering, and biotherapy. In this study, we employ interferometric light microscopy (ILM) via Videodrop technology to assess mitochondrial concentration and size with high precision and efficiency. Mitochondria were isolated from human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) and comprehensively characterized, including through functional and structural marker expression, protein quantification, membrane integrity, and electron microscopy. ILM measurements showed strong correlation and robust accuracy compared to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and total protein assays. Our findings establish ILM as a label-free, rapid, and scalable approach for mitochondrial quantification and sizing, paving the way for standardized quality control in mitochondrial biotherapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Mitochondria transplantation</kwd><kwd>mitochondria transfer</kwd><kwd>Interferometric light microscopy</kwd><kwd>Videodrop</kwd><kwd>Biotherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Mitochondria are double-membrane organelles found in eukaryotic cells. They play critical roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis, energy production, and metabolism. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been observed in various diseases characterized by metabolic imbalance, including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular conditions, gastrointestinal diseases, and neuromuscular conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. To date, there is a lack of well-established treatment approaches, specifically tackling the prevention or reduction of mitochondrial dysfunction for the improvement of energy metabolism in these diseases.</p><p id="P3">Physiologically, mitochondria can be transferred to recipient cells via tunneling nanotubes, intercellular dendrites, extracellular vesicle (EV) cargo, or through direct extrusion from donor cells, followed by internalization by recipient cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Interestingly, studies have shown that blood in a normal physiological state contains a significant number of circulating cell-free, respiratory-competent mitochondria, ranging from 200,000 to 3.7 million per milliliter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Inspired by these natural mechanisms of mitochondrial transfer, exogenous mitochondrial transplantation has been proposed as a potential cell-free biotherapeutic approach for modulating energy metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. This concept was first introduced by McCully et al. in 2009 through the local injection of healthy mitochondria into a rabbit model of ischemic heart injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. More recently, mitochondrial transplantation has gained further validation through a 2017 study conducted at Boston Children’s Hospital, which investigated autologous mitochondrial transplantation in the heart as a treatment for myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, particularly in pediatric patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in mitochondria-based biotherapies with research exploring their potential for treating various medical conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Currently, more than 10 clinical trials on mitochondrial transplantation are underway worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, highlighting the potential of this approach in medical practice. In line with this growing interest, several companies have recently been launched, focusing on mitochondria as a medicinal product, including Cellvie (2018, USA), LUCA Science Inc. (2018, Japan), Mitrix Bio (2018, USA), and MitoSense Inc. (2019, USA). However, several challenges must still be addressed before mitochondrial transplantation can be widely implemented in clinical practice. These include identifying the optimal cell sources, refining technologies for mitochondrial isolation and purification, establishing robust methods for quantification and characterization, developing strategies for long-term storage, optimizing pharmaceutical formulations, and designing effective delivery systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">As a cell source, human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) offer significant advantages for regenerative medicine due to their accessibility, immunomodulatory properties, and capacity for mitochondrial donation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Additionally, they secrete a diverse array of bioactive molecules, including growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular vesicles (EVs)—collectively known as the secretome—which confer anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and tissue-repairing properties, making them highly effective for various medical conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. hMSCs can be obtained from various sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, including bone marrow, adipose tissue, and umbilical cord, and can be expanded in culture without losing their therapeutic potential. Moreover, their low immunogenicity enables their use in allogeneic settings without provoking strong immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. However, compared to traditional cell therapy, which involves administering live cells directly into the patient’s body, cell-free therapy using hMSCs eliminates the risks associated with the engraftment of living cells, such as immune rejection or uncontrolled proliferation. It also provides multifaceted benefits, including tissue repair and immunomodulation, making it a promising and safer alternative to cell-based approaches. For similar reasons, hMSCs are considered one of the best cell sources for cell-free biotherapy based on mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, as demonstrated in both preclinical studies and recent clinical trials. This approach represents a potentially revolutionary advancement in regenerative medicine, with a wide range of clinical applications.</p><p id="P6">Nevertheless, efficiently measuring mitochondrial concentration and size has become a critical challenge for determining mitochondrial characteristics and yield before transplantation. Due to the absence of a simple, rapid, reliable, and universally accepted quantification method, the appropriate dose of mitochondria for transplantation has yet to be standardized. This hampers the ability to compare data across different studies and to establish therapeutic doses, making it difficult to achieve successful mitochondrial transplantation and to translate this approach from bench to bedside. Moreover, due to the instability of extracellular mitochondria—particularly the loss of viability and function following freezing and thawing processes—research in mitochondrial biology and biotherapy has primarily focused on freshly isolated mitochondria. Additionally, most current mitochondrial isolation methods are time-consuming, which can reduce mitochondrial quality and impact transplantation success. Therefore, identifying a rapid and straightforward method for mitochondrial characterization following isolation and prior to transplantation is crucial for ensuring the success and efficacy of mitochondrial transplantation therapies.</p><p id="P7">So far, various techniques have been developed to determine the concentration and size of isolated mitochondria. For concentration measurement, these methods mainly include the use of a hemocytometer, immunofluorescent staining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, flowcytometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, total mitochondrial protein amount<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, or particle counters based on impedance measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Some of these techniques, such as flow cytometry and particle counters, can also provide diameter information for isolated mitochondria preparations in addition to counting. However, most of these widely used methods are time-consuming, expensive, imprecise (not automated), or require sample pre-labeling. Techniques like particle counters based on impedance measurement are automated and can provide diameter information, but they require large sample volumes and electrolyte solutions, have no complex workflow, and come with high running costs and a limited size detection range.</p><p id="P8">In 2016, an analytical device was developed for rapid quantification and sizing of viruses from environmental sources based on interferometric light microscopy (ILM). Since its development, this technic was used for physical characterization of microorganisms in marine water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, small cellular particles in natural sources such as blood preparations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, viral vectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> (lentivirus and adenovirus), bacteriophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> or extracellular vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The Videodrop is a new, label-free, highly time-saving and cost-effective setup that uses ILM for particle detection and tracking.</p><p id="P9">In this study, we leveraged Videodrop as a novel and powerful setup to investigate the feasibility of using the ILM technique serving as a rapid and essential quality control analysis for isolated human mitochondria assessing their concentration and diameter. Mitochondria were isolated from hMSCs and underwent comprehensive characterization, encompassing outer membrane marker expression, viability, protein concentration, functional components, membrane integrity, physical and morphological features. Subsequently, the protein concentration of mitochondria was compared to the concentration measured by ILM. Finally, the size characteristics of mitochondria, as determined by TEM, were juxtaposed with the data obtained through ILM. The primary objective was to ascertain whether Videodrop is sensitive enough to precisely and reliably measure the concentration and size of hMSCs-derived mitochondria, serving as an initial quality control step for bioproduction and biotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Isolation of viable and structurally intact mitochondria from hMSCs</title><p id="P10">Human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were successfully expanded in 2D culture flasks. Mitochondria were isolated from hMSCs using the Abcam mitochondria isolation kit in nine independent experiments - each with varying cell numbers (n=9) ranging from 15 to 270 million cells determined by Nucloecounter. The number of cells (in millions) for each experiment is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The cell viability measured by Nucleocounter was between 92-97% for all the experiments.</p><p id="P11">Isolated mitochondria were characterized in terms of their (i) <bold>viability</bold>, using the MitoTracker Red probe; (ii) <bold>identity</bold>, via immunolabeling of TOM20, a receptor component of the TOM complex (translocase of the outer membrane) in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), as well as Western blotting of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes and membrane integrity markers; (iii) <bold>protein concentration</bold> using the Bradford assay; and (iv) <bold>morphology</bold> via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with negative staining as well as cross-sectioning techniques. Finally, ILM technology was employed using the Videodrop setup to physically characterize the isolated mitochondria in terms of their <bold>quantity</bold> and <bold>size</bold> (hydrodynamic diameter), side by side, compared to the commonly used characterization techniques mentioned above.</p><p id="P12">MitoTracker Red CMXRos probe was used to stain freshly isolated mitochondria. It is a permeable fluorescent dye containing a mildly thiol-reactive chloromethyl moiety whose accumulation relies on the mitochondrial membrane potential (via the electrostatic interactions of the dye’s positive charge and the negatively charged mitochondrial matrix) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The results confirmed the isolation of numerous viable MitoTracker Red+ mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) for all independent experiments (n=9). Counterstaining of samples for the mitochondrial outer membrane marker TOM20 and MitoTracker Red confirmed the presence of multiple MitoTracker Red+/TOM20+ mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Additionally, several TOM20+/MitoTracker-particles were detected following double staining, indicating the presence of non-viable or non-intact mitochondria. This may be attributed to the fact that immunolabeling of mitochondria is a time-consuming process, which could result in the partial loss of mitochondrial integrity.</p><p id="P13">The structural integrity of isolated mitochondria was evaluated using Western blotting (WB) analysis (20 µg protein) with the MitoProfile membrane integrity antibody cocktail, which contains 5 antibodies against representative proteins for each of the primary mitochondrial structures: Outer Membrane – Porin; Intermembrane Space – Cytochrome C; Inner Membrane – Complex Vα and Complex III Core 1; Matrix Space – Cyclophilin D. The data show the coexistence of all these structural proteins in the hMSCs-derived mitochondrial preparations (from three different preparations), confirming the isolation of structurally intact mitochondria proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The presence of TOM20 (another outer membrane marker) was further confirmed by WB of TOM20 protein levels. The post-spin supernatant was used as a control and loaded with the same total protein amount as the mitochondrial samples (20 µg). The results confirmed minimal loss of Cytochrome C, Cyclophilin D, Porin, Complex Vα, Complex III, or TOM20 in the supernatant after the mitochondria isolation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c, i-SN to iii-SN</xref>), therefore validating the isolation method.</p><p id="P14">Mitochondrial quality was further assessed by WB analysis based on the relative levels of the 5 oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes: Complex I subunit NDUFB8, Complex II subunit 30kDa, Complex III subunit Core 2, Complex IV subunit II, and ATP synthase subunit alpha. The antibodies in the OXPHOS cocktail were selected because they target subunits that are labile when their respective complexes are not assembled. The concurrent presence of total OXPHOS complexes was observed in the isolated mitochondria preparation, confirming the presence of functional mitochondrial elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d, i-iii</xref> shows representative analysis from the triplicate experiments). In contrast, the post-spin supernatant exhibited minimal expression of OXPHOS complexes, confirming the successful isolation of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-d, i-SN to iii-SN</xref>). The expression of GAPDH, a housekeeping protein, was detected in both the mitochondria samples and their supernatants. The presence of this cytoplasmic marker alongside 11 structural and functional mitochondrial proteins suggests that the preparations are enriched in mitochondria but not entirely pure.</p><p id="P15">Morphological and ultrastructural integrity of the isolated mitochondria was further confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Indeed, SEM imaging revealed multiple spherical-to oval-shaped structures with intact outer surfaces, ranging in size from 0.2 to 2 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Furthermore, TEM images demonstrated the presence of intact mitochondria at the ultrastructural level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Mitochondria are known for their high plasticity, enabling them to alter their size and shape (ranging from oval to spherical) in response to various cellular conditions and metabolic demands. Additionally, mitochondrial size can vary across different cell types and can be affected by isolation process. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have specifically reported the size characteristics of mitochondria isolated from hMSCs. Therefore, the aim was to investigate the size characteristics of isolated mitochondria derived from hMSCs.</p><p id="P16">To achieve this, three key parameters were measured for each mitochondria-like structure observed in the TEM images of cross-sectioned samples images: the maximum axis diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, shown in yellow), the minimum axis diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, shown in red), and the average of these two diameters. A total of 416 mitochondria-like structures were analyzed across four independent experiments (n = 4), with 3–5 measurement fields per experiment at ×25k magnification.</p><p id="P17">The results showed that the maximum size ranged from 116 to 1700 nm, with a mean maximum diameter of 471.9 ± 44 nm. The minimum diameter ranged from 92 to 1049 nm, with a mean minimum diameter of 344.4 ± 26 nm. The overall average diameter ranged from 105 to 1346 nm, with a mean value of 408.2 ± 35 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). These values are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.</p><p id="P18">Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between the maximum, minimum or the average diameters of the isolated mitochondria-like structures. However, the mitochondria-like structures were found to have conserved partially the anisotropic geometry after isolation as illustrated by the difference between max and min diameters. The average size distribution of isolated mitochondria-like structures is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref> showed that hMSC-derived and isolated mitochondria are highly polydisperse. At the ultrastructural level, approximately 5.29%, 0.72%, and 1.92% of all quantified mitochondria-like structures had diameters exceeding 1 µm based on maximum, minimum, and average diameter measurements, respectively. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> summarizes the size characteristics of the isolated mitochondria-like structures.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Mitochondria concentration measurement by ILM</title><p id="P19">The Videodrop instrument (Myriade, France) is a label-free, rapid, and cost-effective method that allows sub-micrometric particle detection and tracking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). It is able to characterize the size (hydrodynamic diameter) and the concentration of (bio)nanoparticles using only few microliters (5 to 10µL at ~10<sup>9</sup> part/mL) of the precious samples in less than a minute per sample with the mains advantages of being easy-to-use, fast and in a non-denaturant manner and operated without any fluidics (reduced probability of bubbles, no clogging). The system does not require prior calibration nor maintenance from the user. Additionally, it can be used to characterize nano-objects in viscous or complex fluids such as pharmaceutical formulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">The Videodrop is a transmission brightfield microscope employed as an interferometric light microscope that allows the visualization of sub-micrometric particle from interference patterns. The system contains a camera capturing videos, and is associated with an image processing algorithm able to detect and track nanoparticles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows the Videodrop instrument, its optical set-up and depicts the principle of the measurement based on ILM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Counting particles allows to measure the concentration, while tracking their Brownian motion enables to measure individually their hydrodynamical diameter by using the Stokes–Einstein equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD2">Eq. 2</xref>) and to provide size distribution by plotting the number of particles for hydrodynamic diameter ranging from 50 to 1000 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b-c</xref> show the software measurement views.</p><p id="P21">The interferometry-based analytical method was utilized to simultaneously quantify the concentration and hydrodynamic size distribution of hMSC-derived mitochondria using Videodrop. First, we focused on quantifying mitochondria concentration. Isolated mitochondria samples from the 9 independent experiments summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> were analyzed separately using Videodrop.</p><p id="P22">The sensitivity and accuracy of the Videodrop for concentration and diameter assessment depend on relative positioning of the sample concentration regarding the optimal range of the instrument. Indeed, an over-estimation of the size can be observed when the sample concentration is too high. For nanoparticles such as extracellular vesicles, this range is known to be between 10<sup>8</sup> and 10<sup>10</sup> (centered around 1*10<sup>9</sup>) part/mL. In order to estimate the concentration windows that gives the most reliable Videodrop measurements for mitochondria concentration (ie the linear range for the concentration of mitochondria), measurements were done at 5-7 serial dilutions for each mitochondria preparation (N=9). Each Videodrop measurement was performed on triplicate samples with a set of minimum 300 particles to be tracked. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-f</xref> depicts representative interferometry images and the corresponding size distribution of an experiment in which 6 serial dilutions (serial dilution factors 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32, ie dilution factors of d50, d100, d200, d400, d800, and d1600 from the isolated mitochondria samples) were analyzed by Videodrop. As expected, interferometry images visibly show a decrease in the particle density while the dilution factor increases. It is observed that the mean diameter of particles seems to converge to a value while the dilution factor increases. The particle mean size influences the size distribution of the particles, with higher concentrations exhibiting larger particle sizes possibly due to particle aggregation or because mitochondria interact with each other mechanically reducing their movement (sub-diffusion) and inducing therefore an under-estimation of their size. Indeed, at the highest dilution factor, the mean size was lower (277 ± 2 nm), while at the lowest dilution factors, it was higher (441 ± 4 nm). At low concentrations, limited particle sampling can reduce measurement reliability.</p><p id="P23">Identifying the accurate windows for mitochondria concentration measurement is equivalent to identifying the range for which the measured concentration is linear (proportional) with the theoretical concentration (and inversely proportional to the dilution factor). As is it not possible to retrieve the real theoretical concentration, we defined as the theoretical concentration the value that should be the closest for the real number of particles per unit of volume. We developed two different methods to estimate the “theoretical” concentration of each sample based on the combination of measurements performed at different dilution factors, by either (method V1) identifying the concentration that was the closest to 1*10<sup>9</sup> part/mL, which is the center of the optimal working range for concentration quantification using Videodrop, or (method V2) to average all the concentrations that are given a director coefficient close to 1 when fitting the plot of log(measured concentration) as a function of log(1/dilution factor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig3.g-h</xref>). A schematic of the method V2 can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1</xref>.</p><p id="P24">Once the theoretical concentration was found for each of the 9 independent experiments individually, we plotted the measured concentration as a function of the theoretical concentration for the 9 experiments on the same graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3-g and h</xref> for method V1 and V2, respectively). First, we can observe for both methods a good linearity between the theoretical and the measured concentration. Second, while method 2 is more robust because of the consideration of several measurements (performed at different dilution factors), the results obtained were of similar efficiency with both methods. Indeed, by comparing the linear fitting performance (ie R<sup>2</sup> coefficient values) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g and 3h</xref>, we can see that both methods gave similar fitting coefficient and similar R<sup>2</sup> coefficients.</p><p id="P25">Using these complementary methods, the linear concentration range for Videodrop was established, highlighting the particle density range where the system accurately measures mitochondrial particle concentrations across different experiments. Within this range, particle numbers measured by Videodrop varied linearly with particle density, ensuring reliable and consistent quantification.</p><p id="P26">Moreover, our results indicate that the optimal density of interferometry signals for mitochondria-rich preparations falls within the range of 20-30 orange and 5-10 white signals per frame (totaling 30-40 particles). This corresponds to a measured concentration range of 9.5 × 10<sup>8</sup> to 2.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> particles/mL (intersected range of V1 and V2 methods), based on tracking a minimum of 300 particles.</p><p id="P27">The particle size distribution obtained from individual particle tracking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-f</xref>) showed consistent profiles within the above determined linear concentration range.</p><p id="P28">Interestingly, thanks to ILM quantification, we observed a good correlation between the particle quantity and the cell quantity from which mitochondria were isolated. The total particle counts, as measured by Videodrop for the nine experiments with varying cell numbers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>. A linear correlation was found between the total particle count measured by Videodrop and the total cell number (measured by NucleoCounter®) originally used for the production of these particles, with an <italic>R</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> value of 0.9649 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Videodrop data analysis revealed a mean production of 3513 ± 148 particles per cell.</p><p id="P29">To further validate the reliability of mitochondria concentration measured by Videodrop, protein concentration of mitochondria sample (n=9) was measured by Bradford protein assay. Protein concentration measurement is a widely used method to determine the mitochondria concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.

Indeed, Videodrop allows to follow the particles in time. From the 2D coordinates of each particle, the mean square displacement (MSD) is calculated.

While a hemocytometer can be a cost-effective method, its accuracy is highly debated, as it relies on the experimenter’s technique and is prone to personal errors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Immunofluorescent staining with mitochondria membrane potential indicators (e.g., MitoTracker probes) or specific markers (e.g., anti-TOM20) is commonly used to assess mitochondria number<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.

However, the main drawback of this method is that the mitochondria often aggregate and overlap, making it inaccurate and unreproducible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, as confirmed also by our measurements of TOM20+ mitochondria. Furthermore, size quantification via immunofluorescent staining is limited by the diffraction properties of the light. Indeed, the size of the fluorescent detected object matches the real size of the object only if its size is above the diffraction limit of the light (~250nm). For smaller objects, which concerns the majority of the nanoparticles detected in mitochondria enriched samples, the size will be overestimated, which is consistent with our observations. Alternative methods like flow cytometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and nanoflow cytometry (NanoFCM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> can quantify isolated mitochondria with immunofluorescence staining.

These methods rely on a standard protein curve to compare the sample’s total protein content. In this study, we measured mitochondrial protein concentration and found strong correlation between Videodrop particle concentration and mitochondrial protein levels. However, the main limitation of these methods is their reliance on total protein content, which can vary based on mitochondrial purity. Purity is heavily influenced by the isolation method, experimental conditions, and user variability. Since total protein measurement requires mitochondrial lysis, these methods do not provide size (structural) information, which is a crucial mechanical characteristic for assessing mitochondrial integrity and purity. Non-viable mitochondria, previously frozen mitochondria, mitochondrial fractions (proteins, complexes I–V), mitochondrial DNA and RNA, and exogenous ATP or ADP have been shown to be ineffective in providing cytoprotection following mitochondrial transplantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>.

The Coulter principle, based on changes in impedance as particles pass through an orifice, enables measurement of particle volume without relying on particle characteristics like refractive index. Typically used in hematology to count and size blood cells, Coulter counters can measure particles ranging from 200 nm to 1600 µm. Thus, Coulter counters can overestimate the diameter and undercount the number of isolated mitochondria due to their minimum detection size of 200 nm. Moreover, Coulter counters require significant amount of electrolyte (5 mL minimum), limiting its use to hydrophilic particles in large sample containers like beakers or vials, which can lead to low particle concentration. Finally, the high running costs and expensive workflow make it less practical for routine use.</p><p id="P51">In this study, we used a Videodrop instrument, a light interferometry-based method, to characterize isolated mitochondria for biotherapy. The process involves pipetting 5-7 µL of the sample into a small well on a glass coverslip, followed by cleaning after measurement. Settings such as particle detection threshold, tracking length, viscosity, and minimum particle count can be adjusted based on particle properties (e.g., refractive index, density). The optical system records particle movement through short video blocks (100 frames at 140 fps) acquired successively until the minimum particle count is reached. The precision improves with the number of particles (&gt;300nm for all our measurements). Image processing allow to retrieve the interferometric signal where submicrometric particles (&gt;80nm) can be followed in time. All detected particles contribute to particle concentration, while the hydrodynamic radius is determined from tracked particles only.

To gain insight into the particle diameter that ILM was capable of measuring, we conducted a series of TEM analyses. We measured the minimum, maximum, and average diameter of objects exceeding (or not) the 80 nm or 1000 nm size detection limits of Videodrop, in both TEM images of cross-sectioned samples (with higher resolution) and TEM images of negative staining (with lower resolution). Considering all particles, our results demonstrate that the diameter detected by ILM (Videodrop) aligns with the mean maximum particle diameters detected in TEM images of negative staining (276 nm) but not with other measured diameters (minimum or average diameters by negative staining or all diameters measured by cross-sectioning methods). Since electron microscopy provides images with very high resolution, this was expected, as smaller particles generated during mitochondria isolation could decrease the mean particle diameter compared to interferometric light microscopy. TEM analysis revealed that approximately 5-7% (negative staining) and 18-20% (cross-sectioning) of total particles had diameters smaller than 80 nm, while particles exceeding 1000 nm were much less common (~0.4% for negative staining and ~0.2% for cross-sectioning TEM methods). Interestingly, reanalyzing the TEM data—considering the Videodrop’s lower size detection limit (80 nm)—no significant differences were observed between the mean particle diameter measured by Videodrop and the maximum or average diameters detected by negative staining TEM. However, the Videodrop mean diameter was still significantly higher compared to the mean diameters measured by cross-sectioning TEM, even after the 80 nm cut-off. These results suggest that while ILM, as used in Videodrop, may not provide the same high resolution as TEM of cross-sectioned samples, it is still sufficiently accurate and reliable for detecting particle diameter, similar to TEM of negative staining. It has been reported that negative-stain images inherently possess higher contrast compared to cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), which has also been widely employed to detect isolated mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. This could be partly due to the use of heavy metal stains in negative staining, which enhance the visibility of the particles or structures of interest. Additionally, different sample processing for TEM negative staining vs cross section may affect the size of the particles. Also, for ILM the quantification of the mitochondria hydrodynamic diameter is based on the Stokes-Einstein equation, which is valid for spherical object submitted to thermal agitation inducing Brownian motion. While there is nothing indicating that mitochondria may exhibit motion other than due to thermal agitation, mitochondria exhibit a wide range of shapes from spherical to elongated. Here, by using ILM we assume that the Stokes-Einstein equation is valid and therefore we supposed that the objects are spherical. For TEM image analysis, we considered both the min diameter and the max diameter by calculating the average diameter. For ILM, it is not sure whether the hydrodynamic diameter obtained is related to the max diameter, the min diameter or a size in between both diameters. However, as hydrodynamic diameter measured by ILM was close to the maximum diameter measured by negative staining TEM, the diffusive behavior of mitochondria may resemble to the Brownian motion of spherical particles of size corresponding to the max diameter. Additionally, ILM size measurement gives access to the hydrodynamic diameter, which is usually higher than the geometric radius for nanoparticles. Nevertheless, ILM measurement is the closest to the size obtained by TEM and highly less time consuming than the other techniques, ILM should still be considered as a potential method for assessing mitochondria’s size as a quality control tool.</p><p id="P55">In this paper, we conducted side-by-side experiments comparing mitochondria characterization using TOM20 IF microscopy, TEM, Bradford assay for protein measurement, and Videodrop (label-free method) on the same samples. We observed frequent aggregation and overlapping of TOM20+ mitochondria in confocal images. Our results showed a significant difference in the mean diameter of TOM20+ particles measured by HCS Studio Cell Analysis software (938 nm) compared to Videodrop (333 nm) and TEM (219 nm for negative staining, 193 nm for cross-sectioning, and 457 nm for mitochondria-like structures). This difference may be due to the light diffraction limit. According to TEM quantification the majority of the particles contained in the mitochondria enriched fraction are above the limit of diffraction of the light (~250nm). Meaning that the size of the fluorescent objects is going to be higher than the real particle size, therefore inducing an overestimation of the size by confocal fluorescent microscopy technique. No significant differences were found between the mean diameters measured by Videodrop and TEM methods, with results remaining consistent even after introducing cut-offs. Bahnemann et al. reported a size range of 0.5–2.5 μm for CHO-K1-derived mitochondria isolated using Dounce or ultrasound homogenization methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, which were labeled with the same anti-TOM20 antibody as in our study. These findings, altogether reinforced the advantage of Videodrop’s label-free interferometry for accurate size measurement.</p><p id="P56">Particle quantification data showed a lower concentration measured by the TOM20 immunofluorescence method compared to interferometry analysis by Videodrop. This discrepancy may stem from TOM20+ mitochondria structures typically being larger in mitochondria-rich samples. Also, the resolution of confocal microscopy does not allow to differentiate two close nanoparticles from one bigger. High-resolution TEM cross-sectioning revealed a mean size of 421 nm for mitochondria-like structures, which is significantly lower than that measured by TOM20 immunofluorescence, but aligns with the size observed in TEM images. These results suggest that conventional immunolabeling methods can lead to mitochondrial aggregation, hindering accurate quantification of isolated mitochondria compared to TEM or Videodrop methods.</p><p id="P57">Finally, it is important to note that, as a label-free method, the accuracy of Videodrop particle counter measurements for isolated mitochondria size or density largely depends on sample purification. which in turn is influenced by the cell/tissue source and isolation methods. Indeed, ILM does not allow to differentiate between mitochondria-like objects and other particles included in cell secretome. Whether the findings of this study apply to hMSCs-mitochondria purified using different techniques or derived from other cell sources, such as adipose-derived tissues, can only be confirmed through direct comparison.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P58">Overall, our findings, which include comparisons between ILM by Videodrop, protein assays by Bradford method, negative staining and cross-sectioned TEM, and TOM20 IF methods, demonstrate the reliability of Videodrop as an efficient device for quality control analysis of freshly isolated hMSCs-derived mitochondria, suitable for use in bioprocessing, engineering, production, or dosing for biotherapeutic applications. Additionally, Videodrop, to our knowledge, is the most time-efficient label-free particle counter, making it ideal for mitochondrial transplantation studies or biotherapies requiring rapid characterization and quantification of freshly isolated mitochondria before transplantation. The data presented in this study should have broad applications in the emerging field of mitochondria transplantation, particularly in translational studies that require quick and efficient characterization of small volumes (few microliters) of precious human mitochondria in preclinical, pharmaceutical, or clinical settings.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Culture of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs)</title><p id="P59">The mitochondria were isolated from commercially purchased human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (CellEasy batch number N°9297). The hMSCs were cultured under standard tissue culture condition, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were grown in T175 culture flasks using α-Minimal Essential Medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Twenty mL of media was used to ensure complete coverage of the T150 flask. Medium was changed every 3 days. MSCs were grown to 90% confluence before being passage. Cells were lifted from the flask first by aspirating the media and washing in their flasks with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Gibco, Thermofisher). Washed cells were then incubated in 0.05% trypsin ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, Gibco, Thermofisher) for 2 to 3 minutes in an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The flasks were tapped to help mechanical detachment of the cells. An equal volume of α-MEM with 10% FBS was added to neutralize the trypsin. The cell solution was then centrifuged at 300 g for 10 mins and the supernatant was discarded. Cells were quantified using the NucleoCounter® NC-200™ automated cell analyzer (NC-200, Chemometec) to determine the total cell counts and cell viability for each experiment.

Samples were diluted in PBS 1X at 5-7 serial dilutions (d1, d50, d100, d200, d400, d800, d1600). Each dilution was measured in triplicates. Signals from the PBS 1X were checked and always found under the detection limit. For the measurement, drops of 7 µL each were loaded on a round-shaped cover slip using a micropipette before lifting the stage towards the objective. The software QVIR 2.6.0 (Myriade, Paris, France) was then used to illuminate the sample using a 2 W blue LED light. The images were recorded by a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor high-resolution high-speed camera. Each particle scatters the incident light and behave like a secondary source of light. From the interferences of these secondary light sources, an interference pattern is generated by the software. This allows sub-micrometric particles to be detected quickly and followed in time. The concentration of the particles corresponds to the number of detected particles within the measured volume, which depends on the microscope characteristics and the particles’ size. The hydrodynamic radius was estimated by tracking the position of the imaged particle within the recorded movie. Indeed, the particles are moving due to thermal agitation. As passive particles in a pure viscous medium, they exhibit a Brownian motion, where the mean square displacement follows this relation: <disp-formula id="FD1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>Δ</mml:mtext><mml:msup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P67"><italic>D</italic> is the diffusion coefficient and <italic>t</italic> the time.
