We find that zoonotic infections in Thailand are caused by isolates from diverse globally distributed porcine pathogenic lineages in addition to two related Thai lineages CC104 and CC233 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). CC104 and CC233 predominantly carry a serotype 2 capsule and appear to be geographically restricted to Thailand, with the closest relatives being a set of double locus variants of serotype 7 recovered from diseased pigs in North America, Europe and Asia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Both lineages have emerged recently: the dates of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of CC104 and CC233 were 1990 (95% Posterior 1987-1992) and 2002 (95% Posterior 2000-2004) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). These emergence dates are 7-8 years before the first reports of zoonotic infections caused by isolates belonging to both clades (1998 for CC104 and 2009 for CC233) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> Phylogeographic analysis suggests that the MRCA of CC104 and CC233 originated in Asia, however, uneven and sparse sampling across different geographic regions make these reconstructions difficult, with none of the ancestral state posterior probabilities being high (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Both CC104 and CC233 appear to have undergone capsular switching from a serotype 7 to a serotype 2 capsule, which is associated with gain of zoonotic potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> We performed an ancestral state reconstruction of the capsule locus to model these capsular switching events. Our findings suggest that MRCA for both the CC104 and CC233 lineages was likely a serotype 7 strain and the expansion of both CC104 and CC233 was preceded by two capsule switching events where both lineages acquired a serotype 2 capsule (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Next, we investigated the origin of the serotype 2 capsule present in both CC104 and CC233. To do so, we reconstructed a serotype 2 capsular locus phylogeny including all serotype 2 isolates from Thailand, supplemented with serotype 2 isolates from our global collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). This showed that the serotype 2 capsule loci of CC104 and CC233 fall within the diversity of the serotype 2 capsule loci of CC1. Comparisons of mean pairwise nucleotide distance in core genes and those within the serotype 2 capsule locus revealed that despite being very divergent at a core genome level, genes within the serotype 2 capsule loci of CC1, CC104 and, CC233 were almost identical, with only 1 SNP difference between the most common serotype 2 locus sequence found in CC1 and the most common serotype 2 locus found in CC104 and CC233 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Coupled with the fact that the published estimate of the date for CC1’s MRCA precedes our estimated MRCA dates for CC104 and CC233 (1850s, vs 1990 and 2002) suggests that CC104 and CC233 have acquired their serotype 2 locus from CC1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> As many CC104 and CC233 isolates have identical serotype 2 loci, it is possible that it may have transferred from CC1 to one of these lineages and then from that lineage onto the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Our results also reveal other instances of the horizontal transfer of the serotype 2 capsule locus from CC1 to other CCs, revealing that these transfers are not isolated events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>The CC104 lineage has acquired many antimicrobial resistance determinants through mobile genetic elements</title><p id="P19">Acquisition of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes through horizontal gene transfer can increase the fitness of novel bacterial lineages in settings of high antibiotic usage such as pig farms in Thailand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> We therefore examined whether AMR could have promoted the emergence of CC104 and CC233 in Thailand.

In streptococci, resistance against β-lactams is predominantly driven by amino acid changes in their penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). We combined a recently described multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) method with hierarchical clustering to categorise a representative selection of 78 Thai isolates into genetic clusters based on the amino acid variation in their PBPs, and compared the correlation between PBP types and β-lactam MICs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>).</p><p id="P22">We identified 9 clusters of PBP proteins carried by Thai <italic>S. suis</italic> isolates. Cluster 1 includes the majority of susceptible isolates and was composed of all the isolates from the zoonotic and pathogenic lineages CC1, CC25 CC28, CC94, and some isolates from CC104 and CC233 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">13</xref>). There was a strong positive correlation (<italic>m</italic> = 0.043, rho = 0.932, and p&lt;0·001) between divergence from PBP type 1 (the most common PBP type from Cluster 1) and increased MIC against penicillin and ceftriaxone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). All isolates from the main CC104-MDR subpopulation were in Cluster 5, which displayed increased MICs for both penicillin (mean Δlog<sub>2</sub> = 1·5) and ceftriaxone (mean Δlog<sub>2</sub> = 2·4) when compared to Cluster 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">13</xref>). CC233 isolates had a diverse set of PBP types and were spread across clusters 1, 4, 6, and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Isolates from Clusters 4 (CC233), 6 (CC1, CC233, and Singletons) and 7 (CC1, CC104, CC233, and Singletons) had increased MICs against ceftriaxone (mean Δlog<sub>2</sub> = 2·8) and penicillin (mean Δlog<sub>2</sub> = 3·77) compared to Cluster 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">13</xref>). Acquisition of non-susceptible PBP types in the zoonotic lineages CC104 and CC233 appears to be recombination driven, with all three PBP genes displaying evidence of multiple recombination events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">The emergence of the two novel zoonotic <italic>S. suis</italic> lineages CC104 and CC233 coincided with a switch from a serotype 7 capsule to the serotype 2 capsule acquired from the dominant global zoonotic clade. Their evolution is also characterised by the rapid acquisition of multiple AMR determinants, through horizontal gene transfer. Both lineages gained increased resistance against β-lactams through recombination within their Penicillin Binding Protein (PBPs) genes. Additionally, a recent CC104 subpopulation (CC104-MDR) acquired multiple mobile genetic elements carrying a large number of AMR determinants, resulting in multi-drug resistance. The recent emergence of these novel multi-drug resistant zoonotic lineages not only indicates that human infections are not restricted to isolates belonging to zoonotic lineage CC1 as previously suggested but also that novel zoonotic lineages will continue to emerge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup></p><p id="P24">While a recent study found that the main globally distributed pathogenic <italic>S. suis</italic> lineages emerged between the beginning of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> we estimate that CC104 and CC233 emerged much more recently in the late 20<sup>th</sup> and early 21<sup>st</sup> century. These dates follow the intensification of pig farming in Thailand which started in the 1960s after the import of commercial pig breeds from the United Kingdom and the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> It is possible that these imports also led to the introduction of pathogenic lineages of <italic>S. suis,</italic> including CC1. As CC104 and CC233 have not been identified outside of Thailand it is likely that these lineages emerged within Thailand and have not yet spread to other countries. Nevertheless, as whole genome sequencing of <italic>S. suis</italic> isolates is uneven across different countries, it is possible that they have spread to other countries but have yet to be detected. In particular, countries importing live pigs from Thailand (Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam) are at risk of acquiring CC104 and CC233.</p><p id="P25">The emergence of CC104 and CC233 as zoonotic agents is marked by the acquisition of a serotype 2 capsule, a common feature of zoonotic <italic>S. suis</italic> strains. For instance, the Dutch zoonotic lineage CC20 diverged from the European porcine pathogenic CC16 lineage following a switch in its capsule from serotype 9 to serotype 2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> Additionally, the few sporadic zoonotic infections by CC87 and CC94 strains have been caused by divergent and rare serotype 2 strains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> However, a serotype 2 capsule on its own is unlikely to be sufficient for <italic>S. suis</italic> to cause zoonotic infections and the genetic background is likely an additional determinant, since despite carrying a serotype 2 capsule, CC25 and CC28 isolates rarely cause zoonotic infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> The zoonotic lineage CC1 seems to act as a reservoir of serotype 2 capsular locus globally, transferring its capsule locus to other pathogenic lineages through horizontal gene transfer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> The capsule switching events appear to be recent in the case of CC104, CC233, and CC1688, as their serotype 2 locus differ only by 1 SNP from the serotype 2 capsule in CC1 isolates. However, the precise mechanisms by which serotype 2 capsular polysaccharide facilitates disease in both pigs and humans remains unknown.</p><p id="P26">Thailand is amongst countries with the highest consumption of antibiotics per kilogram of meat in the world, with over 1000 tonnes of active pharmaceutical ingredients consumed in the pig farming industry per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> Amoxicillin is by far the most used antibiotic in porcine medicated feed in Thailand and shares a mechanism of action with penicillin and ceftriaxone (i.e. binding PBPs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> Therefore, the high usage of amoxicillin is likely to have exerted a strong evolutionary selective pressure on Thai <italic>S. suis</italic> isolates, resulting in the co-selection of PBP types that also confer increased resistance against penicillin and ceftriaxone. The selection for resistant PBP types has led to a moderate increase in resistance to ceftriaxone, despite cephalosporins not being used in pig farming. Apart from amoxicillin, pleuromutilins, quinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines and aminoglycosides are also extensively used in pig farming in Thailand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> The high usage of pleuromutilins may explain why lineages endemic to Thailand (CC104, CC233, and CC1688) carry the full-length version of <italic>vgaF,</italic> associated with increased pleuromutilin resistance. Additionally, the high antibiotic use will have facilitated the spread of the <italic>TnSTC228</italic> transposon carried by the CC104-MDR subpopulation, thus co-selecting for multiple AMR determinants. Taken together, high antimicrobial usage could have provided a favourable setting for lineages CC104 and CC233 to recently emerge as dominant pathogenic strains and potentially outcompete the CC1 lineage, especially considering that the CC1 isolates carry fewer AMR determinants, including susceptible PBP types. The evolution of AMR in CC104 and CC233 may have been facilitated by horizontal transfer from and recombination with commensal isolates of <italic>S. suis</italic> as they carry more AMR determinants on average than pathogenic isolates as well resistant PBP types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 15</xref>).</p><p id="P27">The evolution of CC104 and CC233 shows how horizontal gene transfers can lead to the emergence and spread of novel multi-drug resistant (MDR) zoonotic <italic>S. suis</italic> lineages. It is of special concern that these novel zoonotic <italic>S. suis</italic> lineages are not only MDR but also are accumulating resistance to critically important antibiotics such as ceftriaxone. For now, the human host remains an evolutionary dead end for <italic>S. suis</italic> as there have been no reports of human-to-human transmission and very little evidence for human carriage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> Nonetheless, novel zoonotic and MDR strains may also be emerging in other countries that have recently undergone pig farming intensification and have a high level of antibiotic usage. This could result in not only an increased burden of disease in such countries but also in other regions via international trade of live animals. Therefore, while <italic>S. suis</italic> CC1 infections remain treatable with β-lactams, we predict that we will see an increasing burden of MDR human <italic>S. suis</italic> infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS207069-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d74aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Boas C.
