The capacity of this fungus to colonise and cause disease relies on its ability to grow within the host, adapting to various nutrient restrictions and physicochemical conditions. The presence of alternative carbon sources, such as the lactate produced by the local microbiota, influences <italic>C. albicans</italic> antifungal drug resistance and immune evasion. In this study, we used genome-wide transcriptomic analysis to investigate the effect of lactate exposure upon metabolic rewiring. We provide evidence that <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells respond to growth in the presence of lactate at pH 5 by regulating genes encoding micronutrient transporters, notably iron transporters. More specifically, lactate triggers the downregulation of genes on the reductive iron uptake pathway, inferring a diminished requirement for high-affinity iron uptake. This is supported by the observation that lactate promotes the intracellular accumulation of iron by <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells. Lactate even enhances the growth of iron-transport defective <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells under iron-limited conditions. Lactate is known to activate protein kinase A (PKA) signalling. However, lactate-induced iron assimilation is PKA-independent. This work provides new insights into the role of lactate in iron homeostasis – two important factors that promote <italic>C. albicans</italic> virulence in the mammalian host, where nutritional immunity is a key antimicrobial strategy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2"><italic>Candida albicans,</italic> a major fungal pathogen, normally resides as a commensal organism in the microbiota of most humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). However, when the microbiota is disrupted, <italic>C. albicans</italic> can cause mucosal infections and, in immunocompromised patients, potentially fatal systemic infections with mortality rates of up to 50 % (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The ability of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to colonise and infect its host relies on its capacity to rapidly adjust to diverse niches in the human body, each presenting distinct nutritional conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). A key aspect of this adaptability is its metabolic flexibility, particularly its ability to use alternative carbon sources, such as the carboxylic acids lactate and acetate. The abundances of these carboxylic acids vary between host environments like the gastrointestinal tract, vaginal mucosa, and bloodstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). <italic>C. albicans</italic> exploits specific transport proteins to assimilate carboxylic acids, such as the Jen1 and Jen2 carboxylate/proton symporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Ato proteins, which are members of the Acetate Uptake Transporter (AceTr) family, have also been implicated in acetate transport and contribute to metabolic adaptability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). This enables <italic>C. albicans</italic> to thrive under nutrient-limited conditions and contributes to the virulence of this fungus both directly and indirectly.</p><p id="P3">Numerous studies have examined the influence of carboxylic acids on <italic>C. albicans</italic>. For example, lactate impacts biofilm formation, sensitivity to stresses and antifungal drug resistance in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Additionally, exposure to lactate induces changes in cell wall architecture, thereby enhancing <italic>C. albicans</italic> virulence and immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). More specifically, lactate sensing enhances the removal of exposed β-glucans, partly through up-regulation of secreted glucanases Xog1 and Eng1 in a protein kinase A (PKA) dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Lactic acid has also been reported to shift the oxidation state of iron from Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). This shift in oxidation state may affect the assimilation by <italic>C. albicans</italic> of iron, an essential micronutrient. In <italic>C. albicans,</italic> the iron reductive uptake pathway involves two sequential modifications of the iron oxidation state. Firstly, ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) ions are reduced to ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) ions by ferric reductases to liberate iron from host sequestration mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Subsequently, Fe<sup>2+</sup> is re-oxidized to Fe<sup>3+</sup> by multicopper oxidases. This oxidation step is coupled to the iron permeases, Ftr1 and Ftr2, thereby resulting in the internalisation of the iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Therefore, by influencing iron oxidation state, the presence of lactic acid could, in principle, counteract the initial reduction of Fe<sup>3+</sup> to Fe<sup>2+</sup> by ferric reductases, and/or bypass the need for subsequent Fe<sup>2+</sup> re-oxidation by multicopper oxidases. Indeed, exposure of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to high concentrations of lactic acid has been reported to adversely affect iron uptake and thus induce the expression of genes involved in the reductive iron pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Interestingly, iron deprivation also induces β-glucan masking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), a process that, as described earlier, has also been attributed to <italic>C. albicans</italic> exposure to lactate. Both lactate and iron deprivation-induced β-glucan masking are dependent on PKA signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Taken together, these observations thereby suggest a potential interplay between lactic acid and iron signalling converging on the PKA pathway.</p><p id="P5">We examine this potential interplay in this study. We show that growth in the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of lactic acid at pH 5 results in the downregulation of <italic>C. albicans</italic> genes involved in the reductive iron uptake pathway, and the concomitant intracellular accumulation of iron. This intracellular accumulation is dependent upon the iron reductive uptake pathway, but independent of PKA signalling. Our data suggest that, as well as providing a carbon source, the presence of lactate in host niches enhances fungal colonisation by enhancing iron assimilation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>pH-dependent transcriptional regulation of metal ion transport in response to lactate</title><p id="P6"><italic>C. albicans</italic> cells are frequently grown under laboratory conditions that do not closely mimic physiological environments, leaving potential physiological effects largely unexplored. To understand the impact of lactate-enriched environments on <italic>C. albicans</italic>, we performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling of <italic>C. albicans</italic> planktonic cells by RNA sequencing. Cells were grown in RPMI media containing low glucose (0.2 %), either at pH 5 or 7, from an initial OD<sub>600nm</sub> of 0.3. When the cultures reached an OD<sub>600nm</sub> of 1.0, they were supplemented with 0 % or 0.5 % lactic acid (t = 0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cells were then harvested for RNA sequencing at various timepoints up to 4 h. A total of 30 independent samples were collected for the four conditions: n=3 at 1 h; and n = 1 at 0.5, 2, and 4 h. This sampling strategy permitted robust comparison of the effects of lactate and pH upon gene expression at the 1 h timepoint, while revealing trends in gene expression over the 4 h time course.</p><p id="P7">The RNA sequencing yielded at least 10 million aligned reads per sample (mean ± SD, 16.1 ± 4.6 million). Pair-wise comparisons were performed between cells cultured in the presence or absence of lactate for each time point and both pHs. One hundred forty genes were differentially affected by the presence of lactate at least at one time-point in cells grown at pH 5 or 7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Among them, 131 were differentially expressed at pH 5 (45 were induced, whereas 91 were repressed). The influence of lactate was much less prominent at pH 7: only 21 DEGs, of which 16 were repressed and five induced by lactate. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>, only one gene was induced by lactate both at pH 5 and 7, whereas about 50 % of genes repressed at pH 7 were also repressed at pH 5.</p><p id="P8">Transcriptional changes induced by lactate were subjected to hierarchical clustering. This heat-map reflects the greater number of <italic>C. albicans</italic> genes that were up-and down-regulated in response to lactate at pH 5 than pH 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Specific clusters were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, revealing significant enrichment of GO terms relating to metabolism, and a substantial remodelling of the expression of genes involved in iron and zinc homeostasis (clusters 5 and 6). Significantly, genes such as <italic>FET31</italic>, <italic>FTR2</italic>, <italic>ZRT101</italic>, <italic>PRA1</italic>, <italic>CTR1</italic>, <italic>FRE7,</italic> and <italic>FRE30</italic> were induced by lactate at pH 5, but not at pH 7. On the other hand, <italic>FTH1</italic>, <italic>FTR1</italic>, <italic>FET34</italic>, and <italic>CFL5</italic> were repressed at pH 5, but not at pH 7.0. The <italic>FRP1</italic>, <italic>FRE10</italic>, and <italic>FET99</italic> genes were repressed by lactate at both pH 5 and 7. We did not detect changes in iron and zinc homeostasis genes at pH 7 that were not also observed at pH 5. These data suggested that, under the growth conditions analysed, exposure to lactate at pH 5 affects iron and zinc assimilation and homeostasis, but not at pH 7. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> shows the fold changes in expression of genes related to iron, copper, and zinc homeostasis (clusters 5 and 6) upon shifting to lactate-containing versus lactate-free media. An immediate response was detected after 30 minutes, followed by a general attenuation after one hour, which recovered at later time points. These data suggested that lactate influenced the homeostasis of these transition metals, particularly iron, we further confirmed and investigated this effect.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Interplay between PKA signalling and iron homeostasis in the lactate-induced transcriptional response</title><p id="P9">To better understand the regulatory pathways controlling the observed transcriptional responses to lactate, we used the YEASTRACT+ database. YEASTRACT+ is a curated repository of regulatory associations between transcription factors and target genes in yeast species, with dedicated databases for 11 yeast species, including <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Specifically, with regards to <italic>C. albicans</italic>, YEASTRACT+ compiles over 50,000 regulatory associations between 129 characterized transcription factors and their target genes, as well as 93 defined transcription factor consensus sequences, based on curated published experimental results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Using the <italic>Rank by Transcription Factor</italic> tool associated with YEASTRACT+, we identified transcription factors known to regulate most genes in the provided gene list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>). Interestingly, this analysis identified Efg1 as the master regulator of the lactate-induced response, controlling 91 % of the 131 differentially expressed genes. The transcription factor Efg1, is regulated by the cyclic AMP/PKA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) and plays a key role in the control of hyphal growth, adhesion, biofilm formation and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Interestingly, other PKA pathway-related transcription factors, namely Flo8 and Wor1, are predicted to control 56 % and 21 % of the lactate-induced response.</p><p id="P11">Other transcription factors that stood out in our analysis included a group of regulators involved in iron homeostasis, particularly Hap43 and Sfu1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). According to this YEASTRACT+ analysis, Hap43 and Sfu1 regulate 21 % and 8 % of the genes we observed in the lactate response, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This observation reinforced the outputs of the GO clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Hap43 is a transcriptional regulator required for the response to low iron, whereas Sfu1 is a repressor of iron acquisition under iron-replete conditions. Additional transcription factors related to iron homeostasis include Aft2, Sef1, Hap2, Hap3, Hap5, and Crz1, which also control small subsets of the observed response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Genes involved in iron acquisition are also positively regulated by the pH-responsive transcription factor Rim101 in neutral-alkaline environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) Significantly, our YEASTRACT+ analysis revealed that Rim101 controls 72 % of the lactate-induced response.</p><p id="P12">Taken together, our GO term and YEASTRACT+ analyses strengthened our working hypothesis that lactate might affect iron homeostasis in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and that PKA signalling might play an important role in regulating this lactate response.</p><p id="P13">We reasoned that iron oxidation by lactate might reduce the requirement for multicopper oxidases, resulting in a higher bioavailability through an enhanced iron reductive uptake pathway (option 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Alternatively, a potential interplay between the PKA pathway and the iron regulon has been proposed (option 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), involving the G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr1, where the PKA pathway activates the kinase Ssn3, which in turn phosphorylates Hap34 a key transcriptional repressor involved in low-iron response, targeting it for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). This post-translational modification alleviates the repression of Sfu1, a downstream regulator that controls iron acquisition machinery. This ultimately leads to the transcriptional downregulation of iron uptake systems, such as <italic>FTR1/2</italic> and <italic>FET34</italic>, which is consistent with our transcript profiling outputs following lactate exposure.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Lactate promotes intracellular iron accumulation in an Ftr1-dependent manner</title><p id="P14">With a view to testing these working hypotheses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), we focused on <italic>FTR1</italic> and <italic>FET34</italic>, which encode a high-affinity iron transporter and a multicopper oxidase involved in iron oxidation and uptake, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). qRT-PCR was performed to quantify the fold changes in these transcripts in the presence or absence of lactate. Fold changes were expressed relative to the zero time point without lactate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). These experiments confirmed the increases in <italic>FTR1</italic> and <italic>FET34</italic> expression between 0 and 30 min observed by RNA sequencing. <italic>FTR1</italic> and <italic>FET34</italic> expression levels declined after 30 min, irrespective of whether lactate was present. The data also confirmed that the increase in <italic>FTR1</italic> expression is significantly attenuated in response to lactate (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0016). Therefore, lactate induced transient changes in the expression of the key iron assimilation gene</p><p id="P15">To evaluate whether these lactate-induced transcriptional changes affect iron uptake through the iron reductive pathway, we first compared intracellular iron levels in <italic>C. albicans</italic> wild-type and <italic>ftr1Δ/Δ</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). In wild-type cells, we observed a significant increase in intracellular iron upon lactate supplementation relative to the control without lactate (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0094 and 0.0024 at 1 h and 4 h, respectively), suggesting that lactate promotes iron uptake. Cells lacking <italic>FTR1</italic> still displayed an increase in iron uptake at 1 h (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0224), but this increase was transient, and iron uptake decreased at 4 h, unlike the wild-type control. We conclude that Ftr1 is required for the sustained increase in iron uptake in response to lactate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We reasoned that <italic>FTR2</italic>, encoding another high-affinity iron permease that was upregulated in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), might partially compensate for the loss of <italic>FTR1</italic>. To test this, we examined a <italic>C. albicans ftr2Δ/Δ</italic> single mutant and a <italic>ftr1Δ/Δ ftr2Δ/Δ</italic> double mutant. These mutants behaved in a similar fashion to the <italic>ftr1Δ/Δ</italic> single mutant: iron uptake only increased transiently in response to lactate, in contrast to the sustained increase in iron uptake observed for wild-type control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). We then turned to the multicopper oxidase gene, <italic>FET34.</italic> Like the <italic>ftr1Δ/Δ</italic> and <italic>ftr2Δ/Δ</italic> mutants, <italic>C. albicans fet34Δ/Δ</italic> cells initially displayed an increase in intracellular iron after 1 h of lactate exposure, but unlike the wild-type control, no further increase was observed at 4 h. We conclude that Ftr1, Ftr2, and Fet34, and by implication the iron reductive uptake pathway, promote sustained iron assimilation in response to lactate (option 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, other factors appear to be required for the initial increase in iron assimilation in response to lactate.</p><p id="P17">We then evaluated the impact of lactate-enhanced iron uptake on the ability of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to grow under iron limitation, and whether lactate suppresses the need for the conventional reductive iron uptake pathway under these conditions. To achieve this, we grew wild-type, <italic>ftr1Δ/Δ,</italic> and <italic>fet34Δ/Δ</italic> cells under iron limiting conditions for 12 days and subsequently re-administered either lactate (0.5 %), iron (0.5 μM), or both in combination. Wild-type cells grew slowly in the absence of lactate and iron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>; asymptotic maxima (A) and growth rates (μ) are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>; Statistics are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). As expected, the addition of iron to the iron-limited medium enhanced growth. Interestingly, lactate significantly enhanced the growth of wild-type cells under iron limiting conditions, and growth was further enhanced by lactate even when iron was not limiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The <italic>fet34Δ/Δ</italic> mutant grew under iron limitation in the absence of lactate, possibly because other multicopper oxidases in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (Fet3, Fet31, Fet33, Fet99) compensated for the loss of Fet34. Interestingly, the <italic>fet34Δ/Δ</italic> cells grew well with lactate even in the absence of supplementary iron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Meanwhile, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), cells lacking the Ftr1 high-affinity iron transporter were unable to grow under iron limiting conditions. The addition of lactate was unable to suppress this growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). We conclude that lactate enhances the growth of <italic>C. albicans</italic> under iron limiting conditions, and that the sustained iron uptake mediated by Ftr1 is important for this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, option 1).</p><p id="P18">We then tested whether lactate-induced iron assimilation is dependent upon PKA signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, option 2). To achieve this, we exploited two inhibitors of PKA signalling: H-89, a specific inhibitor of PKA in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>); and farnesol, which directly inhibits adenylyl cyclase on the PKA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Neither inhibitor blocked the lactate-induced iron uptake observed for untreated wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). We conclude that, despite the apparent involvement of Efg1 in the transcriptional response to lactate (above), lactate-induced iron assimilation does not depend upon PKA signalling, in the conditions tested.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P19">Our genome-wide profiling of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells growing on RPMI revealed that exposure to physiologically relevant concentrations of lactate influences the expression of genes involved in transition metal homeostasis. This effect, which included elements of the reductive iron uptake pathway, occurred at pH 5, but not at pH 7. At first glance, our observations might appear to contradict those of Cottier and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), who reported that, in response to weak acids, <italic>C. albicans</italic> upregulates (rather than downregulates) genes encoding iron transporters and assimilates lower (rather than higher) levels of intracellular iron. However, the authors examined the effects of a relatively high concentration of lactate (0.62 M) on <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells grown in Man, Rogosa, Sharpe (MRS) medium, which they selected because this rich medium supports the growth of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p><p id="P20">At such high concentrations, lactate is thought to reduce iron bioavailability by counteracting the iron-liberating mechanisms of ferric reductases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). In contrast, our experiments employed ~10-fold lower concentration (0.5 % = 0.055 M), which are within the physiological range. Under these conditions, lactate is more likely to promote Fe<sup>2+</sup> oxidation, thereby complementing the activity of multicopper oxidases, without unduly interfering with the ferric reductases.</p><p id="P21">Indeed, we confirmed that <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells accumulate intracellular iron in response to this physiologically relevant lactate concentration and consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), our transcriptomic data showed that this increased iron availability led to downregulation of genes in the iron reductive uptake pathway.</p><p id="P22">Efg1 was also identified as a regulator of the observed transcriptomic response. This was consistent with the involvement of PKA signalling in lactate-induced changes in <italic>C. albicans</italic> physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). However, pharmacological inhibition of PKA signalling by H-89 or farnesol did not block the enhanced iron assimilation induced by lactate. Instead, this sustained iron accumulation was dependent on the iron reductive uptake pathway (<italic>FTR1</italic>). Significantly, this sustained iron accumulation underlies the ability of lactate to stimulate the growth of <italic>C. albicans</italic> under iron limiting conditions. Given the importance of nutritional immunity in limiting microbial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), this interaction between lactate and iron assimilation is likely to enhance fungal colonisation of host niches.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions</title><p id="P23">All <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains used in this study were derived from the clinical isolate SC5314 and are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Importance</title></caption><p><italic>Candida albicans</italic> is a major opportunistic fungal pathogen capable of causing life-threatening infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Its ability to adapt to diverse host environments underlies its success as a commensal and pathogen. This study provides new insights into the metabolic flexibility of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, with a specific focus on how lactate, a common carbon source in host niches, influences iron acquisition and homeostasis. Our findings reveal that, during growth at pH 5, lactate modulates the expression of micronutrient transporters and enhances iron assimilation in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. These results suggest a role of lactate in promoting iron uptake, potentially facilitating fungal colonization and persistence within the host. By elucidating the molecular and phenotypic consequences of lactate exposure upon iron metabolism, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Time profile of genes induced in the presence of lactate, at pH 5 and 7.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematic representation of the experimental setup.
