This presents a <italic>prima facie</italic> challenge to cellular homeostasis, as topologically complex proteins seldom refold efficiently in vitro. How cells overcome sequence-intrinsic folding limitations to optimize protein biogenesis is incompletely understood. Here, we show that efficient folding and assembly of the model five-domain homotetramer β-galactosidase is obligatorily coupled to its synthesis on the ribosome, and define the underlying mechanisms. During refolding of full-length protein from denaturant, maturation of the catalytic domain is frustrated. Assembly outpaces monomer folding, and non-native oligomers accumulate. The ribosome directs the order of folding events and specifies the pathway of oligomer assembly. Efficient <italic>de novo</italic> folding is characterised by segmental domain folding, shaped by binding of a nascent amphipathic helix to a cryptic pocket on the ribosome surface. Homomer assembly initiates cotranslationally via recruitment of a full-length subunit to the nascent polypeptide, and the failure to do so results in misassembly. Our results reveal how the ribosome can dictate the timing of folding and assembly to enable efficient biogenesis of a topologically complex protein.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Small single domain proteins typically refold rapidly and reversibly in vitro, implying that their amino acid sequence suffices to encode productive folding.

Based on the relationship between protein length and in vitro refolding kinetics, &gt;600 bacterial proteins are predicted to refold slower than the doubling time of <italic>E. coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. This discrepancy suggests that the cellular environment contributes additional information to folding reactions of topologically complex proteins.</p><p id="P4">Folding assistance is provided in part by molecular chaperones, which suppress off-pathway aggregation and catalyse refolding following proteotoxic stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In addition, the translating ribosome may direct efficient <italic>de novo</italic> folding during protein synthesis. The ribosome influences protein maturation at different levels. Proximity to the ribosome surface often alters the stability of nascent domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and the vectorial character of protein synthesis can avoid interdomain misfolding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. For oligomeric proteins, assembly frequently initiates on the ribosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Cotranslational assembly can protect unstable subunits from aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and may contribute to the fidelity of protein complex formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The ribosome therefore constitutes a unique folding environment, but how exactly this benefits difficult-to-fold proteins is unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Here, we used <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> β-galactosidase (β-gal), a large homotetramer of five-domain subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, as a model for understanding how the cellular environment optimises protein folding and assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We show that maturation of β-gal is highly efficient only when folding is coupled to synthesis on the ribosome, and use structural and proteomic approaches to provide a molecular rationale. We find that the ribosome directs monomer folding and enforces directional assembly of β-gal subunits. The resulting synchronisation between cotranslational folding and assembly avoids kinetic traps that frustrate refolding.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cotranslational folding enables efficient biogenesis of β-gal</title><p id="P6">Spontaneous refolding of urea-denatured β-gal in vitro was undetectable at 37 °C, and inefficient (yield &lt;30%) even at lower temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1a</xref>). Refolding was also slow, with t½ ~4 h at 10 °C, and ~10 min at 37 °C based on extrapolation of the Arrhenius plot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a,b</xref>). The bacterial Hsp70 chaperone system (DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE) supported only ~20% refolding at 37 °C and did not increase the refolding rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1c</xref>). β-gal refolding is therefore disfavoured at physiological temperature and only partially rescued by chaperones. In contrast, β-gal folded efficiently when produced in a fully-reconstituted in vitro transcription/translation (IVT) system without chaperones at 37 °C, to a yield of 83±1% active protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>). Moreover, several observations indicated that <italic>de novo</italic> folding of β-gal is rate-limited by its synthesis on the ribosome. First, the increase in β-gal enzyme activity during ongoing translation was near-concomitant with synthesis of the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d</xref>), consistent with previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Second, β-gal activity did not increase after arresting translation using antibiotics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1e</xref>). Third, β-gal activity was detected in the ribosomal fraction of IVT reactions, and this was reduced by addition of puromycin to release nascent chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1f</xref>). Thus, active β-gal accumulates on translating ribosomes, in agreement with previous in vivo observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Together, these data show that cotranslational folding of β-gal, even in the absence of chaperones, is both faster and substantially more efficient than its refolding from denaturant. We next sought to understand the molecular basis for this difference.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Pathway of β-gal refolding from denaturant</title><p id="P7">We first aimed to understand why β-gal refolds to low yield <italic>in vitro.</italic> The absence of turbidity during refolding suggested that β-gal did not form large aggregates under our experimental conditions, although aggregation could be induced by raising the temperature and lowering the concentration of residual urea (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1d</xref>). To account for the fraction of β-gal that failed to refold, we resolved refolding reactions by native PAGE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1e</xref>). Consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, tetrameric β-gal accumulated over time at the expense of the monomer and dimer. We also observed a population of β-gal migrating as a diffuse band between dimer and tetramer on native PAGE, which appeared early during refolding and persisted throughout. Prolonged incubation with X-gal revealed enzymatic activity of the monomer and dimer, indicating that they can assemble into active tetramers. However, the intermediate species was inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1e</xref>). Thus, a fraction of β-gal becomes trapped as a non-native oligomer during attempted refolding, limiting the yield of native enzyme. In contrast, IVT-produced β-gal did not contain inactive intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Cotranslational folding therefore bypasses a misfolding step that leads to off-pathway oligomerisation.</p><p id="P8">The fraction of β-gal that does refold from denaturant, refolds slowly. To understand why, we analysed refolding reactions using hydrogen/deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). At 16 different times after dilution from denaturant, we pulse-labelled β-gal with D<sub>2</sub>O and quantified deuteron incorporation at the peptide level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b,c</xref>). Our HDX-MS experiment followed the on-pathway refolding reaction, since the non-native oligomeric species was depleted during the deuterium labelling step (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2a</xref>). We measured refolding kinetics for 400 individual peptides covering 96% of β-gal residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Data S1</xref>), allowing us to determine the detailed sequence of refolding events. The data were highly redundant, with each residue reported on by 4.4 peptides on average.</p><p id="P9">β-sheet-rich regions in each domain, coinciding with hydrophobic Ile-Leu-Val clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, refolded early and near-simultaneously, followed by peripheral helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2e</xref>). Slow refolding peptides tended to cluster in the native structure of β-gal, specifically at domain-domain interfaces involving D3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3a,b</xref>). The long subunit interface reached native levels of exchange before domain interfaces within the monomer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3d,e</xref>), implying that dimer assembly initiates before monomer folding completes. This is consistent with previous analyses of β-gal refolding kinetics, which showed that the rate-limiting step is unimolecular and involves maturation of the dimer into a tetramerisation-competent state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. The slowest event was refolding of residues 3-8, comprising part of the α-peptide at the activating interface, which matches the kinetics of recovery of enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3c</xref>). In summary, slow refolding of β-gal occurs in the following steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2g</xref>): 1. Folding of the β-sheet core of each domain. 2. Assembly via the long interface. 3. Formation of domain:domain interfaces. 4. Completion of D3 folding. 5. Assembly via the activating interface. Non-native oligomerisation is a competitive side-reaction, possibly originating from partially-folded dimers that accumulate early during refolding.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The ribosome directs segmental folding of the catalytic domain</title><p id="P10">We next sought to understand how the β-gal monomer folds on the ribosome. To model cotranslational folding intermediates, we prepared a series of 12 stalled ribosome:nascent chain complexes (RNCs), each representing an equilibrium snapshot of biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4a,b</xref>). Translation was stalled at each domain boundary as well as within individual domains. To remove bound chaperones, we rigorously purified the RNCs from <italic>E. coli</italic> lacking the ribosome-associated chaperone Trigger factor. The three longest RNCs were also purified from Δ<italic>lacZ</italic> cells to remove low levels of co-purifying endogenous β-gal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4b</xref> and discussed below).</p><p id="P11">The analytical complexity of ~2.5 MDa RNCs poses a substantial challenge to probing NC conformation. We used an optimised HDX-MS workflow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> to define the folding status of each NC at the peptide level, using native β-gal as a reference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Data S2</xref>). To uncover regions that fold cooperatively during synthesis, we plotted the uptake of each peptide as a function of NC length and grouped peptides that undergo their final folding transition at the same stage of synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6a</xref>). We found that peptides grouped by folding behaviour also clustered spatially in the native structure of β-gal, indicating that they behave as cotranslational foldons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3d</xref>). Similar to the refolding reaction, β-rich regions often folded cooperatively on the ribosome. The β-sheet cores of D1, D2 and D4 reached near-native levels of deuterium exchange as soon as each complete domain was synthesised, as did a discontinuous β-rich subdomain in D5. In contrast, folding of loop- and α-helix-rich regions was often delayed relative to synthesis, suggesting a requirement for long-range stabilising interactions. For example, the central jelly roll of D1 folded as soon as the domain emerged from the ribosome, while peripheral loops and helices folded upon synthesis of neighbouring D2 and D3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c,d</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Cotranslational folding of D3 was distinct from other domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3e-g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6b</xref>). D3 houses the active site, and forms a distorted TIM-barrel with 3 βαβα repeats. Repeat 1 was synthesised in RNC<sub>1-460</sub> but partially folded only in RNC<sub>1-510</sub>. Repeat 2 was synthesised in RNC<sub>1-510</sub> and partially folded when D3 was complete in RNC<sub>1-646</sub>. Repeat 3 was synthesised in RNC<sub>1-646</sub> and partially folded when D4 had emerged from the ribosome in RNC<sub>1-745</sub>. Thus, each βαβα repeat begins folding independently, following a short delay relative to their synthesis. Furthermore, the α-helices of each βαβα unit folded at shorter NC lengths than the β-strands, indicating that they may fold first during translation. This is in contrast to the refolding reaction, where the core β-strands of D3 mature near-simultaneously, followed by peripheral helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2e</xref>). Together, these data define the sequence of cooperative folding events during β-gal synthesis, and reveal segmental, helix-driven folding of the D3 TIM-barrel.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The ribosome surface sequesters a nascent amphipathic helix to alter domain folding</title><p id="P13">The central catalytic domain D3 refolds inefficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>), and populates unique intermediates during efficient folding on the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>). To understand how the ribosome modulates folding of this domain, we purified fragments containing the first 2¼ or 2½ domains of β-gal off the ribosome. HDX-MS showed that the 2¼-domain fragment was nearly identical to the corresponding RNC<sub>1-460</sub>, but the 2½-domain NC (RNC<sub>1-510</sub>) was conformationally destabilised on the ribosome as reflected by increased deuterium uptake (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S7a,b</xref>). Destabilised sites were distant from each other in sequence, but would cluster together near the C-terminus if the NC assumed a near-native tertiary structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S7c</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To understand the origin of ribosome-induced NC destabilisation, we determined the structure of RNC<sub>1-510</sub> using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8a</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">d</xref>). The overall architecture, with 70S ribosome bound to A- and P-site tRNAs, is similar to previously reported structures of stalled ribosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. In addition, we observed continuous density for nascent β-gal in the tunnel and against the ribosome surface, of sufficient quality to model both the stalling sequence and the C-terminal 46 residues (465-510) of the β-gal construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Residues 485-494 near the vestibule were modelled as an alanine backbone due to limited local resolution. The NC assumes an extended conformation in the exit tunnel and follows a defined path, stabilised by interactions with ribosomal proteins uL4 and uL22 lining the tunnel wall (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9a-d</xref>). Although it initially follows the contour of uL22, the NC switches trajectory near the vestibule, towards uL29, before emerging from the tunnel close to uL23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9b</xref>). Density corresponding to the N-terminal part of the NC (residues 1-464) is visible only at lower contour levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Strikingly, residues 466-478 of β-gal fold into a well-defined α-helix (local resolution 2.8-3.0 Å) outside the vestibule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8e</xref>). The helix is anchored by NC residues Tyr473 and Asn468, which form hydrogen bonds to uL23 residues Met24 and Glu52, respectively. Trp475 of the NC inserts into a pocket formed by Ser34 and Met30 of uL29, and Phe51 of uL23. The groove formed by uL23/uL29 is hydrophobic and accommodates the nonpolar face of the amphipathic NC helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d-f</xref>). Although residues 466-478 are α-helical in native β-gal, we found that the equivalent isolated peptide is disordered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S9e,f</xref>), suggesting that helical structure is stabilised by uL23. Interestingly, the NC-binding pocket we identify is normally occupied by the flexible C-terminus of uL23, which is unresolved in our structure and presumably displaced by the NC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). Residues that line the binding pocket and confer its hydrophobic character are evolutionarily conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9g</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Folding of the nascent helix in complex with uL23 explains why NC<sub>1-510</sub> is locally destabilised on the ribosome. In native β-gal, the hydrophobic face of the helix packs against a hydrophobic groove in D3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S9h</xref>). Interactions with the ribosome therefore compete with intra-NC interactions, disrupting NC folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). Since the destabilised sites in RNC<sub>1-510</sub> form part of the same cotranslational foldon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7b,c</xref>), helix sequestration suffices to destabilise adjacent regions. Importantly, the locally destabilised regions recover when the chain elongates further in RNC<sub>1-646</sub>, indicating that intra-NC interactions eventually outcompete ribosome binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7b</xref>). In summary, we show that the ribosome surface can modulate domain folding by temporarily sequestering a nascent amphipathic helix in a cryptic hydrophobic pocket. This results in segmental cotranslational maturation of a domain that otherwise refolds in a concerted fashion.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The ribosome directs β-gal assembly to avoid misassembly</title><p id="P17">During refolding, β-gal assembles prematurely and forms off-pathway oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In contrast, assembly is efficient when coupled to ongoing translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-g</xref>). We therefore considered whether the ribosome changes the pathway of β-gal assembly to promote productive folding. Since β-gal is only active when tetrameric, the observation of β-gal activity on polysomes implies that it assembles to some extent during synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1f</xref>). To probe the underlying mechanism, we first measured enzyme activity of purified β-gal RNCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a</xref>). RNCs longer than 745 aa showed low levels of enzyme activity (&lt;5% of RNC<sub>FL+50aa</sub>), indicative of weak or partial assembly.

This occurred in WT but not Δ<italic>lacZ</italic> cells, and was partially disrupted by mutating the activating interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4b, and S10b</xref>). The co-assembling full-length subunits were protease resistant, suggesting that they are folded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S10c</xref>). Thus, mature β-gal subunits assemble with incomplete nascent polypeptides exposing at minimum the first 4 domains of nascent β-gal.</p><p id="P19">To test this mechanism in vivo, we used selective ribosome profiling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Pull-downs using C-terminally tagged β-gal efficiently recovered ribosomes translating <italic>lacZ</italic> mRNA, indicative of co-post assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10d</xref>). Analysis of protected footprints revealed that the onset of assembly occurred after synthesis of ~700 aa, stabilised after ~800aa, and persisted until translation termination, in close agreement with the pulldowns of stalled RNCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). The late onset of assembly implied that co-post assembly initiates via the long (C-terminal) rather than activating (N-terminal) interface. Consistent with this, a β-gal fragment 1-519, which contains all residues contributing to the activating interface, was monomeric even at a concentration of 900 µM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S10e</xref>).</p><p id="P20">RNCs were inactive when produced in vitro in the absence of full-length subunits, arguing against a co-co assembly pathway involving two or more incomplete NCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S10a</xref>).

Co-co assembly is expected to shift translating ribosomes from the monosome to disome fraction after nuclease digestion of the connecting mRNA, resulting in an enrichment of disome footprints at the expense of monosome footprints. No such enrichment was observed for β-gal, indicating that cotranslational β-gal assembly is co-post.</p><p id="P21">To test whether incomplete chains of β-gal can self-assemble off the ribosome, we purified a 4-domain fragment (1-725), corresponding to the earliest onset of assembly detected by SeRP. We found that 1-725 formed unstable tetramers with weak enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S10h</xref>). However, negative-stain EM revealed additional higher-order oligomers containing 7-8 copies of 1-725 tetramers arranged in a star-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S10i</xref>). Incomplete chains of β-gal are therefore assembly-competent off the ribosome, but can misassemble. In contrast to isolated 1-725, RNC<sub>1-745</sub> (purified from Δ<italic>lacZ</italic> cells) was inactive and thus unassembled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5d</xref>). The ribosome therefore inhibits premature co-co assembly, and in doing so prevents misassembly.</p><p id="P22">To test whether the ribosome sterically interferes with co-co assembly, we purified RNCs exposing residues 1-725 of β-gal fused to C-terminal Gly-Ser linkers of increasing length. These RNCs were inactive, but could be activated in a linker length-dependent manner by complementation with folded D5 <italic>in trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5f</xref>). Cotranslational assembly is therefore influenced by both subunit folding and proximity to the ribosome.</p><p id="P23">To understand how folding and assembly are coordinated prior to translation termination, we focused on RNC<sub>1-1014</sub>. This RNC represents the endpoint of cotranslational maturation, when only ~30 C-terminal residues remain sequestered in the ribosome exit tunnel. HDX-MS analysis of RNC<sub>1-1014</sub> showed that D5 was strongly destabilised compared to native β-gal, and must therefore complete folding post translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5</xref>). Since D5 forms the majority of the long interface, post-translational D5 folding may explain why cotranslational assembly strictly requires at least one full-length subunit. Indeed, RNC<sub>1-1014</sub> was efficiently activated by purified D5 in <italic>trans</italic>, demonstrating that D5 folding can trigger co-co tetramer assembly on ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5f</xref>). The ribosome therefore dictates the mode and onset of assembly by controlling the timing of C-terminal domain folding. Assembly is synchronised with monomer folding, rather than preceding folding as occurs during inefficient refolding from denaturant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">By characterising the maturation of a large multidomain oligomeric protein on and off the ribosome, we uncover new features of cotranslational folding that support the biogenesis of complex folds.

Since isolated secondary structures are intrinsically unstable, nucleating helix folding may promote folding by reducing the entropic barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.

Nonetheless, most proteins across all proteomes are oligomeric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, implying that oligomer biogenesis is optimised in vivo. We find that the ribosome specifies the pathway of β-gal assembly. Although β-gal is a symmetric homomer, cotranslational assembly is directional and involves a full-length and a partially-synthesised subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). This assembly mode may help to confer assembly specificity when multiple oligomeric forms are possible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5e</xref>), and avoid misfolding between two incompletely folded subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1g</xref>).

Instead, we propose that the pioneering round of translation generates a subunit which then engages the nascent chain on the trailing ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). The polysome may therefore act as a scaffold for efficient co-post homomer assembly.

Domain 3 folds in discrete steps, the timing of which are dictated by an interaction with a hydrophobic groove on uL23 that stabilises a nascent amphipathic helix. The pioneering round of translation generates a full-length subunit, which then binds via the long interface to a ribosome-associated subunit during synthesis of domain 5. An immature dimer results, which matures post-translation and assembles via the activating interface to form the folded tetramer. When uncoupled from translation, monomers fold via a less efficient pathway and are prone to misfold and misassemble.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206072-f006"/></fig></floats-group></article>
