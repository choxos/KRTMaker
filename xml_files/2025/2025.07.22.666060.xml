Neural stem cells (NSCs) or neuroblasts in <italic>Drosophila</italic> require the regulation of mitochondrial fusion, along with the activity of the electron transport chain (ETC), to meet the metabolic demands of differentiation. However, the mechanisms by which mitochondrial fusion and activity together regulate NSC differentiation are not well understood. We investigated the relationship between mitochondrial fusion, and ETC complex I activity during <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblast differentiation. We found that depletion of complex I subunits did not affect the number of type II neuroblasts but reduced their proliferation, thereby decreasing the numbers of mature intermediate precursor cells (mINPs), ganglion mother cells (GMCs), and neurons in each lineage. Complex I depletion decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and cristae numbers, and increased mitochondrial fragmentation and ROS. Increased ROS resulting from the depletion of antioxidant enzymes also led to a decrease in mINPs, GMCs, and neurons in each type II neuroblast lineage. Both complex I and antioxidant protein depletion led to delayed G1/S transition and decreased nuclear cyclin E levels. Interestingly, the defects in proliferation, differentiation, and ROS in complex I and anti-oxidant protein depleted neuroblasts could be restored by fused mitochondrial morphology obtained through additional depletion of the fission protein Drp1. Further, overexpression of antioxidant proteins could alleviate the ROS and rescue the differentiation defect in complex I depleted type II neuroblasts. Together, this study reveals a role for complex I and mitochondrial fusion in restricting ROS for differentiation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>neural stem cells</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>electron transport chain</kwd><kwd>complex 1</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>ROS</kwd><kwd>cyclin E</kwd><kwd>Drp1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Mitochondrial dynamics and activity regulate stem cell differentiation. In mammals, pluripotent stem cells predominantly rely on glycolysis for energy production. They contain fragmented or globular mitochondria, with poorly organised cristae and perinuclear localisation. These fragmented mitochondria have low electron transport chain (ETC) activity, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ATP production. During differentiation, mitochondria transition to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), facilitated by fused or tubular mitochondrial architecture with well-developed cristae. Fused mitochondria have high OXPHOS, MMP, and ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). An equilibrium between the fusion and fission events determines the mitochondrial architecture and consequently, their activity. The family of large Dynamin GTPases orchestrates these events. Mitofusin (Mfn) in mammals, or Mitochondrial assembly regulatory factor (Marf) in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> drives outer mitochondrial membrane fusion, followed by inner mitochondrial membrane fusion through Optic atrophy 1 (Opa1). Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is essential for mitochondrial fragmentation.</p><p id="P5">Mitochondrial dynamics and activity regulate proliferation and differentiation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural stem cells, also known as neuroblasts. In larval stages, proliferating neuroblasts rely on glycolysis; however, during the larval-to-pupal transition, they exit the cell cycle and undergo terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Mitochondrial fusion driven by Opa1 is essential for differentiation in the central brain neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). An increase in Notch signaling leads to excessive proliferation of neuroblasts, which also requires mitochondrial activity and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Although mitochondrial dynamics and activity are crucial for neuroblast proliferation and differentiation, the mechanisms by which they interact to produce differentiation outcomes remain largely unexplored.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we investigate the interaction between mitochondrial fusion and oxidative phosphorylation driven by complex I during the proliferation and differentiation of neuroblasts in the central brain of <italic>Drosophila.</italic> The central brain in the third instar larva contains type I and type II neuroblasts. The type I neuroblasts are approximately 90 in number, and the type II neuroblasts are 8 in number. They express transcription factors Deadpan (Dpn) and Asense (Ase). Type I neuroblasts divide to give rise to ganglion mother cells (GMCs). The type II neuroblast lineages contain transit amplifying cells, similar to those found in mammalian systems. Type II neuroblasts express an Ets transcription factor, <italic>pointed P1</italic> (<italic>pnt</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). They undergo division to produce immature intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Immature INPs undergo transcriptional changes to form mature INPs (mINPs), which express Dpn and Ase. mINPs divide asymmetrically 5–6 times, to form GMCs. GMCs in both type I and II lineages express Prospero (Pros) and Ase. GMCs eventually divide symmetrically to produce neurons or glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). High nuclear Pros and Elav are expressed in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P7">ETC complex I, known as NADH dehydrogenase or NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase is a multi-subunit enzyme with a 1000 kDa molecular weight that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. Complex I can generate ROS during electron transfer in the ETC. It is an L-shaped structure, consisting of one hydrophobic arm embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and one hydrophilic arm present at the periphery, facing the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> complex I is composed of 43 subunits, a catalytic core of 14 evolutionarily conserved subunits alongside 29 accessory subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Although these accessory subunits are not directly involved in the catalytic process, their perturbation can disrupt the assembly of the entire complex, leading to elevated ROS generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Electrons from complex I are transferred to complex III and then to IV, where molecular oxygen is reduced to water. This electron flow is coupled to the pumping of protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space by complex I, II, and IV, establishing an electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which manifests as the MMP. Complex V (ATP Synthase) utilises the MMP to synthesise ATP from ADP.</p><p id="P8">In this study, we found that depletion of complex I subunits led to decreased proliferation in the central brain neuroblasts. There was a decrease in differentiation in the type II neuroblast lineage, characterized by reduction in the numbers of mINPs, GMCs, and neurons. Notably, the downregulation of complex I led to fragmented mitochondria, decreased cristae numbers, a low MMP, and increased ROS generation. These elevated ROS levels led to a decrease in differentiation by disrupting the transition from the G1 to the S phase in the cell cycle. Inducing mitochondrial fusion or increasing ROS scavengers in complex I depleted type II neuroblasts reversed the ROS levels and restored the differentiation defects in the type II neuroblast lineage.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>ETC complex I depletion leads to a decrease in the proliferation and differentiation of neuroblasts at the larval stage</title><p id="P9">To evaluate the function of ETC complex I, we depleted individual subunits in type I and II neuroblasts by combining worniu-Gal4 (wor-Gal4), mCD8-GFP and <italic>pointed</italic> <italic>P1</italic>-Gal4 (<italic>pnt</italic>-Gal4), mCD8-GFP with shRNA lines against them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). mCD8-GFP marked the plasma membrane in the cells expressing the Gal4 and the shRNA. RNAi depletion was carried out against the complex I subunits, ND-49 (mammalian NDUFS2) and ND-51 (NDUFV1), belonging to the core hydrophilic matrix arm and ND-19 (NDUFA8), ND-39 (NDUFA9), ND-42 (NDUFA10) and ND-PDSW (NDUFB10) subunits belonging to the accessory hydrophobic membrane arm. When expressed with wor-Gal4 at 29°C, we observed pupal lethality on the depletion of ND-PDSW, ND-49, and ND-42, with the few flies that emerged from pupae being sluggish in behaviour. Depletion of ND-51, ND-39, and ND-19 gave a more severe phenotype of complete pupal lethality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Depletion of complex I subunits specifically in type II neuroblasts using <italic>pnt</italic>-Gal4 did not affect the development of F1 flies. Flies emerged normally out of pupae but were less active and sluggish. They died within 15 days after eclosion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). The shRNA lines against ND-51 (ND-51<sup>i</sup>), ND-39 (ND-39<sup>i</sup>), and ND-19 (ND-19<sup>i</sup>) were selected for further analysis of the role of complex I in neuroblast proliferation and differentiation.</p><p id="P10">We assessed the impact of ND-51, ND-39 and ND-19 depletion on the numbers of central brain neuroblasts and their proliferation by crossing the corresponding shRNA lines with wor-Gal4 and immunostaining for neuroblasts with Miranda and phospho-Histone 3 (pH3), which marks dividing cells. There was no significant difference in the numbers of neuroblasts between the controls and brains depleted of ND-51, ND-39, and ND-19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B and C</xref>). However, there was a significant reduction in the proportion of mitotically active neuroblasts within each brain lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B and D</xref>). Knockdown of ND-51, ND-39, and ND-19 in type II neuroblasts using the <italic>pnt</italic>-Gal4 driver also yielded a decreased number of mitotically dividing neuroblasts as compared to controls, but the number of neuroblasts remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E-G</xref>). Live imaging of third instar larval brains expressing ND-51<sup>i</sup> in type II neuroblasts showed decreased division. Control neuroblasts divided at least once during live imaging in 40 mins, but ND-51 depleted neuroblasts did not show a division in the same duration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Collectively, these observations show that complex I is a crucial regulator of neuroblast proliferation.</p><p id="P11">We evaluated the impact of complex I depletion on differentiation in the type II neuroblast lineage. We quantified the number of distinct progenitor cells, mINPs, GMCs and neurons within the type II neuroblast lineage by immunostaining for specific markers. We found that the numbers of mINPs (Ase+, Dpn+) were decreased in ND-51<sup>i</sup>, ND-39<sup>i</sup> and ND-19<sup>i</sup> expressing lineages as compared to mCherry<sup>i</sup> expressing controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). We assessed the proliferation of mINPs by co-staining with Dpn and pH3. Depletion of ND-51, ND-39, and ND-19 resulted in a decreased number of mINPs labelled with pH3 within the lineage compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A and B</xref>). This reduction in mINP proliferation corresponded to a decrease in GMC (Ase+ Dpn-) numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A and C</xref>), subsequently leading to a diminished production of neurons (high nuclear Pros) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D and E</xref>). We evaluated whether apoptosis led to a decrease in cells in the type II neuroblast lineage by immunostaining the brains with cleaved Caspase 3. We did not find any discernible difference between control and complex I depleted neuroblast lineages with cleaved Caspase 3 and found that apoptosis was not a cause of decrease in lineage cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>). To confirm the specificity of RNAi-mediated complex I depletion, we utilized an independent shRNA targeting ND-51<sup>i</sup> (BL29534). ND-51<sup>i</sup> (BL29534) expression with <italic>pnt</italic>-Gal4 also showed a significant decrease in mINPs, GMCs, and neurons within the lineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B-F</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Complex I depletion has also been shown to decrease the proliferation of tumor neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). In this analysis, we further find that the reduction in neuroblast and mINP proliferation resulting from complex I depletion in type II neuroblast lineage led to a decrease in the proliferation of transit amplifying cells and differentiated cells.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Expression of Drp1 mutant in complex I deficient type II neuroblasts alleviates their proliferation and differentiation defect</title><p id="P13">Our prior analysis demonstrated that depleting Opa1 in type II neuroblasts leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and differentiation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Similar observations of mitochondrial fragmentation and impairment of differentiation have been reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestinal stem cells upon Opa1 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Drp1 activity is essential for driving mitochondrial fragmentation in Opa1 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Additionally, concurrent depletion of Drp1 with Opa1 restores mitochondrial fusion and alleviates the differentiation defects, underscoring the necessity of a fused mitochondrial morphology for proper stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Depletion of ETC complex I and complex V in type I neuroblasts causes mitochondrial fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). We assessed mitochondrial morphology in ND-51 depleted type II neuroblasts and muscle cells by crossing the shRNA lines with <italic>pnt</italic>-Gal4 and mhc-Gal4, respectively. As expected, ND-51 depleted type II neuroblasts contained fragmented mitochondria surrounding the nucleus and relatively smaller mitochondria in muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We investigated whether Drp1 depletion by co-expression of the dominant negative form of Drp1 (Drp1<sup>SD</sup>) with complex I RNAi could reverse the mitochondrial morphology defects. For this, we generated the combinations, Drp1<sup>SD</sup>;ND-51<sup>i</sup> and Drp1<sup>SD</sup>;mCherry<sup>i</sup> as a control and crossed them to <italic>pnt</italic>-Gal4 and mhc-Gal4 to assess mitochondrial morphology. Mitochondria in Drp1<sup>SD</sup>;mCherry<sup>i</sup> type II neuroblasts were clustered and localised to one side of the cell as compared to mCherry<sup>i</sup> alone. Drp1<sup>SD</sup>;mCherry<sup>i</sup> expression in muscle cells led to bigger and interconnected mitochondria as compared to mCherry<sup>i</sup> alone. Drp1<sup>SD</sup>;ND-51<sup>i</sup> neuroblasts contained a mixed population of clustered mitochondria localised to one side of the cell and fragmented mitochondria. Muscle cells expressing Drp1<sup>SD</sup>;ND-51<sup>i</sup> showed larger mitochondria than ND-51<sup>i</sup> alone.</p><p id="P15">We further assessed the proliferation of Drp1<sup>SD</sup>;ND-51<sup>i</sup> expressing neuroblasts using wor-gal4 and <italic>pnt</italic>-Gal4. In each brain lobe, the proportion of mitotically dividing neuroblasts was significantly increased in Drp1<sup>SD</sup>;ND-51<sup>i</sup> compared to ND-51<sup>i</sup> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-E</xref>). Next, we analysed the consequence of Drp1 depletion on differentiation in the ND-51<sup>i</sup> expressing type II neuroblast lineage. Consistent with the suppression of the defect in proliferation of neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-E</xref>), the number of mINPs increased in Drp1<sup>SD</sup>;ND-51<sup>i</sup> compared to ND-51<sup>i</sup> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F and G</xref>). Furthermore, we observed an increase in mitotically dividing mINPs in Drp1<sup>SD</sup>;ND-51<sup>i</sup> compared to ND-51<sup>i</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A and B</xref>). This increased division of mINPs in Drp1<sup>SD</sup>;ND-51<sup>i</sup> type II neuroblast lineage resulted in the rescue of the number of GMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F-H</xref>), and the neurons were also partially rescued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I and J</xref>). To confirm that the rescue of differentiation defects upon Drp1<sup>SD</sup> expression was not a consequence of Gal4 dilution, we expressed UAS-mito-GFP with ND-51<sup>i</sup> and found that the numbers of mINPs, GMCs, and neurons were comparable to ND-51<sup>i</sup> alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B-F</xref>). In summary, mitochondrial fusion suppresses the differentiation defects caused by complex I depletion in the type II NB lineage.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Depletion of Drp1 suppresses the defects in G1/S progression and cyclin E nuclear accumulation in complex I knockdown type II neuroblasts</title><p id="P16">Mitochondrial activity and dynamics regulate cell cycle progression through the G1/S phase. Depletion of complex I in <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye discs causes a delay in the G1/S transition and decrease in cyclin E, mediated by high ROS levels and JNK-pathway activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Drp1 depletion also affects cyclin E levels in <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). We assessed the impact of complex I depletion on G1-S progression and cyclin E accumulation in the nucleus. We incubated the live brains with EdU (5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine), a thymidine nucleoside analog that incorporates into newly synthesised DNA during the S-phase of the cell cycle. ND-51<sup>i</sup> expressing type II neuroblast lineage showed a decreased number of EdU-positive cells and mINPs compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-C</xref>). This decrease was restored in Drp1<sup>SD</sup>;ND-51<sup>i</sup> expressing type II neuroblasts and their lineage. There was a decrease in the nuclear accumulation of cyclin E in ND-51<sup>i</sup> expressing neuroblasts compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D and E</xref>). Further, cyclin E levels in Drp1<sup>SD</sup>;ND-51<sup>i</sup> expressing neuroblasts were comparable to control and greater than ND-51<sup>i</sup> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D and E</xref>). Therefore, complex I disruption induces G1/S phase transition defects by decreasing nuclear cyclin E in type II neuroblasts.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Decreased MMP, mitochondrial fragmentation, decreased cristae numbers and increased ROS production in complex I depleted type II neuroblasts is rescued by mitochondrial fusion</title><p id="P17">Disruption of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) in neuroblasts leads to mitochondrial fragmentation, decreased mitochondrial activity, and altered metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). We measured the changes in MMP, cristae organization, and ROS generation to assess mitochondrial functionality in complex I depleted type II neuroblasts. We used the potentiometric dye, Tetra-methyl-rhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), to assess MMP in living third-instar larval brains. TMRM fluorescence was measured in type II neuroblasts and expressed as a ratio to neighbouring control type I neuroblasts. We observed a significant reduction in MMP in ND-51 and ND-19 depleted type II neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A and B</xref>). Mitochondrial fusion by Drp1<sup>SD</sup> expression did not alter the MMP, and co-expression of Drp1<sup>SD</sup> with ND-51<sup>i</sup> and ND-19<sup>i</sup> in type II neuroblasts restored the MMP.</p><p id="P18">The inner mitochondrial membrane in fused mitochondria can accommodate well-organised lamellar cristae, whereas fragmented mitochondria contain poor cristae morphology. From a functional perspective, cristae expand the surface area of the inner mitochondrial membrane, thereby increasing ETC components, for increased oxidative phosphorylation leading to higher MMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). By concentrating proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and lowering the mean distance between electron transport chain (ETC) complexes, cristae behave as specialised compartments that ensure favourable conditions for ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Therefore, cristae disruption might be the reason for reduced MMP on complex I depletion in neuroblasts. To study cristae organization, we used transmission electron microscopy on brains expressing ND-51<sup>i</sup> and mCherry<sup>i</sup> with wor-Gal4. Control neuroblasts have relatively elongated mitochondria with cristae-rich morphology. ND-51<sup>i</sup> neuroblasts possess fragmented mitochondria; the mitochondria are smaller and have less crossectional area. The ND-51<sup>i</sup> neuroblasts have fewer numbers and poorly organised cristae than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C-E</xref>). In Drp1<sup>SD</sup>;ND-51<sup>i</sup> expressing type II neuroblasts, mitochondrial morphology and cristae number were similar to Drp1<sup>SD</sup>;mCherry<sup>i</sup> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C-E</xref>). These observations show that the rescue of MMP by mitochondrial fusion in complex I depleted neuroblasts is coincident with the achievement of appropriate mitochondrial morphology and cristae architecture.</p><p id="P19">In <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, inhibiting ETC activity induces cellular ATP stress and increased phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (pAMPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).

Incubating third-instar larval brains with a non-hydrolysable glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose also increases pAMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). To investigate if complex I depletion decreased ATP in type II neuroblasts, we assessed ATP levels in ND-51 depleted type II neuroblasts using the BioTracker ATP-Red Live Cell Dye. The fluorescence of the ATP-Red dye was found to be comparable in complex I depleted and control type II neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A and B</xref>).

DHE fluorescence in type II neuroblasts was estimated as a ratio to neighbouring control type I neuroblasts.

Depleting SOD enzymes in type II neuroblasts and larval muscle showed mitochondrial fragmentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5E</xref>), but interestingly, MMP was not altered in SOD1<sup>i</sup> type II neuroblasts but decreased slightly in SOD2<sup>i</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5F and G</xref>).

Downregulation of SOD1/2 also led to a decreased number of total EdU positive cells in the lineage, and the proportion of mINPs positive for EdU also declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F-H</xref>). This decreased proliferation of cells in type II neuroblast lineage was consistent with the decrease of nuclear cyclin E localisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6I and J</xref>). These results show that enhanced ROS generation in type II neuroblasts impedes nuclear cyclin E levels, leading to proliferation defects and ultimately resulting in a decreased number of differentiated cells in the lineage. ROS is therefore causally linked to proliferation and defects caused by complex I depletion in type II neuroblasts.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Overexpression of ROS scavengers in complex I depleted type II neuroblast suppresses differentiation and G1/S transition defects</title><p id="P23">Since elevated ROS via complex I depletion or depletion of superoxide scavenging enzymes led to loss of differentiation in the type II neuroblasts, we assessed if decreasing the ROS levels in ND-51<sup>i</sup> by overexpression of SOD2 would alleviate the differentiation defect in ND-51<sup>i</sup>. Overexpression of SOD2 in type II neuroblasts did not change ROS levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C and D</xref>) and the number of mINPs, GMCs and neurons as compared to controls. But overexpression of SOD2 in ND-51 depleted type II neuroblasts (SOD2<sup>OE</sup>;ND-51<sup>i</sup>) decreased ROS levels compared to ND-51<sup>i</sup> alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C and D</xref>). Further, the SOD2<sup>OE</sup>;ND-51<sup>i</sup> combination showed a restoration of the numbers of mINPs, GMCs and neurons in each type II neuroblast lineage as compared to ND-51<sup>i</sup> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A-E</xref>). Rescue of differentiation defects in SOD2<sup>OE</sup>;ND-51<sup>i</sup> type II neuroblasts was consistent with the rescue of S-phase proliferation defects in the lineage, the number of EdU positive cells and proportion of EdU positive mINPs were higher than the ND-51<sup>i</sup> alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A-C</xref>). Also, nuclear cyclin E levels in SOD2<sup>OE</sup>;ND-51<sup>i</sup> type II neuroblasts were similar to those observed in controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6D and E</xref>). SOD2<sup>OE</sup>;ND-51<sup>i</sup> expressing type II showed a loss of MMP as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5F and G</xref>) and this was similar to like ND51<sup>i</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A and B</xref>), suggesting that proliferation and differentiation defects on complex I depletion are because of high ROS but not MMP loss. Since mitochondrial fusion by Drp1 depletion in complex I downregulated type II neuroblast rescued differentiation defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) by lowering ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F and G</xref>), we expressed Drp1<sup>SG</sup> in SOD2<sup>i</sup> type II neuroblast.

These findings show a crucial role for maintenance of appropriate ROS levels by mitochondrial fusion and complex I activity in regulating differentiation in the type II neuroblast lineage.</p><p id="P24">In summary, the elevation of ROS levels in type II neuroblasts, induced by either complex I or SOD depletion, leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and differentiation defects by abrogating the G1/S phase transition. However, restoring ROS levels by overexpressing scavenging enzymes or fusing mitochondria by depleting Drp1 in these neuroblasts rescues the differentiation defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7F</xref>). Our studies demonstrate that relatively fused mitochondrial morphology plays a crucial role as an essential regulator of ETC activity and ROS, facilitating progression through the cell cycle for differentiation in neuroblasts of <italic>Drosophila.</italic></p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">We show that optimal complex I activity and mitochondrial fusion limits ROS to regulate the cell cycle and differentiation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> type II neuroblast lineage. We discuss our results in the context of the following: 1] the mechanism by which there is a change in ROS by complex I depletion and how mitochondrial fusion impacts this change and 2] the mechanism of control of mitochondrial activity and morphology in <italic>vivo</italic> in stem cell differentiation.</p><p id="P26">During electron transport through ETC complexes, 0.2-2% of electrons escape ETC and interact with oxygen to form superoxides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Complex I and complex III, are the main sites of ROS production in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Dysfunctionality of complex I or its inhibition by rotenone leads to inefficient transfer of electrons, leading to their build-up and increase in ROS by reaction with oxygen in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). We observed an increase of ROS on complex I depletion by depleting its subunits ND-51 or mammalian NDUFV1 and ND-19 or mammalian NDUFA8. ND-51 belongs to the core hydrophilic matrix and catalyses the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ and is part of ~815kDa complex I assembly intermediate. Downregulation of ND-51 and ND-19 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle decreases complex I assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Thus, disrupting complex I formation in type II neuroblasts on ND-51 and ND-19 knockdown may cause complex I to lose electrons and produce ROS. Reverse electron transfer (RET) may be another possibility for generation of increased ROS. RET catalyses the reduction of matrix NAD+ with electrons provided by CoQH2. The electrons from complex I and II are transferred to CoQH2, some are further moved to complex III (FET, forward electron transfer), and others flow back to complex I (RET). Excessive ROS is generated during RET compared to FET, presumably due to the dissociation of FMNH<sub>2</sub> from complex I and the reaction with matrix O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). FMN and the CoQ reduction sites of complex I are centres for ROS production during RET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).</p><p id="P27">In complex I deficient neuroblasts, mitochondrial fusion might reduce ROS generation via facilitating ETC supercomplex formation in the cristae. These supercomplexes increase electron transport efficiency between ETC complexes by optimising the distance between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Hydrogen peroxide, a small and electrically neutral molecule, diffuses through the inner and outer membranes of mitochondria to reach the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Superoxides on the other hand may pass to the cytoplasm through mitochondrial channels. Increased ROS accumulation beyond a threshold level in mitochondria induces the opening of mitochondrial channels, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) and inner membrane anion channel (IMAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), which releases ROS to the cytoplasm, accompanied by MMP dissipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). ROS accumulation in the cytosol promotes the opening of MPT and IMAC in other mitochondria, called ROS-induced ROS release (RIRR). Therefore, RIRR might be another reason for MMP loss on complex I depletion and mitochondrial fusion rescuing MMP by inhibiting RIRR through decreasing ROS levels.</p><p id="P28">Decrease in complex I subunits leads to mitochondrial fragmentation. This is likely to occur due to the alteration of mitochondrial fusion and fission proteins or the impact of ROS on mitochondrial fusion and fission proteins. Complex I inhibition by rotenone induces mitochondrial fission in a Drp1 dependent manner in neurons in the Parkinson’s disease model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Decreasing mitochondrial fission by expressing a dominant-negative Drp1 or overexpressing Mfn led to the inhibition of apoptosis of these neurons. Increase in ROS has also been shown to increase expression of Drp1 and activate Drp1 fission by increasing phosphorylation at the 616 residue in mouse hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). ROS can regulate mitochondrial dynamics by modulating fusion and fission proteins at the transcriptional level and through post-translational modifications. High cellular ROS activates MAP kinases like ERK, which then phosphorylate and activate Drp1, promoting fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). In hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated ROS generation facilitates survival by activating the AKT pathway, which then activates NF-κB. This pathway leads to the expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial fission, like Drp1, and suppresses fusion proteins MFN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Various signalling pathways regulate mitochondrial activity and stem cell differentiation. Notch signalling regulates mitochondrial morphology and thereby affects stem cell fate decisions. In mice, less Notch signaling maintains fragmented mitochondria and promotes intestinal stem cells and neural stem cells differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Fused mitochondria morphology promotes the differentiation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestinal stem cells by maintaining low ROS and suppressing JNK pathway. Inducing mitochondrial fragmentation elevated ROS levels and JNK activity, and inhibited differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).
