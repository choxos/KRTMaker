Yet how they estimate the distance to an odour source remains unclear. The spatiotemporal dynamics of natural odour plumes, shaped by airflow turbulence, offer valuable cues for locating odour sources. Here, we show that mice can discriminate odour sources placed at different distances by extracting information from the sub-sniff temporal structure of naturalistic odour plumes. Using a wind tunnel and an olfactory virtual reality system, we generated dynamic plumes and demonstrated, through high-throughput automated behaviour, that mice distinguish near from far sources based on odour fluctuations operating faster than their respiratory cycle. Two-photon calcium imaging of olfactory bulb projection neurons revealed that distance-dependent responses are present in a small subset of mitral and tufted cells, and that population activity encodes source distance. Critically, neural responses correlated more strongly with high-frequency plume features than with mean odour concentration. Our results identify a neural basis for distance estimation from odour dynamics and highlight the importance of rapid temporal processing in mammalian olfaction.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Olfaction provides animals with the remarkable ability to remotely sample their environment under low-visibility conditions, a vital skill for crepuscular and nocturnal species, such as rodents. Rather than relying solely on direct contact, as taste does, mice detect airborne odours carried by complex, often turbulent airflows, enabling them to gather information about distant objects, such as potential food sources, predators, or mating opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Marin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">McKissick et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Sunil et al., 2024</xref>). From an ecological standpoint, the ability to estimate how far away an odour source is can be crucial for a rodent’s survival. For instance, detecting the scent of a predator at close range prompts immediate evasive action, whereas sensing it from afar might allow continued foraging. In the same way, evaluating whether a food source is realistically within reach helps the animal to conserve energy and minimise exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Findley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gire et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In natural environments, odour signals rarely spread as uniform gradients. Instead, they form spatiotemporally complex, dynamic plumes shaped by turbulent airflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Crimaldi et al., 2022</xref>). Within these plumes, pockets and filaments of higher concentration are interspersed with intervals of relatively odour-free air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Celani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Crimaldi &amp; Koseff, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Moore &amp; Atema, 1991</xref>), producing odour events on timescales of tens to hundreds of milliseconds, often exceeding typical sniffing frequencies of 4–12 Hz in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Wachowiak, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Welker, 1964</xref>). As a plume travels farther from its source, it expands spatially while changing its temporal statistics, including odour event parameters such as peak height, onset slope, and intermittency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Reddy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Schmuker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Vergassola et al., 2007</xref>). These features therefore carry crucial information about the distance to an odour source, offering cues to guide navigation and decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Balkovsky &amp; Shraiman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Mafra-Neto &amp; Cardé, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Rigolli et al., 2022</xref>). One key open question is whether and how rodents exploit these high-frequency fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ackels et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dasgupta et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Marin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Sunil et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Tootoonian et al., 2025</xref>). If rodents can capitalise on this temporal information, it would not only enable them to pinpoint and distinguish different sources from the atmospheric background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Rokni et al., 2014</xref>), but also to construct a spatial map of their environment using purely olfactory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Jacobs, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Poo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Sterrett et al., 2024</xref>). Critically, such a strategy would let them rapidly locate and identify odours without needing to physically move between sources to confirm their identity or position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gire et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Behavioural evidence indicates that rodents might indeed exploit these transient cues. In certain odour localisation tasks, mice commit to a directional choice shortly after detecting the odour, well before they have traversed the entire distance to the source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Findley et al., 2021</xref>). This early commitment suggests that relevant spatial information is available in the odour signal itself, even at a distance. Moreover, when mice are trained in multi-choice arenas where multiple strategies such as memory-based foraging are possible, they sometimes switch between systematic searching and potentially more nuanced reliance on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the odour stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Findley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gire et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Tariq et al., 2024</xref>). The fact that they do so under conditions of high plume complexity hints that rodents can integrate rapid temporal changes of the stimulus that might be missed by simpler gradient-following strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gire et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jones &amp; Urban, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Khan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Growing evidence suggests that each sniff captures not just a static snapshot of odour composition but can also convey intricate temporal details. In rodents, behavioural experiments with optogenetic stimulation have shown that mice can discriminate between inputs delivered as little as 10-20 ms apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Rebello et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Smear et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">2013</xref>), and asynchronous stimulation across the two olfactory bulbs can elicit different responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kuruppath et al., 2021</xref>). Systematic investigations of their temporal discrimination abilities have revealed that mice can discriminate odour correlation structures at frequencies up to 40 Hz, surpassing their typical sniffing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ackels et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dasgupta et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Warner et al., 2024</xref>). A head-restrained odour-counting task reveals that mice integrate sporadic, plume-like odour pulses across dozens of sniffs, giving greater weight to inhalation-phase stimuli which might ultimately constrain behavioural accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Boero et al., 2025</xref>). Psychophysical work in humans shows that observers can distinguish the temporal order of odour pulses spaced by as little as 120 ms within a single sniff, indicating that fine-grained temporal coding extends across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Wu et al., 2024</xref>). This capacity challenges earlier assumptions that the mammalian nasal cavity and slow transduction kinetics of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) would “wash out” high-frequency features of incoming odour plumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Duchamp-Viret et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kepecs et al., 2006</xref>). Instead, recent physiological and modelling work indicates that the convergence of large populations of ORNs in the olfactory bulb (OB), allows access to fast-changing odour signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ackels et al., 2021</xref>). Correspondingly, OB projection neurons, mitral and tufted cells (MTCs), can encode odour correlation structure at frequencies up to 20 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ackels et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dasgupta et al., 2022</xref>). Further it has been shown that odour events such as onset, offset, whiffs, and blanks are tightly coupled to MTC population activity, with different MTC clusters exhibiting varying degrees of correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lewis et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">2024</xref>) and that mice can discriminate odour stimuli of low and high intermittency values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gumaste et al., 2024</xref>). Such high-frequency processing confers a potential advantage for resolving spatial information from turbulent odour plumes. It could, for instance, enable rodents to perform source separation, correctly assigning odour molecules to their respective origins, and help tackle the “olfactory cocktail party problem” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hopfield, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Rokni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Tootoonian et al., 2025</xref>). An olfactory system with access to rapid fluctuations allows mammals to extract distance and direction cues without physically sampling multiple locations, thereby improving efficiency in odour-driven spatial tasks.</p><p id="P8">Here, we tested whether mice can indeed extract distance-related information from the spatiotemporal structure of odour plumes. By combining wind tunnel recordings in an automated behavioural setup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Erskine et al., 2019</xref>) and an “olfactory virtual reality” system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ackels et al., 2021</xref>), we systematically explored how temporal features at various frequencies contribute to distance discrimination. Our results show that odour fluctuations in the sub-sniff frequency range are especially informative about space, providing more salient distance cues than slower timescale averages such as mean concentration. Mice learned to distinguish odour sources placed at different distances purely based on these high-frequency cues, underscoring the temporal bandwidth of rodent olfaction. Furthermore, two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in the OB identified a subpopulation of MTCs that exhibit distance-dependent responses, suggesting a neural correlate for this spatial sensitivity. Overall, our work demonstrates that rodents can make use of rapid temporal signatures of odour plumes for spatial perception.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mice can discriminate between odours originating from near and far sources</title><p id="P9">Natural odour plumes are shaped by airflow turbulence, resulting in high-frequency odour intensity fluctuations that may contain information about odour source location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gumaste et al., 2020</xref>, p. 20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hopfield, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Recent work has shown that mice can access high frequency components of odour stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ackels et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dasgupta et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Warner et al., 2024</xref>), and suggested this could be used by mice to gather spatial information using olfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ackels et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bhattacharyya &amp; Singh Bhalla, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Findley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). In this work, we investigated whether mice can extract and use this information to discern odour source relative distance, and how this information is represented in the OB.</p><p id="P10">To this end, we first created a naturalistic but controlled environment that was robust enough to allow for long-term, high-throughput animal training, but complex enough to mimic naturally-occurring plumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-C</xref>). Odour stimuli were generated with custom-built distance Odour Delivery Devices (dODDs, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) placed inside a wind tunnel, using a passive-release mechanism (liquid odour picked up by passing airflow when the dODD is opened, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1.1, S1.2 A,B</xref>). This approach allowed for odour plumes to be generated anew for every trial, thus creating highly complex temporal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) under reproducible conditions that nevertheless mimic the high variability occurring under natural conditions.</p><p id="P11">A home cage-based automated behavioural system (AutonoMouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Erskine et al., 2019</xref>); <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>) was connected to the downwind end of the wind tunnel, allowing the animals to sample odour plumes created inside the wind tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1.3</xref>). This allowed us to simultaneously train a cohort of group-housed mice (n = 24) for a long period of time (up to 14 weeks), resulting in a large number of trials (4053.9 ± 660 trials/animal). Using this system, mice were trained to discriminate categories of odour plumes originating from different distances using an olfactory Go/No-Go (GNG) task paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-D</xref>). By harnessing the high number of trials that can be generated and presented to the mice, we were not limited to predetermined stimulus structures and can thus study discrimination ability in mice in a naturalistic context with ethological relevance, where the stimulus is highly variable, but also highly informative of odour source distance.</p><p id="P12">Mice were trained to respond with licking to the S+ and suppress licking to S- stimuli, where the odour source distance associated with a reward (S+) was “Near” for half of the animals, and “Far” for the other half (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1.5</xref>). The total duration of licking (total time licked) was calculated for each trial and used in the analysis of discrimination ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1.6</xref>). Using this measure, we found the distribution of total time licked to be different between S+ and S- trials for 16/24 mice (p &lt; 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U test). More specifically, mice showed a narrower distribution of lick durations during S+ trials compared to a wider distribution, often shifted to the left or with an additional peak below 200 ms for S-trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> example mouse, more mice in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1.6</xref>). This suggests mice were more engaged in licking to S+ trials, compared to S- (they spent more time licking and licked more consistently over a large number of trials).</p><p id="P13">To quantify the difference between the distributions of lick durations in response to S+ or S-trials, we split the response window at a threshold of t = 200 ms and calculated a discrimination index defined as the ratio between the number of S- trials and the number of S+ trials with a lick duration smaller than the threshold t (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). A ratio &gt;1 indicated a higher number of S- trials with lick durations shorter than t, indicating correct lick behaviour. Conversely, a ratio value &lt;1 indicated a preference for S+ trials. For a perfectly trained mouse with no bias, the ratio value would tend towards infinity, while a ratio value close to 1 would indicate no preference (and therefore no difference between S+ and S-). To distinguish a real difference from one obtained by chance, while also taking the lick bias and the difficulty of the task into account, we compared the ratios obtained for individual mice to ratios calculated from their own responses, after shuffling the labels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1.6M</xref>). All mice showed a Discrimination index &gt;1 and the differences were significant for 19/24 mice (p &lt; 0.001) when compared to the corresponding shuffled controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Additionally, lick duration distributions remained robustly different for any threshold chosen between 50 and 600 ms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1.6N,O</xref>). This analysis was necessary due to a clear bias for licking present in all mice. Thus, most mice displayed almost 100% accuracy in responding to S+ stimuli by licking (Hits). However, when mice did refrain from licking, they predominantly did so only in S- trials, as evidenced by the lower lick fraction recorded in S- trials compared to S+ trials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1.4</xref>, fraction licked split by S+/S-), resulting in fewer False Alarms while still displaying a high Hit rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig S1.6P</xref>). This is what allows mice to perform with above chance accuracy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1.4</xref>). Overall, we conclude mice can discriminate odour sources placed at different distances based on the different lick behaviours expressed in response to S+ compared to S-.</p><p id="P14">The primary aim of the behaviour experiment described above was to determine whether mice are capable of discriminating between odour stimuli with the same odour identity, but delivered from two different locations in space, and thus arriving at the nose of the animal with different temporal structures. We found that mice were capable of this discrimination, but it remained unclear what information in the stimulus they were using to inform their responses. In order to answer this question, we further aimed to investigate what information is present in the odour plumes presented to the mouse, and what information from these plumes is accessible to the mouse olfactory system.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>What features of the odour plume allow for distance discrimination?</title><p id="P15">To analyse what information is available in the plume structure that would allow distance discrimination, we recorded temporal structures of odour plumes using a photoionization detector (PID). We placed the detector in the same location where a mouse’s nose would be during a trial, and delivered odours as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). This was done during the same period as animal training (though not simultaneously), with the additional purpose of confirming stimulus stability throughout the training period. This large plume bank allowed us to get a handle on the large variability seen in naturalistic plumes, which is a key feature of our approach, as well as an experimental challenge. The temporal structure of recorded odour plumes was different between distances. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> shows example recorded plumes from a far source and near source, respectively. Additional examples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2.1</xref>) further illustrate the differences between distances, as well as the variability within categories and across recorded plumes overall.</p><p id="P16">To quantify the differences in the temporal structure of odour plumes, we compared the two distance categories for eight features calculated for each plume instance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2.2, S2.3, S2.5</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>): mean odour concentration, maximum odour concentration (largest peak height), number of peaks, maximum peak prominence, standard deviation, variance, kurtosis, skewness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2.3</xref> with all features). The most substantial differences were observed in temporal features of the plumes, such as number or height of peaks. These were also the features that allowed for the highest accuracy of a linear discriminant trained on individual features one at a time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2.4</xref>). Moreover, combining different features allows for almost perfect classification of plumes into near and far categories (tSNE, eight features used, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) where the number of peaks is the most informative axis for the discrimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2.7</xref> for complementary dimensionality reduction analysis using PCA). Thus, the temporal structure of odour plumes contains enough information to distinguish stimuli from sources at different distances, with some features allowing for higher discrimination accuracy than others.</p><p id="P17">In order to further investigate which features are most informative, we moved to a more controlled setting, in which we could readily simulate odour plumes from different distances using a high-speed odour delivery device: the temporal Odour Delivery Device (tODD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ackels et al., 2021</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Using this device, we were able to reproduce the recorded structures described above with high fidelity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2.8, S2.9, S2.10</xref>). The reproduction strategy retained the discriminability between plume categories based on individual features by capturing the differences and variability in features observed in recorded plumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2.11, S2.12</xref>).</p><p id="P18">By capturing and replicating the spatiotemporal attributes that differentiate near from far odour sources, we have shown that temporal features can reliably classify plume distance categories. Precise playback of these recorded plumes preserves variability across individual stimuli. This sets the stage for tightly controlled physiology experiments under head-fixation, to link the observed discriminability in behavioural tasks to neural responses in the OB.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Odour source distance is encoded in a subset of OB projection neurons</title><p id="P19">We have so far shown that mice can discriminate between odour sources placed at different distances, and that temporal information present in odour plumes would allow for this discrimination. We next examined whether these high-frequency cues are actually accessible to OB neurons. Historically, the brief, rapidly fluctuating concentration peaks found in turbulent plumes were assumed to exceed the temporal resolution of mammalian olfaction. However, recent work suggests otherwise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ackels et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dasgupta et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Warner et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Wu et al., 2024</xref>). To investigate whether the OB can indeed extract distance-related information from naturalistic plume structures, we combined a method for reliably recreating plume dynamics with two-photon calcium imaging of dorsal OB projection neurons (MTCs) in head-fixed, anaesthetised mice (Tbet-cre:GCaMP6f, n=3), while simultaneously monitoring respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-C</xref>). Rather than repeatedly presenting a single plume signature, we delivered 40 distinct “near” plumes and 40 distinct “far” plumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, outer columns), capturing a broad range of temporal features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G-H</xref>). This allowed us to assess whether information about distance can be extracted by the OB from highly variable, naturalistic stimuli. Additionally, the large number of distinct plumes, and the resulting wide range of different features and feature combinations covered by our stimulus space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G-H</xref>), allowed us to further probe into how different features of naturalistic odour plumes are represented in the OB.</p><p id="P20">To assess whether the OB is able to discriminate between plume structures originating from different distances, we recorded neuronal activity (as expressed by a change in GCaMP6f fluorescence, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, inner columns) in response to 40 different plume structures for each distance category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, outer columns). Across all trials (~90 per distance, two odours; ethyl butyrate and 2-heptanone), we identified a small subset (13 out of 1062 cell-odour pairs; 1.2%) that responded differently to near versus far plumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). These “distance-sensitive” cells showed stronger responses to far stimuli in the majority of cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>), and each cell’s sensitivity was typically specific to one odour (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3.1, S3.2</xref>).

It therefore led us to the question of whether these neural responses can be used to predict an odour source’s distance?

To visualise the responses underlying this classification, we plotted the average calcium signals in response to near and far plumes over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, left and middle). The difference map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, right) highlights that a subset of cell-odour pairs exhibited higher activity in response to far plumes (blue) or near plumes (red). A linear classifier was trained on the population responses of all recorded cell-odour pairs to determine whether the stimulus originated from a near or far source, based on the ensemble activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Classifier performance steadily increased with the number of cell-odour pairs included (purple line, maximum performance: 73.0 ± 9.0%), substantially exceeding the shuffled control accuracy (black line). This result indicates that while only a fraction of MTCs responded significantly differentially to distance, activity patterns across the population of cells carry significant information about plume origin. Further classification analyses for both odours individually (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4.1, S4.2</xref>) and a pairwise comparison between further intermediate odour source distances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4.3</xref>) can be found in the supplement.</p><p id="P23">When comparing mean responses of individual cells to far versus near conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), the majority of responses showed similar amplitude for both plume types, but a subset (purple) fell above the unity line, showing stronger responses towards far stimuli. When we further segregated these cells’ activity by odour identity, it became clear that distance sensitivity was associated with the odour that elicited stronger responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4.4, S4.5</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that even modest differences in MTC response strength allow above-chance prediction of odour source distance from population activity.</p><p id="P24">In the final part of our results, we will examine which temporal features of naturalistic plumes underlie this distance-dependent coding, providing a direct link between the neural representation in the OB and the animal’s ability to discriminate odour sources at varying distances.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Stimulus features informing distance-sensitivity</title><p id="P25">We first demonstrated that mice can discriminate between odour sources placed at different distances. Additionally, we showed distance-related information is also discernible from the activity of OB projection neurons. Next, we aimed to understand which features of the stimulus inform the OB (and consequently the animal) about distance. To this end, we took advantage of the wide range of plume structures we presented in the head-fixed setting. As described above (and<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>), we presented 40 different plume structures for each distance category, with each plume not only informing about distance, but also expressing many temporal features, in different combinations. Thus, this experimental design allowed us to analyse cell responses not only in terms of preference for a particular distance, but also preference for specific features of the odour plume. To further leverage diversity in the temporal features space, we introduced two intermediate source distances (40 cm and 60 cm) for a total of 160 different plume structures presented to the mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). For each plume we defined extracted values for an array of different features. This allowed us to move beyond simple near vs far comparison (broad categories) and explore how the OB encodes specific temporal features across and within categories. To support consistent plume presentation and alignment, respiration was recorded during the experiments and remained stable across mice and conditions at ~2 Hz (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S5.1</xref>). Stimuli were aligned to inhalation onset, ensuring consistent timing across trials. We also verified that total and inhaled odour concentrations were broadly matched across distances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S5.2</xref>), ensuring that observed neural differences were not simply driven by concentration differences but solely by temporal plume structure. When examining odour exposure on a per-sniff basis, we found that the amount of odour inhaled during the first sniff was comparable across distances, while differences in the inhaled odour amount between sniffs emerged from the second sniff onwards, particularly for near versus far plumes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S5.3</xref>).</p><p id="P26">To investigate which stimulus properties drive the responses of distance-sensitive cells, we leveraged the substantial variability in temporal features within each distance category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Specifically, we examined the correlation between trial-by-trial response amplitudes and individual plume features. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref> illustrates the method for a representative distance-sensitive ROI: the calcium response is plotted against three plume descriptors (mean odour concentration, number of peaks and maximum peak concentration). This approach revealed cells whose activity is strongly correlated to certain plume features. For example, the response of Cell ii in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref> appears to be closely linked to the total odour inhaled. Notably, for distance-sensitive cells the strongest negative correlations appeared with the plume features that best indicate source distance. These features operate at sub-sniff timescales, such as the number of peaks and the maximum peak concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C,D</xref>). When we sorted all recorded cells by their correlation with distance, we observed that correlation between response and distance could be inversely mapped to the correlation between response and sub-sniff temporal features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, bottom part of the heatmap). In contrast, no pattern emerged between correlation with distance and average correlation measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Collectively, these findings underscore that sub-sniff temporal dynamics, rather than simple concentration averages, serve as key indicators of source distance for OB neurons.

To investigate how rodents might perform such discrimination, we developed an experimental setup that reliably produces temporally complex odour plumes from different distances, striking a balance between naturalistic complexity and experimental control. With high-throughput behavioural assays and <italic>in vivo</italic> physiological recordings, we examined whether mice can discriminate the distance of different odour sources and how distance-related temporal plume features are encoded within the OB.</p><p id="P29">Our results demonstrate that mice can discriminate odour sources placed at different spatial distances, showing for the first time that information within odour plumes provides sufficient cues for distance discrimination. We observed that plume features at sub-sniff timescales, rather than broader measures such as mean odour concentration, carried more information to discriminate odour source distances. Particularly the number of peaks and maximum peak concentration provided higher accuracy in distinguishing between near and far sources. This aligns with odour bout count and stimulus intermittency measures proposed in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gumaste et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Schmuker et al., 2016</xref>). We conducted plume feature analysis at high sampling frequencies (1 kHz) which likely exceeds the temporal resolution of mouse olfactory perception (approximately 40 Hz; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ackels et al., 2021</xref>)) and thereby potentially inflates peak counts and magnitude values. Future studies should systematically test plume feature reliability and informativeness at various sampling frequencies to align with rodent sensory capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Boero et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gumaste et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lewis et al., 2024</xref>). The distances we chose for our experiments provided clear and discriminable statistical differences in plume features, effectively capturing the natural variability rodents might encounter in their environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Reddy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Rigolli et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that the four distances studied grouped into two distinct categories, suggesting a near versus far categorisation as opposed to a gradient mapping of source distance. This categorical distinction may reflect an intrinsic boundary in rodent olfactory perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Rigolli et al., 2022</xref>). Yet, whether this categorization generalises beyond our experimental settings remains to be determined. Expanding the range of distances and systematically varying environmental parameters, such as airflow dynamics and obstacle configuration, would clarify how robustly specific plume features inform distance discrimination across diverse contexts.</p><p id="P30">Our findings show mice consistently displayed differential licking responses to odour sources at varying distances, although achieving consistently high discrimination accuracy proved challenging. Several factors likely contributed to this moderate performance. Notably, the inherent asymmetry of the Go/No-Go task, where an impulsive action (licking) is contrasted against inhibitory control (withholding licking), might have influenced overall accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Carandini &amp; Churchland, 2013</xref>). Detailed analysis of licking patterns revealed that mice were more consistently responsive during rewarded (S+) trials, suggesting clear reward anticipation, whereas variability in responses during non-rewarded (S−) trials might reflect fluctuations in motivation rather than genuine perceptual errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Berditchevskaia et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, efforts to mitigate predictable differences in odour arrival times between distances, by incorporating variable onset delays and flexible trial termination, inadvertently intensified task asymmetry. Although designed to maintain engagement, these adjustments allowed mice to conclude rewarded trials prematurely while requiring them to endure the full duration of non-rewarded trials for a correct response. Consequently, mice may have strategically licked simply to reduce trial durations, potentially decoupling their licking decisions from actual stimulus discrimination. Taking these behavioural and task-design considerations into account, it seems likely that mice possess greater discrimination capability than was observed under our current experimental conditions. Refining the training paradigm, for instance by implementing a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bitzenhofer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Boero et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Nakayama et al., 2022</xref>) to mitigate motivational biases, may help shed further light onto the limits of sensory discrimination capabilities.</p><p id="P31">A key question we asked was: How is odour source distance represented in the OB? To ensure naturalistic variability of temporal patterns, we exposed animals to a wide range of plume structures recorded from near and far sources. When decoding odour source distance from the population of MTC calcium responses, we found that accuracy exceeded behavioural performance of mice proficient in the discrimination task. This suggests that distance information carried by odour plumes could, in principle, support even more precise discrimination. Strikingly, a small subset of individual MTCs exhibited clear differential responses to near versus far plume sources, with most distance-selective MTCs responding more strongly to far than to near stimuli in most cases. Notably, this tuning was already present in naïve animals that had never been trained to judge source distance. To understand what might be driving this selectivity, we presented a large and diverse set of plume structures, including intermediate distances (40 cm and 60 cm). When correlating neural responses in a trial-by-trial fashion with specific stimulus features, we observed that their activity tended to correlate inversely with sub-sniff plume features most predictive of source distance. Furthermore, when sorting cells by their correlation with distance, we found that their response tuning could be almost perfectly mapped to their tuning to these fast temporal features. In contrast, correlations with broader, average plume statistics did not show such a pattern. These findings suggest that fast fluctuations in odour intensity, rather than slow integrative cues, may play a central role in how OB neurons encode spatial information. We acknowledge, however, that this observation is correlative, and future work is needed to determine whether these features are used directly by the OB circuitry to support behavioural discrimination.</p><p id="P32">What cellular or circuit mechanisms could account for these distance-dependent responses? One possibility is that MTCs are not “counting peaks” per se, but instead integrate the constancy of odour concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Boero et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lewis et al., 2024</xref>). Less-peaky, more continuous plumes (typical of far sources) could drive a larger, temporally summated input from ORNs than highly intermittent near plumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lewis et al., 2024</xref>). Since ORNs of a given receptor type are scattered across the epithelium before converging onto the same glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Malnic et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Mombaerts et al., 1996</xref>), pockets of odorised air will likely recruit partially non-overlapping ORN ensembles over time. A smoother plume might therefore activate a larger part of that ensemble, whereas a smoother plume with low intermittency may engage fewer ORNs within brief time windows. Additional temporal summation could occur at the level of individual ORNs or of their postsynaptic MTCs, as ORN spike fidelity drops at high stimulation frequencies or high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Ghatpande &amp; Reisert, 2011</xref>). Taken together, this could transform fine-scale plume fluctuations into population codes that emphasise the more stable temporal signature of distant sources. Consistent with this view, the distance-sensitive MTCs we identified were generally more narrowly tuned to odour identity. This raises the testable idea that the most reliable responders within a glomerular column jointly encode both chemical identity and temporally derived spatial information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arneodo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P33">Methodologically, our calcium imaging approach is well suited for identifying and targeting specific neurons, but its temporal resolution limits capturing millisecond-scale plume dynamics. Future work using high-density electrophysiology, faster GCaMP variants, or genetically encoded voltage indicators will be essential to resolve the precise timing of ORN and MTC firing relative to fine temporal plume features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lewis et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Storace et al., 2015</xref>). Combining such recordings with selective activation of a single, genetically labelled glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arneodo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Schwarz et al., 2018</xref>), and multiplexed imaging of both ORN input and MTC output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Martelli &amp; Storace, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Storace &amp; Cohen, 2017</xref>) could reveal how lateral inhibition, sister-cell diversity (Zhang et al., 2025), and molecular specialisations together give rise to distance-sensitive signalling in the OB.</p><p id="P34">Our results show that mice can discriminate the distance of an odour source by tracking rapid, sub-sniff changes in a plume, and that a subset of MTCs in the OB reflects this information. By tying together plume measurements, behaviour, and single-cell activity, we add a strong link between the physics of natural odours, animal behaviour and neural coding. Future studies could further clarify which temporal plume features rodents utilise for spatial discrimination in different contexts by employing an olfactory virtual reality coupled with precise plume control, or even in unrestrained mice. Such experiments will help to pinpoint precisely, how specific olfactory bulb circuits transform natural chemical signals into reliable cues for navigation.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Behaviour experiments</title><sec id="S11"><title>Animals</title><p id="P35">All animal procedures performed in this study were approved by the UK government (Home Office PPL number PA2F6DA12) and by Institutional Animal Welfare Ethical Review Panel.

Within the common home cage of AutonoMouse, mice have free access to food, social interaction and environmental enrichment (including nesting material, chew blocks, climbing frames, cardboard tubes, cardboard and red plastic houses). Water is not freely available in the system, but can be gained at any time by completion of an operant conditioning Go/No-Go task. To access these behavioural tasks, mice must leave the home cage and enter a behavioural area. This behavioural area contains the odour port and a lick port through which water rewards can be released. The lick port is also connected to a lick sensor, which registers the animal’s response (time spent in contact with the sensor) in response to the task stimuli. As animals can only gain their daily water intake by completing behavioural tasks, mice are motivated to complete long sequences of trials without manual water restriction. However, there is no limit on how many times mice can trigger a trial, or how much time they can spend in the odour port, which could add additional constraints on using timeouts for negative reinforcements.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Acclimatisation to the AutonoMouse system</title><p id="P39">Animals were weighed and their weight recorded on the day they were transferred to the AutonoMouse and then every day for 2 weeks.</p><p id="P40">The first phase of the behavioural task assigned to all animals was a ’pre-training’ phase, designed to train animals to reliably gain their water intake from the behavioural port. This phase was itself split into multiple tasks. At first water was delivered as soon as an animal was detected in the behaviour port (20 trials). Next, water was delivered only if the mouse licked at least once after activating the behaviour port (50 trials). Following from that, the percentage of total trial time (2 s) that the animal must lick to gain a water reward was increased in 50 ms increments up to 10% of trial length, or 200 ms (50 trials per step). Each water reward was initially 15 µl. This was adjusted to 10-30 µl depending on animal performance (to ensure all mice performed roughly the same number of trials per day).</p><p id="P41">For the first two weeks of any AutonoMouse experiment, animal weights were checked daily to ensure health status of the cohort.

A custom head-fixation implant was attached to the base of the skull with medical super glue (Vetbond, 3M, Maplewood MN, USA) such that its most anterior point rested approximately 0.5 mm posterior to the bregma line. Dental cement (Paladur, Heraeus Kulzer GmbH, Hanau, Germany; Simplex Rapid Liquid, Associated Dental Products Ltd., Swindon, UK) was then applied around the edges of the implant to ensure firm adhesion to the skull. A craniotomy over the left olfactory bulb (approximately 2 × 2 mm) was made with a dental drill (Success 40, Osada, Tokyo, Japan) and then immersed in ACSF (NaCl (125 mM), KCl (5 mM), HEPES (10 mM), pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH, MgSO4.7H2O (2 mM), CaCl2.2H2O (2 mM), glucose (10 mM)) before removing the skull with forceps. The dura was then peeled back using fine forceps. A layer of 2% low-melt agarose diluted in ACSF was applied over the exposed brain surface before placing a glass window cut from a cover slip (borosilicate glass #1 thickness [150 μm]) using a diamond scalpel (Sigma-Aldrich) over the craniotomy. The edges of the window were then glued with medical super glue (Vetbond, 3M, Maplewood MN, USA) to the skull. Following surgery, mice were placed in a custom head-fixation apparatus and transferred to a two-photon microscope rig along with the heat pad.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Imaging parameters</title><p id="P58">The microscope (Scientifica Multiphoton VivoScope) was coupled with a MaiTai DeepSee laser (Spectra Physics, Santa Clara, CA) tuned to 940 nm (~30 mW average power on the sample) for imaging. Images (512 × 512 pixels, field of view 550 × 550 μm) were acquired with a resonant scanner at a frame rate of 30 Hz using a 16 × 0.8 NA water-immersion objective (Nikon). Using a piezo motor (PI Instruments, UK) connected to the objective, a volume of ~300 μm was divided into 6 planes resulting in an effective volume repetition rate of ~5 Hz. The odour port was adjusted to approximately 0.5 cm away from the ipsilateral nostril to the imaging window, and a flow sensor (A3100, Honeywell, NC, USA) was placed to the contralateral nostril for continuous respiration recording and digitised with a Power 1401 ADC board (CED, Cambridge, UK).</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Odour stimuli</title><p id="P59">For this experiment a total of 752 trials were planned to be presented for each mouse. The plumes used were recorded in the wind tunnel during the same session and were picked from the centre of the distributions of plume features as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2.3</xref>. We presented 40 plumes for each of the 4 distances using 2 main odours (EB and 2H), resulting in 320 “core” trials that were randomised before being added to the trial bank. The next 384 trials consisted of the same core 320 trials, together with an additional 8 more repeats of one plume/distance/odour, which were again independently randomised and added to the trial bank. Finally, the last 48 trials were 3 repeats of one plume/distance/odour for an additional 4 odours, also randomised. This trial order was then presented to each mouse, in blocks of 40 trials, in order to facilitate data acquisition. Odour delivery was triggered by inhalation using a threshold-crossing algorithm. The delay between trigger and odour delivery was the same for all plumes at 65ms.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Imaging data analysis</title><p id="P60">For MTC imaging, motion correction, segmentation and trace extraction were performed using the Suite2p package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p">https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p</ext-link> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>). Putative neuronal somata were automatically identified by segmentation and curated manually. Fluorescence signal from all pixels within each ROI was averaged and extracted as a time series. ΔF/F = (F − F0)/F0, in which F is raw fluorescence and F0 is the median of the fluorescence signal distribution.

Data was split into a training set and a test set using a 75:25 split stratified by category (distance). Values were then scaled using Standard Scaler. C parameter was set to 0.001.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Respiration data analysis</title><p id="P64">Respiration data was extracted using Spike 2 (CED, Cambridge, UK) and further analysed in Python 3. Inhalation was performed using a threshold crossing approach. Traces were normalised within one experiment to the maximum value over the length of the experiment, then segmented into inhalation (above threshold) and non-inhalation (below threshold) phases. This segmentation was used to create a binary signal that was overlaid on the plume traces to calculate the “inhaled plume” and features that took account of inhalation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Odour delivery</title><sec id="S29"><title>Odours used</title><p id="P65">All odours were obtained in their pure form from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO, USA. Odours used: isoamyl acetate (IAA), 1-heptanal (1H), nonanoic acid (NA), α-terpinene (AT), ethyl butyrate (EB), 2-heptanone (2H), benzyl acetate (BA). Odours used in the wind tunnel were presented in their pure form (EB, IAA). For imaging experiments, odours were diluted 1:50 in mineral oil and a further 1:2 in air, resulting in ~1:100 or 1% concentration reaching the animal.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Wind tunnel</title><p id="P66">To produce olfactory stimuli with similar temporal structures as those measured outdoors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ackels et al., 2021</xref>), a wind tunnel with near-laminar flow was developed. An obstacle placed in the airflow introduced controlled complexity to the airflow. The wind tunnel was square in cross-section and measured 165 cm (L) x 65 cm (W) x 62 cm (H). The frame was constructed from aluminium profiles (MayTec Aluminium Systemtechnik GmbH, Dachau, Germany) and walled with clear acrylic panels. The floor of the tunnel was a laboratory bench placed 5cm lower than the odour port that mice used for sampling. The obstacle was a plastic cylinder (height: 12.7 cm, diameter: 7.6 cm), positioned on the midline 15 cm downstream of the fan, inspired by the routine use of cylindrical obstacles to generate airflow turbulence in fluid dynamics research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Béra et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p id="P67">Wind generation was achieved by a centrifugal blower (D2E133-AM47-23, ebm-papst) placed in the inlet section of the tunnel, with the rear end being open for air to exit the tunnel. The room ventilation system had its outlet placed at the back of the room, above and slightly behind the mouse/PID end of the wind tunnel. To better control the airflow, we used a honeycomb structure (Hexagonal Aluminium W/CRIII Coating 3.0 3/8 .002N 5052, 10 cm in thickness, Texas Almet) placed between the fan and the tunnel, to create a largely laminar airflow. This ensured that the airflow complexity we observed was primarily created by the obstacle. Neutrally buoyant helium-filled soap bubbles (Sage Action, Inc.) were used to visualise airflow, as filmed with a high-speed camera (Basler).</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Distance Odour Delivery Device (dODD)</title><p id="P68">The distance Odour Delivery Device (dODD) was used to deliver odours into the airflow in a passive fashion. The device of choice was a custom-built ensemble of an Arduino controlled servo motor (TowerPro SG-5010, Adafruit) that rotates an aluminium lid covering a glass petri dish (5cm diameter). Eight such devices were placed inside the wind tunnel, and controlled via a compact data acquisition (cDAQ) device (National Instruments) and either PulseBoy or the AutonoMouse software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ackels et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Erskine et al., 2019</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/RoboDoig/PulseBoy">https://github.com/RoboDoig/PulseBoy</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/autonomouse-control">https://github.com/autonomouse-control</ext-link>). This also allowed for integration with the temporal ODD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ackels et al., 2021</xref>), which was adapted and integrated into the system for the imaging experiments. Before each recording session the petri dishes were filled with 10 ml ethyl butyrate (EB), which was the odour used for all plume experiments.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Temporal Odour Delivery Device (tODD)</title><p id="P69">Reproduction of recorded odour plumes was achieved with a temporal Odour Delivery Device (tODD) and custom control software, as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ackels et al., 2021</xref>. In brief, the odour delivery device was based on a modular design of four separate odour channels, and consisted of an odour manifold for odour storage, a valve manifold for control of odour release and hardware for controlling and directing airflow through the system. We used high-speed micro-dispense valves with custom electronics for pulse-width modulation to maximise bandwidth. Two manifolds of four valves were joined together using a three-way connector (TMMA3203950Z, The Lee Company) to create an eight-channel device. Pulse profiles for calibration and stimulus production were generated with custom Python software, allowing us to define pulse parameters across multiple valves using a graphical user interface. The drivers themselves were passed valve opening times via a 5 V TTL pulse from digital I/O controls via a compact data acquisition (cDAQ) device (National Instruments).</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Odour plume recordings</title><p id="P70">The temporal structure of odour plumes was recorded using a mini-PID photoionization detector with a bandwidth of ~330 Hz (200B miniPID, Aurora Scientific, Aurora ON, Canada) and Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design), sampled at 1 kHz. The tip of the detector was placed in the behaviour chamber at the centre of the odour port, to mimic the position of the nose of a mouse performing the task. For each set of recordings, the odour source was alternated between 4 different positions (near or far, left or right) inside the wind tunnel. The PID was calibrated periodically by adjusting the gain and baseline such that it would produce the same response to a series of square pulses of known amplitude (1000 ppm, 100 ppm, 10 ppm isobutylene). Thus, we could compare broad ranges of concentration over different recording sessions</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Reproduction of recorded plumes</title><p id="P71">Reproduction of recorded odour plumes was achieved using pulse-width modulation (PWM) generated with custom Python software (PyPulse, PulseBoy, daqface; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/RoboDoig">https://github.com/RoboDoig</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/warnerwarner">https://github.com/warnerwarner</ext-link>) as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ackels et al., 2021</xref>. Briefly, this was achieved by mapping odour signal amplitudes from recorded plume data to PWM duties, converting a time series of amplitudes to a time series of PWM duties. These duties could then be used as the input to an odour valve to reproduce the original signal. First, each PID trace was corrected to baseline drift by performing baseline subtraction, as compared to a 1 s period before each trial. The trace was then normalised to between 0 and 1, as set by the <italic>target_max</italic> variable in PulseBoy, and then converted into a series of binary opening and closing times, at a frequency of 500 Hz. To reproduce the plume using the whole dynamic range of the olfactometer, <italic>target_max</italic> would be set to 1. The length of the openings and closings relate directly to the value of the normalised signal, a value of 1 translates to a continuous opening, and a value of 0 translates to continuously closed. In an offline assignment, <italic>target_max</italic> values were adjusted to group ratios and within group ratios to match mean concentration over the whole plume. Thus, there was variability in the overall concentration presented, but that variability was largely within groups of plumes from the same distance, not between different distances. Generally, wherever an odour position is inactivated a blank position was activated to compensate for flow change. Thus, an inverse sequence of commands as used for the plume generation, termed “anti-plume”, was simultaneously fed to a valve connected to a mineral oil (blank) channel to produce the compensatory flow. This reproduction strategy allowed to precisely control stimulus onset and to fully equalise mean concentration, though, crucially, preserving variability within groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig S2.11, S2.12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S35"><title>Plume analysis</title><p id="P72">Plumes were recorded using Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design), sampled at 1 kHz. Trial onset was calculated using a TTL pulse passed through an additional channel on the acquisition board (Cambridge Electronic Design). Further analysis was then performed initially in MATLAB and Python 3 using Jupyter Lab. Briefly, traces were segmented using the trial onsets and baseline subtraction performed using the 1 s prior to trial onset. Plume features were defined and calculated as follows: <italic>Correlation</italic> was calculated using the corr function in MATLAB or DataFrame.corr(method=’pearson’) in Python 3 using the pandas package. <italic>Plume arrival time</italic> was calculated as the time of the first point above 3*SD of the baseline (1s interval before trial onset). <italic>Mean odour concentration</italic> was calculated as the average PID signal over a certain time window as specified. <italic>Maximum peak</italic> was calculated as the maximum value of the PID signal over a certain time window as specified. <italic>Number of peaks</italic> was calculated using the find_peaks function (scipy.signal.find_peaks) in Python 3, using the parameters height = 0.05 and prominence = 0.1 for the reproduced plumes, and height = 0.01 and prominence = 0.01 for the recorded plumes. <italic>Maximum prominence</italic> was extracted from the outputs of the find_peaks function above. <italic>Standard deviation, Variance, Kurtosis and Skewness</italic> were calculated using the corresponding functions in the scipy.statslibrary for different time windows as specified. <italic>Reproduced plume integral</italic> and <italic>Odour inhaled</italic> were calculated using the integrate.trapz function in scipy. <italic>Cumulative odour presented</italic> and <italic>Cumulative odour inhaled</italic> were calculated using the cumsum function in numpy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S36"><title>Statistical analysis and data display</title><p id="P73">To test for statistical significance between individual groups where appropriate we used either paired or unpaired student t-tests or, for non-parametric data, the Mann–Whitney U test, or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the equality of probability distributions.

The dODD is formed of 8 odour boxes, 4 at each distance (near or far) from the PID, arranged symmetrically across the midline of the tunnel (Left and Right positions).

A lick response (top) would allow for early termination of the trial if the total time licked (shaded in blue on the lick trace) was &gt;200 ms in a 2 s rolling window. The absence of a lick response (bottom) was defined as total time licked &lt;200 ms in a 2 s rolling window, and the trial would continue until its maximum length was reached at 3s. These two categories of responses to the two types of trials (S+ or S-) produced the outcomes listed on the right-hand column (Hit, Miss, False Alarm, Correct Rejection). <bold>(E)</bold> Histograms of total time licked for an example mouse, as calculated by the AutonoMouse software to decide upon delivering a water reward, using time above threshold (dotted line) in the lick traces as shown in D (S+ in blue, S- in orange). <bold>(F)</bold> Discrimination index defined as the ratio of total time licked (S-/S+) for each mouse below the threshold (t = 200 ms), compared to the mean of shuffled values for that mouse.
