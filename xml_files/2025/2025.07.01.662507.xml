We tested eCF506, a conformationally selective c-Src inhibitor, on morphine antinociception and examined its effect on μ receptor signaling and β-arrestin2 recruitment. Oral eCF506 inhibited morphine tolerance in C57BL/6J mice. Exposure of PathHunter CHO cells to eCF506 did not affect inhibition of cAMP accumulation by the μ agonist, DAMGO, but reduced β-arrestin2 recruitment. This effect, mimicked by targeted degradation of c-Src, occurred through inhibition of c-Src catalytic function as evidenced by its diminution by the catalytically inactive Src250-536(K298M) construct. This mutant also restricted the effect of c-Src inhibitors on β-arrestin2 recruitment. eCF506 additionally increased surface expression of μ receptors and limited their internalization by endomorphin-2 but did not alter DAMGO-evoked GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation. These findings suggest that eCF506 prolongs opioid antinociception by inducing signalling bias, diminishing β-arrestin2-mediated μ receptor regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Analgesia</kwd><kwd>NXP900</kwd><kwd>arrestins</kwd><kwd>tolerance</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Chronic pain, pain persisting for 3 months or more, affects one third of the population and is the leading cause of years lived with disability, highlighting the need for effective analgesic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cohen et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Opioid analgesics activate μ receptors to provide powerful relief from moderate to severe acute pain by signaling through Gα<sub>i/o</sub> proteins to inhibit voltage activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VACCs) and activate G-protein activated inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) channels and suppress neuronal excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Matthes et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Heinke et al., 2011</xref>).

Strategies that diminish the influence of β-arrestin2 and/or c-Src on μ receptors may prolong inhibitory coupling to provide sustained analgesia and improve the long-term use of opioids.

These limitations have the potential to confound interpretations for the role of c-Src in μ receptor signal transduction and diminish enthusiasm for using dasatinib as an adjunct to improve opioid analgesia.

The mean antinociceptive potencies (ED<sub>50</sub>) of morphine in the tail withdrawal assay following administration of vehicle, eCF506 (20 mg/Kg) or eCF506 (80 mg/Kg) were: 1.5 [0.6 – 2.5], 1.5 [0.8 – 2.2] and 1.0 [0.5 – 1.4] mg/Kg, respectively (Supplementary Figure 1B).</p><p id="P10">We continued to assess morphine antinociception for 10 consecutive days following once-daily administration of vehicle or eCF506 (20 or 80 mg/Kg) 30 minutes prior to morphine (10 mg/Kg) to assess the impact of c-Src inhibition by eCF506 on the development of antinociceptive tolerance. Morphine caused the development of antinociceptive tolerance in wild type mice administered with vehicle as revealed by a gradual decline in the maximum possible effect (MPE) from day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), and a reduction in the ED<sub>50</sub> of morphine to 9.7 [7.8 – 11.5] mg/Kg on day 10 (Supplementary Figure 1C). By contrast, the decline in %MPE was delayed until day 9 and morphine’s ED<sub>50</sub> was reduced to 4.2 [1.1 – 7.3] mg/Kg in mice administered with eCF506 (20 mg/Kg). There was no decline in morphine antinociception (% MPE) across the 10 days in mice receiving eCF506 (80 mg/Kg) and the ED<sub>50</sub> on day 10 was 2.6 [1.7 – 3.6] mg/Kg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>; Supplementary Figure 1D-E).</p><p id="P11">The development of antinociceptive tolerance to morphine is accelerated and more profound in μ+/-mice expressing 50% fewer receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sora et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bull et al., 2017</xref>).

The potency of morphine to cause antinociception in μ+/- mice (mean ED<sub>50</sub> 4.4 [3.5 – 5.5] mg/Kg) was reduced when compared to WT mice (Supplementary Figure 8B), consistent with reduced μ receptor expression.

Mean efficacy (E<sub>MAX</sub>) and potency (pEC<sub>50</sub>) values are summarised in Supplementary Table 1. A one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni corrections revealed that all agonists had partial efficacy at recruiting β-arrestin2 to μ receptors when compared to DAMGO (F5,33 = 80.4).

Therefore, we determined the impact of inhibiting c-Src kinase using eCF506 or PP2 on the concentration-response relationships of DAMGO to recruit β-arrestin2 to μ receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) and inhibit the accumulation of cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). PathHunter CHO cells were either exposed to 1 μM eCF506 or PP2, or to PP3, a c-Src inactive analogue to PP2, overnight (16-hours) and concentration-response relationships of DAMGO were compared to that of cells exposed to an equal volume of DMSO.

By contrast, in the cAMP accumulation assay, neither eCF506 nor PP2 affected the E<sub>MAX</sub> (F3,28 = 0.8) or apparent potency (F3,28 = 1.3) of DAMGO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>; Table 1).</p><p id="P18">The presence of spare receptors and amplification of G protein signaling through indirect assessment of cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kelly, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baptista-Hon et al., 2020</xref>) compromises straightforward comparisons of the relative efficacies and potencies of DAMGO, which may conceal an effect of c-Src inhibition. Therefore, we additionally compared the concentration-response relationships of DAMGO to inhibit cAMP accumulation whilst restricting the availability of μ receptors using the irreversible antagonist, β-FNA. PathHunter CHO cells were exposed to β-FNA (100 nM) for 1 hour followed by wash off since our prior studies revealed that this concentration eliminates receptor reserve in the cAMP assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Singleton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Singleton et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P19">The potency of DAMGO to inhibit cAMP accumulation was reduced by prior exposure to β-FNA when compared to cells without prior exposure to β-FNA, consistent with a reduction in available μ receptors (Table 1; Supplementary Figure 3E-H). eCF506 and PP2 similarly had no effect on the E<sub>MAX</sub> of DAMGO despite limited receptor availability (Table 1). Importantly, the concentrations of eCF506, or PP2 used to inhibit c-Src had no impact on the viability of PathHunter CHO cells when assessed using identical exposure paradigms in the MTT assay (Supplementary Figure 3I). As expected, overnight exposure to eCF506 or PP2 reduced the phosphorylation of c-Src at residue Y416 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>; Supplementary Figure 3J).

The latter retains the capacity to scaffold c-Src substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Miller et al., 2000</xref>). Mean efficacy (E<sub>MAX</sub>) and potency (pEC<sub>50</sub>) values of DAMGO to recruit β-arrestin2 are summarised in Table 2.

Importantly, there was no change in viability between cells overexpressing WT Src compared to Src1-249, or between cells overexpressing Src250-536(K298M) compared to Src250-536 (Supplementary Figure 5D-E) demonstrating that the reduction in β-arrestin2 recruitment is not caused by lower cell densities. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the catalytic domain of c-Src participates in the agonist-evoked recruitment of β-arrestin2 to μ receptors.</p><p id="P25">We further tested the hypothesis that c-Src catalytic function participates in β-arrestin2 recruitment by overexpressing a c-Src catalytic mutant rendered constitutively active by phenylalanine substitution of tyrosine at residue 530 (SrcY530F) and assessing the efficacy and potency of DAMGO to recruit β-arrestin2 relative to cells overexpressing WT Src (Supplementary Figure 5F).

Furthermore, constitutive recruitment of β-arrestin2 in the absence of DAMGO was also enhanced by overexpression of SrcY530F to 162 ± 22% of the basal recruitment by WT c-Src (Supplementary Figure 5G), revealing that c-Src catalytic activity may also participate in constitutive, ligand-independent, recruitment of β-arrestin2.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Overexpression of mutant c-Src constructs with no kinase activity abolishes the impact of c-Src inhibitors on β-arrestin2 recruitment to μ receptors</title><p id="P26">Since overexpression of c-Src mutants lacking kinase function diminishes β-arrestin2 recruitment to μ receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-B</xref>), we hypothesised that these mutants would also eliminate the impact of eCF506 and PP2 on DAMGO evoked recruitment of β-arrestin2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Furthermore, in cellular models, eCF506, PP2 and targeted degradation of c-Src diminished the recruitment of β-arrestin2 to agonist-activated μ receptors, whereas PP3, a c-Src inactive analogue of PP2, had no effect. β-arrestin2 recruitment was also reduced in cells overexpressing catalytically inactive c-Src mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Miller et al., 2000</xref>), and neither PP2 nor eCF506 limited the efficacy of DAMGO in cells overexpressing a dominant negative kinase (K298M).

In keeping with this sequence of events, exposure to μ receptor agonists caused phosphorylation of c-Src that correlated with agonist efficacy for recruiting β-arrestin2. These findings are consistent with the idea that arrestins recruit c-Src via its SH3 domain following engagement with the phosphorylated receptor tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Luttrell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Pakharukova et al., 2021</xref>). However, our finding that pharmacological inhibition, targeted c-Src degradation, and overexpression of non-functional mutant constructs of c-Src also limit β-arrestin2 recruitment to μ receptors, suggests additional roles of c-Src in regulating μ receptor signal transduction upstream of β-arrestin2 binding. Indeed, c-Src can directly phosphorylate μ receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) and this occurs in mouse embryonic fibroblasts depleted of arrestins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P37">Early evidence reveals that c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of GRK2 enhances its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sarnago et al., 1999</xref>), whilst interactions between c-Src and arrestins can promote GRK2 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Penela et al., 2001</xref>). It is therefore consistent that c-Src inactivation through pharmacological inhibition by eCF506 resulted in elevated GRK2 expression. However, it is interesting that upregulation of GRK2 by eCF506 had no impact on the phosphorylation barcode evoked by DAMGO at μ receptors; several serine/threonine residues present on its c-terminus are well established to be specific targets of GRK2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Just et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Miess et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Drube et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Underwood et al., 2024</xref>).

However, it is important to note that c-terminal phosphorylation of μ receptors does not always correlate with agonist efficacy. Some high efficacy agonists like SR-17018 cause substantial GRK2/3 mediated phosphorylation but have limited efficacy for β-arrestin2 recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fritzwanker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gillis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Singleton et al., 2024</xref>).

Our finding that c-Src catalytic activity is required for β-arrestin2 recruitment provides mechanistic insights into how eCF506 diminishes morphine analgesic tolerance. Our prior study also reveals that the c-Src/c-Abl kinase inhibitor, dasatinib, and PP2 abolish tolerance to morphine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bull et al., 2017</xref>). These bind c-Src in its active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Tokarski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Muratore et al., 2009</xref>) consistent with a requirement of c-Src catalytic function in the development of tolerance. It is unclear whether these effects are solely mediated through restricted β-arrestin2 recruitment, although several phenotypes in DRG neurones from β-arrestin2-/- mice, including elevated surface expression of μ receptors and their constitutive coupling to VACCs, are mimicked in wild type DRGs treated with c-Src inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Walwyn et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, some behaviours caused by the absence of β-arrestin2, including prolongation of basal tail latencies and enhanced potency of morphine to cause antinociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bohn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lam et al., 2011</xref>) are not observed in wild type mice treated with eCF506. This implies that disruption to c-Src signalling alone is insufficient to recapitulate these phenomena. Interestingly, eCF506 had only transient effects on restoring morphine analgesia in μ+/- mice rendered tolerant by repeated exposure to morphine. This may be explained by a temporary increase to the surface availability of μ receptors revealed in the HiBiT assay. While eCF506 abolishes radiation-induced lung fibrosis, it is ineffective at reversing established lung pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Choi et al, 2025</xref>).

These properties mimic the benefits sought by the development of biased agonists, which tend to be partial agonists, while maintaining full opioid efficacy. Inhibition of c-Src may provide a unifying strategy to limit hypersensitivity and improve the long-term analgesic effects of opioids that can be leveraged to better treat chronic pain.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Animals</title><p id="P41">Male and female wild type (WT) and μ+/- C57BL/6 mice, weighing 24 – 30 g and aged 10 – 14 weeks at the start of each experiment, were bred in house in a temperature (19-24°C) controlled unit on a 12-h light cycle at the University of Dundee.

Cells were exposed to β-FNA (100 nM) for 1 hour at 37°C as our prior studies have consistently revealed that this concentration is sufficient to abolish μ receptor reserve of DAMGO in the cAMP accumulation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Singleton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Singleton et al., 2024</xref>). β-FNA was reconstituted in luciferin and forskolin containing buffer and exposed to cells for the first hour of the 2-hour incubation. Cells were washed to remove unbound β-FNA and replenished with 40 μl of fresh assay buffer before assessing luminescence 1 hour later. Agonist addition and subsequent measurements were performed as described above.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Inhibition of c-Src</title><p id="P53">For experiments involving additional overnight incubation with c-Src inhibitors/degraders or vehicle controls, these were prepared at 2x concentration in Opti-MEM and 50 μl added directly to each well at the end of the day before each assay. β-arrestin2 recruitment and inhibition of cAMP accumulation were assessed the following day using the same approaches described above with the exception that c-Src modulators were additionally included in the agonist (β-arrestin2 assay) or luciferin and forskolin (cAMP assay) incubation steps.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Cell viability</title><p id="P54">Cell viability was measured using an MTT or CellTiter-Glo assay (#G7570; Promega, UK) at the start of each experiment. In both assays, cells were seeded in Opti-MEM and treated as described in the overnight c-Src exposure paradigm then left to settle overnight. The following morning, when measuring MTT absorbance, Opti-MEM was replaced with 100 μl MTT (0.5 mg/ml) reconstituted in dPBS and incubated at 37°C for 3 hours. MTT was then replaced with 100 μl isopropanol containing HCl (4 mM) and 0.1% (v/v) NP40 and incubated in the dark with agitation for 15 minutes. Absorbance was measured at 590 nm using a FlexStation-III multimodal plate reader (Molecular Devices, USA). In the CellTiter-Glo assay, a ladder of known cell densities (625-20000 per well) without exposure to treatment was also included on each 96-well half area white plate to extrapolate cell plating efficiency. The following morning, Opti-MEM was replaced with 50 μl of fresh Opti-MEM followed by 50 μl of proprietary CellTiter-Glo substrate reconstituted as recommended.

These data were plotted and fitted to a three-parameter logistic function (Response = minimum + ((maximum-minimum)/1+10<sup>(log(potency)-[agonist])</sup>)) yielding maximum and minimum responses used to derive estimates of agonist efficacies (E<sub>MAX</sub>) and potencies (EC<sub>50</sub> or IC<sub>50</sub>). The latter converted to positive logarithmic molar values (pEC<sub>50</sub> or pIC<sub>50</sub>, M) to generate a Gaussian-distributed data set amenable to parametric analysis.

Reported ‘n’ values in the figure legends represent the number of individual 96-well plates. Significance indicated in the summary tables and graphs represent p &lt; 0.05 and post-hoc pairwise comparisons with a Bonferroni or Dunnet correction applied were only performed if F achieved p &lt; 0.05.
