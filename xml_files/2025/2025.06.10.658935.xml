Both the microbiota and the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium have a role in pharmacokinetic variability of medical drugs. In this study, we developed a high-throughput workflow to assess the absorption of bacterially produced (drug) metabolites by intestinal epithelial cells through the combination of anaerobic bacterial cultures and human-intestine derived Caco2 cell cultures in a transwell system. To functionally monitor the barrier integrity during the experiments, we introduced a panel of marker compounds, whose concentration kinetics on either side of the epithelial monolayer indicates barrier integrity and transport. We employed this workflow to systematically probe the effect of different gut bacterial species on the epithelial absorption of 482 drugs and their 172 bacterially produced metabolites. While we could recapitulate known bacterial drug biotransformation reactions and expected drug metabolite absorption profiles, we also identified 33 new bacteria-drug pairs for which bacterial biotransformation alters epithelial permeability. Further, we combined the developed experimental workflow with untargeted metabolomics analysis to systematically study epithelial permeability of metabolites naturally produced by gut bacteria. Tracking the absorption kinetics of 397 bacterially produced metabolites revealed that the majority (&gt;79%) of these metabolites do not pass the Caco2 monolayer, illustrating its role as a physical and metabolic barrier. In summary, we present a highly adaptable high-throughput workflow to quantitatively study the metabolic interactions at the intestinal microbiota-host interface which can impact pharmacokinetics, toxicokinetics, and human physiology.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The intestine is the second largest extended surface between the environment and the human body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Gallo, 2017</xref>). The complex structure of the intestinal barrier regulates which compounds from the luminal contents enter systemic circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Haroun et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, the intestinal barrier is involved in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, which is influenced by the composition and activity of the gut microbiota, the immune system, hormonal state, and activity of intercellular connections of the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Di Vincenzo et al., 2024</xref>). The epithelial layer of the intestinal barrier controls the absorption of water and hydrophilic substances through tight junction proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chelakkot et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, small hydrophobic compounds can be absorbed by the transcellular route, which involves passive diffusion through the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Schoultz &amp; Keita, 2020</xref>). Many orally administered drugs are absorbed through this latter route, which has also been described by the empirical Lipinski rule of 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Lipinski, 2000</xref>). Certain compounds are transported actively by the intestinal epithelial cells, for example, water-soluble vitamins, ions, amino acids, and short chain fatty acids. This active transport is mediated by carrier and transport proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Schwenk, 1987</xref>). For orally administered drugs to be systemically active, the compound or its metabolites have to pass through the intestinal barrier.</p><p id="P3">The large number of different microorganisms colonizing the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT), also called the gut microbiota, play a significant role in the determination of host physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Fan &amp; Pedersen, 2021</xref>). Moreover, the gut microbiota can directly metabolise drugs affecting their pharmacokinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Verdegaal &amp; Goodman, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Weersma et al., 2020</xref>). Through interactions of bacteria with drug molecules in the intestine, the compounds can be biotransformed into different drug metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zimmermann et al., 2019a</xref>), which may have a similar or altered activity compared to the parent drug. For example, the prodrug sulfasalazine is activated by azoreductases, whereas brivudine can be biotransformed into the liver toxic compound bromovinyl uracil, which are both reactions that can be performed by both gut bacteria and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Peppercorn &amp; Goldman, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Zimmermann et al., 2019b</xref>). The interpersonal differences in the gut microbiota composition and metabolic activity have therefore been suggested to potentially affect drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Javdan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zimmermann et al., 2019a</xref>). Several anecdotal cases of gut microbial drug biotransformation that impact drug disposition have been described. For example, for chloramphenicol, levodopa, and methylprednisolone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arassi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Glazko et al., 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Isildar et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Maini Rekdal et al., 2019</xref>). However, to systematically assess the effects of the gut microbiota on systemic drug and metabolite exposure, we currently lack high-throughput approaches to quantify gut microbial contributions to specific processes related to drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET).</p><p id="P4">To quantify the apparent permeability of bacterial metabolites, drugs, and bacterially produced drug metabolites across the colonic epithelial barrier as a factor of oral bioavailabililty, we combined bacterial cultivation with a Caco2 cell monolayer cultures in a transwell system and with high-throughput liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. We measured the transfer across the colonic barrier of 482 drugs, 172 gut bacteria-produced drug metabolites, and identified 33 bacterial drug metabolites with altered absorption properties compared to their respective parent drugs. Beyond the scope of medical drugs, we furthermore, employed an untargeted metabolomics approach to monitor the kinetics of 7240 bacterial metabolites, and demonstrate the generalizability of the developed protocol to quantify metabolic microbiota-host interaction. Altogether, we established a high-throughput workflow to mechanistically investigate gut microbial impact on intestinal metabolite absorption that can lead to altered metabolic microbiota-host interactions and interpersonal variability in drug pharmacokinetics.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Establishment of a colonic transwell system that includes bacterial metabolites</title><p id="P5">To quantify the permeability of gut bacteria-produced metabolites, we combined anaerobic cultivation of human gut bacteria with a cell culture-based transwell assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We used Caco2 cells, which are a heterogenous population of human intestinal epithelial cells that form a closed cell layer barrier upon cultivation on a transwell membrane. The use of these cells has been well-established for permeability assays of drugs and other compounds. They have become a standard in preclinical drug discovery and development, as evidenced by more than 4400 permeability assays using Caco2 cells currently reported in the ChEMBL data repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lennernäs et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">van Breemen &amp; Li, 2005</xref>). To test the effect of gut bacteria on intestinal permeability, we anaerobically cultivated ten different gut bacterial species covering three major phyla (Actinomycetota, Bacteroidota, Bacillota) of the human gastrointestinal microbiome. Importantly, the selected bacterial species have previously been shown to biotransform a broad range of chemicals, such as drugs and carcinogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">B. Zhang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zimmermann et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To test whether these bacteria affect Caco2 viability and barrier integrity, we cultivated the bacteria under anaerobic conditions in gut microbiota medium (GMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Goodman et al., 2011</xref>) for 16 and 24 hours. We then filter-sterilised (0.22 μm) the bacterial culture supernatants and added these supernatants containing bacterial metabolites to the upper compartment of a transwell insert covered with a Caco2 cell monolayer. In this experimental setup, the upper compartment of the transwell is seen as the apical side of the intestinal barrier, which faces the intestinal lumen and is hence directly exposed to gut bacterial metabolites. Correspondingly, the lower compartment of the transwell setup represents the basolateral side of the intestinal barrier, facing the intestinal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Caco2 cells were exposed to sterile-filtered bacterial culture supernatant (CFS) for four hours and we assessed Caco2 viability by resazurin reduction (indicating metabolic activity by the cells) and barrier integrity by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements. Caco2 cell viability was indifferent following exposure to most bacterial culture supernatants cultivated for 16 hours compared to the media control. However, CFS of some species grown longer (24 hours) did impact cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). TEER is a standard measurement of barrier establishment, in which higher values indicate a tighter epithelial barrier. However, its usefulness to assess the monolayer integrity has been debated in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mukherjee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Narai et al., 1997</xref>). We found that exposure to specific bacterial culture supernatants (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., <italic>Alloscardovia omnicolens, Clostridium ramosum</italic>, and <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>) decreased the TEER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results made us wonder how bacterial metabolites affect the permeability of the barrier for small molecules.</p><p id="P7">To directly assess permeability through the intestinal cell layer, we assembled a mixture of seven marker compounds that we added to the apical side of the Caco2 monolayer following their pre-conditioning with CFS of each of the 10 bacterial species. We selected four marker compounds that readily pass through the intestinal barrier by passive diffusion (antipyrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lennernäs et al., 1996</xref>), haloperidol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Niemegeers &amp; Laduron, 1976</xref>), propranolol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), and warfarin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">O’Reilly et al., 1963</xref>)), and three compounds that poorly pass through an intact epithelial barrier to the basolateral compartment of the transwell system (etoposide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Leu &amp; Huang, 1995</xref>), nadolol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sasaki et al., 2022</xref>), and terbutaline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lennernäs et al., 1996</xref>)). We then measured the levels of the marker compounds on either side of the monolayer every 30 minutes for four hours using LC-MS. The resulting marker compound kinetics in the sterile media controls demonstrate the distinct absorption properties of the selected marker compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Importantly, low or absent signal for non-permeable compounds on the basolateral side demonstrated that the function of the barrier remained intact after exposure to supernatants of nine and seven species at 16 hours and 24 hours of bacterial growth, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). Moreover, using these marker compounds, we found that barrier function does not necessarily correlate with altered TEER values (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., for <italic>Gemella haemolysans</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-E</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Of note, the difference in TEER values, cell viability, and compound absorption between the 16- and 24-hour bacterial cultures was striking for some of the bacterial species tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-C</xref>). We found that the culture supernatants of the 24-hour cultures of <italic>A. omnicolens, C. ramosum</italic>, and <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, exerted the strongest impact on Caco2 barrier integrity. The low pH values of these supernatants (pH 5.0) compared to pH 6.9 of the other culture supernatants and the media control suggested a potential pH effect on the epithelial barrier. Indeed, re-adjusting the pH of the supernatants of <italic>A. omnicolens, C. ramosum</italic>, and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> cultures from 5.0 to 7.0 negated their negative effect on Caco2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). These results demonstrate that a lower pH, as a result of gut bacterial fermentation, can have an effect on Caco2 viability and barrier integrity of the monolayer. As a consequence, we employed bacterial cultures grown for less than 16 hours and monitored the pH of bacterial culture supernatants for all subsequent assays.</p><p id="P9">Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that the established experimental setup allows the exposure of Caco2 monolayers to bacterial metabolites and the monitoring of the barrier function. Further, we identified two cases, for which the TEER was minimally impacted while the marker compounds revealed an impaired barrier function (<italic>G. haemolysans</italic> and <italic>C. scindens</italic>). Thus, the employed set of the marker compounds provides a direct and sensitive functional readout of the intestinal barrier function, that is more specific and relevant than TEER measurements.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Bacterial biotransformation assay compatible with human cell cultures</title><p id="P10">To study the epithelial permeability of gut bacterial drug metabolites, we sought to establish a high-throughput gut bacterial drug biotransformation assay that is compatible with human cell culture. To this aim, we selected 482 chemically diverse compounds with a broad range of predicted compound hydrophobicity (aLogP) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A-B, Table S1</xref>). To quantify the permeability of these 482 drugs, we incubated Caco2 monolayers in the transwell setup with the drugs in a combinatorial pooling scheme in quadruplicate for four hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zimmermann et al., 2019a</xref>). Measurements of the kinetics of the seven marker compounds for each transwell and resazurin reduction following drug incubation demonstrated that none of the compounds damaged the epithelial barrier or affected Caco2 viability at the applied concentration of 5 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>). Quantification of the drug kinetics on both apical and the basolateral side of the epithelial layer revealed that 373 of the 482 tested compounds passed the epithelial layer to the basolateral side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This is in line with the expected behaviour of the selected drugs, most of which are approved for oral administration.</p><p id="P11">Next, we incubated these drugs with the ten different gut bacterial cultures described above (and no-bacteria controls) in quadruplicate using the combinatorial pooling protocol previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">B. Zhang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zimmermann et al., 2019a</xref>). In a total of 1056 samples, we assessed 4820 bacteria-drug interactions by measuring the compound levels at 0, 2, and 8 hours of incubation using LC-MS. We considered compounds being biotransformed when their levels were significantly decreased over time (&gt;10% reduction, FDR-corrected p-value &lt; 0.05) compared to time zero of the incubation and the no-bacteria control. We found 172 (35.6%) of the 482 tested compounds to be metabolised by at least one of the tested bacterial species. As previously reported, we observed large differences between the tested bacterial species and the drugs they biotransformed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arassi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zimmermann et al., 2019a</xref>). Of the 44 drugs included in this study that overlap with a previous report, we found similar biotransformation results for 61.3% of the drugs. The reason that 16 of the 44 drugs that were biotransformed in a previous report but not in the current screen is likely due to the difference in number of gut bacterial species and strains assayed (10 versus 76) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zimmermann et al., 2019a</xref>). This overlap of drugs to be metabolized by gut bacteria validates the altered biotransformation protocol that we used to increase compatibility with cell cultures. To identify bacterial biotransformation products of the 172 metabolized drugs, we employed untargeted metabolomics analysis of the respective samples. To this aim, we first identified putative metabolites that were increased in the presence of a specific drug compared to control samples (log2(fold change) &gt;2 and FDR-corrected p-value &lt;0.01). We then filtered these putative metabolites based on chromatographic retention, mass defects, and ion fragmentation as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zimmermann et al., 2019a</xref>). We further filtered for metabolites that increased in abundance over the incubation time, while the levels of the respective parent drugs significantly decreased in matching cultures. This analysis yielded a total of 259 putative drug metabolites for further testing of their epithelial permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, distinct mass differences between these putative biotransformation products and their respective parent compounds suggested reduction and hydrolysis reactions to occur most frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zimmermann et al., 2019a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). Moreover, our biotransformation screen could recapitulate known biotransformation reactions, for example the deacetylation of roxatidine acetate by <italic>B. uniformis</italic> and of bisacodyl by several bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Javdan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zimmermann et al., 2019a</xref>). We also identified new reactions, such as the N-acylation of azilsartan, an antihypertensive, and the hydrolysis of carfilzomib, an anti-cancer drug that acts as a selective proteasome inhibitor. The latter reaction leads to a drug metabolite that was only described in patient samples previously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A-B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). In summary, employing a high-throughput gut bacterial biotransformation assay with 482 compounds and 10 gut bacterial species allowed us to pinpoint 172 compounds that are biotransformed by at least one of the ten gut bacterial species. Additionally, we identified 259 putative drug biotransformation products for further testing of their permeability through the intestinal epithelial barrier.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Epithelial permeability of drugs and gut bacterial drug metabolites</title><p id="P12">Having established the compatibility of the CFS with Caco2 cells and the establishment of the bacterial drug biotransformation assays, we next set out to assess the effect of bacterial (drug) metabolism on trans-epithelial transport. To this aim, we used CFS from the bacterial biotransformation assays at zero and eight hours of drug exposure. The CFS of each drug pool was added to the apical side of a transwell and we collected samples every 30 minutes for four hours from either side of the transwells. In this screen, we analysed 12,672 samples by LC-MS to assess a total of 4,338 drug-bacteria-transport interactions in quadruplicate. We determined the concentration kinetics of each drug and their (putative) bacterial metabolites on either side of the transwell barrier. We then investigated whether any drug metabolite displays different epithelial permeability compared to their parent drug, due to altered physicochemical properties upon gut bacterial biotransformation. We detected 170 of the 259 putative drug metabolites identified in bacterial cultures also in this transwell assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). To assess the permeability of these compounds across the Caco2 monolayer, we compared the slope of the concentration kinetics on either side of the transwell system for each putative biotransformation product and its originating parent drug. To compare the kinetic profiles, we fit a linear regression model for the apical and basolateral sides for both the parent compound and its putative biotransformation products. We identified 33 (19.4%) pairs of drug and bacterial drug metabolite, for which the permeability kinetics (concentration slopes) were significantly different (FDR-adj. p-val &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Among these 33 cases, we identified eight cases for which the bacterial metabolite passes the intestinal barrier whereas the parent compound does not and two cases with opposite behaviour. For example, carfilzomib, used in treatment of multiple myeloma, poorly passes the epithelial barrier, while its bacterial metabolite readily passes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Intriguingly, a previous study reported this metabolite in plasma and urine of patients with solid tumors and multiple myeloma without indicating its potential gut microbial origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Further, carfilzomib has a high patient-to-patient variability in its pharmacokinetics, which could hence be (partially) explained by the biotransformation of the drug by the gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Quach et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, we identified nine species-drug-metabolite interactions for which both the bacteria and the Caco2 cells produce the same metabolite. In our screen, one of the drugs that is known to be metabolized by the gut microbiota, bisacodyl, a stimulant laxative, was included. Bisacodyl has to be converted into its active metabolite bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-pyridyl-2-methane (BHPM) in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Corsetti et al., 2021</xref>) to be active. We found that most bacteria, as well as the Caco2 cells, can convert bisacodyl to BHPM, which readily passes to the basolateral compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Another example for which both bacteria and Caco2 cells biotransform the same drug is nicergoline, which is deacetylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C</xref>). Caco2 cells are active in metabolism and express certain drug-metabolising enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Vaessen et al., 2017</xref>), which likely explains the observed biotransformation of some (pro)drugs in the absence of bacterial incubation. In summary, our screen showed that most bacterial drug metabolites have similar epithelial permeability compared to their parent drugs. One of the examples of a drug and metabolite with unchanged absorption properties is the drug azilsartan, a reaction by the bacterial species described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, we found several bacterial biotransformation products that display altered permeability compared to their parent drugs, which indicates that our workflow can be used to assess the effect of bacterial drug metabolism on altered intestinal permeability of pharmaceuticals. Some of the examples of differential epithelial permeability between bacterial drug metabolites and drugs may contribute to pharmacokinetic variability between patients.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Quantification of intestinal absorption of bacterial metabolites</title><p id="P13">Next, we sought to employ our established workflow to assess intestinal absorption of endogenous gut bacterial metabolites. To this aim, we employed an untargeted metabolomics approach to identify bacterially produced metabolites and to trace them in the transwell system to assess permeability through the epithelial monolayer. We used the no-drug control data of the screen described above, in which we exposed the Caco2 cells to the supernatant of each gut bacterial species. We annotated (level 3) a total of 7240 out of 13,874 detected metabolic features using the MiMeDB database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Wishart et al., 2023</xref>). From these metabolites, we focused on the 10% most abundant metabolites per species that were not detected in the growth media controls, resulting in a total of 1425 metabolites. After fitting these metabolites in the kinetics data from the apical and the basolateral side of the transwell assay, we performed additional filtering steps based on the number of replicates and time points each metabolite was detected in (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">materials and methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). This resulted in a total of 397 bacterially produced metabolites that we detected on the apical side. For 232 of these metabolites we detected no change in their abundance during the four hours of Caco2 cell exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). For 104 metabolites, we detected a decrease over time on the apical side (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., a negative fold change between time points 0 and 240 minutes). For example, cyclo-(D-arginine-L-proline) produced by <italic>A. omnicolens, E. faecalis</italic> and <italic>G. haemolysans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Such cyclic dipeptides are commonly secreted by members of the gut microbiota as signalling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Nishanth Kumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Ogilvie &amp; Czekster, 2023</xref>). Of the metabolites that were decreasing on the apical side, we however only detected 19 on the basolateral side with increasing concentrations, suggesting that the metabolite passed unchanged through the Caco2 monolayer. An example is deoxyadenosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>), an adenosine derivative that can be produced by both the host and the microbiota, and that can disrupt the function of immune cells when present at high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boussamet et al., 2024</xref>). It has recently been identified as an oral microbial biomarker in a study comparing multiple sclerosis patients and healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Wishart et al., 2023</xref>). In conclusion, our developed workflow can be used to study the (selective) transfer of conserved and unique microbial metabolites across the intestinal barrier in high-throughput. We found many bacterial metabolites that are further metabolized by the Caco2 cells, which show some of the dynamic interactions between the gut microbiota and the intestinal barrier. Together, these findings indicate that only a small number of bacterial metabolites pass unchanged through the intestinal barrier, supporting the notion that the epithelial layer functions selective metabolic barrier and that there is a dynamic metabolic interaction between the gut epithelium and the bacterial metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Di Vincenzo et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ghosh et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P14">We developed a workflow to study the permeability of microbial (drug) metabolites across the gut epithelial barrier, represented by a Caco2 monolayer on transwell inserts. The established workflow offers a robust, sensitive and high-throughput method to explore how and which bacterial metabolites (selectively) pass the epithelial barrier and how biotransformation may impact pharmacokinetics, and to identify both expected and new drug-microbiota-absorption interactions.</p><p id="P15">We observed that bacterial metabolites affect TEER values, without impacting Caco2 viability. This indicates that gut barrier integrity is not only a direct function of cell fitness. To monitor subtle changes in barrier integrity, we introduced a panel of marker compounds of epithelial permeability. Applying these marker compounds, we identified cases for which TEER measurements were unchanged, while the barrier function was impaired. It has been previously reported that bacterial metabolites have an effect on the function of tight junction proteins and expression in the epithelial cells through Toll-like receptor signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Ey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ghosh et al., 2021</xref>). The differential effects of the supernatants of distinct bacterial species showed the potential role of species-specific metabolites in shaping intestinal barrier function. This could be further explored in the future to gain insights into the molecular effects that the complex bacterial communities of the human gut have on the intestinal barrier functions.</p><p id="P16">Our high-throughput screen assessing how microbial activity may alter drug absorption revealed several new cases of differential epithelial permeability between drugs and their bacteria-produced metabolites. The identification of bacterial drug metabolites with different absorption properties compared to their respective parent drug suggests a mechanism of how the microbiota can potentially affect pharmacokintetics. However, in our panel, most of the drug-metabolite pairs have comparable absorption properties, while their activity can be different. For example, in the case of the deacetylation of roxatidine acetate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>), which forms the active metabolite of the prodrug, both roxatidine acetate and its deacylated form have comparable absorption properties, but the deacetylated metabolite has been described as the active drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kang et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, the cases for which the microbiota and the Caco2 cells produced the same metabolite reflects the broader interplay between host and microbiota metabolic pathways and raises the question of potential synergies or multi-step metabolism in drug biotransformation between the host and its microbiota.</p><p id="P17">The untargeted analysis of Caco2 exposure to endogenous bacterial metabolites highlights the selective nature of the intestinal epithelial barrier to transfer of metabolites, reinforcing its role as metabolic gatekeeper. The untargeted metabolomics approach identified 7240 metabolites, of which 397 were high-abundance, bacteria-derived metabolites. However, only 4.8% (19) of these metabolites could be detected at both the apical and basolateral side, suggesting that most bacterial metabolites do not cross the intestinal barrier unchanged. The decreasing levels of many metabolites on the apical side over time without corresponding detection on the basolateral side suggests their metabolism by Caco2 cells. This is corroborated by our analysis that identified 73 highly abundant basolateral metabolites which were only measured at the basolateral side and that increased over time. This workflow could be used in the future to further investigate the effects of bacterial metabolites on gut barrier function in a high-throughput setup. To mimic the intestinal epithelium better in this system, Caco2 cells could be cultured with air-liquid interface and the addition of vasointestinal peptide (VIP) to enhance apical mucus production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Floor et al., 2025</xref>). Moreover, cultures of patient material, intestinal cells from animal disease models, or co-cultures of cells that form a monolayer together, could be used in this experimental system to selectively study the metabolic gut microbiota - gut epithelium interaction. In addition, different cell types could be added to the basolateral compartment of the transwell setup to study the interactions of the gut to other organs, as has been shown before with NCI-H716 enteroendocrine and liver cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chaudhari et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P18">In summary, this study highlights the significant role the gut microbiota plays in modulating drug absorption and metabolism, with implications for understanding pharmacokinetic variability among individuals. The developed workflow could be a useful tool in drug discovery and development, as the permeability of drugs across a Caco2 monolayer already is accepted by the FDA as a surrogate for human intestinal permeability measurements. The combination of the permeability studies with the possible interaction of a drug with the gut microbiota, and the effect of absorption of the drug (and drug metabolite) mimics the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation better and can therefore improve drug discovery, development, and regulatory approval processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Larregieu &amp; Benet, 2013</xref>). Therefore, the developed workflow offers a scalable and reproducible method for assessing these interactions, enabling more in-depth studies on the interplay between host cells and microbial metabolites.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P19">This work describes the establishment of a high-throughput workflow to assess absorption properties of microbial (drug) metabolites. In the current setup, some limitations exist. For example, all data in this work has been acquired with a single LC-MS method. Therefore, we likely missed certain (drug) metabolites, since these might not be retained on the selected chromatographic column (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., C18). Further, we used Caco2 cells, which are well-established for permeability assays and can mimic the intestinal barrier of the small intestine to some extent, but they are not fully representative of the gut epithelium. The gut epithelium consists of several cell types, which communicate with each other, which has not been included in our experimental setup. Additionally, we used CFS from single species, whereas the gut microbiome consists of a community of different bacterial species. We therefore likely missed metabolic interactions that would happen in the gut. Moreover, the mechanism by which metabolites may change the barrier function of the Caco2 monolayer has not been elucidated in this work. For the bacterial cultures with near physiological pH that nonetheless impaired Caco2 barrier function, it remains unclear how the barrier function exactly is changed.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="P20">All chemicals were purchased from SelleckChem.

Cells used in this study were not passaged more than 20 times. Transwell inserts were obtained from Millicell, and were used in combination with 24-well plates (Thermo Fisher). The Caco-2 cells were grown in T75 flasks at 37°C in an incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cells were grown using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco, 41965-039) with 4.5 g/liter D-glucose, 584 mg/liter L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% Amphociterin B, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium in the flasks was changed every 3 days. At 90% confluence, the cells were passaged using incubation with 0.5% trypsin for 5 minutes at 37°C after washing the cells with PBS. Cells were then seeded into the transwell inserts (pore size 0.4 μm) at 10,000 cells/well for the 96-well plates and at 1e5 cells/well for the 24-well plate inserts (Millicell, PSHT004R1 and PIHP01250). The transwells with the Caco-2 cells were used only after &gt;21 days post-seeding, to allow for the establishment of a stable monolayer.

Small volumes of both the apical and basolateral side (5 uL) were taken every 30 minutes and immediately stored at -80°C until metabolite extraction. Time points were taken for 4 hours, whereafter the cells were washed three times with HBSS and media was added to the cells, on the apical side containing a viability dye (Promega, G8080). After an overnight incubation, the apical media was transferred to a separate 96-well plate (Thermofisher) and fluorescent signal was measured.

As a result of this data filtering, we integrated 259 putative drug metabolites in the transwell data; filtering for barrier intactness, filtering for at least three technical replicates at at least three different time points, we comprised a dataset containing the absorption profiles of 170 drug-species-metabolite pairs. We then compared the slopes of each parent drug measured from the 0-hour bacterial incubation in the transwell assay and the slope of the drug metabolite measured of the 8-hour bacterial incubation.

The behaviour was determined based on the data at the apical side, for which for each metabolite the log2 fold change of peak area was determined between 0 minutes of exposure and 240 minutes of exposure. A decrease in peak area abundance was defined as a log2fold change value &gt; -0.5, and an increase as a value &gt; 0.5. No change in peak abundance was defined as a log2 fold change value between -0.5 and 0.5 (n=4 per metabolite-species pair). C.
