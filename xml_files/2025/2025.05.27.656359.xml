It is unclear how hallucinatory proneness changes across the lifespan, with prior questionnaire-based studies showing mixed results. As factors such as multi-sensory acuity loss and relatively increased reliance on prior knowledge may increase as we age, and these are considered risk factors for hallucination proneness, we hypothesised that reported decreases in hallucinations might reflect stigma-related underreporting. We therefore sought to measure hallucination proneness in 44 healthy adults spanning the adult lifespan (younger age group; n=22; age 19-39 years, mean 27.2 ± 5.5; older age group n=22; age 59-79 years, mean 68.0 ± 5.8), quantifying the tendency to experience complex and simple hallucinations in an experimental environment designed to elicit hallucinations. We find that reports of complex hallucinations (those representing objects, scenes, etc) are lower in older adults than in younger adults, both in real time and retrospectively. None of our measured cognitive or sensory measures (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, perceptual reorganisation, imagery vividness, memory inhibition, and suggestibility) mediate this relationship. We conclude that reduced complex hallucination proneness appears normative in ageing, and that experiencing hallucinations in older individuals may signal underlying pathology.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Visual hallucinations - percepts without corresponding external stimuli - are associated with various clinical conditions including schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Silverstein &amp; Lai, 2021</xref>), Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Barnes &amp; David, 2001</xref>), dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zarkali, Adams, et al., 2019</xref>), epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Kasper et al., 2010</xref>) and vision impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Jan &amp; del Castillo, 2012</xref>). Many of these conditions are particularly prevalent in older adults. Though hallucinations are commonly experienced in these pathological states, they can also be experienced within the general population - both spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Johns et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">McGrath et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Tien, 1991</xref>) and induced through experimental methods, for example using alterations in light and sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Allefeld et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Reeder, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Wackermann et al., 2002</xref>). Across all of these states, the hallucinations that are experienced can range from simple (i.e. abstract, geometric forms) to more complex, (i.e. objects, human figures, or scenes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Barnes &amp; David, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Jan &amp; del Castillo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Kasper et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Shenyan et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Silverstein &amp; Lai, 2021</xref>). However, it is unclear how susceptibility to phenomenologically distinct types of hallucinations changes across the lifespan in healthy adults.</p><p id="P3">Among the few studies that explore hallucination frequency in typical ageing, findings are inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Badcock et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Larøi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Shenyan et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Soulas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Thompson et al., 2021</xref>). Though some studies report an increase in hallucinatory prevalence with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Shenyan et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Tien, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Turvey et al., 2001</xref>), many report a decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Larøi et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Maijer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Thompson et al., 2021</xref>). These studies often rely on self-report questionnaires, which may be prone to various biases: for example, older individuals may retrospectively under-report hallucinations due to stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Badcock et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">2020a</xref>). We sought to resolve this discrepancy by measuring changes in hallucinatory proneness in a healthy ageing population using more objective, experimental measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Shenyan et al., 2024</xref>). If hallucinations are rare in older people, their presence could provide a strong indicator of underlying pathological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Compton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Pagonabarraga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zarkali, Adams, et al., 2019</xref>). Alternatively, an increase in hallucinations may simply be a normal aspect of ageing, and thus, we would observe a corresponding increase in a healthy, ageing population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Baumeister et al., 2017</xref>).</p><sec id="S2"><label>1.1</label><title>Age-related mechanisms of hallucinatory proneness</title><p id="P4">Ageing also offers a unique opportunity to test existing hypotheses about the multiple interrelated factors which have been shown to promote hallucinatory experiences. One key factor is an overreliance on prior expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Teufel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zarkali, Adams, et al., 2019</xref>), which may act to increase the tendency to experience hallucinations when paired with an independent, pathological mechanism, for instance, in Lewy body disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zarkali, Adams, et al., 2019</xref>) or psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Teufel et al., 2015</xref>). Alternatively, prior expectations may become overweighted to compensate for age-related declines in visual function, which reduce the reliability of sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Collerton et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Occelli et al., 2017</xref>). Given that visual function diminishes with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Pitts, 1982</xref>), increased hallucinatory proneness in older adults may stem from the interaction between sensory deficits and stronger reliance on prior knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Chan et al., 2021</xref>). We therefore predicted that both visual impairments and the weighting of prior expectations would increase with age, and that these factors would be associated with a heightened tendency to experience complex hallucinatory imagery in later life. Similarly, the strength and vividness of mental imagery - a predominantly top-down process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Dijkstra et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">2022</xref>), may also influence hallucinatory proneness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Königsmark et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Reeder, 2022</xref>). However, as mental imagery vividness tends to decline across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Gulyás et al., 2022</xref>), this could alternatively predict a reduction in hallucinatory experiences in older age.</p><p id="P5">Another contributing factor to hallucinatory proneness is a reduced ability to suppress irrelevant signals—a cognitive process related to inhibitory control—which has been associated with increased auditory hallucinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alderson-Day et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Badcock &amp; Hugdahl, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Swyer &amp; Powers, 2020</xref>). This tendency can be measured through intentional memory inhibition tasks, which require participants to suppress responses to irrelevant memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alderson-Day et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Paulik et al., 2007</xref>). Performance on tasks measuring inhibitory control and memory suppression correlate with the severity of hallucinations both in individuals with psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Badcock et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Waters et al., 2003</xref>) and in healthy controls, as measured via self-reported questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alderson-Day et al., 2019</xref>). While most research on intentional memory inhibition and hallucinations has predominantly focused on the auditory domain, here we test the relationship between inhibition and visual hallucinations. Prior research suggests that the ability to intentionally suppress unwanted memories diminishes with age, with older adults' performing poorer than younger adults in similar tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Collette et al., 2009</xref>). This led us to hypothesise that age-related declines in intentional memory inhibition could also increase the tendency to experience hallucinatory experiences in older age.</p><p id="P6">Finally, individual differences in suggestibility may also play a role in hallucinatory proneness. For instance, hallucinatory-prone participants have been found to report voices in white noise more frequently when they are specifically instructed to expect the voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Alganami et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, various measures of trait suggestibility have been found to correlate with self-reported hallucinatory experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Alganami et al., 2017</xref>). This may be related to phenomenological control – the tendency for individuals to shape their perceptual experiences in response to suggestions or task demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Dienes &amp; Lush, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lush et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">2021</xref>). Notably, suggestibility has also been observed to increase with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Biondi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Mitchell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Page &amp; Green, 2007</xref>), leading us to hypothesise that increases in this trait with age could contribute to increased hallucinatory experiences in older adults.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><label>1.2</label><title>Current study</title><p id="P7">Two common ways of inducing visual hallucinatory imagery via experimental manipulations are through perceptual deprivation, i.e., presenting homogeneous visual and auditory inputs (Ganzfeld; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Schmidt et al., 2020</xref>), and visual stimulation via a high frequency, salient flicker (Ganzflicker; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Königsmark et al., 2021</xref>). Using these methods, we previously outlined a novel approach to measuring hallucinatory proneness, quantifying experiences in real-time using button presses and verbal descriptions, and retrospectively via drawings and questionnaires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Shenyan et al., 2024</xref>). These methodologies can consistently induce both ‘simple’ and ‘complex’ hallucinations, where simple hallucinations are abstract alterations in colour, shapes and patterns likely to be driven by bottom-up activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Bressloff et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ermentrout &amp; Cowan, 1979</xref>), and complex hallucinations are figurative percepts with relatively greater semantic associations, such as objects, faces and scenes, likely derived from a comparatively more top-down driven mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Allefeld et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Reeder, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Shenyan et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We reasoned that by putting participants in an abstract, experimental situation where they might even be expected to hallucinate, we would mitigate stigma and anxieties around the associated implications of hallucinating which might occur during self-report of hallucinations in day-to-day contexts. Our hypotheses and predictions are primarily tailored towards the tendency to experience complex imagery, as complex hallucinations are less affected by strictly bottom-up processes (i.e. the intensity of visual drive), and therefore are more likely to be affected by risk factors related to higher-order cognitive processes, such as inhibition and an overreliance on prior expectations. Furthermore, complex hallucinations are likely more similar to the pathological hallucinations experienced in conditions like Parkinson’s Disease and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Barnes &amp; David, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Silverstein &amp; Lai, 2021</xref>), and their prevalence in a healthy population may therefore have more relevance to clinical decision making.</p><p id="P9">We therefore conducted a comprehensive investigation into the tendency to experience experimentally-induced hallucinations in older adults, with a particular focus on whether the frequency and intensity of complex hallucinatory imagery varies with age. Building on findings from our previous study in a younger adult sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Shenyan et al., 2024</xref>), and considering that numerous risk factors for hallucination proneness increase with age (as detailed above), we investigated how specific cognitive and perceptual factors hypothesised to influence hallucinatory experiences change from early to late adulthood. We further explored how these age-related changes might modulate the propensity to experience hallucinations. The factors of interest included reduced quality of sensory input, increased contribution of knowledge in perception, vividness of mental imagery, inhibitory control and suggestibility. We experimentally tested their relationship with the tendency to experience complex hallucinations during both a Ganzfeld and a Ganzflicker, as well as their association with age.</p><p id="P10">Our primary hypothesis was that both the number and intensity of complex hallucinations (those related to objects, faces, scenes, etc) would increase with age, related to age-related declines in visual function, increases in weighting of prior expectations, reduced inhibitory control, and increased suggestibility. Alternatively, it is also plausible that the frequency and intensity of complex hallucinations decreases with age, given evidence for a decline in the vividness of visual imagery across the lifespan.</p><p id="P11">To quantitatively assess these hypotheses, we collected several measures. Visual function was assessed through visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. Reliance on prior knowledge in perception was measured using a two-tone image task, wherein participants initially view an ambiguous, difficult to parse image. After being shown the original undistorted image, they view the ambiguous version again; improved recognition on this second viewing reflects the influence of prior knowledge on perception. Inhibitory control was assessed via the Inhibition of Currently Irrelevant Memories (ICIM) task, which evaluates participants' ability to intentionally suppress memory-based interference during a sequential image recognition task using black-and-white line drawings. The vividness of visual imagery and suggestibility were measured using validated self-report questionnaires.</p><p id="P12">As an exploratory facet to our study, we also examined the prevalence of simple hallucinations (those related to more abstract patterns and forms) with age. Although we had no specific a priori hypotheses, the tendency to experience simple hallucinations is linked to cortical excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Bressloff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">DaSilva Morgan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Shenyan et al., 2024</xref>). Since cortical <italic>hypo</italic>excitability has been observed with ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Cespón et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Clark &amp; Taylor, 2011</xref>) it is possible that simple hallucinations may decrease with age. Conversely, vision loss in healthy ageing could be paired with visual phenomena (i.e. floaters, phosphenes; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Bergstrom &amp; Czyz, 2025</xref>) in a way that could be interpreted as simple hallucinations, leading to an increase in simple hallucinations.</p><p id="P13">Our results did not correspond to our prediction that reduced vision would lead to an increased reliance on prior knowledge and therefore an increased tendency to experience complex hallucinations. Instead, we found that complex hallucinations are reduced in old age. In our sample, we also found evidence for reduced suggestibility in old age, which could in principle explain reduced experiences of complex hallucinations. However, a mediation analysis provided no evidence for a causal relationship between complex hallucinations, age and suggestibility. These findings reveal that reduced visual ability, as occurs in healthy ageing, does not increase the likelihood of experiencing hallucinations. Our findings also suggest that the tendency to experience complex hallucinations is not a normal part of the ageing process, and that their presence is therefore likely to be indicative of a pathological process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S5"><label>2.1</label><title>Sample</title><p id="P14">There were 48 participants in the study, with four excluded.

Participants were asked to keep their eyes open, monitor any phenomena that arose across their visual field and to only verbalise a brief description of them once the percept had faded. These instructions were provided to ensure that participants reported all visual phenomena that could arise, even those that may have been more minor (i.e., simple, phosphene-like percepts) than they were expecting.

Participants first completed a training task in which a grayscale image was displayed and transformed gradually into a two-tone image that was unsmoothed and easy to recognise, to ensure they understood the relationship between two-tones and greyscale images. Next, participants completed four practice trials with unsmoothed ‘easy’ two-tone images. This was followed by the main task, in which 20 two-tone images of varying difficulty and the corresponding 20 greyscale images were presented in a pseudo-randomised order, such that for each grayscale image the corresponding two-tone was presented twice - once before the grayscale image (naive condition), and once after the grayscale image (cued condition). The task consisted of 60 experimental trials, with each trial consisting of a fixation cross presented for one second, followed by either a naive, greyscale or cued image presented for 200 ms, and finally a response screen. During the response screen, the question ‘Can you name what you saw?’ was displayed, prompting the participant to verbally name what they perceived in the image. The given answer was then typed in by the experimenter and displayed on the screen. Motivational, but uninformative, feedback was given after each trial to all participants. A diagrammatic of the task is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. A break screen was displayed every 12 trials to show progress through the task.

For each participant, images that were not accurately identified in the greyscale condition were excluded from their data across all conditions. Two experimenters independently scored each image and met to resolve any discrepancies between scoring. Our primary outcome measure, the perceptual reorganisation effect, was quantified as the difference between the number of cued correct images and naive correct images, excluding trials where the grayscale image was named incorrectly, i.e.: <disp-formula id="FD1"><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>(</mml:mtext><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mtext>)</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec></sec><sec id="S19"><label>2.3.2.2</label><title>The Inhibition of Current Irrelevant Memories task (ICIM)</title><p id="P28">The ICIM task was used to measure participants' intentional memory inhibition ability through assessing image recognition in three blocks of sequential black-and-white line drawings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alderson-Day et al., 2019</xref>).

We therefore reasoned that reports of reduced hallucination proneness may be due to the stigma associated with experiencing hallucinations and the implications, and we predicted that placing participants in an abstract, controlled experimental paradigm designed to elicit hallucinations (and therefore minimising stigma-related underreporting) would reveal an age-related increase in hallucinations.</p><p id="P50">Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that the tendency to experience experimentally-induced complex visual hallucinations in a laboratory environment decreases with age, and there was no consistent age difference in the tendency to experience simple hallucinations. This was despite replicating substantial, well-documented declines in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity with age in our sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Owsley et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Pitts, 1982</xref>) This suggests that age-related sight loss does not increase hallucination proneness, unlike more severe forms of sight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Jan &amp; del Castillo, 2012</xref>). In addition, processes thought to involve top-down modulation of sensory brain regions and hypothesised to correlate with hallucination proneness, such as perceptual reorganisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Teufel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zarkali, Adams, et al., 2019</xref>), vividness of mental imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Königsmark et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Reeder, 2022</xref>), and memory inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alderson-Day et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Paulik et al., 2007</xref>), showed no significant differences between our groups of healthy younger and older adults.</p><p id="P51">Older participants also exhibited reduced suggestibility, which correlated with fewer complex hallucinations. However, this association may simply reflect the decline of suggestibility with age, as we found no evidence for a causal relationship with complex hallucinations. Despite this, this work still highlights a need to explore suggestibility as a potential factor in reporting during hallucination reporting experiments, for example by increasing responding to meet perceived expectations or more lenient criterion setting. To disentangle this, future studies could also include control ‘faux hallucination induction’ conditions in which true visual hallucinations are unlikely to occur, but participants are prompted to report specific anomalous perceptual experiences, and to explore the relationship between percepts reported in the control conditions and those reported in true hallucination-inducing conditions.</p><p id="P52">Our findings add to a body of literature exploring hallucinations in a healthy ageing population in various ways. Firstly, for the first time, we experimentally induced visual hallucinations in older-adults through two distinct methods: visual stimulation via a rapidly flickering screen (Ganzflicker) and sensory deprivation using a static, homogeneous light field paired with auditory brown noise (Ganzfeld). We show that despite the numerous risk factors for increased hallucination-proneness typically associated with aging, such as reductions in sensory abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Owsley et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Pitts, 1982</xref>), older adults report fewer complex hallucinations during experimental conditions as well as self-reporting the retrospective intensity of this complex imagery as lower. There are several potential mechanisms to explain these changes.</p><p id="P53">The lower incidence of hallucinations in our older adult sample, and their lack of association with expected risk factors, may reflect the influence of sample selection and the underlying dynamics of pathology across the lifespan. For example, traits such as increased top-down influence on perception and inhibition of irrelevant representations, have been linked to conditions like Lewy body dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zarkali, Adams, et al., 2019</xref>) or psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Teufel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Soriano et al., 2009</xref>) and may signal early vulnerability to pathology in younger individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Haarsma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Paulik et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Teufel et al., 2013</xref>). Those whose hallucination-related traits progressed into overt clinical conditions may be underrepresented in older healthy samples due to an earlier onset and diagnosis. Thus, the reduced hallucination proneness in our older sample may reflect a filtering effect over time. Our work suggests that when hallucinations do occur in older adults, they may warrant closer clinical attention, as they could signal underlying pathology rather than normative age-related change. Future research could use controlled hallucination-inducing paradigms, such as flicker or sensory deprivation, as safe "stress tests" (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zarkali, Lees, et al., 2019</xref>) to probe individual differences in hallucination susceptibility and potentially flag early signs of neurodegenerative or psychiatric disorders.</p><p id="P54">Age-related cortical hypoexcitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Cespón et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Clark &amp; Taylor, 2011</xref>) could also explain the decline of complex hallucinations we observed in our older adult sample. Our focus here has been on top-down modulatory factors as the primary driver of complex hallucinations, given their relative insensitivity to bottom-up manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Shenyan et al., 2024</xref>). However, these findings do not negate a contributory role for intrinsic cortical excitability in generating complex hallucinations. Simple hallucinations have been linked with cortical excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Bressloff et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">2002</xref>), and though we observed no differences in the rate of button-press reports for simple hallucinations, we did see evidence to suggest a decrease in the retrospectively rated intensity of simple hallucinations in old age, which could also be driven by cortical hypoexcitability. Future studies should investigate this possibility, for example by using methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to measure flicker phosphene thresholds in both older and younger adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abrahamyan et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S35"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P55">As measures of hallucinations rely on self-reported measures, there is still the possibility that older individuals may conservatively under-report hallucinations due to stigma. Furthermore, our younger cohort was composed mostly of undergraduate university students. Therefore, there may also be a cohort effect, where younger adults are more accepting of the possibility of experiencing hallucinatory experiences during a psychology experiment. We further did not collect background data on socioeconomic factors like education levels, which could vary by age and influence hallucinatory reporting. These factors therefore act as potential unmeasured mediators, which may inflate the estimates of the direct effect of age on hallucination proneness in our mediation analyses.</p><p id="P56">Furthermore, the classification of hallucinations as complex in our study was based on researcher judgement, which inherently introduces potential bias. In order to mitigate this, we were particularly conservative in our classification of complex hallucinations – concordance between the provided description and the drawing was required to be appropriately classified as a complex hallucination. Moreover, discrepancies in classifications were discussed among the experimenter and other researchers involved in the project to reach a consensus. While these measures were implemented to reduce bias and enhance the reliability of our findings, it is important to acknowledge that some degree of researcher bias may still persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Shenyan et al., 2024</xref>). In addition, the dynamic nature of hallucinations, specifically during the Ganzflicker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Shenyan et al., 2024</xref>), presents challenges for verbal reporting. It is possible that some participants may have experienced visual hallucinations but were unable to effectively articulate them. However, the consistency of our results both directly measured inside the laboratory (i.e., button press measures and self-report retrospective questionnaires) and outside of the laboratory (i.e., CAPS which measures anomalous perception in day-to-day life), decreases the possibility of both of these situations. Incorporating objective measures such as neuroimaging techniques could provide further insights into the neural differences between younger and older adults during these paradigms.</p></sec><sec id="S36" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P57">To conclude, we show that older adults are less prone to experimentally-induced visual hallucinations than younger adults, aligning with a growing body of literature. Our findings suggest that when hallucinations do occur in older adults they may be indicative of underlying pathology, rather than being a result of the risk factors associated with normal ageing (i.e., sensory and cognitive impairments). Further research is needed to explore whether we are able to use safe hallucination-inducing environments - such as flicker or sensory deprivation - as ‘stress tests’ for hallucination-associated pathology, as well as cognitive factors which contribute to complex hallucination formation and how these differ across the lifespan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS206148-supplement-Supplementary_materials.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d50aAcGbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S37"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by a Wellcome Career Development Award: [306332/Z/23/Z]; Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council [grant number BB/J014567/1], grants from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; UCL Institute of Ophthalmology.</p></ack><sec id="S38" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability statement</title><p id="P58">Data is available on request.
