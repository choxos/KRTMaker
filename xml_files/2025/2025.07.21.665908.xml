nuclear envelope and is the central gateway for macromolecular transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm in eukaryotes. NPC biogenesis requires the coordinated assembly of over 500 proteins culminating in the fusion of the inner and outer nuclear membranes. The molecular mechanism of this membrane fusion step that occurs in all eukaryotes is unknown. Here, we elucidate the mechanism by which two paralogous transmembrane proteins, Brl1 and Brr6, mediate membrane fusion in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Both proteins form multimeric, ring-shaped complexes with membrane remodeling activity. Brl1 is enriched at NPC assembly sites via a nuclear export sequence and then interacts with Brr6 across the nuclear envelope lumen through conserved hydrophobic loops. Disrupting this interaction blocks fusion and halts NPC assembly. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the Brl1-Brr6 complex drives membrane fusion by forming a channel across bilayers that enables lipid exchange. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that Brl1/Brr6 homologues are broadly distributed across eukaryotes, and functional experiments in human cells and D. melanogaster establish CLCC1 as an NPC fusogen in metazoans. Together, our results uncover a novel, conserved mechanism for membrane fusion in eukaryotes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">A fundamental challenge for all eukaryotic cells is the selective transport of a diverse set of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. This exchange is mediated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), a ~50 MDa protein channel that spans the double lipid bilayer of the nuclear envelope (NE). NPCs are among the largest and most conserved cellular complexes in eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, NPCs are composed of over 30 distinct nucleoporins (Nups), which assemble in multiple copies to form a mature structure with eightfold rotational symmetry, totaling more than 500 individual proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">In recent years, extraordinary progress has been made in characterizing the fully assembled NPC structure, but much less is known about how the large number of NPC subunits come together and how NPCs are inserted into the NE. In general, there are two modes of NPC assembly: post-mitotic assembly, which occurs following NE breakdown during open mitosis, and interphase assembly, in which NPCs are assembled into the intact NE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In organisms that undergo closed mitosis, interphase assembly is the only way to build new NPCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and inserting a functional NPC into the intact NE without compromising nuclear-cytoplasmic integrity presents a great challenge for the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The stepwise process begins at the inner nuclear membrane, where stable subcomplexes of individual Nups come together to form successive higher order assemblies that culminate in the mature complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The final step of NPC insertion requires fusion of the inner and outer nuclear membranes to create a continuous pore through the NE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the two paralogous transmembrane proteins Brl1 and Brr6 are critical for this process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Both proteins are essential, and disruption of either halts NPC assembly, resulting in the emergence of unfused, omega-shaped NE herniations that are a hallmark of defective NPC assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Except for Brl1’s ~280-amino-acid unstructured N-terminus, the two paralogues share a highly similar structure, comprising two transmembrane helices and a luminal amphipathic helix (AH). We and others previously demonstrated that the AH in Brl1 is essential for NPC biogenesis, and single point mutations in the AH stall NPC assembly at a step prior to the fusion of the inner and outer nuclear membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. However, the molecular mechanism of membrane fusion during NPC biogenesis and how Brl1/Brr6 contribute to this process have remained elusive.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we integrate experimental approaches with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to uncover how Brl1 and Brr6 mediate membrane fusion during interphase NPC biogenesis. We find that Brl1 and Brr6 interact to form homo-oligomeric ring structures, creating a channel that enables lipid exchange between the inner and outer NE bilayers. Phylogenetic analyses reveal the presence of <italic>BRL1/BRR6</italic> homologues across the eukaryotic tree, and functional studies in human cell lines and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> establish CLCC1 as their functional equivalent in metazoans. Together, our results uncover a novel mechanism for membrane fusion in NPC biogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Brl1 is enriched at NPC assembly sites via a nuclear export signal</title><p id="P6">Brl1 and Brr6 are paralogues with highly similar domain architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Despite their similarity, both Brl1 and Brr6 are required for NPC assembly in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Brl1 was found to localize preferentially to the inner nuclear membrane, whereas Brr6 is found in both inner and outer nuclear membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, and overexpression of one cannot compensate for the loss of the other, suggesting distinct and non-redundant functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. To better characterize the functional differences between Brl1 and Brr6, we focused on the long unstructured N-terminal domain found exclusively in Brl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We first generated a truncated Brl1 variant lacking the N-terminal region (Brl1ΔN) and tested its role <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using a plasmid shuffle strategy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a</xref>), we replaced the chromosomal <italic>BRL1</italic> and/or <italic>BRR6</italic> copies with wild-type (wt) versions on a counter-selectable plasmid. Then, we stably integrated the <italic>BRL1ΔN</italic> mutant into the genome and selected for cells that lost the wt plasmid. Using this approach, we found that <italic>BRL1ΔN</italic> failed to compensate for a <italic>BRL1</italic> deletion at endogenous expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1b</xref>). However, when overexpressed, Brl1ΔN could functionally replace full-length Brl1. Remarkably, unlike the wt protein, overexpression of Brl1ΔN also rescued the <italic>BRR6</italic> deletion and even restored viability of a <italic>brl1Δ brr6</italic>Δ double deletion strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). By contrast, overexpression of an N-terminally truncated Brr6 variant could not functionally replace Brl1 but rescued the <italic>BRR6</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). These findings suggest that the N-terminal domain of Brl1 is essential at physiological levels and is important for the functional divergence of Brl1 and Brr6.</p><p id="P7">Surveying the Brl1 N-terminus using the nuclear export signal (NES) prediction tool LocNES uncovered two potential Xpo1-dependent NESs in the first 32 amino acids of Brl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. We tested the functionality of these NESs by fusing N-terminal fragments of Brl1 to GFP-MBP and monitored their intracellular localization. Whereas GFP-MBP alone localized diffusely throughout the cell, constructs containing the full Brl1 N-terminus or just the putative NES fragments were excluded from the nucleus to a similar level as constructs with an NES derived from protein kinase A inhibitor (NES<sup>PKI</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). In contrast, constructs lacking the predicted NES, such as GFP-MBP fusions with the Brl1 C-terminus, the Brr6 N-terminus, the Brl1 N-terminus without the NES sequences, or where the amino acids of the NES were scrambled (Brl1(NES<sup>scr</sup>)), localized throughout the cell, similarly to GFP-MBP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1c-d</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Next, we wanted to understand the functional importance of these NES elements in Brl1. Brl1 variants lacking the NES (Brl1ΔNES) or carrying a scrambled version (Brl1(NES<sup>scr</sup>)) were unable to restore viability of <italic>brl1</italic>Δ cells when expressed at low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Importantly, the observed lethality was not due to differences in expression levels, as these constructs were expressed at levels comparable to endogenously tagged Brl1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1e</xref>). To determine if both NESs are required, we created diploid yeast cells where one copy of <italic>BRL1</italic> was truncated and tested the viability of the haploid cell after sporulation. Interestingly, deletion of either NES alone was tolerated but deletion of both was lethal, indicating that the two NES elements are functionally redundant, but the presence of at least one NES is essential (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1f</xref>). Supporting this, fusion of a single, heterologous NES<sup>PKI</sup> to the Brl1ΔNES mutant could also restore viability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1f</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Xpo1-dependent NESs are leucine-rich and very hydrophobic in nature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. To make sure that it is indeed the nuclear export function that is required and not only the hydrophobicity, we created a chimera between Brl1ΔNES and the longer and less hydrophobic, Msn5-dependent NES from Pho4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. A Pho4 fragment containing the NES and one of the two binding domains for the Pho80 kinase was efficiently excluded from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1c-d</xref>). Interestingly, fusing this Msn5-dependent NES<sup>Pho4</sup> to Brl1ΔNES was sufficient to restore the function of Brl1 since its expression rescued the lethality of the <italic>BRL1</italic> deletion strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). This demonstrates that the presence of an NES in Brl1 is essential, independent of the specific nuclear export pathway.</p><p id="P10">Brl1 levels play a critical role in NPC assembly, as overexpression of Brl1 has been shown to rescue several NPC assembly mutants such as <italic>nup116</italic>Δ or <italic>gle2</italic>Δ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that the use of the export machinery provides a checkpoint mechanism that selectively concentrates Brl1 only at functional NPC assembly intermediates at the inner nuclear membrane. Consistent with this model, overexpression of Brl1ΔNES or Brl1(NES<sup>scr</sup>) restored the viability of <italic>brl1</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>, compared to <bold>1e</bold>) suggesting that high cellular levels of Brl1 can bypass this enrichment step. To test the NES-dependent enrichment directly, we analyzed the localization of the amphipathic helix mutant of Brl1 (Brl1(AH*)), which is unable to promote NPC assembly, with and without an NES upon degradation of endogenous Brl1 using an auxin-inducible degron (AID)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Following auxin-induced degradation of Brl1, full length Brl1(AH*) accumulated in foci around the NE, likely corresponding to stalled NPC assembly intermediates. Brl1(AH*)ΔNES on the other hand was concentrated to a much lower degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). Furthermore, while overexpression of full-length Brl1(AH*) in a Brl1 wt background is normally dominant negative, cells expressing the truncated Brl1(AH*)ΔNES were viable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1g-h</xref>). This suggests that formation of the toxic, multilayered NE herniations we previously observed in this mutant depends on the accumulation of high levels of Brl1(AH*) at the inner nuclear membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Together our data reveal a critical role for the NES in localizing and enriching Brl1 at NPC assembly sites. This enrichment mechanism would provide an elegant solution to restrict NPC insertion to assembly sites that can already functionally interact with the nuclear export machinery and prevent erroneous fusion events elsewhere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Brl1/Brr6 are present across the eukaryotic tree and CLCC1 is their functional equivalent in metazoans</title><p id="P11">In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, both <italic>BRL1</italic> and <italic>BRR6</italic> are essential, and their full-length variants carry out non-redundant functions in NPC biogenesis, at least partly due to the presence of an NES in Brl1. Given that some fungi, such as <italic>S. pombe</italic>, possess only a single <italic>BRL1/BRR6</italic> homologue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, we sought to investigate the evolutionary ancestry of this protein family. Using HMMER, a tool for sequence-based homology searches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, we identified <italic>BRL1/BRR6</italic> homologues in 52 of 55 species spanning holomycotan diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2b</xref>). Of note, viability assays revealed that overexpression of orthologues from several fungi could compensate for the loss of Brr6, or even both Brl1 and Brr6, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, underscoring not only a structural but also remarkable functional conservation of these proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2a</xref>). Most fungi contain a single <italic>BRL1/BRR6</italic> gene, but a notable duplication appears to have occurred in the Saccharomycotina. Intriguingly, this duplication correlates with the emergence of an N-terminal NES in one of the two paralogues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2b</xref>). This suggests that the gene duplication has enabled the fine-tuning of NPC assembly through the evolution of an NES-mediated targeting mechanism that recruits one Brl1/Brr6 copy to nascent NPCs that form at the inner NE.</p><p id="P12">NPC biogenesis is essential in all eukaryotes, yet Brl1/Brr6-like proteins have so far only been reported in fungi, raising questions about their wider evolutionary conservation. To address this conundrum, we extended our search for homologues across 148 species spanning the diversity of eukaryotes. Indeed, Brl1/Brr6-like proteins can be detected throughout the eukaryotic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), suggesting an origin predating the divergence of fungi, potentially tracing back to the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). Surprisingly, the distribution of <italic>BRL1/BRR6</italic> homologues across the eukaryotic tree is patchy and for many lineages we could not confidently identify homologues. Most notably, no homologue could be found in metazoans using these conventional sequence-based homology searches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3a</xref>). However, HHpred, an algorithm designed to detect distant structural homology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, recently identified CLCC1, a metazoan protein with a luminal amphipathic helix flanked by two transmembrane domains, closely resembling the topology of Brl1/Brr6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that CLCC1 is conserved across metazoans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3b</xref>), but due to high sequence divergence, we were unable to determine if <italic>BRL1/BRR6</italic> and CLCC1 share an ancestral origin or if this is a case of convergent evolution. Nevertheless, the structural similarity between these proteins suggests that they may perform equivalent functions in NPC biogenesis.</p><p id="P13">To test if CLCC1 is required for NPC assembly in metazoa, we created human cell lines in which we deleted CLCC1 by CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>) and examined NE morphology using electron microscopy. Consistent with defects in NPC biogenesis, the appearance of NE herniations in a CLCC1 KO cell line, a hallmark of failed NPC assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d-e</xref>). Fluorescence microscopy revealed an accumulation of MLF2 and ubiquitin foci at the NE, both established markers of NE herniations in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. To verify that these foci represent stalled NPC assembly intermediates, we assessed the colocalization of MLF2 with NUP107 and RanBP2. NUP107 is incorporated into NPCs prior to membrane fusion, while RanBP2 is recruited only after membrane fusion has occurred<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Strikingly, we observed MLF2 foci preferentially in NE regions lacking a RanBP2 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Quantitative analysis indeed revealed that MLF2 and NUP107 signals were uncorrelated as both stalled intermediates and mature NPCs contain NUP107, while there was a clear anticorrelation between MLF2 and RanBP2 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). This confirms that the MLF2-positive structures represent pre-fusion NPC assembly intermediates devoid of RanBP2.</p><p id="P14">To determine whether Brl1 and CLCC1 function similarly in NPC biogenesis, we introduced point mutations in the amphipathic helix of CLCC1 that mimic those previously shown to render Brl1 incapable of promoting membrane fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Consistent with its importance for the function of CLCC1, mutations in the CLCC1 AH (I323D or L312/I315D) induced NPC assembly defects, as evidenced by the appearance of MLF2 foci at the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i, 2k</xref>). Like Brl1(AH*) mutants, CLCC1 AH mutants exhibited a dominant-negative phenotype, as defects were observed even in the presence of a wt CLCC1 copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j-2l</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Finally, we examined whether the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLCC1 homologue <italic>CG12945</italic>, hereafter <italic>dClcc1</italic>, also affects NPC assembly. We obtained a homozygous lethal allele of <italic>dClcc1</italic> (<italic>CG12945<sup>EP3613</sup>, hereafter dclcc1<sup>EP</sup></italic>) and used the FLP-FRT system to generate mosaic tissues containing <italic>dclcc1<sup>EP</sup></italic> homozygous clones. In the ejaculatory duct, we observed a marked reduction of Nup358/RanBP2 at the NE in the RFP-null <italic>dclcc1<sup>EP</sup></italic> homozygous cells, indicating that NPC assembly is halted at a step prior to NE membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2m-n</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that CLCC1 is a metazoan-specific NPC assembly factor that not only has a similar structural architecture to Brl1/Brr6 but also functions in the same pathway.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Brl1 and Brr6 form homo-oligomers with membrane remodeling capability</title><p id="P16">The broad distribution of Brl1/Brr6 and CLCC1 across the eukaryotic tree, along with their conserved AH, suggests that they may act in a similar manner during NPC assembly. We therefore sought to examine their mechanism of action, focusing on Brl1 and Brr6 in budding yeast. Using AlphaFold3 (AF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, we found that both Brl1 and Brr6 are predicted to self-associate and form curved, multimeric structures that become fully closed rings when 10 or more copies are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5a-b</xref>). Notably, similar multimeric ring structures are also predicted for Brl1/Brr6 homologues in other species and for CLCC1, but not for unrelated proteins that also contain two or three transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6-S7</xref>).</p><p id="P17">The AF-predicted protein-protein interactions suggest a conserved oligomerization mechanism in which the amphipathic helices align radially to interact with the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>). To test this oligomerization model experimentally, we targeted an interaction surface between two Brr6 monomers which is predicted to be mediated by electrostatic interactions (R87, E88, D91 and K123, E128) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Charge-reversal mutations on either side of this interface disrupted Brr6 function, leading to lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Strikingly, introducing compensatory charge reversals on both sides of the predicted interaction interface restored function and cells expressing this double variant were viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). This experiment validates the AF model and provides strong evidence that Brr6 multimerization is essential for its function, although the precise stoichiometry of the Brr6 multimer is difficult to determine experimentally. We were unable to engineer equivalent compensatory, electrostatic interaction interfaces in Brl1, but given its structural similarity, we consider it highly likely that Brl1 can also form a multimeric structure as predicted by AF.</p><p id="P18">To assess the behavior of these oligomeric structures in a membrane environment, we used coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations. To perform the MD simulations of Brl1 and Brr6 complexes inserted into a lipid bilayer, we selected one oligomeric AF model representing 16-mer rings. When embedded in flat lipid bilayers, the oligomeric complexes of both Brl1 and Brr6 introduce pronounced local membrane curvatures and disrupt lipid organization in their vicinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). To assess this remodeling effect, we calculated the second-rank order parameter (P2) reflecting the degree of order in the lipid tails. We observed a gradual decrease in the order of the lipid tails surrounding the protein assemblies when compared to the bulk membrane region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5d</xref>). Near the oligomers, lipid tails tilt away from their usual orientation, suggesting that they are splayed or inverted, while those farther away remain in a typical bilayer arrangement.</p><p id="P19">Since such lipid remodeling has been shown to strongly correlate with increased membrane fusion propensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, we wondered whether the observed lipid destabilization might be sufficient to drive membrane fusion. To test this, we performed MD simulations of very closely opposed (6 nm) flat membrane bilayers with a Brl1 or Brr6 16-mer inserted into one of the membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e-h</xref>). However, throughout the simulations the two membranes remained at a constant distance and did not undergo any interaction or fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e-h</xref>). Given that both Brl1 and Brr6 are essential <italic>in vivo</italic>, it was perhaps not surprising that the presence of Brl1 or Brr6 alone was insufficient to induce membrane fusion <italic>in silico</italic>, prompting us to explore how Brl1 and Brr6 cooperate to promote membrane fusion.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Brl1/Brr6 interact across the ER lumen through a conserved hydrophobic loop motif</title><p id="P20">Earlier work suggested that Brl1 and Brr6 interact biochemically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. To identify their potential interaction interface, we used AF to model assemblies of 16 Brl1 monomers together with 16 Brr6 monomers. Both proteins still formed the previously observed homotypic 16-mer rings and interact with each other side-to-side. Intriguingly, AF predicted that the two homo-oligomers interact in a head-to-head orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). This arrangement is consistent with their reported localization in opposing membranes of the NE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and suggests that a luminal interaction between Brl1 and Brr6 might bridge the inner and outer nuclear membranes. The predicted interaction is primarily mediated by short, hydrophobic motifs found at the tips of the luminal domains of both Brl1 and Brr6, composed of four residues: Φ-P-A-Φ (hydrophobic-proline-alanine-hydrophobic), hereafter referred to as the hydrophobic loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Multiple sequence alignment revealed that this motif is highly conserved in fungi and other holomycota and likely stabilized by the two previously characterized disulfide bridges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, which are also well conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p id="P21">To experimentally test if the hydrophobic loops are indeed required for the interaction between Brl1 and Brr6, we substituted the two hydrophobic residues of the interaction surface with negatively charged aspartic acid (ΦPAΦ-&gt;DPAD, subsequently called Brl1(loop*) or Brr6(loop*)). Interestingly, AF no longer predicted a head-to-head interaction between Brl1 and Brr6 for these mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8a-b</xref>). Cells expressing loop mutants in either Brl1 or Brr6 were not viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Milder substitutions like Brl1(LPAC), Brr6(VPAC) or Brr6(VPAM) were tolerated in the presence of a wt partner, but in combination they resulted in synthetic lethality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8c</xref>), consistent with an interaction between Brl1 and Brr6 via this loop interface.</p><p id="P22">To monitor how disruption of the hydrophobic loop affects NPC assembly, we employed the AID system to deplete endogenous Brl1 in cells that additionally express either Brl1(wt) or Brl1(loop*). NPC assembly was assessed by the localization of Nup82, a NUP known to incorporate only after membrane fusion has occurred<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Upon depletion of endogenous Brl1, Brl1(loop*) expressing cells displayed pronounced Nup82 mislocalization, whereas Nup82 remained evenly distributed around the NE in Brl1(wt) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d-e</xref>). These results show that the hydrophobic loop is essential for Brl1 function and that its disruption halts NPC assembly at a step before membrane fusion.</p><p id="P23">Previously we demonstrated that overexpression of the Brl1(AH*) mutant had a dominant-negative effect, leading to the accumulation of bright foci in the NE and the formation of multilayered membrane herniations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. In line with the critical role of the hydrophobic loop in membrane fusion, overexpression of the Brl1(loop*) mutant caused a similar dominant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). However, fluorescence microscopy revealed a key distinction: whereas the NE foci formed upon Brl1(AH*) overexpression colocalized with Brr6, those formed by Brl1(loop*) did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). This strongly suggests that although both mutants block NPC assembly, they do so through different mechanisms. Brl1(AH*) retains the ability to interact with Brr6 across the NE lumen but is non-fusogenic because of the disrupted AH. In contrast, Brl1(loop*) fails to interact with and recruit Brr6 to NPC insertion sites, thereby preventing membrane fusion despite having an intact AH.</p><p id="P24">Overexpression of a Brr6 variant with a mutation in the AH, Brr6(AH*), led to the accumulation of Brl1 in foci at the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). This indicates that Brl1 is still recruited to early NPC assembly intermediates and engages with Brr6(AH*), but that Brr6(AH*) is unable to promote membrane fusion, thus halting NPC biogenesis. Indeed, ultrastructural analysis confirmed a substantial increase in arrested NPC assembly intermediates in these cells (10.4 per μm<sup>2</sup> NE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref>) compared to the low frequency observed under normal conditions (0.3-0.5 per μm<sup>2</sup> NE; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>). Like for Brl1(AH*), overexpression of Brr6(AH*) was also dominant-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Remarkably, additional disruption of the hydrophobic loop, Brr6(loop*)(AH*), alleviated the toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>) and decreased the accumulation of Brl1 at the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). This is consistent with our results that a functional loop is critical for the interaction between Brl1 and Brr6. The Brr6(loop*)(AH*) the double mutant fails to interact with Brl1 and thus permits endogenous Brl1 and Brr6 to function normally in promoting membrane fusion.</p><p id="P25">In summary, our results show that the hydrophobic loops of Brl1 and Brr6 mediate the luminal interaction between the two proteins. This interaction is essential for membrane fusion, and its disruption on either Brl1 or Brr6 halts the NPC assembly process.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Brl1-Brr6 interaction leads to lipid mixing between lipid bilayers</title><p id="P26">Given the importance of the Brl1-Brr6 interaction for NPC assembly, we sought to determine whether the presence of both protein complexes is sufficient to promote membrane fusion. To test this, we performed CG-MD simulations using the AF-predicted structures for the Brl1 and Brr6 homo-oligomeric 16-mers in the 32-mer complex, which featured flatter luminal domains when compared to the individual 16-mers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5c</xref>). The two 16-mers were split apart and embedded into opposing membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a</xref>). In our MD simulations the two complexes rapidly established stable interactions via the hydrophobic loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a-b</xref>) provided that the initial distance between the two bilayers was below 10 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp Movie 3</xref>) and persisted throughout the entire duration of the simulations. Notably, this distance threshold aligns very well with previous membrane-distance measurements of NPC assembly intermediates in cryo-ET tomograms: while the inner and outer NE are normally spaced ~20 nm apart, they narrow to ~10 nm as the inner nuclear membrane buckles towards the outer at NPC assembly intermediates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. To mimic the high membrane curvature at NPC assembly sites, we also embedded the Brl1 oligomer in a vesicle (R = 12 nm) and again observed robust binding to Brr6 within a few microseconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supp Movie 4</xref>). As a control, no contact between the flat bilayer and the vesicle was established when only an individual 16-mer of Brr6 was present in the bilayer, while leaving the vesicle free of protein. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>). Overall, this supports our model in which Brl1 and Brr6 interact via their hydrophobic loops and suggests that this interaction can only take place in the context of NPC assembly intermediates.</p><p id="P27">In the MD simulations, the protein-protein interaction between the Brl1 and Brr6 complexes further reduces the distance between the inner and outer NE, effectively pulling the membranes into close proximity to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5e</xref>). In addition, lipid remodeling similar to that seen in the presence of the Brl1 and Brr6 complexes alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>) was observed on both membranes. Hence, the Brl1-Brr6 complex promotes both membrane tethering and local lipid remodeling near its oligomeric structure, hinting that the formation of this complex primes the inner and outer NE membranes for fusion. Indeed, in all our simulations we observed that once the Brl1-Brr6 interaction is established, lipid mixing takes place within the channel that is formed by the two ring structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). This lipid mixing is reminiscent of a hemifusion-like intermediate with exposed lipid tails but, in this case, it is stabilized within the protein rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). We repeatedly found that lipid mixing is exclusively initiated within the channel that is formed by the Brl1-Brr6 ring structure, highlighting the potential role of the oligomeric complex as a catalyst of membrane fusion.</p><p id="P28">Following lipid mixing, no further spontaneous progression of the fusion process could be observed. To test whether subsequent steps could promote further events in the fusion cascade, we performed additional unbiased CG-MD simulations after removing the protein rings from the final conformation observed in the previous MD simulations with the protein complex. This approach is justified by the observation that Brl1 only transiently associates with assembling NPCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and that Brl1 and Brr6 are not present in the fully assembled NPC structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, we found that in these conditions, lipid mixing spontaneously progresses into a stable hemifusion stalk intermediate and, over time, all the headgroups rearrange sideways, ultimately facilitating a stalk to diaphragm transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>). Taken together, our simulations identify the hetero-oligomeric Brl1-Brr6 ring complex as a novel catalyst of membrane fusion. Rearrangement or removal of the complex, via a yet unknown mechanism, is likely required to achieve complete fusion between the inner and outer nuclear membrane.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">NPCs are a hallmark of all eukaryotic cells, and the insertion of new NPCs into the NE hinges on a pivotal fusion event of the inner and outer nuclear membranes to form a fusion pore that spans the NE. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Brl1 and Brr6 have been shown to be essential for this process, yet the underlying mechanism of how Brl1 and Brr6 contribute to membrane fusion has remained unclear. Here, we characterize a heteromeric Brl1-Brr6 ring channel as a novel catalyst of membrane fusion in eukaryotes. Our results demonstrate that Brl1 is targeted via an NES to new NPC assembly sites where it can interact with Brr6 across the lumen of the nuclear envelope. Both Brl1 and Brr6 can multimerize into ring-like homo-oligomers, and upon interaction they can assemble into a large heteromeric fusion channel that bridges the inner and outer NE. MD simulations reveal that the Brl1-Brr6 complex destabilizes lipid bilayers, promoting lipid exchange through the central channel of this ring complex, ultimately driving membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>).</p><p id="P30">New NPC assembly is a fundamental process in the life of all eukaryotic cells. Therefore, it has been puzzling that Brl1/Brr6-like proteins have so far only been identified in fungi. Our phylogenetic analyses however demonstrate that homologues of Brl1/Brr6 are present in many lineages across the eukaryotic tree. This suggests that the origin of Brl1/Brr6 predates the divergence of the holomycota clade, and Brl1/Brr6-like proteins might have already been present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). In addition, we show that the structurally similar protein CLCC1 is conserved across metazoans and demonstrate that it is required for NPC assembly in human cells and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Of note, we could not identify Brl1/Brr6 or CLCC1-like proteins in all eukaryotic lineages and, for example, plants lack clearly identifiable homologs. Given the essential nature of NPC assembly, it is likely that there are functionally equivalent proteins in these species as well, but their sequences are too divergent to be identified by sequence-based homology searches. The pronounced sequence divergence between Brl1 and CLCC1 supports the idea that additional, divergent NPC fusogens may exist across eukaryotes. Why such a central component of NPC biogenesis would evolve so rapidly remains unclear. Further investigation into the membrane fusion machinery across diverse eukaryotes will be key to understanding whether this fundamental step is driven by evolutionary conservation or has evolved multiple times and reached a convergent solution.</p><p id="P31">Despite their elusive evolutionary relationship, our work provides strong evidence that CLCC1 and Brl1/Brr6 perform equivalent roles in NPC assembly. Depletion of human or <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLCC1 halts NPC biogenesis and leads to the accumulation of arrested NPC assembly intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Furthermore, mutations in the AH of hCLCC1 recapitulate the dominant-negative phenotypes previously seen with comparable mutations in the AH of Brl1, suggesting that these two protein families promote membrane fusion in a mechanistically similar way. An obvious difference between these proteins lies in the structure of the hydrophobic loop, which is highly conserved in Brl1/Brr6-like proteins but diverges in CLCC1. Moreover, CLCC1 contains a third transmembrane helix, but can likely also homo-oligomerize into a ring-like structure despite this (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). While we have identified the AH in CLCC1 as a conserved feature required for membrane fusion, whether CLCC1 mediates fusion through self-interaction or whether it requires additional partners remains an interesting question.</p><p id="P32">Whereas in most lineages only a single gene coding for Brl1/Brr6 or CLCC1 can be identified, Saccharomycotina have undergone a gene duplication leading to a functional specialization of Brl1 and Brr6, and in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Brl1 and Brr6 can no longer replace each other. We hypothesize that this gives Saccharomycotina better control over the membrane fusion step during NPC assembly. The NES-dependent recruitment of Brl1 that we identify here ensures that the fusion machinery is enriched only at newly forming NPCs that can functionally interact with the nuclear export machinery, thus preventing fusion at non-functional intermediates. Essentially, this could serve as an NPC-assembly checkpoint prior to the initiation of NE fusion. This also predicts that the fidelity of NPC assembly may be lower in our strains that depend on overexpression of Brl1ΔNES or in other eukaryotes that have a single <italic>BRL1/BRR6</italic> gene. They likely rely on a homotypic interaction of identical Brl1ΔNES or Brl1/Brr6 rings that could potentially assemble anywhere in the NE or ER. However, insertion of new NPCs and NE fusion must be tightly controlled in all eukaryotes to prevent the uncontrolled exchange of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Therefore, additional safeguards against uncontrolled NE fusion likely exist. Interestingly, our MD simulations suggest that within the native NE, the two membrane leaflets are too far apart and not flexible enough for the Brl1 and Brr6 rings to interact spontaneously. Therefore, the interaction between Brl1 and Brr6 across the NE lumen can likely only occur at newly emerging NPC assembly intermediates where the initial recruitment of NPC components has already buckled the inner NE membrane and reduced the distance between the inner and outer membranes. Similarly, since Brr6 (and CLCC1) are also found in the ER, it is possible that proteins that control ER luminal width, such as Climp63<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, might play analogous roles to prevent homotopic intraluminal ER fusion. Additional layers of regulation may also contribute. For example, we previously showed that the AH of Brl1 preferentially binds highly curved membranes, such as those found in NPC assembly intermediates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. This curvature-sensing mechanism might help to recruit and further stabilize the membrane conformations required for fusion exclusively at new NPC assembly sites.</p><p id="P33">The observed mechanism of Brl1-Brr6 mediated fusion is conceptually similar to that of other fusion machineries: protein-mediated tethering between two membranes promotes close proximity between the two bilayers, ultimately leading to fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Yet, several novel aspects emerge from our data. First, all hitherto known intracellular membrane fusion machineries (e.g., SNAREs, dynamin-like GTPases) promote fusion by cytosolic tethering domains, while the Brl1/Brr6 complex does so using luminal facing domains. Second, SNAREs and dynamin-like GTPases ultimately use energy provided by ATP or GTP hydrolysis to promote membrane fusion but no energy consuming step has so far been identified in yeast NPC biogenesis. It is however important to point out that the energy for membrane fusion in SNARE-mediated processes is provided by tight protein-protein interactions between v- and t-SNAREs that trigger docking and zippering reactions that are sufficient for lipid exchange. ATP hydrolysis is only subsequently required for SNARE complex dissociation and recycling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Akin to SNAREs it appears that the main energetic driving force promoting membrane fusion in NPC biogenesis is the close apposition of the inner and outer NE membrane. This is initially driven by early stages of NPC assembly. Subsequently, the distance between the inner and outer NE is further reduced by the multivalent loop-loop interactions between the Brl1 and Brr6 oligomers, allowing for lipid exchange. How the multimeric complex formed by Brl1 and Brr6 is disassembled and turned over remains an open question. Energy-driven processes, such as post-translational modifications could regulate this late fusion step. Moreover, Brl1/Brr6 together with Apq12 have been implicated in lipid homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>.

Finally, the post fusion recruitment of additional NPC components, such as the Y-complexes and the cytoplasmic filaments might lead to structural rearrangements within the NPC that stabilize the new fusion pore and might facilitate the recycling of the fusion machinery.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cloning procedures</title><p id="P34">The plasmids for this study were constructed using either scarless homology-based cloning with the In-Fusion® Cloning Kit (Takara Bio) or by modular assembly following the Golden Gate strategy described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>.

To convert the protein structure predictions from all-atom to CG resolution, the Martinize2 script<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup> was used. An elastic network with a force constant of 500 kJ/mol·nm<sup>2</sup> was applied to preserve the secondary structure of the protein, merging all individual subunits of the protein complex. Next, the insane.py script<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup> was used to generate a lipid bilayer with the following composition: DOPC: DOPE: DOPS: DOPA: DODG (69:20:5:2:4).

The temperature (310 K) and pressure (1 bar) were maintained using the Berendsen thermostat and barostat, respectively. The system was then stripped of solvent and ions to obtain only the equilibrated bilayer which was used in subsequent simulations. For vesicle simulations, we utilized the Martini Maker tool of CHARMM-GUI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup> to generate a 12 nm-radius vesicle made solely of DOPC.

Both the protein insertion and the lipid removal steps were executed by an in-house TCL script on VMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref></sup>. As a result, several lipids remained within the inner ring of the 16-mer oligomers.

Energy minimization was performed using the steepest descent algorithm for 5000 steps, with a position restraint of 1000 kJ/mol·nm<sup>2</sup> applied to the protein backbone beads. The system was then equilibrated using the five-step protocol, incrementally increasing the time step from 1 fs to 15 fs while steadily reducing position restraints on the protein backbone beads. The temperature (310 K) and pressure (1 bar) were maintained using the Berendsen thermostat and barostat, respectively. Four independent replicas of 5 μs were simulated.</p><p id="P67">For systems with two opposing membranes, we began by building a single membrane containing the desired protein. Each system was built and equilibrated separately using the approach described above. Next, water and ions were removed to obtain the equilibrated structure of the protein in the membrane. The resulting two equilibrated membrane bilayers and protein systems were then positioned apart along the bilayer normal with the minimum desired distance between the opposed membranes. The entire system was then re-solvated with 0.15 M NaCl solution. To maintain the water density in the inter-bilayer space, we implemented an equilibration protocol in which a 2 nm diameter pore was temporarily created in one of the bilayers to allow the passage of water and ions from the intermembrane space to outside of membrane and vice versa. During this process, lipid tails were restrained to stay away from the pore using a flat-bottom restraint potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>. The pore was then gradually filled through further equilibration steps by reducing both the diameter and the force constant for the flat bottom restraint, resulting in a stable configuration for production runs.

For protein-protein minimum distances, all beads of two proteins were considered, while for membranes, only the phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub>) beads of lipids in both inner and outer nuclear membrane were considered for calculation. The distribution of inner-outer nuclear membrane distances was derived from replica-averaged distance profiles.
