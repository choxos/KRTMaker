Controlling the porous structure of soft materials to create micro-sized pores that enable cell migration is crucial for tissue development and regeneration. This work presents liquid-core soft compartments formed via interfacial polyelectrolyte complexation between alginate and ε-poly-<sub>L</sub>-lysine, which membrane physical properties are tailored by adjusting the composition of the prototypical aqueous two-phase system. The additional interfacial dynamics provided by the presence of the immiscible polymer phases promoted the organization of porous architectures in the membrane. Fiber-shaped tubular structures enable adhesion and migration of mesenchymal stem cells to surrounding fibrin matrices and its invasion, behavior that was significantly improved in conditions of higher membrane porosity.

Most conventional approaches rely on sacrificial templates, or porogens such as polymeric microparticles, that need subsequential removal to create void spaces in the solidified material.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]</sup> Also, freeze-drying<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]</sup> and cryogelation<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]</sup> methods are associated with either a reduction of the material’s density and consequent mechanical integrity, or limited control over pore uniformity. Alternatively, techniques such as bioprinting<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]</sup>, photolitography<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]</sup> and laser ablation<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]</sup> offer the possibility to generate pores, holes or channels with better resolution; however, these methods are often time-consuming and/or require specialized equipment as well as qualified people. Liquid-liquid phase separation in polymeric systems has become a simpler strategy to generate porous hydrogels with diverse morphologies showing improved cell stretching and migration capacity.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]</sup> While these techniques are predominantly used in bulk soft materials produced in continuous environments, the potential to tailor porosity specifically at interfaces has received limited attention.</p><p id="P3">In recent decades, the organization of macromolecules at interfaces has enabling developing chemically tailored surfaces and confining materials with wide interest. Assemblies and physical interactions can be promoted at solid-liquid interfaces, for example, by the sequential deposition of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (PEs) on solid templates<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]</sup>, or at liquid-liquid interfaces of miscible<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]</sup> or immiscible phases<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]</sup>. In fact, when two solutions of oppositely charged PEs are placed side-by-side, a soft membrane derived from the electrostatic interaction and complexation between the PEs is formed following the solution interface.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]</sup> Additionally, when two immiscible liquids come into contact, interfacial tension arises to minimize the system’s free energy and maintain phase separation. If antagonistic charged PEs are introduced into the immiscible phases separately, they will spontaneously interact at the interface of two liquids.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]</sup> Thus, in this case, two distinct interfaces and phase separation processes can be identified: one arising from the interaction between the PEs, and another resulting from the immiscibility of the two phases. Introducing a two-phase interface into the process may provide different driving forces for molecular interaction and assembly, enabling the possibility of manipulating the structure and architecture of the fabricated interfacial material.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]</sup> Typically oil/water interfaces are used, but due to concerns over potential toxicity and the challenges of washing away oils or organic solvents, aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) have gained attention as a biocompatible alternative for biomaterial production.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]</sup> Soft membranes formed through PE complexation at all-aqueous interfaces, taking the form of spherical capsules or flexible tubular fibers, exhibit diverse features and functionalities interesting for a wide range of applications in the biomedical field, including the encapsulation and compartmentalization of biological cargo<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]</sup>, the development of delivery vehicles<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]</sup>, and the creation of reaction platforms<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]</sup>. In such cases, membrane permeability plays a crucial role in the regulation of molecules, materials or biological substances that can cross the membrane, which in turn is influenced not only by factors such as pressure differences, and the dimensions and surface characteristics of the membrane, but also its porosity.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]</sup></p><p id="P4">Here, we report a porogen-free and single-step method to increase the porosity of interfacial PE membranes, by adjusting the composition of the most classical prototypical polyethylene glycol (PEG)/dextran ATPS used to support the formation of tubular liquid-core fibers. In cell-laden membranous materials produced through all-aqueous interfacial complexation, cells are usually kept inside the designated compartment to promote self-assembly into microtissue aggregates<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]</sup>, or to encapsulate single cells<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]</sup>. Alternatively, the membrane can act as a scaffold for cell adhesion, by incorporating cell-adhesive moieties or imparting a filamentous structure.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]</sup> While these approaches show promise for organoid engineering or the development of tissue biomimetic models, the potential for highly porous aqueous compartments to promote the invasion of encapsulated cells into surrounding matrices remains unexplored. This could be relevant for biomedicine and tissue engineering fields given the critical role of cell migration and invasion in various biological processes including angiogenesis, wound healing and tissue regeneration.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]</sup></p><p id="P5">In this study, the interaction and complexation process between natural PEs, namely ε-poly-<sub>L</sub>-lysine and alginate, is observed to be influenced by the composition of the aqueous immiscible phases, thereby resulting in the spontaneous formation of distinct micro-structural porous features at the interfacial membrane. Interestingly, the overall macrostructure and mechanical integrity of the fiber structures remains unaffected by the enhanced microporosity of the membrane; and in fact, it improves their structural robustness. These properties are preserved independently of construct’s size and geometry, and demonstrate significant effects in the capacity to promote the migration of encapsulated mesenchymal stem cells and invasion of surrounding fibrin hydrogels. The developed method offers a simple and effective approach to modulate the morphological features of all-aqueous interfacial membranes, with potential applications in tissue engineering and regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><label>2</label><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Fabrication of tubular fibers with different membrane porosity</title><p id="P6">Aqueous solutions of PEG (MW 8 kDa) and dextran (DEX, MW 450–650 kDa) were used as a prototypical ATPS to create a water/water interface, that control the interaction of oppositely charged PEs, each distributed separately in one of the phases, as previously reported.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]</sup> Alginate (ALG, MW 100-200 kDa) and ε-poly-<sub>L</sub>-lysine (EPL, MW 4.7 kDa) in the dispensing and bath phase, respectively, diffuse and interact electrostatically at the interface of the solutions to form a coacervate-like membrane. The formation of easy to handle and macroscopically surface-homogeneous tubular fiber-shaped materials was achieved by depositing a DEX + ALG solution in a PEG + EPL bath phase, and applying continuous displacement of either the dispensing or matrix setups (Schematic representation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Appropriate concentrations of both phase-forming or charged polymers were used considering previous optimized formulations that enabled the formation of physiologically stable and cytocompatible structures, namely, PEG 17 wt%, DEX 15 wt%, ALG 2 wt% and EPL 0.75 wt%.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]</sup> After 2 minutes of complexation, the interface of the ATPS precursor is disrupted by performing minor washing steps, and structures are retrieved to a physiological saline medium.</p><p id="P7">In here, we carefully studied the possibility of tailoring the porosity of the interfacial membrane within the same system, by adjusting the concentrations of PEG and DEX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>, Supporting Information). While decreasing PEG concentration from 17 wt% to 2-8 wt% induced the formation of microscopic porous-like morphological features in the membrane, adjusting the DEX concentration did not produce such visible effects. Besides concentration, polymer molecular weight also strongly influences the density and viscosity of the solutions.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]</sup> Due to the significant differences in molecular weight between the polymers (PEG vs. DEX), and the viscosity-driven effect of dissolved alginate, the dispensing solution exhibits higher density and viscosity compared to the bath phase. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of altering the properties of the prototypical dispensing phase, by using DEX with different molecular weights (MWs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>, Supporting Information). Reducing the MW to 75 and 6 kDa resulted in interfacial fiber membranes with very distinct morphological characteristics. When using polymers with MW of the same order of magnitude, namely PEG 8 kDa and DEX 6 kDa, the membrane is poorly porous both before and after washing, while the use of DEX 75 kDa produced membranes with branched complexes with an organized interspacing after washing. Moreover, in the tested conditions, the reduction of the PEG concentration continued to induce the generation of more interspaced complex networks in the interfacial membrane, although after the washing steps this was more evident with the original 450-650 kDa DEX. This suggests that a large difference between the MW of the phase-forming polymers is necessary to cause a significant effect on the membrane porosity of the studied system. Although manipulating the properties of the prototypical ATPS shows potential for controlling membrane characteristics, it is important to consider its impact on the processing and handling of the resulting tubular fibers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>, Supporting Information). Very low polymer concentrations primarily hindered fiber processing due to decreased bath viscosity or density of the dispensing phase, while lower DEX MW led to fibers with reduced handling quality.</p><p id="P8">To determine whether a specific ATPS polymer plays a key role in forming interfacial tubular membranes with enhanced porosity, we empirically investigated the impact of removing each polymer from the process. Similar morphologies were visualized after the complete removal of PEG from the bath phase, although the membrane is less openly porous (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>, Supporting Information). Moreover, tubular membranes formed with a dispensing phase containing only ALG (without DEX), exhibited a more homogeneous and less dense structure. Both these observations highlight an essential role of the DEX phase in generating the pore-like microstructural changes in the membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>, Supporting Information). However, only when both the polymer phases are present, the global porosity of the membrane is significantly affected. In membranes formed in conditions where both of the polymers are absent, very dense interfacial coacervates with no structural organization are formed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>, Supporting Information).</p><p id="P9">Since the concentration of PEG played a crucial role in achieving desirable membrane porous features, we selected three formulations in which only the PEG concentration varied, namely 17 wt% (used as control), 12 wt% and 8 wt%, to conduct a more detailed study and characterize membrane porosity. Macroscopically all fiber structures are similar with no evidence of increased porosity in the membrane, but microscopic observations revealed pore-like heterogeneities in the membrane as the concentration of PEG decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The gradual increase in opacity (measured by the mean gray value) with time correlates with the timely diffusion and continuous interaction of the PEs, thereby generating fiber structures with increased membrane thickness and robustness.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]</sup> Capito and colleagues demonstrated that the complexation between large and small oppositely charged molecules resulted in interfacial membranes that grow in a highly ordered architecture, given the osmotic pressure imbalance that influenced the diffusion of the PEs and their self-assembly process.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]</sup> In here, the process of membrane growth is believed to be similar considering the different affinity of the PEs to the ATPS polymer phases. Previous studies on PEs partition coefficient revealed that while ALG strongly prefers the DEX phase, EPL distributes between both aqueous phases, with a higher affinity for the inner DEX phase, opposite from where it is originally dissolved in the process of fiber formation.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]</sup> This suggested that EPL diffusion is the primary factor driving membrane formation, and resulted in an inward growth of the membrane at extended complexation times. The higher degree of opacity in fibers produced using PEG at 8% right after 5 minutes of complexation, indicates an accelerated and favored PE interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). After 30 minutes, differences in the gray value demonstrate the effect of decreasing the PEG concentration, leading to progressively darker membranes. Since less viscous environments facilitate molecular diffusion, a greater number of polyions are expected to interact due to the faster and freer movement of EPL chains towards the interface at reduced polymer concentrations.</p><p id="P10">Upon washing with PBS, a clear swelling of the fibers was observed due to osmotic effects caused by the disruption of the prototypical interface.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]</sup> This swelling was evaluated as a function of time, considering the external diameter variation during volumetric fiber expansion. While in PEG 17% formulation, a gradual increase in swelling ratio is observed over time, 12% fibers exhibited less expansion, with minimal swelling in fibers produced with 8% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, the time required to reach equilibrium decreased from 40 to 20 minutes due to the lower PEG concentration. This demonstrates an enhanced mechanical robustness of the membrane in PEG 8% formulation, allowing it to better withstand water-swelling effects and maintain its structural dimensions over time. This behavior could be explained by the accelerated complexation, and an apparent densification of the interfacial membrane. Nevertheless, interestingly, the dry weight of fibers of 0.5 cm length was estimated at around 50 μg consistently across all three conditions, with no significant statistical differences observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To characterize the morphological properties of the membranes, we labeled the fibers with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and examined them across the membrane thickness using confocal fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). The thickness, determined from orthogonal projections, slightly increased from ~14 μm to a maximum of ~22 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). However, given the higher porous nature of the 12% and 8% membranes, we determined a minimum thickness of approximately 6 μm in the pore regions. The membrane porosity significantly increased from approximately 6% to 28% as the PEG concentration decreases from 17% to 8%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). Regarding the size of the pores, we mostly consider their area given their irregular shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). Membranes produced in baths of variable PEG concentration have a mean pore size of 9.4, 28.5 and 50.9 μm<sup>2</sup>, with average Feret’s diameter of 5.1, 9.4 and 11.8 μm, for the respective 17%, 12% and 8%. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to evaluate the surface characteristics of the outer (facing the external environment) and inner (facing the lumen of the tubular fibers) parts of the membranes. SEM micrographs indicate that the porous morphology is mostly present in the internal surface of the membranes, while the outer surface is more homogeneous, and becomes rougher when PEG concentration is decreasing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>). Moreover, closer images of the pores at PEG 8% indicated an interesting highly filamentous organization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>, Supporting Information). Together, these observations suggest that the pores in the lower concentration formulation are covered by a very thin outer layer that is more amorphous, which is the result from the initial interfacial PE interaction at the early stages of liquid-liquid contact. As the smaller EPL chains (compared to ALG) diffuses towards the inner liquid, the membrane grows and forms an inner thicker filamentous layer that is organized with pore-like heterogeneities, as the result of the electrostatic self-assembly and a possible structural rearrangement in the presence of the immiscible components. Moreover, time-lapse videos of the z-stacks of PEG 8% membranes, reveal a noticeable increase in pore size throughout the membrane thickness from the outer region to the inner lumen, indicating an additional heterogeneity and hierarchy through the z axis of the membrane structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video S1 and Figure S5B,C</xref>, Supporting Information). This asymmetry aligns with the observations of Baig <italic>et al</italic>. <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]</sup>, and can be attributed to the dynamic complexation process in which the rate of EPL entry varies during membrane formation.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]</sup></p><p id="P12">To explore the versatility of the purposed method, we investigated the effect of other parameters, such as complexation time and the size and geometry of the final compartment, on the porosity of the membrane, while maintaining PEG at 8%. Higher complexation times produced membranes with lower pore sizes, with mean values of 40.3 μm<sup>2</sup> and 26 μm<sup>2</sup> for 15 and 30 minutes of complexation, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). On the other hand, membrane porosity is maintained, showing a slight increase, across liquid-core fibers with diameters ranging from 0.47 to 2 mm, produced with needles of 27 to 20 gauge, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). Additionally, we observed very similar porous structures in spherical-shaped membranes, of both small and large sizes, with diameters of 0.8 mm and 5 mm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). In general, the results show a tendency for decreasing porosity and pore size with the radial dimension of structures, whether they are fibers or spheres. The pore size decreased to mean values of approximately 40 μm<sup>2</sup> for the smallest structures compared to values within the range of 90 to 100 μm<sup>2</sup> for the larger ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2.2</label><title>Cell-mediated liquid-core fiber deformation</title><p id="P13">The potential effect of the membrane’s porous morphology on cell behavior was assessed by directly mixing human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs) in the dispensing phase, that also contained ALG functionalized with the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid sequence (ALG-RGD) to promote cell adhesion to the membrane. This phase was dispensed in bath solutions containing PEG 17% and 8% as the control and more porous conditions, respectively. After producing the cell-laden fibers, they were washed, transferred to cell culture medium and cultured for 7 days, for subsequent viability analysis. Live/dead assay revealed that reducing PEG concentration didn’t affect cell viability, with cells remaining highly viable in both conditions along the culture period, indicating the cytocompatibility of the method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). At day 1 there is an apparent less aggregation of the cells in the PEG 8% membranes. This tendency was also visualized in mouse endothelial cell line, but throughout the 7-day culture period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>, Supporting Information). GFP-expressing C166 cells were more uniform distributed within the fibers of PEG 8% formulation, while they formed larger aggregates in the control condition. This suggests that the characteristics of the porous structure of the interfacial membrane may distinctively affect the distribution patterns of different cell types within the compartment. The hASCs started to adhere right after 1 day and maintained a spread morphology along the 7 days, while they continuously proliferate inside the fiber structure with no statistical differences on cell metabolic activity between conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P14">During cell culture, we observed that cells were folding the membrane, causing a macroscopic deformation of the fiber structures. The ability of human MSCs to fold materials was previously observed in soft fibrous hydrogels and thin films, leading to the formation of dynamic constructs with spontaneous deformation or the development of spheroidal structures with minimized necrotic core formation.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]</sup> Fiber deformation was assessed by the reduction of the fiber area throughout 10 days of culture, determined from optical microscope images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). A significant decrease in fiber area occurred in the PEG 17% condition after 7 and 10 days, with fibers contracting down to ~75% of their original area at day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). This behavior was not observed in the morphologically more porous fibers produced with the PEG 8% bath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition, a tendency for them to undergo bending into more favorable geometries was observed in most cases, mainly due to gravity-driven effects that promoted an increased cell density at specific regions of the fiber compartment, gradually forming more curved structures over time. By measuring the bending angle, which corresponds to the vertex angle at the center of each fiber<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]</sup>, there was evidence of a stronger bending deformation in PEG 17% fibers after 7 days, compared to the PEG 8% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). These findings support the increased robustness of membranes in the PEG 8% formulation, making them more resistant to deformation. The contractile forces of hASCs were believed to be the main driving factor for this behavior. Cell contractility is mediated by the aggregation of the motor protein myosin II, and its interaction with overlapping actin filaments, leading to cytoskeletal tension.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]</sup> As such, we evaluated the effects of suppressing contraction using an inhibitor of myosin II – blebbistatin – which was previously shown to promote a distinct cytoskeleton organization with thinner filaments in hASCs, hampering their adhesion capacity.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]</sup> The treatment of cell-laden fibers with blebbistatin at day 3 prevented membrane folding and fiber deformation, with no reduction on fiber area after 7 days of culture, in both conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8A,B</xref>, Supporting Information). Additionally, treating 7-day deformed fibers resulted in slight de-folding behavior after 1 day with a small increase in the bending angle although not statistically significant, and further maintenance of fiber geometry over 7 days, in both conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8A,C</xref>, Supporting Information). Altogether, these results indicate the distinct ability of the soft compartment to enable adhered cells to plastically deform the membrane through contraction resulting in interesting fiber geometries, that are totally dependent on the cell’s behavior and membrane properties.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.3</label><title>Cell migration from fiber compartments to surrounding matrices</title><p id="P15">Cell migration in a material depends on cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, where specific biochemical and biophysical cues, such as growth factor signaling and material porosity, respectively, play a major role in stimulating/guiding cell motility across the material. Several studies have been conducted to assess the material’s ability to support cell migration, primarily by embedding spheroids and analyzing cell outgrowth<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]</sup>, ones reporting the effectiveness of highly porous hydrogels to potentiate cell migration.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]</sup> In here, we hypothesize that the higher porosity and pore size of the PEG 8% membranes may enhance the ability of encapsulated and adhered cells to migrate from the fiber membrane to a surrounding matrix, compared to the less porous and uniformly thick PEG 17% membranes. To explore this hypothesis, cell-laden fibers in which cells were left to adhere to the different membranes for 4 days, were embedded within fibrin hydrogels as schematically represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>. Fibrin is a natural protein formed during blood clotting, through the enzymatic cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin, leading to the polymerization of insoluble fibrin monomers into a three-dimensional network.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]</sup> Fibrin hydrogels have been widely used in cell migration assays due to their biomimetic properties, closely resembling the extracellular matrix.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]</sup> They support cell adhesion, remodeling, and proteolytic degradation, effectively replicating physiological migration in wound healing and tissue regeneration.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]</sup></p><p id="P16">After embedding, live/dead assay revealed a tendency of compartmentalized cells to migrate towards the fibrin hydrogel in both conditions, with more cells present outside near the fiber in the PEG 8% condition along the 10 days culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Cells appear to mostly migrate the fiber’s membrane as single and occasional units, therefore we use optical microscopy to keep track on the number of cells that were in close proximity to the fiber membrane and spreading to the surrounding fibrin hydrogel as an indicator of their migration out of the fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). For that, we considered only the cells along the fiber length, excluding those exiting from the ends, as these regions are more prone to experimental artifacts due to the cutting process used to produce straight fibers with identical lengths. After 1 and 3 days, very few cells were observed outside the fiber-shaped compartments in both conditions. However, by day 5, a clear difference between conditions became evident, with a significantly higher number of cells in the outer region near the PEG 8% membranes – a trend that persisted throughout the 10-day culture period. Moreover, the invasion area occupied by cells in the hydrogel at the end of the assay is significantly higher in the PEG 8% condition compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Together, the results indicate the ability of the explored method of manipulating interfacial membrane’s porosity in order to facilitate the migration of compartmentalized cells into surrounding tissue-like materials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">PE complexation is a multistep process that involves an initial nucleation phase where charged groups of the polymer chains interact electrostatically displacing counter ions and water molecules, leading to further growth and organization into insoluble solid-like coacervates as water is expelled into the surrounding solution and the complex becomes denser and stable.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]</sup> The process of PE complexation and its resultant material and structure are dependent on several factors relating to the PEs itself such as their charge density, molecular weight (MW), their intermolecular interaction, and also the solvent environment.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]</sup> Recently, Liu and Tong observed the formation of interfacial complexes with a porous structure from the interaction between high MW hyaluronic acid and synthetic poly-diallyldimethylammonium (PDADMAC), while the complexation with lysine-based peptide amphiphiles led to membranes with a well-condensed non-porous structure.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]</sup> On the other hand, Tang <italic>et al</italic>. reported the formation of porous membranes which are formed by spontaneous water-on-water spreading and simultaneous complexation of oppositely charged synthetic PEs.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]</sup> The formation of such porous structures is consistent with membranes produced via non-solvent-induced or aqueous PE phase separation methods, which occur through solvent exchange and polymer precipitation, or pH-dependent charge transition behavior, respectively. <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]</sup> However, with pore sizes ranging from nanometers to just a few micrometers, these membranes are particularly well-suited for filtration applications. In here, the porous structure of membranes is affected, whether they are produced with or without the prototypical ATPS phases. Liquid-core fiber membranes produced by the complexation of EPL and ALG in an ATPS-free environment, present an increased fiber opacity suggesting a faster achievement of compact structures, and consequently show a more condensed (non-porous) membrane structure. On the other hand, porous interfacial PE membranes are created in the presence of the aqueous PEG and DEX phases. These immiscible polymer phases allow for the regulation of PE diffusion and their complexation at the interface, enabling the formation of membranes with diverse morphologies. We explore the ability of tailoring the physical properties of the resultant membranous material, by adjusting the composition of the phases involved in the PE interfacial complexation. It is well established that molecule diffusion is facilitated in low viscous environments, and that reduced ATPS polymer concentration produces solutions with lower viscosity.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]</sup> The interaction between the PEs occurs more quickly upon the reduction of the concentration of PEG in the bath phase, due to facilitated diffusion of the EPL molecules towards the interface of the system. In fact, fibers produced in lower PEG concentration present enhanced mechanical stability, exhibiting lower swelling capacity with minimal dimensional change, and higher resistance to fiber deformation under the contractile forces of encapsulated hASCs. However, this phenomenon is not solely governed by the enhanced diffusion profile, as the estimated dry mass of the fiber membrane remains consistent across both higher and lower PEG concentrations. Instead, the membrane architecture is more openly porous in the lower viscous bath environment. This suggests that distinct molecular re-arrangements and subsequent complex network organization are playing a significant role in the observed phenomenon. The porosity of the interfacial membranes produced in PEG 8% increased 4-fold compared with the previously reported control condition using PEG at 17%. We hypothesize that upon expelling water during complexation, the ALG/EPL complexes may contract into the form of a porous network structure, which likely results in the enhanced properties observed. In PEG 17%, PE complexation remains effective, but during the dehydration step, the higher viscosity likely prevents the re-arrangement of the complexes into such an open network structure.</p><p id="P18">Additionally, PEG and DEX are both non-ionic, highly hydrophilic polymers that can act as macromolecular crowding agents.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]</sup> Their strong affinity for water molecules allows them to retain hydration, while their presence in aqueous solution leads to an excluded volume effect. This effect reduces the effective volume available for other molecules, influencing their diffusion, conformation and possible interactions.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]</sup> Studies using PEG as a crowding agent in complex coacervation, have shown to increase the stability of the coacervate. The role of PEG is mostly associated with a change in the conformation of the PE constituents<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]</sup> as well as the increase in the entropic dehydration driving force for the process, by extracting interstitial water from the coacervate phase without interfering with the surface hydration of the PEs.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]</sup> In this system, decreasing the PEG concentration increases overall water availability and reduces crowding, providing more space and liberty for structural re-arrangements of the complex to occur at the interface. Another notable aspect to consider is the importance of having a more viscous inner phase and high-density contact barrier, provided by the presence of high MW DEX, to enable the generation of structurally organized porous membranes, and more stable and easily handled fiber compartments. Therefore, in general, the additional interfacial dynamics provided by the presence of both immiscible polymer phases during PE complexation at the liquid-liquid interface, was crucial to control the diffusion mechanisms, water structuring and PE interaction, necessary to manipulate the final porosity of the obtained membranes. As a consequence of the increased membrane porosity, cell-laden fibers produced in PEG 8% baths demonstrated higher potential to facilitate the migration of mesenchymal stem cells, adhered to the luminal part of the membrane, to surrounding fibrin matrices and promote its invasion.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="conclusions"><label>4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P19">In summary, we investigate how tuning the composition of immiscible concentrated polymer phases influences PE complexation at all-aqueous liquid interfaces, allowing tailoring the structural properties of the resulting membranes. Independently of the geometry of the processed interfacial material, the method remains effective and can induce different porosity degrees depending on the size of the constructs. Unlike other techniques to induce porosity in soft materials that are not amenable to be processed with encapsulated cells, the possibility to induce membrane porosity during fiber formation by simply adjusting the system composition, facilitates cell seeding of the fiber lumens in a single-step manner. The facilitated migration of mesenchymal stem cells from the highly porous fiber compartments and improved invasion of surrounding tissue-like matrices demonstrate great potential of the produced materials for tissue engineering and regeneration applications.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><label>5</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Fabrication of tubular fibers</title><p id="P20">Liquid-core fibers were prepared as previously described.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]</sup> Briefly, solutions of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, average MW 8000 Da, Sigma-Aldrich) and dextran (from Leuconostoc spp., MW 450,000 – 650,000 Da, Sigma-Aldrich) of varying concentration were prepared in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, Sigma-Aldrich). Then, the polyelectrolytes (PEs) sodium alginate (from brown algae, MW 120,000-190,000 g/moL, Sigma-Aldrich, 71238) and ε-Poly-L-lysine (EPL, derived from fermentation of Streptomyces albulus PD-1, MW ~ 4700 g/mol, Epolyly®, Handary S.A., 0201) were dissolved separately in the dextran and PEG solutions, respectively. 2 wt% alginate and 0.75 wt% EPL was used. The pH of the PEG+EPL solution was adjusted to ~7.2, after the complete dissolution of EPL. The fibers were formed by dispensing a solution of dextran and alginate using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus) with a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min, in a larger volume bath phase of PEG and EPL. The petri dish containing the bath solution is displaced during extrusion of the dispensing phase, to allow the formation of threads where interfacial PE complexation occurs. The produced structures are segmented using a spatula, to enable the generation of straight fibers with control over their length. After 2 minutes, the complexation is interrupted by removing the bath phase and performing 3 washing cycles with PBS. A 2-minute complexation time was used for the tested conditions, unless otherwise mentioned.

(DEX) and alginate (ALG) in a bath containing polyethylene glycol (PEG) and ε-Poly-<sub>L</sub>-lysine (EPL). Driven by electrostatic complexation between the ALG and EPL, an interfacial membrane is created. The porosity of the interfacial membrane is increased by adjusting the composition of the bath phase, namely, by decreasing the concentration of PEG, which provides a less viscous environment with a higher water content. <bold>B</bold> Representative macroscopic images of fibers in PBS produced in baths with different PEG concentration – 17%, 12% and 8% - as well as brightfield microscopic images. <bold>C</bold> Mean gray value over time of fibers produced in the different baths, indicative of fiber opacity (n = 4 replicate fibers). <bold>D</bold> Swelling ratio determined by external diameter variation over time after washing with PBS (n = 4 replica fibers). <bold>E</bold> Estimated dry weight after lyophilization (n = 8 (12%) or 9 (17%, 8%) replica plastic tubes containing fibers of the same length). <bold>F</bold> Three-dimensional representations of confocal micrographs of the interfacial membranes with hollow liquid cores, as well as closed images to show their porous morphology.
