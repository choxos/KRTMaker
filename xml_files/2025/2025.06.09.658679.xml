Here, we investigated whether mice exhibit fear of predators across four experimental contexts: one in a novel head-fixed condition and three in established, freely moving scenarios. In head-fixed mice, we measured the behavioral outcome and response to a live rat. Mice were water-deprived and habituated to walk on a treadmill that controlled a virtual environment and reward delivery. After meeting performance criteria, baseline data were collected in one session, followed by a test session in which the mice were exposed to a live rat. Despite the presence of the predator, most (5 out of 7) mice continued to forage at baseline levels; however, individual mice showed significant alterations in one or more of the following measures: running speed, pupil size, eye movement, and posture. To assess how behavioral context and physical restraint influence predator responses, we exposed 36 naive, freely moving mice to fear-inducing stimuli — including looming visual cues, rat odor, and a live rat. Even in these conditions, a substantial proportion of mice failed to exhibit classical defensive responses such as avoidance or escape. Notably, when presented with a freely moving rat, only about half of the mice displayed avoidance behavior. Together, these findings suggest that mice do not universally express innate fear behaviors such as avoidance or fleeing, even in ethologically relevant predator encounters. Instead, their responses appear to be context-dependent and variable, challenging common assumptions about automatic defensive reactions in rodents.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>2</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Threat perception and appropriate reaction to a threat are necessary for survival. Incorrect assessment of a sound in a bush, or the strength of a barrier holding a vicious animal at bay can on the one hand lead to death or injuries, and on the other hand to anxiety even when there is nothing to fear. Earlier work on threat perception in both animals and human beings has focused on three aspects of threat and behavior: how the brain detects threats, responds to threats, and the conscious feeling of fear that occurs in threatening or dangerous situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Beckers et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Tovote, Fadok, and Lüthi 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Silva, Gross, and Gräff 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">LeDoux and Brown 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Fanselow and Pennington 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mobbs et al. 2019</xref>). These aspects of threat perception and the response to threats have most often been studied using Pavlovian conditioning, in which an innocuous stimulus, usually a sound cue is paired with an unpleasant noxious stimulus like an electric shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mowrer and Lamoreaux 1946</xref>). Over time the innocuous stimulus elicited the same behavioral defensive responses -- freezing, fleeing, changes in posture -- as the noxious stimulus and physiology, i.e. changes in pupil size and increases in heartbeat rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Blanchard and Blanchard 1989</xref>). The advantage of this class of paradigms is that investigators have control over the causal conditions -- the stimulus -- and can measure the effect of stimuli on behavior. These approaches have been successful in elucidating the brain circuits involved in threat perception and those involved in generating the behavioral response to the threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Phillips and LeDoux 1992</xref>; review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Tovote, Fadok, and Lüthi 2015</xref>). In recent years, a plethora of other paradigms have been developed using a variety of stimuli for inducing fear. Looming stimuli -- where a shadow grows above a rat or mouse, simulating a bird of prey readying to pounce -- can be threatening to rodents: they run, hide or freeze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Schiff 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Yilmaz and Meister 2013</xref>). Noxious odors -- fox or cat urine -- or loud sounds, heights, or larger rodents have also been used to elicit fear by introducing a "natural" threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gibson and Walk 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mongeau et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Farmer-Dougan et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Silva, Gross, and Gräff 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Our goal in this study was to design a head-fixed mouse preparation for prey-and-potential-predator interaction and test the outcome of this work against existing paradigms. In the head-fixed preparation we examined whether the need to forage for food affects the expression of fear. Earlier work suggested that rats prey on mice, and that mice are innately afraid of rats, i.e. that the presence of a rat elicits defensive behaviors in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Karli 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Panksepp 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Blanchard et al. 1998</xref>). Here we assessed whether head-fixed mice showed evidence of fear and changed their behavior, whether they continued foraging even in the presence of the rat. In our paradigm, mice ran on a treadmill to obtain a water reward and decided between "foraging" i.e. licking for reward, while faced with a threat, a living rat hovering over the lick tube. Surprisingly, even though mice showed some expression of fear in the presence of a rat, most head-fixed mice continued foraging even in the presence of the rat. During the interaction, all manners of sensory cues were available to mice -- mice could almost touch the rat, could smell, see and hear the rat moving and still most mice continued foraging. Even more surprisingly, when we used established standard paradigms designed for freely moving mice i.e. exposing mice to looming stimuli -- in the form of a rapidly expanding black disk designed to mimic the shadow of an approaching predator -- rat odors, or live rats, mice did not consistently show defensive fear behavior.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods | materials"><label>3</label><title>Methods and Materials</title><p id="P4">All experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of animal welfare of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin and the local authorities, the ’Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales’. Mice (n=43, 6-7 weeks old at start of experiments) on a C57BL / J6 background sourced from various breeding facilities and 5 rats were used in this study. For experiments involving head fixation, seven mice (4 male, 3 female) were sourced from the internal breeding facilities. In the following plots the male mice are enumerated as mouse 1-4, and the female mice as mouse 5-7. Because the primary outcome of this experiment, the blunted avoidance response to the presence of the live rat, was independent of the sex of the mice (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2-7</xref>), for experiments with freely moving mice, male mice were sourced from in-house breeding colony, Janvier, or Charles River. Mice were housed socially with at least one other littermate. Animals were housed in a reversed 12-hour day / night cycle. Five female Wistar rats served as the predator stimulus and were kept in the same facility as the mice, but in another room. The mice and rats were kept in a 12h light cycle (mice 6am to 6pm, rats 5am to 5pm) and had ad lib access to food and water.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Surgical procedures for head-fixation</title><p id="P5">On the day of the surgery, adult C57Bl6 mice (n=7) weighing 20-40 grams were injected with Carprofen (5 mg/kg) intraperitonially pre-surgery, then deeply anesthetized with a mixture of Ketamine and Xylazine (Ketamine 12.5mg/ml, Xylazine 1 mg/ml, 10 μl/g dose) and placed on a heating pad maintained at 37°C. A local analgesic, Lidocaine (100 μl), was injected under the skin at the site of the incision. Lightweight aluminum headposts -- 3 cm long, 2mm thick, weighing 0.4 gm -- were affixed to the skull using Rely X and Jet Acrylic (Ortho-Jet) black cement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Ebner et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dominiak et al. 2019</xref>). Post-surgery analgesia was provided over 3 days, with Carprofen injections (5 mg/kg) intraperitonially and, if there were signs of post-operative pain, Buprenorphine (0.05-0.1 mg/kg) subcutaneously in addition.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Simulated foraging experiment</title><p id="P6">The simulated foraging environment consisted of a rigid-foam-based circular treadmill and a 30 cm long plexiglass tube with a 7 cm diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 1</xref>). The treadmill was lightweight enough that mice could move it effortlessly. It had a rubberized surface to increase the grip of the mouse on the wheel. The movement of the treadmill was read by an encoder. The output of the encoder was used to control the position of the plexiglass tube, which was mounted on a rail and controlled by a small stepper motor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). To ensure safe and stable movement, and to minimize the stress on a rat held in the tube, the top speed of the tube was limited to 4 cm per second. The output of the encoder was also linked to the PC that controlled two large monitors positioned on each side of the treadmill that were used to stream visual stimuli tethered to the movement of the treadmill.</p><p id="P7">The tube holding the rat was coated with a red film limiting the ability of mice to see the position of the rat, or to see whether there was a rat in the tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Additionally, the front of the tube was covered with a disk which could be rotated by an electronic input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). When a rat was in the tube, the disk could be used to selectively hide or show the rat during the simulated predator encounter. The disk could be rotated to allow odors through, or to block all sensory stimuli from inside the tube. When the disk was in the open position, the rat could stick its nose out of the tube and almost touch the mouse when it was at the lick spout.</p><sec id="S5"><title>Electronics and control of behavior</title><p id="P8">A finite state machine (Bpod r2, Sanworks LLC) monitored trial states, and the sequence of reward delivery and data acquisition. This state machine also controlled the high-resolution acquisition of movement traces from the encoder in the treadmill and triggered the cameras (recording at 100Hz) (Error! Reference source not found.). In addition to the state machine, a single-board PC (Raspberry Pi 4 by Raspberry Pi Foundation) was used for real-time control. The 1kHz output from the Bpod was down sampled to 25 Hz, then transferred to a microcontroller (Arduino Nano by Arduino.cc) which controlled stepper motors to translate this into motion of the plexiglass tube. If the mouse moved the treadmill faster than 4 cm / s then the output of the encoder was truncated to ensure that the tube followed smoothly. Note that the treadmill moved as fast as the mice needed; but if the treadmill moved at a high speed, the output was translated into a manageable speed for moving the lick spout, and the associated large tube that could contain a living rat.</p><p id="P9">The position of the disk at the front of the tube was also controlled by the single-board PC and microcontroller (Arduino Nano by Arduino.cc) and updated by stepper motors that rotated the disk. Finally, the single-board PC was used to generate the virtual visual environment tethered to the movement of treadmill.</p><p id="P10">The monitors used for displaying the streaming stimuli were also used as a go-cue at the beginning of the trial and an end-cue at the end. The streaming stimuli consisted of symbols that moved in synchrony with the treadmill. The screen flashed green at the start of a new trial and red at the end of a failed trial.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Habituation and training</title><p id="P11">After surgical operation to implant a head post, mice were habituated to being handled and head-fixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). Training on the treadmill began, once mice tolerated head fixation for ~ 20 minutes. At this point, water intake for mice was monitored and restricted, but ensured to be at a level resulting in no more than 20% of weight loss per mouse compared to the weight before onset of water control. To ensure that all mice were available on the same experimental day when a rat was introduced, training continued for 3-4 weeks.</p><p id="P12">The initial training consisted of rewarding mice manually with Saccharose-sweetened water when they were head-fixed and they moved the treadmill in the correct / forward direction. Once mice moved the treadmill in the correct direction, training was automated. In the first days, there were no time constraints. Mice simply had to move at least 28.5 cm forward on the treadmill to receive the sweetened water reward. Five to seven seconds after reward delivery, the lickspout / tube contraption automatically moved to its starting position, away from the mouse and the next trial began. The beginning of a new trial was indicated by a sound cue (played by a buzzer at 50Hz) and flashing of the virtual reality screens.</p><p id="P13">In the next phase of training, a time limit was introduced. Mice had 30 seconds to move the treadmill at least 28.5 cm. Once mice learned to keep moving the treadmill to obtain a reward, the duration of the trial was shortened to 12 seconds. When a cohort of mice achieved &gt;65% successful trials under these conditions for 3 days, the control and experimental data were collected.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Live predator encounter</title><p id="P14">Once baseline control data had been collected on the next day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-F</xref>), a rat that had been habituated to handling and to the apparatus, was placed in the tube. The mouse was then head-fixed to the treadmill and experimental data were collected. The day after the encounter with the rat, a second day of baseline data was collected without the rat.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Experimental paradigm with freely moving mice</title><p id="P15">One cohort of twelve male C57Bl6/J mice and a second cohort of twenty-four male C57Bl6/J mice were used in these experiments. Mice were ordered from the in-house breeding colony, Janvier, or Charles River. For the first cohort the 3 female Wistar-rats as in the simulated foraging task were used, and for the second cohort 2 additional female Wistar-rats were used. Female rats were used to minimize the possibility of a rat biting through the holder or injuring a mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Karli 1956</xref>). We chose to use animals from multiple sources to verify whether mice obtained from our in-house colony showed unusually low threat responses.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Looming stimuli</title><p id="P16">To evaluate innate threat responses independent of the presence of a live predator, we applied the well-established looming stimulus paradigm. This paradigm is a standard for inducing fear in mice. The mice were solitary housed and habituated to changes in day-night-cycle for 5 days, then over the next four days, one mouse per source and day (resulting in 3 mice per day) was placed in a darkened room for an hour before experiments began. The purpose of the solitary housing of these mice was to ensure a minimum of unintended interaction between mice before each recording session. On the experimental day, mice were moved into a plexiglass arena (0.5 m x 0.29 m) and left to explore it for 10 minutes. The arena was cleaned with 15% Ethanol before each mouse was introduced. It contained a shelter, made of red plexiglass. When mice entered a pre-defined zone, a looming stimulus -- a shadow that expanded above the mouse -- was presented. The looming stimulus consisted of 5 presentations of a small black dot (3°visual angle) expanding rapidly over 200ms to its full size (50°) and then remaining at this size for 250 ms. The stimulus was repeated at least 90 s after the last presentation. The sequence of looming stimuli was repeated 10-14 times for each mouse over 45 minutes. Video data was collected at 60 Hz. Each stimulus presentation was triggered manually by a researcher supervising the experiment through a monitor located out of sight of the mouse, but within the same room as the setup.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Test with Rat odor</title><p id="P17">The mice used in the looming experiments were then used to examine place preference in the presence or absence of rat odors. Over two days two mice from each source, i.e. in-house, Charles River, and Janvier, per day (6 mice per day) were moved into the plexiglass arena one at a time. The arena was split in half with a small connector between the two sides. Mice were left to explore both sides of the arena for 10 minutes. Then the mouse was removed, and a rat was brought into the arena, but could only explore one side of the arena. The rat was removed after 5 minutes, and the mouse was returned to the arena. Movement of the mouse in the two conditions was tracked offline with video acquired at 60Hz for the first cohort and 25Hz for the second cohort. The arena was cleaned before each mouse was introduced into the arena.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Assaying response to live rat</title><p id="P18">Finally, the same mice were placed in a modified version of the plexiglass arena (again 2 mice per group per day). The arena was divided in half by a 1mm thick metal mesh, with gaps that were just large enough for mice or rats to stick the tips of their noses through the mesh. Control data was acquired for five minutes, then mice were removed, and a rat was brought into the arena. Two minutes after introducing the rat, mice were introduced into the other side of the arena. Movement of the mouse was tracked offline with video acquired at 25-60Hz. The arena was cleaned before each mouse was introduced into the arena.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Behavioral analysis</title><sec id="S13"><title>Simulated foraging with a live rat encounter predator encounter</title><p id="P19">Behavioral measures including overall performance, speed of movement and a variety of movement parameters were tracked using high speed video at 100 Hz, over the course of the 3 days. Analog traces from the treadmill encoder, and the movement sequences of the mice were captured on two Basler cameras, one aimed at the body, and one aimed at the face. Movement and posture of the mice was tracked using DeepLabCut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mathis et al. 2018</xref>). Behavioral phenotypes that were available for analysis in the control condition and in the presence of the rat included: 1) Flight, apparent as a backward movement on the treadmill. This movement pushed the tube holding the rat away from the mouse and showed up as negative deflection in the encoder output and leads to a failure in licking. 2) Freezing, i.e. the mouse stops moving, which would be apparent in the speed traces and lead to a failure of the trial. 3) Changes in mouse posture, hunching or stretching. 4) Changes in pupil size. 5) Changes in nose movement.</p><p id="P20">We performed the experiments in such a way that we were able to pair the behavioral phenotype of each mouse on the first recording day (before a rat was introduced) as a baseline to all further recordings of the same mouse.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Assaying threat response in freely moving mice</title><p id="P21">One of the three assays -- the looming stimuli -- was dependent on vision, two of them had olfactory components. In these experiments —looming, rat odor avoidance, and live rat exposure— the position of the mice was tracked using SLEAP (version 1.3.3). Three key body points were annotated along the midline of each mouse. For positional tracking, the pixel coordinates of the neck point were extracted and transformed into millimeter-based coordinates relative to the layout of each experimental arena. To reduce noise, positional data were clipped to the arena boundaries and smoothed using a sliding half-second window. Due to the side-view recording setup in the looming experiment (necessitated by an overhead screen), additional geometric corrections were applied. The X-coordinate was taken directly from the neck point, while the Y-coordinate was defined as the lowest Y-value among the three tracked points. An empirical downward shift of 20 pixels was then applied to the Y-coordinate. The adjusted coordinates were subsequently clipped to the nearest point within the arena polygon visible in each frame. After these corrections the pixel-based position converted to millimeter-scale coordinates.</p><p id="P22">Because the perspective of the looming videos enforced a strong correlation between the X- and Y-position, only the X-position of the mouse relative to the shelter was used for further analysis. The absolute X-axis speed (relative to the shelter) was smoothed with an 11-frame window before being used to classify looms as either "fleeing" or "non-fleeing" events.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="S16"><title>Simulated foraging with live a rat</title><p id="P23">Here we first assayed mouse behavior for evidence of innate fear -- i.e. freezing, fleeing, -- which would be evident in performance. This study was also designed to capture subtle changes in the behavior of mice -- speed of movement as mice approach rats, success rate, pupil size, body elongation nose movement -- in the presence of rats. To assay these changes in behavior, the data related to each behavioral feature (pupil size, speed of movement, nose movement, etc.) were first filtered with a rolling z-score across a one second window. Values with an absolute score above three were removed. The time series data was then smoothed with a half second window by way of a rolling mean.</p><p id="P24">In the case of the video data (DeepLabCut output) it was also necessary to perform initial filtering steps, according to the detected likelihood that a feature was discovered in a frame, and with an initial z-score filtering across the x- and y-position of the features. In statistics where we considered the pupil-diameter and pupil position, we also filtered the eight detected markers around the pupil with a modified z-score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Iglewicz and Hoaglin 1993</xref>).</p><p id="P25">We compared the behavioral items pairwise per mouse, between the day of the baseline recording and the following days. To achieve this, we summarized half-second wide bins relative to the beginning of the trial or the delivery of reward of the timeseries and compared these between the two conditions. These data were plotted to show the mean and standard deviation per feature and condition. Binned data for sessions with and without the rat were compared, and the difference between the mean and standard deviation and the significance of this shift shown as a bar plot.

Once mice were habituated to head restraint and to obtaining reward by moving the treadmill they could perform 50-100 trials in a day, obtaining a total reward of 0.5 ml in a ~30-45-minute session. When mice started a trial, the lickspout was at a starting position ~30 cm from the mouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). A go cue -- the flashing of the virtual reality monitors -- and a sound cue initiated the trial. A successful trial was one in which mice moved the treadmill 28.5cm in 12 seconds, with the last 1.5 cm of movement controlled automatically within the code. Two to four seconds after reward delivery, depending on the start of licking, the lick spout and red tube over it were reset to their starting position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P34">Well trained, motivated mice start running on the tread mill immediately after licking the reward, even before the lick spout moved back to starting position. As mice improved their daily performance, adult female rats were habituated to being handled and to the apparatus. Once a cohort of mice were stable in their performance for 3 successive days -- reaching the threshold criteria in their performance -- the experimental data was collected over 3 consecutive days. On the first day control data was collected, on the second day the rat was introduced into the behavioral paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-C</xref>). The third day was a post-rat control session. To maximize the potential for interaction between the head-fixed mouse and restrained rat, we used only one setting -- open-- on the disk that covered the mouth of the tube holding the rat. Note that in this setting mice could almost touch the rat on each trial and mice could see, smell and hear the rat moving in the tube as it came closer to the mouse. On each trial, with every mouse, rats could stick their nose out of the tube. When rats were in this position, their nose was effectively just above the lickspout for mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Performance</title><p id="P35">Performance of each mouse was analyzed for three consecutive days: control / baseline day, day with the rat, and a post-rat day. Surprisingly, the success rate of most mice (5/7 mice) was unaffected by the introduction of the rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Two mice manifested a significant and dramatic decrease in their performance that persisted into the post-rat day. Next, we examined whether mice changed their behavior when the rat was introduced.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Movement speed on treadmill</title><p id="P36">One measure of performance is the rate of success; another measure was the speed with which mice moved the treadmill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 2</xref>). Mice could run or walk slowly and consistently to cover 28.5 cm in 12 seconds. Most mice learned to move at a consistent speed of around 0.2 m / s. This speed was mostly uniform and on average it stayed constant for most of the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), but the speed decreased abruptly as mice stopped moving to lick the reward spout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P37">One issue that arose in monitoring and comparing the behavior of mice from day to day, was whether the position of the mouse on the treadmill changed across days. It was possible that mice were positioned at slightly different height relative to the treadmill, and this effectively changed the speed with which mice moved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). To examine this, we selected frames from different time points during each session and examined them for any obvious differences in height of the mouse relative to the treadmill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). There were no significant differences in the positioning of mice from day to day.</p><p id="P38">Next, we compared the speed of movement from control sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, green traces) and sessions when the rat was present for individual mice. These data show that while the majority of mice show no consistent significant changes in their movement speed in presence of the potential predator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, blue traces), three out of seven mice showed significant (p&lt;0.01, Mann-Whitney U test; MWU) and consistent changes in their movement speed throughout the session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Their average speed was significantly different at the onset of the trials when the rat was present. The two mice that decreased their movement speed in the presence of the rat were slow on the treadmill from the beginning of the trial. One mouse ran significantly faster in the presence of the rat. In the remaining mice, there were no consistent changes in average speed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2, 3</xref>). Taken together these data suggests that some mice are strongly but differentially affected by the presence of the rat.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Eye movement and pupil diameter</title><p id="P39">To assess whether mice attend to the presence of the rat, we used DeeplabCut to track eye movement and pupil diameter on the control day and on the day that the rat was introduced into the tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 3</xref>). We plotted the average position of the pupil in the horizontal axis relative to the two corners of the eyes, over the course of the control session and in the presence of the rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>). In five out of seven mice, there was a significant (p&lt; 0.01, MWU) change in the horizontal position of the pupil in the presence of the rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, green traces); in the remaining 2 there were no consistent changes in eye position. On average, the position of the eyes of five mice was significantly different (p &lt; 0.01, Mann Whitney U) during their reward phase compared to the control days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). When the rat was present in the tube and the mice were directly in front of the tube, on average, 3 mice positioned their eyes more in the direction of the rat (looked right) and 2 looked away from the rat. These effects were significant and were evident throughout the trial. Two mice showed no significant change in their eye position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, right panels).</p><p id="P40">Next, we examined pupil size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 4</xref>). Pupil size changes with changes in lighting, or changes in parasympathetic or sympathetic system. To establish that light around the face and head of the mouse remained consistent, we measured brightness and light intensity around the eye and at another point on the head. There was no effect on the luminance / light levels around the eyes or head when the rat was introduced.</p><p id="P41">But in the presence of the rat there were significant (p&lt;0.01, MWU) changes in pupil diameter in five out of seven mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>), especially when mice were close to the rat (Blue traces, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).

The other 2 mice showed no significant changes in their pupil diameter.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Posture and facial movements</title><p id="P42">To assess whether any other aspects of mouse posture or facial movement were affected by the presence of the rat, we measured mouse posture -- estimated by body-length -- and facial movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 6, 7</xref>). In three out of seven mice there was a significant change in the pose when the mouse was confronted by the rat (blue). Additionally, in 2 other mice there was a significant increase in nasal movement speed in the presence of the rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 6</xref>).</p><p id="P43">Taken together this work suggests that head-fixed mice forage for reward, they do not flee but a diverse set of behaviors change when they are faced by the rat (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). They move differently on the treadmill; they move their eyes and change their pupil size.</p><p id="P44">Next, we considered whether head fixation, thirst, and the need to forage affected threat perception or the mouses behavioral response to the threat. At the same time, we also assessed whether the mice in our colony were inherently less fearful. To address these issues, we used naive freely moving mice, from our colony and from two other sources.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Effect of looming stimuli</title><p id="P45">In these experiments, we used 36 naive mice, 12 mice were from our animal facility, 12 newly acquired from Charles River, and 12 from Janvier. Overall, it was not possible to determine whether the source of mice made a difference to the results, but mice obtained from our inhouse facility showed very similar behaviors as those obtained from external sources.</p><p id="P46">Mice were placed in an arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A, B</xref>), and when they entered a particular location in the arena, the looming protocol was initiated. A dark shadow enlarged above the mouse, simulating a bird of prey swooping over the mouse. For each mouse, the looming stimulus protocol was repeated 14 times. Post-hoc video analysis showed that none of the mice froze in response to the looming stimulus; seven out of 36 mice ran into the shelter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). The mice that ran into the shelter moved rapidly during the looming stimulus, and we verified the detection of fleeing behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E, F</xref>), the remaining 29 mice did not show any significant and consistent movement toward the shelter. Overall, these results suggest that looming stimuli can reliably evoke fleeing in mice, but this effect is only observed in ~19% of the mice.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Avoidance of rat odors and rat presence</title><p id="P47">Next, we examined whether freely moving mice (n = 36) reacted to rat odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-C</xref>). Mice were placed in an arena with a partition down the middle -- a partition that mice could and did traverse. Five minutes after putting mice in the arena, they were removed from the arena. A rat was introduced on one side of the partition -- a partition that rats could not traverse -- and then removed. The mouse was returned to the arena. Post-hoc analysis of the amount of time spent in each portion of the arena, revealed that mice either preferred the side that had contained the rat (p&lt;0.01, MWU), or showed no clear preference for either side of the arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p id="P48">Next, we used the same arena but closed off the wire mesh partition that separated the arena into two halves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A, B</xref>). Once again naive mice were placed in the arena but were allowed to explore only one half of the arena, then they were removed, and a rat was placed on the right side of the arena. Mice were then returned to the arena. In these experiments, half the mice avoided being close to the wire mesh that separated the rat from the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C-E</xref>). The other half showed either no preference for one side or the other. Three mice preferred staying close to the mesh. These data suggests that mice do not innately display defensive behaviors in the presence of rats.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S29" sec-type="discussion | conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Discussion and conclusion</title><p id="P49">Our work shows that the obvious behavioral expressions of fear -- fight, flight or freezing -- are not easily elicited in laboratory mice. Specifically, the hardwired innate fear of a potential predator is not expressed in our experiment in head-fixed mice "foraging" for a reward. In fact, mice continue to forage even when a rat, the "predator", was in close proximity, within licking distance of the mouse. Furthermore, even when mice were free -- not head-fixed -- and able to move in their environment, looming stimuli did not elicit freezing responses and elicited escape to shelter responses in just a quarter of the mice. Finally, freely moving rats elicited an avoidance response in just half of the freely moving mice. Taken together our data suggests that the idea of an innate stimulus, that elicits a fixed and hardwired behavioral response is likely to be very sensitive to context; it might be learned or be history dependent.</p><p id="P50">Our goal was to reproduce a natural prey and predator encounter in a controlled setting where it is possible to monitor many dimensions of mouse behavior. In our simulated foraging paradigm, the movement of the mouse was digitally tethered to the movement of the reward spout and the tube that could contain the rat toward the mouse. Rats were only introduced into the paradigm for a single session, and only after mice displayed an expert level of understanding of the paradigm that allowed them to obtain a reward.</p><p id="P51">Our results with this paradigm are surprising. Even though the head-fixed mouse and the rat almost touched each other, most mice did not freeze or flee, and did not push the treadmill in the opposite direction to push the rat away, they simply continued to move to the reward spout. None of the mice showed classic defensive responses in the presence of rats. Instead, in the presence of rats, even though mice adjusted aspects of their movement and posture and two out of five mice showed a decrease in performance most continued toward the reward spout. Furthermore, even though most mice changed their behavior when the rat was introduced, the changes in behavior were not uniform. On average in the presence of the rat, mice did not uniformly run faster or slower, they did not hunch up or elongate, nor did they all look in the direction of the rat. Contrary to our expectations that the pupil would dilate, we observed a consistent constriction in pupil size -- a constriction that could not be explained by a change in luminance. Taken together this work suggests that head-fixed mice do not automatically display a set of defensive responses in the presence of a potential predator.</p><p id="P52">To examine whether foraging pressure, head fixation or the nature of our mouse colony could explain our results, we modified our experimental design to assess fear in freely moving mice that had ad lib access to food and water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Verma et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Burnett et al. 2016</xref>). We replicated looming stimulus paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lenzi et al. 2022</xref>), used noxious stimuli, i.e. rat odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Banik and Anand 2011</xref>), presented live rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Karli 1956</xref>) and tested mice from 3 different sources. Surprisingly, looming stimuli elicited a flight response only in ~20% of the of mice; the smell of rats elicited no avoidance response. But the presence of a live rat in an adjacent enclosure generated an avoidance response, even then in only half the mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>).</p><p id="P53">Recent work suggests that the history of individual mice changes how they react to looming stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lenzi et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Wang 2020</xref>). In their work, socially isolated mice were more likely to attempt to escape from the looming stimulus. In our work mice were socially isolated for a few days before the experiments and still few mice showed escape or defensive behaviors. These results are surprising given that we closely followed previously published paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Yilmaz and Meister 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lenzi et al. 2022</xref>) where freezing and fleeing could be elicited. The cohort of animals we used for these experiments was sufficiently large (36 animals), handled identically, and was from diverse sources. It is possible that some aspects of how we habituate, or house animals or how animal caretakers look after mice reduce fear and stress or reduce the behavioral expression of fear in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Furlong, Richardson, and McNally 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kallnik et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gouveia and Hurst 2017</xref>). It is also possible that just as in rats, the sexual identity of mice affects how they respond in our behavioral paradigms (Gruen et al., 2015).</p><p id="P54">Our study was undertaken as an exploration of innate fear in head-fixed mice. Our simulated foraging experimental design was novel. It had visual cues; it had a moving tube (that could hold a rat) linked to the motion of the mouse on a treadmill. It had olfactory cues -- the smell of a rat. It had auditory cues related to the motion of treadmill and the rat in the tube. The behavioral approach was designed to measure fear, to measure how individual mice express defensive responses -- how their behavior changed over ~50-100 trials, spread over 2 days in response to a live rat. Even though mice continue to forage, even after rats come close to them – almost lick them -- it is possible that for a short time, for a trial or a few trials, mice are in fact afraid of rats, but they rapidly habituate to the presence of the rat. This kind of rapid learning over the course of a few trials cannot be ruled out. But as we would be left with only very few trials, potentially just a single trial per mouse, we could not perform these experiments on a scale necessary to rule out these effects.</p><p id="P55">Our work suggests that mice adapt rapidly and learn to suppress their escape responses, that even the response to an innate fear-inducing threat, such as presence of a predator can be dynamically adjusted. It is possible that even innate processes need an appropriate sensory stimulus to trigger or help teach the appropriate behavioral response. Is the innate response genetically programmed, or do innate responses also need to be triggered by contextual stimuli and learning?

1</label><caption><title>Experimental design, setup, and performance in the presence of a rat.</title><p><bold>A)</bold> Side view of the mechanical components in the apparatus. The movement of a treadmill was tethered to the movement of a lick spout and a large red tube. When mice walked forward, the lick tube moved towards them, when mice moved backwards, the lick tube moved away. A flashing screen (part of a virtual reality display) and a sound cue signaled the start of a trial. Mice had 12 seconds to complete a trial, if they succeeded, reward was delivered within reach of the mouse, and a new trial was initiated by resetting the position of the spout to its starting position away from the mouse. <bold>B)</bold> Threat perception disc. The apparatus was designed to mimic four user defined interactive conditions with the large red tube positioned over the lick spout. The full view condition was one where the opening of the tube was completely open, and it was possible for a head-fixed mouse and the rat to almost touch each other. The olfactory condition was one where odors could be delivered but visual, tactile and other elements inside the tube were blocked. The visual condition was one where mice could see inside the tube. The opaque condition blocked all cues from inside the tube. Note that auditory cues were not filtered and that a fan at the end of the tube could be activated to extract smells from the red tube. <bold>C</bold>) Training procedures. Habituation consisted of head fixing mice on the treadmill and manually rewarding them when they moved forward spontaneously. Following this brief, 1- to 2-day habituation period, the reward delivery was automated. Reward was dispensed after mice had moved 28.5 centimeters-- the circumference of the treadmill. This movement was sufficient to move the lick spout into a position where mice could lick the reward as it was delivered. Over days the flashing light cue of the virtual reality screens, and the sound cue were added as go-cues to begin the trial. The duration of the trial was shortened, giving mice 12 seconds to reach the spout, or move at least 28.5 cm. <bold>D</bold>) Data acquisition. Once all mice of the cohort reached criterion (65% success rate) baseline data was acquired. In the next session, a live rat was placed inside the tube, and the experiment was repeated -- with the full interaction between the mouse and the rat. Finally, on a third day, reference data in the absence of the rat were acquired. <bold>E</bold>) Performance data. Of the seven mice used for these data sets, five showed no change in their performance in any of the three sessions. For the other two, performance was affected by the presence of the live rat. For both these mice, the reduction in performance persisted through the next day, post rat.
