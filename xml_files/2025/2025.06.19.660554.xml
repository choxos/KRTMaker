Upon sensing viral infection, the cyclase produces a signal molecule that activates effector function and causes cell dormancy or death. However, the evolutionary origins and functional independence of CBASS components remain unclear. Type II CBASS systems commonly employ TIR-SAVED domain effector proteins that deplete cellular NAD+ during viral infection. Here, we demonstrate that a TIR-SAVED effector protein can operate as a standalone antiviral defense, causing significant growth inhibition and approximately 50% viral clearance during infection in the complete absence of its cognate cyclase. Remarkably, we show that the TIR-SAVED effector can sense cyclic di-AMP, a conserved second messenger produced by the host diadenylate cyclase DacZ, when the canonical CBASS signal is absent. This antiviral activity was associated with depletion of cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> and required intact conserved functional residues within both the TIR and SAVED domains. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of antiviral signalling that expands the functional repertoire of CBASS. They also provide insights into the modular evolution of complex prokaryotic immune systems, suggesting that what are now CBASS effectors might have evolved as independent defense components before being integrated into multi-protein systems.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Bacterial and archaeal cells employ diverse antiviral defense mechanisms to combat viral infections.

These systems are found in almost 14% of bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and can activate various cellular responses upon viral infection, triggering cell death or dormancy before the viruses can spread to sister cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. To date, four types of CBASS systems have been identified in bacterial and archaeal populations, with approximately 39% being type II CBASS systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Typically, each type II CBASS gene cluster is composed of genes encoding a cyclase, one or more effectors, and the ancillary proteins Cap2 and Cap3: a ubiquitin-like protein ligase and a deconjugating enzyme, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Many Bacterial type II CBASS Systems defend against viral infections through a TIR-SAVED domain effector protein that depletes cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels.

This coordinated mechanism has been extensively characterized in bacterial systems, where mutation of the cyclase active site completely abolishes CBASS activity, reinforcing the view that the proteins of these systems function as interdependent components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">However, most if not all complex biological systems have evolved from pre-existing parts via a process that is often referred to as evolutionary tinkering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. The evolutionary origins and potential functional independence of CBASS components remain unknown.

Similarly, SAVED domains are found across diverse immunity contexts, including various CBASS types and type III CRISPR systems, suggesting potential functional versatility beyond their canonical signalling roles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. This raises the question if the fusion of these domains into one protein preceded their association with the cyclase, and whether CBASS effectors can function independently of their cognate cyclases or recognize alternative signalling molecules beyond their predicted substrates.</p><p id="P5">If effectors can operate autonomously, this would suggest that complex CBASS systems may have evolved through the recruitment and integration of pre-existing defense components, rather than co-evolution as obligate modules. Furthermore, the ability of effectors to recognize alternative signalling molecules could provide additional layers of antiviral protection and explain the remarkable diversity and widespread distribution of CBASS systems across bacterial and archaeal genomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Our previous work demonstrated that an archaeal Type II CBASS system in <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic> (H-CBASS2) responds to chronic viral infection by inducing growth inhibition rather than triggering cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, suggesting an alternative mechanism of action in halophilic archaea compared to the typical abortive infection responses observed in bacteria. Here, we investigate the functional independence of TIR-SAVED effector proteins from H-CBASS2. Using the chronically-infecting virus HFPV-1 and the model archaeon <italic>H. volcanii</italic>, we demonstrate that the H-TIR-SAVED effector can function as a standalone antiviral defense system, causing growth inhibition and viral clearance in the complete absence of its cognate cyclase. Remarkably, we show that this independent activity depends on the recognition of cyclic di-AMP, a conserved signal secondary messenger produced by the host diadenylate cyclase DacZ, in the absence of the canonical cyclic trinucleotide signal typically associated with type II CBASS systems that are related in sequence and structure to HCBASS2.

We then infected the cells with the HFPV-1, a chronically-infecting virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, and selected virus-infected colonies expressing each individual protein to assess their physiological effects. Interestingly, we observed that virus-infected cells induced to express the H-TIR-SAVED protein, despite lacking both the E1-E2-JAB and cyclase proteins —showing nearly 50% virus clearance by the third passage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Furthermore, virus-infected cells expressing H-TIR-SAVED alone exhibited substantial growth inhibition compared to non-infected cells or those carrying an empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). A slight growth inhibition was also observed upon H-TIR-SAVED expression, even in the absence of virus infection, in <italic>H. volcanii</italic> compared to the control strain carrying an empty pTA927 plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). We used qPCR to measure viral DNA levels in the supernatant and found that cells expressing H-TIR-SAVED showed a 20-30% reduction in viral DNA compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>)</p><p id="P9">Next, we performed live-dead staining assays on logarithmic cultures of HFPV-1-infected cells expressing H-TIR-SAVED proteins. In agreement with our previous findings on the full CBASS system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, no dead cells were observed in these cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Fig. 1a</xref>). As expected, H-TIR-SAVED expression also did not affect the plaquing efficiency of HFPV-1(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Similar to the full-length type II CBASS system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, the expression of H-TIR-SAVED caused a growth delay but did not induce cell death, reinforcing the idea that type II CBASS systems and their components do not function as a typical abortive infection mechanism, at least not during chronic HFPV-1 infection. We then investigated the long-term effects of viral infection by exposing H-TIR-SAVED expressing cells to room temperature conditions for 3-4 weeks. The virus-infected colonies of cells expressing the TIR-SAVED (NAD-depleting) effector exhibited bleaching compared to infected CBASS-negative control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>), similar to the results obtained previously with the full system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. As expected, subsequent live-dead assays after long-term virus exposure revealed a higher proportion of dead cells in virus-infected H-TIR-SAVED culture compared to infected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Fig. 1b</xref>). Taken together, these results confirm that the TIR-SAVED effector is responsible for the bleaching activity previously observed for H-CBASS2, which probably results from depriving cells of NADPH required for the synthesis of isoprenoids, including carotenoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The TIR-SAVED effector protein depletes NAD<sup>+</sup> in virus-infected cells, In the absence of the CBASS cyclase</title><p id="P10">Previous studies have demonstrated that type II CBASS systems detect viral infection through their cyclase proteins, which then produce cyclic signalling molecules that are sensed by effectors, ultimately triggering cell death or dormancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.Accordingly, our previous results showed that inactivating the cyclase by mutation abolished the H-CBASS2 activity during viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. This raised the question of whether the observed growth delay in H-TIR-SAVED-expressing cells was caused by NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion. To determine whether the H-TIR-SAVED protein was able to deplete cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in the absence of a cyclase we measured total NAD levels in logarithmic-phase cultures of HFPV-1-infected cells expressing H-TIR-SAVED. Interestingly, we found that total NAD levels decreased in virus-infected H-TIR-SAVED-expressing cells compared to infected controls containing an empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In contrast, total NAD levels in infected cells expressing the full H-CBASS2 remained unchanged during logarithmic growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, we also observed a substantial reduction in total NAD levels, in infected bleached colonies expressing H-TIR-SAVED in the absence of a virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Next, we generated the H-TIR-SAVED and <italic>Microbacterium ketosireducens</italic> TIR-SAVED structures using AlphaFold 3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We then compared the H-TIR-SAVED structure with the <italic>M. ketosireducens</italic> TIR-SAVED structure using Chimera and created a homology model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, which revealed a high degree of structural similarity (RMSD between 196 pruned atom pairs is 1.188 angstroms; (across all 383 pairs: 3.757) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Further analysis identified E80 as the active-site residue in the TIR domain, which we mutated to glutamine (E80Q). Notably, previous studies reported that this mutation in <italic>M. ketosireducens</italic> TIR-SAVED abolished both NAD depletion and phage defense<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Consistent with these findings, the E80Q mutation in H-TIR-SAVED fully restored NAD levels and partially rescued the growth phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D&amp;E</xref>) in H-TIR-SAVED -expressing infected cells. Furthermore, we did not observe bleached colonies in virus-infected cells after introducing this mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Recent studies have shown that TIR-SAVED oligomerizes and becomes active in the presence of cA3 signalling molecules. This multimerization is crucial for its function, as mutations in the SAVED domain active site disrupt signal binding (specifically to cA3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, rendering the protein monomeric and inactive. We investigated whether structurally analogous amino acids in H-TIR-SAVED would abolish its activity, which would indicate that, like a typical CBASS system, the H-SAVED domain binds specific signalling molecules in response to infection. To test this hypothesis, we introduced R195E and F388A mutations separately into the H-TIR-SAVED active site and found that the F388A mutation partially reversed the growth delay and completely prevented the colony bleaching caused by HFPV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Fig. 3</xref>). This result indicates that, like a typical CBASS system, the SAVED domain must bind a specific signalling molecule in order to be active during infection.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Virus infection leads to a more severe growth arrest in H-TIR-SAVED cells compared to full length H-CBASS2-expressing cells</title><p id="P12">We observed that HFPV-1 infection caused more severe growth delay in cells expressing H-TIR-SAVED compared to those expressing full-length H-CBASS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Additionally, virus-infected H-TIR-SAVED cells bleached more rapidly than cells expressing full-length H-CBASS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Most notably, when measuring NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, we found that infected H-TIR-SAVED-expressing cells showed a two-fold greater decrease compared to cells expressing full-length H-CBASS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>H-TIR-SAVED proteins sense cyclic di-AMP, a signaling molecule produced by a conserved host enzyme</title><p id="P13">Since introducing mutations in the signal binding site of H-TIR-SAVED abolished activity, this implied that a signalling molecule is required, which must be generated by a host enzyme in the absence of a cyclase during viral infection. Since H-TIR-SAVED is induced and may adopt an open conformation, it could potentially bind to molecules resembling its predicted substrate cAAG that are somehow produced as a result of membrane stress triggered by viral infection. The obvious candidate in the case of <italic>H. volcanii</italic> is the essential secondary messenger molecule cyclic-di-AMP (c-di-AMP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. This molecule is produced by the diadenylate cyclase DacZ and has been shown to be essential, required for osmoregulation and, strikingly, toxic when its concentration rises above a certain threshold within cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Some diadenylate cyclases are found in proximity to CBASS gene clusters, and have been suggested to sense phage infection by responding to membrane stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.To test this hypothesis, we used <italic>H. volcanii</italic> strains with reduced and constitutive DacZ expression, exhibiting approximately 50% reduction in activity relative to basal levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. We then introduced the H-TIR-SAVED protein along with HFPV-1 virus into these low c-di-AMP cells. Notably, cells expressing H-TIR-SAVED in these strains showed substantially milder growth inhibition when infected with HFPV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Furthermore, we added exogenous c-di-AMP to cells expressing either the full H-CBASS2 and H-TIR-SAVED proteins without viral infection and performed growth analyses. Interestingly, we found that in the presence of external c-di-AMP, the H-TIR-SAVED protein caused growth inhibition even in the absence of virus. We also observed a small effect on the full-length CBASS system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Notably, we did not observe any effect of c-di-AMP when we used strains with mutations in the TIR and SAVED domain proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), as expected. Altogether, these findings suggest that the H-TIR-SAVED protein can function as an <bold>independent</bold> immune effector in <italic>H. volcanii</italic> and can respond to viral infection by sensing cyclic di-AMP signals produced by different cyclase such as DacZ within the cell, rather than being limited to detecting their putative cAAG signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P14">Here we show that the TIR-SAVED effector of a type II CBASS can act independently as an antiviral defense, and is capable of inducing growth inhibition during infection in the absence of cyclase protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B&amp;C</xref>). Such independent activity may provide a more robust defense system that is less sensitive to anti-defense mechanisms, such as anti-CBASS (Acb) proteins that sequester signal molecules and inhibit CBASS-based immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. This is consistent with a system that has evolved to have co-dependency between its components. Taken together, these results help explain how complex CBASS systems evolved from their individual components, prior to becoming inter-dependent. TIR-domain proteins are found in many different anti-phage systems, and there are even single protein TIR-domain systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and thus could have been recruited for defensive roles before becoming associated with a cognate cyclase. Consistent with previous studies in other organisms, we show that the TIR-SAVED effector can cause growth inhibition by depleting NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in infected cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we found that the expression of TIR-SAVED without the other CBASS components also led to a significant reduction in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in virus-infected <italic>H. volcanii</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A&amp;B</xref>), confirming this domain’s critical role in the observed growth inhibition. The E80Q mutation in the catalytic site of the TIR domain partially reversed the growth phenotype and fully prevented the NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion caused by virus infection in cells expressing the stand-alone TIR-SAVED protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D&amp;E</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We further show that the SAVED domain’s ability to mediate antiviral responses depends on specific conserved residues required for signal sensing. The rescue of the growth phenotype and suppression of bleaching by the F388A mutation (which is important for cA3-binding in b bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>) support a role for the SAVED domain as a signal sensor, likely detecting a cyclic nucleotide signal even in the absence of the canonical cyclase. This is further supported by our observation that H-TIR–SAVED can sense cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP), representing a novel twist in the study of CBASS signalling specificity. The substantial rescue of growth inhibition in strains with reduced DacZ expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), along with the induction of growth arrest by exogenous c-di-AMP in the absence of viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B&amp;C</xref>), provides strong evidence that this effector protein has evolved to recognize endogenous signalling molecules beyond the canonical cA3G produced by CBASS cyclases. These results suggest that while the SAVED domain retains its ligand-binding role, it has broad enough specificity to recognize structurally related cyclic nucleotides beyond its cognate trinucleotide, which is predicted by structural similarity to be cAAG. This expanded signal-recognition capacity may explain the widespread presence of SAVED domains across diverse antiviral immune systems, including various CBASS types as well as type III CRISPR systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.</p><sec id="S8"><title>Cyclic di-AMP</title><p id="P16">plays several key roles in bacterial physiology, including responses to osmotic stress and protecting DNA integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. While the membrane stress is more typical to early stages of viral infection, at least in bacteria, DNA damage is generally not considered to be phage associated. However, replication of phage genomes often includes DNA open ends, which are indistinguishable from DNA breaks at the molecular level, and could therefore indicate viral replication and trigger a defensive function. Notably, many genes encoding DacZ enzymes naturally co-occur with CBASS systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, suggesting a potential link between viral infection, c-di-AMP signalling, and CBASS activation. This also could explain why prokaryotes typically encode a complete CBASS system rather than a standalone TIR-SAVED effector. If TIR-SAVED operated independently based on ci-di-AMP signalling alone, it could respond to various physiological stresses in the absence of infection. Such response would not be beneficial for the cells since a response that delays growth and eventually can result in cell death should be reserved exclusively to stopping the spread of viral infection rather triggered during general stress situations.</p><p id="P17">These findings of cyclase-independent effector function are in contrast to our previous observations that when the whole H-CBASS2 cluster was expressed together, and cyclase activity was abolished by point mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>,this resulted in complete abolishment of CBASS activity. This indicates that either the E1-E2 protein, the H-CBASS2 cyclase or both can modulate the effector function until the cyclase produces enough specific signal. The molecular basis for this molecular remains to be elucidated, but one may speculate that the complete system is better for cells than the lone TIR-SAVED effector because it is less likely to respond to spurious membrane stress in a way which is harmful, in the absence of viral infection.</p><p id="P18">Altogether, our findings suggest that H-TIR-SAVED proteins can function as standalone immune effectors that sense c-di-AMP signals produced by different cellular cyclases to detect viral infection and mediate defense responses. This expands the functional repertoire of CBASS effectors beyond their originally defined signalling context and highlights a more modular, signal-flexible architecture in immunity, which could extend beyond archaea to many Gram-positive bacteria whose genomes encode both <italic>dacZ</italic> and CBASS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Culture conditions</title><p id="P19">The Haloferax wild-type strains were regularly cultured at 45°C in either Hv-YPC or Hv-Ca/Hv-Enhanced Ca medium. <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic> transformants were selected and grown in either Hv-Ca or Hv-Enhanced Ca (Hv-ECa) medium.

All the mutation was confirmed through sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Transformation with HFPV-1</title><p id="P22"><italic>H. volcanii</italic> cultures were grown overnight until reaching log phase and collected by centrifugation (6,500 rpm, 5 min). The cell pellet was carefully resuspended in 200 μl of spheroplasting solution (1 M NaCl, 27 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 15% sucrose). The cells were treated with 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8) to remove divalent cations. After 10 minutes at room temperature, concentrated HFPV-1 particles (5-10 μl) were added and incubated for 5 minutes. The suspension was then mixed gently with 250 μL of 60% PEG600 and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The cells were washed with 1 ml regeneration solution (Hv-YPC+ media containing 15% sucrose) and resuspended in the same media. The culture was first incubated statically at 28°C for 3 hours, followed by another 3-hour incubation with shaking. The cells were then serially diluted, plated, and individual colonies were screened for successful HFPV-1 infection using virus-specific PCR primers.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Growth curves</title><p id="P23">The strains were cultured overnight in Hv-ECa medium supplemented with thymidine and tryptophan until reaching log phase. The cultures were then diluted in fresh Hv-ECa medium containing thymidine and tryptophan to achieve an initial OD of 0.03-0.05. For induction experiments, L-tryptophan was added to a final concentration of 2 mM. The diluted cultures were grown in 96-well plates at 42°C with continuous shaking for 72 hours. Growth was monitored by measuring optical density (OD595nm) at 30-minute intervals using a Biotek ELX808IU-PC microplate reader. Each strain was tested in at least three biological replicates, with each biological replicate consisting of three technical replicates.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Growth curve with external cyclic di-AMP</title><p id="P24">Growth experiments were performed using uninfected cells expressing H-TIR-SAVED and a control strain containing the empty plasmid.

Overnight cultures were diluted in fresh medium to an OD of 0.03-0.05 and grown at 45°C with shaking until reaching logarithmic phase. Aliquots of 100 μl from each culture were transferred to 1 ml Eppendorf tubes. The cells were stained by adding 10 μl each of Propidium iodide and SYTO9 dyes from their respective stock solutions. After incubating in darkness for 15-20 minutes to allow dye uptake, 10 μl of each stained culture was examined under a Leica sp8 confocal microscope at 20x and 40x magnification. For analysing dead cells in bleached colonies, cells were collected directly from plates containing bleached colonies and suspended in 100 μl of Hv-ECa medium. The cell suspension was washed twice with Hv-ECa medium before proceeding with the previously described microscopy staining and imaging protocol.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Plate colony pigmentation assays</title><p id="P27">Strains were grown overnight until reaching log phase, then diluted in fresh medium to OD 0.05.

Cultures were grown to late log phase, and equivalent cell numbers (normalized by optical density) were collected and washed twice with cold Hv-Ca media. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 5 min) in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. Each pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of NADH/NAD extraction buffer and lysed using two rounds of sonication. The lysates were centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 10 min), and the supernatants were filtered through Amicon 10 kDa cut-off spin filters to remove proteins. For the assay, 50 μl of each deproteinized sample was transferred to a 96-well plate. A master reaction mixture (98 μl NAD cycling buffer + 2 μl NAD cycling enzyme mix) was prepared, and 100 μl was added to each well. After 5 minutes of incubation at room temperature, 10 μl of NADH Developer was added per well. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 1-2 hours, followed by absorbance measurement at 450 nm. Bleached colonies were collected directly from plates and suspended in 1 ml of cold Hv-Ca media, followed by two washing steps. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 5 min) in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. Each pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of NADH/NAD extraction buffer and lysed using two rounds of sonication.

Briefly, <italic>H. volcanii</italic> strains were grown overnight in Hv-ECa medium and normalized to an optical density of 595 nm (OD595). Next, 400 μl of cultures with 0.5 M CaCl2 was added to 3-4 ml of 0.2% top-agar (preheated and cooled to 60°C) in Hv-YPC, and the mixture was spread onto rich agar plates with 18% SW. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes. A ten-fold serial dilution of HFPV-1 was prepared in Hv-ECa, and 3 μl of each dilution was spotted onto the agar. After 2 days of incubation at 30°C, plaques formed. The plates were then left on the bench at around 25°C for 2-3 days, during which time the plaques continued to grow and become more distinct. Images were captured to document the growth and appearance of the plaques.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Long-term growth experiments</title><p id="P30">Individual colonies were selected from each strain (the <italic>H. volcanii</italic> strain containing H-TIR-SAVED and a control strain infected with the virus) and grown in liquid Hv-ECa medium supplemented with thymidine and tryptophan until reaching late logarithmic or stationary growth phase. The cultures were then subcultured into fresh medium, and this process was repeated for approximately 3 passages. After the third passage, 100 μl from each culture was serially diluted in fresh Hv-Ca medium and spread onto Hv-Ca plates containing thymidine and tryptophan. From the resulting growth, 25-30 colonies from each sample were analysed by PCR to assess HFPV-1 viral presence.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR)</title><p id="P31">We determined the genome copy numbers of <italic>H. volcanii</italic> and HFPV-1 using a CFX Connect Real-Time PCR system.

To measure viral DNA secretion, we extracted DNA from 200 μl of the resulting supernatant using a Quick-DNA Viral Kit. We then performed quantitative PCR with q-PCRBIO SyGreen Blue mastermix Hi-ROX, using primers targeting both an internal viral protein and the DNA polymerase II small subunit (<italic>polB</italic>), which served as a housekeeping gene.

We first extracted the amino acid sequence of the H-TIR-SAVED (accession number: WP_115891642.1) from the NCBI database. The extracted sequence was submitted to the AlphaFold3 server for predicted structure generation. After obtaining the model, we conducted a Foldseek search for structural comparison against the PDB database. The resulting structure was analysed based on TM-score and RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) values.

D) Viral DNA concentration in the supernatant of HFPV-1 infected <italic>H. volcanii</italic> cells after 72 hours of growth represented as Ct values determined using primers specific to the HFPV-1 genome (mean ± SE of three biological replicates). E) Plating efficiency of HFPV-1 measured by a plaque assay conducted using 10-fold serial dilutions of virus stock (the left-most dilution is a 10<sup>-4</sup> virus suspension). H-TIR-SAVED expressing cells, as well as control cells with an empty vector, were mixed with 0.02% top agar and plated onto rich medium. Then, 3 μL of serial dilutions of HFPV-1 were spotted onto the plates to measure plaquing efficiency. The images shown are representative of at least three biological replicates.

C) Growth curves of strains carrying mutations in the TIR and SAVED domains in the presence of c-di-AMP. The wild-type H-TIR-SAVED strain with c-di-AMP is shown in purple, and its corresponding control in black. Mutants E80Q (TIR domain), R195E, and F388A (SAVED domain) are shown in pink, cyan, and blue, respectively. Values represent the mean ± SE of at least three biological replicates, each with three technical replicates. D) Proposed model for the mechanism of action of the TIR-SAVED effector in the absence of a cognate cyclase. Upon HFPV-1 infection, the DacZ protein senses membrane stress caused by the presence of the virus and produces cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) signalling molecules. The SAVED domain detects the c-di-AMP signal, triggering activation of the TIR domain. The activated TIR domain then depletes cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, leading to growth delay and eventual bleaching and death.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206999-f004"/></fig></floats-group></article>
