We and others have shown that activation of the Hedgehog and TGF-beta signalling pathways is required to initiate tail regeneration. In this study we initially focus on these two pathways to better understand their role regeneration. We have found that Hedgehog signalling acts upstream of the TGF-beta pathway by activating transcription of the TGF-beta ligand <italic>tgfb1a</italic>. We have identified differentially expressed genes that are regulated after tail excision as well as those that are dependent upon TGF-beta signalling. From this analysis we found that Keratin genes fall into categories of co-expression: one set that is upregulated by TGF-beta signalling after injury (<italic>krt<sub>up</sub></italic>) and a second set that is downregulated (<italic>krt<sub>down</sub></italic>). To see whether these two sets show co-expression more broadly, we analysed single cell RNA sequencing data and found that <italic>krts</italic> fall into the same categories during zebrafish development. We have mapped the expression of a representative member of <italic>krt<sub>up</sub> (krt97</italic>) and <italic>krt<sub>down</sub></italic> (<italic>krt5</italic>) sets during development and regeneration and show that <italic>krt97</italic> is found in epithelia that is moving and <italic>krt5</italic> is expressed in epithelia that is stationary. Based upon our results we propose that the <italic>krt<sub>up</sub></italic> set allows for collective epithelial migration while the <italic>krt<sub>down</sub></italic> set inhibits mobility. These results reveal one mechanism by which TGF-beta may initiate regeneration and could help to explain how changes in cytoskeletal composition influence cell movement during development and repair.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Although mammals are able to heal wounds and regrow many tissues such as skin and muscle, the regeneration of complex structures is limited. Aquatic vertebrates on the other hand, are able to regenerate large portions of organs including limb, tail, spinal cord, retina and heart(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Poss and Tanaka 2024</xref>). When comparable damage occurs in mammals, tissue usually fails to regrow and scarring occurs. One possible explanation for the poor regenerative potential observed in mammals may be a failure to recruit competent cells to the site of injury in sufficient numbers to restore the missing tissue. Thus, the characterisation of signalling pathways that are able to induce regenerative cell migration in model organisms may aid in the development of novel regenerative medicine strategies.</p><p id="P3">Zebrafish larval tail excision offers a rapid and simple model to understand the basic principles of regeneration(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Rojas-Muñoz et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Romero et al. 2018</xref>). Excision is typically performed between 48 and 72 hours post fertilisation (hpf) and involves removal of some of the larval fin (finfold), muscle, neural tube, notochord and other tissue. Following excision, early wound signals (ATP, Calcium and ROS) are released and the wound rapidly closes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Niethammer 2016</xref>). The body axis shortens and a ball of notochord cells forms at the stump (called the notochord bead)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-d</xref>). The notochord bead expresses Hedgehog (HH) ligands which induce migration of regenerative cells to the stump (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-e</xref>). This results in the formation of the blastema and wound epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). The blastema and wound epithelium express signalling pathways which orchestrate the redevelopment of the tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Regeneration of the tail completes by around 72 hours post excision (hpe).</p><p id="P4">The TGF-beta pathway plays crucial roles in wound healing in mammalian systems and is involved with wound closure, fibroblast activation, inflammation and fibrosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Massagué and Sheppard 2023</xref>). It has also been shown to act during the regeneration of different zebrafish tissues including heart, spinal cord, lateral line and adult skin(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Richardson et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bensimon-Brito et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Keatinge et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Hsu et al. 2024</xref>). Recent analysis has shown that TGF-beta signalling acts during larval tail regeneration and is linked closely with pro-regenerative metabolic reprogramming(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Sinclair et al. 2021</xref>). How the TGF-beta pathway relates to the existing signalling network for tail regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-g</xref>) is not clear.</p><p id="P5">Keratins (Krts) are intermediate filament proteins that are found mainly in the cytoskeleton of epithelial cells and are associated with desmosomes and hemidesmosomes. They give strength to many structures including skin, hair and nails. In addition to their structural roles they have effects on diverse cellular processes such as cell signalling, metabolism and mechanotransduction(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Redmond and Coulombe 2021</xref>). Studies in zebrafish have primarily used <italic>krts</italic> as markers of epithelia and transgenic fish carrying fluorescent proteins driven by <italic>krt</italic> promoters are widely used(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Love, Huber, and Anders 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Gong et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Lee, Asharani, and Carney 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In this study we have propose that the TGF-beta pathway plays a central role during tail regeneration. We find that it is activated by notochord-derived HH signalling through the upregulation of transcription of the ligand <italic>tgfb1a</italic> in the notochord bead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Notochordal TGF-beta signalling then inhibits HH signalling by repressing transcription of <italic>indian hedgehog a</italic> (<italic>ihha</italic>) in the notochord and further activates <italic>tgfb1a</italic> in the notochord and surrounding tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). To better understand the downstream effects of TGF-beta signalling we use bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after tail excision and after pharmacological inhibition of TGF-beta signalling. We identify members of the <italic>krt</italic> gene family as targets of the TGF-beta pathway after excision, and find that they fall into two categories of co-expression (synexpression): one set that is upregulated by TGF-beta signalling after injury (<italic>krt<sub>up</sub></italic>) and a second set that is downregulated by TGF-beta signalling after injury (<italic>krt<sub>down</sub></italic>). Next we focus on two <italic>krt</italic> genes, <italic>krt97</italic> and <italic>krt5</italic> as representative members of <italic>krt<sub>up</sub></italic> and <italic>krt<sub>down</sub></italic> to examine their expression during development and regeneration. We find that whereas <italic>krt97</italic> is expressed in epithelia that are actively moving, <italic>krt5</italic> is expressed in epithelium that is stationary. Using developmental single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets we show that genes in <italic>krt<sub>up</sub></italic> and <italic>krt<sub>down</sub></italic> tend not to be co-expressed suggesting that these two groups have distinct functions during development. Collectively these data suggest a model where TGF-beta allows for collective cell movement in the epithelia by modulating expression of different members of the <italic>krt</italic> gene family.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>TGF-beta signalling acts downstream of HH signalling</title><p id="P7">Pharmacological inhibition of the HH and TGF-beta signalling pathways have striking similarities: In both cases the wound closes and the notochord bead forms, but there is no recruitment of regenerative cells to the stump(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Sinclair et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Romero et al. 2018</xref>). We have previously shown that HH ligands <italic>ihhb</italic> and <italic>shha</italic> are expressed in the notochord both before and after tail excision. To begin to understand the relationship between the HH and TGF-beta pathways we used standard RNA in situ methods(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Thisse and Thisse 2014</xref>) to identify <italic>tgfb1a</italic> as a candidate ligand gene that is expressed in the notochord bead immediately after wounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Expression is initially just in the notochord and then spreads to the surrounding tissue. To determine whether the two pathways regulate each other we treated fish with either a HH pathway inhibitor (cyclopamine) or a TGF-beta pathway inhibitor (SB431542). We found that cyclopamine treatment blocks <italic>tgfb1a</italic> transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) and SB431542 treatment increases <italic>ihha</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). These two findings indicate that TGF-beta signalling is likely to act downstream of the HH pathway and forms a negative feedback loop to modulate HH activity. In addition we found that TGF-beta activates its own transcription especially in the tissue surrounding the notochord bead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). We have previously found that while the standard whole-mount RNA in situ methods detect expression in the notochord bead, it does not detect genes expressed in the intact notochord(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Romero et al. 2018</xref>). To investigate whether <italic>tgfb1a</italic> is expressed in notochord cells prior to injury, we switched to the hybridization chain reaction fluorescent (HCR) in situ method which utilises much smaller probes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Choi, Schwarzkopf, and Pierce 2020</xref>). Whereas, <italic>ihhb</italic> is expressed through-out the notochord before and after injury, <italic>tgfb1a</italic> is only activated in the notochord bead upon injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Together these findings suggest a model whereby the formation of the notochord bead causes the induction of <italic>tgfb1a</italic> expression by HH signalling.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Transcriptional analysis of TGF-beta signalling during regeneration</title><p id="P8">To begin to understand the role of TGF-beta signalling in regenerative cell recruitment, we performed bulk RNA-seq to identify DEGs after tail excision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). To focus on genes that are regulated at the start of regeneration, fish were processed at 18 hours post excision (hpe). RNA was collected using four treatments: DMSO (vehicle control) unoperated, DMSO operated, SB431542 unoperated and SB431542 operated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Three replicates were done for each treatment and the data was processed using the DESeq2 package in R(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Choi, Schwarzkopf, and Pierce 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Love, Huber, and Anders 2014</xref>). One conclusion that can be drawn from this analysis is that DEGs that are found in the SB431542 operated versus DMSO operated comparisons tend to also be DEGs in the SB431542 unoperated versus DMSO unoperated set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). This suggests that genes that are targets of TGF-beta signalling during regeneration are also responding to TGF-beta activity in uninjured fish. This is unexpected as treatment with SB431542 in unoperated fish confers no visible changes. There are however some DEGs that are regulated by SB431542 in operated fish that do not show significant regulation by SB431542 in unoperated fish. These genes are potential wound/regeneration specific targets of the TGF-beta pathway (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P9">A second conclusion from the RNA-seq comparisons is that genes that are regulated during regeneration are usually influenced by SB431542 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). For example, DEGs that are upregulated following injury are likely to also be downregulated when injured fish are treated with SB431542. This supports the model that TGF-beta is pro-regenerative and is required during the onset of regeneration to recruit cells. However, there are some DEGs that do not fit this model (see upper right and lower left quadrants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3d</xref>). For example DEGs in the upper right quadrant of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig3d</xref> are upregulated following injury and are upregulated when injured fish are treated with SB431542. It is not immediately clear why this is, but one possible explanation is that there is negative feedback affecting these genes and that testing at earlier time points would find that they are initially downregulated by TGF-beta. The most significant DEGs that are identified by this comparison are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>.</p><p id="P10">Further evidence that TGF-beta has a pro-regenerative role comes from comparison of DEGs after injury in DMSO to DEGs after injury in fish treated with SB431542 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). In this graph, DEGs that are unaffected by the presence of SB431542 after injury fall on a slope of 1. The regression slope is closer to 0.9 indicating that there is a bias towards DEGs that are injury specific and are responding to TGF-beta. For example, genes that fall below the slope of 1 line in the upper right quadrant are predicted to be activated by TGF-beta whilst those that fall above the slope of 1 line in the lower left quadrant are predicted to be repressed by TGF-beta during regeneration. A subset of these genes are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 3</xref>.</p><p id="P11">To find genes that are injury-specific but not TGF-beta targets we can take DEGs that fall close to the slope of 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig3e</xref>. We can also identify this type of gene by selecting DEGs that lie close to the X-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig3d</xref>. By applying both criteria we identified a subset of DEGs that are potential TGF-beta independent regeneration genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Members of the Keratin family show TGF-beta-dependent responses to injury</title><p id="P12">To learn more about coordinated gene expression during regeneration we searched for families of genes in the RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 5</xref>). Of these, the Krt family stands out because most members are regulated by TGF-beta and these members are either activated during regeneration (<italic>krt<sub>up</sub></italic>) or inhibited (<italic>krt<sub>down</sub></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We grouped the <italic>krts</italic> as being in these synexpression groups based upon being significant (P &lt; 0.05) in at least one of the comparisons. There are nine <italic>krts</italic> that do not fall into these groupings. Two of these, <italic>krt18a.2</italic> and <italic>krt95</italic>, were not identified in our analysis. Of the remaining seven, six are expressed at low levels at the time of our assay which perhaps affects our detection, and the seventh (<italic>krt222</italic>) is only distantly related to other members of the <italic>krt</italic> family.</p><p id="P13">The zebrafish <italic>krt</italic> family is smaller than the mammalian family and is less well studied(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Krushna Padhi, Akimenko, and Ekker 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Ho et al. 2022</xref>). To begin to understand the significance of these two groupings, we first performed phylogenetic analysis to see whether members of Krt<sub>up</sub> or Krt<sub>down</sub> are more closely related to each other based upon their predicted protein sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 b</xref>). We have included members of the human Krt (hKRT) family in this analysis for comparison. There are three type II Krts with one Krt<sub>up</sub> and two Krt<sub>down</sub> members. These fall next to the human type II Krts in one cluster. The type I branch has greater variation with one of the human Krts (hKRT18) showing more similarity to zebrafish genes than to other human Krts. Within the type I branch there is some correlation between expression and relatedness. Krt<sub>up</sub> and Krt<sub>down</sub> appear to separate between Krt15 and Krt94. Intriguingly, the members that show regulation but a P value that is greater than 0.5 do still show a correlation in their relatedness. For example, although <italic>krt1-c5</italic> does not show significance in pairwise comparisons, it does show the expected changes in expression for Krt<sub>up</sub> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>) and falls into the Krt<sub>up</sub> phylogenetic branch. Likewise, <italic>krt1-19d</italic> has the expected changes in expression for Krt<sub>down</sub> and falls into the Krt<sub>down</sub> branch. The correlation in the type I group between expression and relatedness may indicate that there are structural differences between these Krt<sub>up</sub> and Krt<sub>down</sub> members and that the two groups were formed by one evolutionarily event.</p><p id="P14">To see whether this correlation extends to their chromosomal organisation, we looked at the genomic organisation of <italic>krts</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). <italic>krts</italic> are found clustered on six chromosomes. The cluster on chromosome 19 contains up to three members of <italic>krt<sub>down</sub></italic> and the cluster on chromosome 22 has two members of <italic>krt<sub>up</sub></italic>. Three of the other chromosomes are mixed synexpression genes and chromosome 5 has a single <italic>krt</italic> gene. Overall the genomic organisation does not show a strong correlation with the type of synexpression.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title><italic>krts</italic> have distinct domains of expression during regeneration and development</title><p id="P15">To understand the relevance of <italic>krt</italic> regulation at the tissue level we decided to do HCR in situ analysis. For this we have focused on <italic>krt5</italic> as a representative of <italic>krt<sub>down</sub></italic> and <italic>krt97</italic> as a representative of <italic>krt<sub>up</sub>.</italic> We first tested the response of these at three stages, uninjured (96hpf), 24hpe(96hpf) and 48hpe(120hpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). In fish at these stages we found that <italic>krt97</italic> and <italic>krt5</italic> are expressed in distinct domains. <italic>krt97</italic> is primarily in epithelial cells of the finfold in a crescent shape around the end of the tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). This region of expression is removed following tail excision. <italic>krt5</italic> on the other hand is found in the epithelia that sits on the trunk. At 24hpe epithelial cells have gathered on the end of the stump to form the wound epithelium. At this time, <italic>krt97</italic> expression is upregulated in wound epithelium and <italic>krt5</italic> expression is reduced in the trunk epithelia nearest to the stump. By 48hpe the fin fold is reforming and krt97 is expressed in the new area of growth. On the other hand <italic>krt5</italic> is strongly downregulated near to the regrowing tail. Inhibition of TGF-beta with SB431542 during regeneration results in a strong increase in <italic>krt5</italic> and a reduction in <italic>krt97</italic> consistent with the RNA-seq data. To further confirm our results we probed scRNA-seq data for fish at 24hpe and 48hpe(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Sinclair et al. 2021</xref>). We see that <italic>krt97</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>krt5</italic><sup>+</sup> cells are in distinct domains with <italic>krt97</italic><sup>+</sup> cells increasing after excision and <italic>krt5</italic><sup>+</sup> cells decreasing. Pseudo bulk RNA-seq analysis of this scRNA-seq data suggests an increase of 1.5 fold for <italic>krt97</italic> at 24hpe and a decrease of <italic>krt5</italic> expression to 0.5 at 24hpe and 0.38 at 48hpe. Together these data suggest that <italic>krts</italic> respond to injury in a TGF-beta dependent fashion and are expressed in distinct compartments of the skin.</p><p id="P16">Given that regeneration of the fin fold is likely to recapitulate aspects of fin fold development, we decided to look at tail developmental stages to compare development to regeneration. The fin fold emerges between 20hpf and 48hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a</xref>). At 20hpf it can be seen as a ridge of epidermal cells that sits on the midline of the left and right sides of the tail. At this stage <italic>krt5</italic> is in scattered cells throughout the tail epidermis and at 24hpf and 32hpf <italic>krt5</italic> is expressed throughout the tail epidermis. Between 36hpf and 48hpf the fin fold goes through morphogenesis and <italic>krt5</italic> expression is limited to the trunk of the tail. At 20hpf <italic>krt97</italic> expression is in a layer of cells at the base of the epidermal ridge in a crescent of cells around the end of the tail. This expression expands and as the finfold expands it becomes more restricted to the caudal end of the finfold. Intriguingly <italic>krt97</italic> is not expressed in the most distal layer of cells of the finfold. To summarise, <italic>krt5</italic> and <italic>krt97</italic> are expressed in different areas of the tail epidermis with <italic>krt97</italic> being expressed in the fin fold as it undergoes morphogenesis.</p><p id="P17">To further understand the compartmentalisation of <italic>krt5</italic> and <italic>krt97</italic> expression we analysed the Daniocell scRNA-seq dataset which contains cells from 3hpf to 120hpf(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Farrell et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Sur et al. 2023</xref>). We found that <italic>krt97</italic> and <italic>krt5</italic> show separate domains of expression primarily between 30hpf and 58hpf and at other time points the expression domains are not distinct (data not shown). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref> shows pooled cells from 36-46hpf and <italic>krt5</italic> is expressed in a cluster annotated as periderm and <italic>krt97</italic> is in fin epithelium and epithelium clusters.</p><p id="P18">Treatment with the inhibitor SB431542 during finfold development does not confer a morphological phenotype suggesting that TGF-beta signalling does not strongly affect finfold development (data not shown). However, considering our result that most genes which are regulated by TGF-beta during regeneration also show some regulation in uninjured fish, we decided to see whether SB431542 affects <italic>krt</italic> gene expression during development. We found that treatment between 16.5hpf to 24hpf and 40hpf to 48hpf results in a strong reduction in <italic>krt97</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>krt5</italic> did not show a change in expression. This suggests that the regulation of <italic>krts</italic> during development may be related to that seen during regeneration, at least for <italic>krt97.</italic></p><p id="P19">This compartmentalised expression of <italic>krt5</italic> and <italic>krt97</italic> during finfold development and regeneration raises the possibility that other members of <italic>krt<sub>up</sub></italic> and <italic>krt<sub>down</sub></italic> show segregated expression patterns during development. We have tested other keratins and find that there is limited overlap between <italic>krt<sub>up</sub></italic> and <italic>krt<sub>down</sub></italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 6</xref> and data not shown). To see whether this is the case more broadly we pooled periderm, fin epithelium and epithelium clusters from the Daniocell scRNA-seq dataset and assessed the degree of co-expression between <italic>krt<sub>up</sub></italic> and <italic>krt<sub>down</sub></italic> using Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). This data shows that there is a strong degree of coexpression within each group. For example, <italic>krt1-19e</italic> expression is correlated to other members of <italic>krt<sub>down</sub></italic> especially in the epidermis with <italic>krt5</italic> and <italic>krt91</italic> showing the highest association with <italic>krt1-19e. krt1-19e</italic> shows a negative correlation to members of <italic>krt<sub>up</sub></italic> particularly with <italic>krt18a.1, krt97</italic> and <italic>krt8</italic> in the periderm. This data shows the co-regulation of <italic>krts</italic> seen during regeneration and with manipulation of TGF-beta signalling is also found more broadly in epithelia during developmental stages.</p><p id="P20">The expression <italic>krt97</italic> during finfold regeneration and development correlates to regions that are undergoing morphogenesis. These epithelia need to engage in collective cell migration and are likely to alter their cytoskeleton to allow this to occur. On the other hand, <italic>krt5</italic> is reduced during finfold morphogenesis and regeneration suggesting that it is inhibitory to epithelial movement. To investigate this hypothesis, we decided to analyse epithelial cell movement during development and regeneration to see whether different epithelial regions have different mobility. Our predictions were that regions that express <italic>krt97</italic> (epithelia of the fin fold) move more quickly than regions that express <italic>krt5</italic> (epithelia on the trunk). To test cell movement during regeneration we used photo-conversion of a nuclear localised dendra transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig 9a, b, g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig. 7</xref>). We found that cells in the proximal finfold move the furthest averaging approximately 70um per day relative to cells on the trunk. In unoperated animals there was very little movement. To assess cell movement during development, we made timelapse recordings of a nuclear-localised fluorescent reporter and measured movement relative to the underlying somites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Movie 1</xref>). As during regeneration we found that during development cells on the finfold move faster than cells on the trunk (by approximately 15um/hour) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9c-f, h</xref>). These results show that epithelia move at dramatically different rates during regeneration and development, and that the differences in movement may correlate to differences in <italic>krt</italic> expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P21">In this study we focus on how regenerative cells are recruited to the site of injury after tail excision. We present a model whereby HH signalling activates regenerative cell recruitment by transcriptionally activating <italic>tgfb1a</italic> expression in the notochord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). The TGF-beta pathway then induces more expression of <italic>tgfb1a</italic> whilst inhibiting expression of <italic>ihhb</italic> in the notochord. After establishing that TGF-beta signalling acts downstream of the HH pathway, we then focus on the identification of genes regulated by TGF-beta during regeneration to investigate how cell recruitment takes place. These data reveal sets of genes that are important in the regeneration and indicate that TGF-beta plays a central role in this process. We propose that members of the <italic>krt</italic> gene family as potential effectors of regenerative TGF-beta signalling and that TGF-beta signalling enables collective cell migration by modulating the expression of different <italic>krts</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>).</p><p id="P22">TGF-beta has been linked to wound healing by mammalian studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Lichtman, Otero-Vinas, and Falanga 2016</xref>). The initial activation of the pathway during wounding is by serum protease activity which releases TGF-beta1 from platelets. The activated pathway then has many roles including keratinocyte recruitment. Our results suggest that during tail regeneration the role in keratinocyte recruitment is similar, but the initial activation of the TGF-beta pathway involves transcriptional activation of <italic>tgfb1a.</italic> Another similarity is that there is also some evidence for TGF-beta regulation of mammalian <italic>Krts</italic> during wounding. For example, one study has found that <italic>Krt15</italic> is repressed during wound healing and is also repressed by TGF-beta signalling suggesting that it would be in the <italic>krt<sub>off</sub></italic> synexpression group(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Werner and Munz 2000</xref>). Furthermore, links between keratin and TGFbeta have been characterised for different tumour types and keratins are used as biomarkers for cancer prognosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Li et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Moll, Divo, and Langbein 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Mammalian studies that primarily use scratch assays have suggested that Krt's usually have negative roles on cell movement, but can also increase migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Sanghvi-Shah and Weber 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chung, Rotty, and Coulombe 2013</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Beil et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Yoon and Leube 2019</xref>). For example, Keratin 6 and 16 are activated after wounding and are thought to play a role in retraction of intermediate filaments from the cell periphery(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Paladini et al. 1996</xref>) and cause a reduction in cell adhesion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Wawersik and Coulombe 2000</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Wang et al. 2018</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Wawersik and Coulombe 2000</xref>). In addition, Krts may affect cell migration by altering cellular elasticity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Beil et al. 2003</xref>) and myosin activation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Nanes et al. 2024</xref>). In Xenopus keratins are involved with adhesion and cell contraction during gastrulation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Sonavane et al. 2017</xref>). Understanding the precise molecular role of zebrafish Krts during collective epithelial cell migration will take further investigation.</p><p id="P24">Regulated expression of <italic>krts</italic> during regeneration has been observed in adult zebrafish tail regeneration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Martorana et al. 2001</xref>), xenopus larval tail regeneration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Tazawa, Shimizu-Nishikawa, and Yoshizato 2006</xref>) and newt limbs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Corcoran and Ferretti 1997</xref>). This suggests that dynamic expression of <italic>krts</italic> is conserved during organ regeneration. Our finding that <italic>krts</italic> have similar regional expression domains during development and regeneration may indicate that embryonic expression patterns are re-established during regeneration. The significance of regionalised expression domains of <italic>krts</italic> during development has yet to be explored.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>General methods</title><p id="P25">Experimental procedures and fish maintenance were performed using standard methods49.
