Despite the frequent use of the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, differentiation protocols vary extensively, with the most common being differentiation via the addition of retinoic acid and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. However, due to the lack of a reliable evaluation method, their adequacy as synaptic models remains unclear. Here, we investigate whether SH-SY5Y cells constitute a functional model for synaptic studies by phenotypically and ultra structurally analyzing synaptogenesis in SH-SY5Y cells subjected to different differentiation protocols. Electron microscopy (EM) techniques, including conventional EM, cryo-EM, and cryo-electron tomography, were systematically applied to characterize synaptogenesis in SH-SY5Y cells. Further characterization was performed through immunostaining and functional assays, such as live exocytosis assays and whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. Despite exhibiting some presynaptic-like features, differentiated SH-SY5Y cells do not form morphologically or functionally complete synapses under the conditions tested. Immunostaining results were consistent with previous findings, showing synaptic markers. However, functional investigations did not detect synaptic activity. High-throughput EM analyses revealed an absence of synaptic structures in these cells. Additionally, an alternative differentiation approach incorporating additional neurotrophic factors promoted the formation of pre-synaptic-like compartments containing synapse-like synaptic vesicles (SVLVs). Though these SVLVs exhibited pleomorphic size distributions, differing from typical synaptic vesicles, and lacked connectors. These findings emphasize the need for cautious interpretation of results derived from SH-SY5Y cells when studying molecular synaptic architecture or neurodegenerative diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">There are numerous neuronal cell models, among the most used ones are human neuroblastoma cell lines, such as SH-SY5Y, mouse neuroblastoma cell lines such as NB41A, Neuro2a and dopamine-containing hybrids (MN9D), used in neuronal differentiation, neurotoxicity, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Other widely used cell lines include rat derived cells, such as catecholaminergic cells (PC12) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and human embryonic neuronal precursors (LUHMES) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons are increasingly regarded as an alternative model for studying synapses due to their potential to differentiate into diverse neuronal subtypes and form structures that more closely resemble native neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. However, the production of iPSC-derived neurons is resource-intensive, requiring specialized expertise and infrastructure, expensive culture media, and long differentiation times. This and limited scalability make them less suitable for high-throughput applications compared to other models, like SH-SY5Y cells. As such, the choice of model often reflects a balance between physiological relevance and experimental feasibility. SH-SY5Y cells provide a faster and more cost-effective alternative for investigating neuronal pathways. While their structural and functional complexity does not fully match that of primary neurons or animal models, their use facilitates scalable and ethically sustainable experimentation. Although primary neurons remain the gold standard for synaptic studies, they are constrained by limited availability, variability, and ethical concerns, further underscoring the need for standardized, accessible cell models such as SH-SY5Y.</p><p id="P3">Synapse formation is a key determinant of neuronal maturation and function and a prerequisite for cellular models intended to investigate synaptic structure and plasticity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Synaptic model systems are vital to understanding signal transmission, circuit formation, and mechanisms underlying neurological disorders <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. SH-SY5Y cells, derived from human neuroblastoma, have been extensively used to model neuronal differentiation, function, and disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. They are known to express synaptic proteins, to exhibit neurite outgrowth, and evoked electrical activity or electrophysiological responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, whether these features translate into the formation of mature synaptic structures remains unclear.</p><p id="P4">High-resolution techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) offer direct visualization of synaptic ultrastructure and are essential for confirming synapse formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Despite their potential, these methods remain underutilized in the characterization of SH-SY5Y-derived neuronal models.</p><p id="P5">This gap is particularly relevant considering the numerous differentiation protocols designed to enhance the neuronal properties of SH-SY5Y cells. Differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells typically requires specific cell culture medium supplementation. The most common supplement is all-trans retinoic acid (RA), a factor promoting early neuronal development through the activation of nuclear receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Supplementation with additional agents, such as phorbol esters and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), enhance maturation and dopaminergic phenotype <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Other supplements, such as dibutyryl-cAMP, promote neurite extension while cholesterol supports synaptic vesicle formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Recent protocols combining RA, BDNF and B-27<sup>™</sup> in neurobasal medium have also been reported to enhance neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we evaluated the structure and functionality of SH-SY5Y cells, differentiated over 28 days, using live confocal microscopy, protein expression analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and whole-cell patch clamp recordings. We report that while differentiation increased synaptic protein expression, no protocol, including RA, BDNF, cAMP, or cholesterol supplementation, led to mature synapse formation. This highlights the limitations of existing protocols to successfully differentiate SH-SY5Y cells into a functional synaptic model and underscores the need to explore alternatives.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell Culture</title><p id="P7">SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (EMEM, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (hiFBS, Gibco) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S, Gibco) in T-75 flasks, incubated at 37°C 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

They were then detached with a cell scraper and transferred into 1.5mL tubes. The lysate was then sonicated 3x 10 s at 50 % power using the SONOPLUS HD2070 homogenizer (Bandelin) and incubated on ice for further 10 min. The fully lyzed cells were centrifuged at 14.5 x g for 20 min and the supernatant containing the proteins of interest was collected. The protein content was determined using a bicichoninic acid assay (Sigma-Aldrich). The samples were prepared in Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min at 95°C, snap frozen, and stored at -80°C. The samples were equilibrated to 5 µg/well and loaded onto a 10% bisacrylamide gel. The gel was run for 30 min at 20mA, followed by 90 min at 40 mA. The gel was then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Merck) for 70 min at a constant 100 V. The membrane was washed with phosphate buffered saline with 1% Tween (PBST) for 10 min and then incubated with Intercept (PBS) Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences) in PBST for 1h.

To enable gentle medium exchange during imaging, a custom-made perfusion system using 20-gauge needles adapted to a µ-dish. The perfusion system was installed in the LSM 880 confocal microscope (Zeiss).

The cells were stimulated for 2 min with a depolarizing high-potassium solution (Tyrode’s containing 70 mM KCl, 59 mM NaCl and 10 µM AM4-64). This was followed by a 10 min incubation in standard Tyrode’s solution containing 10 µM AM4-64 to allow slow endocytosis staining (Gaffield &amp; Betz, 2007). Non-internalized dye was quenched for 5 min with 0.5 mM SCAS in low-calcium and high-magnesium Tyrode’s solution (0.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), which halts spontaneous re-exocytosis of the endocytosed vesicles. A z-stack was acquired at the region of interest. Then the cells were stimulated with high-potassium Tyrode’s solution and a micrograph was acquired every 2 s for 3 min using a large pinhole (5.42 AU), thus broadening fluorescence detection in the z-plane (depth of focus 0.99 μm) using the laser at 488 nm and 1.8% strength. This allowed us to minimize laser intensity and reduce photobleaching.

Actin-rich membrane protrusions lacking microtubules were identified at neurite tips and branching points, indicative of filopodia and growth cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). These findings are consistent with early axon branching previously described in primary hippocampal neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Dendrites, identified by their larger diameter, the presence of spines, polyribosome clusters, and a less dense cytoskeletal organization, were less frequently observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">During differentiation, we observed fine cellular protrusions between SH-SY5Y cells, particularly at earlier points (DPD 14), that resemble tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. These structures were less prominent at later stages (DPD 28), when neurite-like processes dominated morphology. Although these protrusions superficially resemble structures implicated in intercellular interactions, such as thin membrane bridges, we did not assess cytoskeletal composition, membrane continuity, or intercellular transport, and therefore refrain from making further interpretations regarding their identity or function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, their presence in early-stage cultures may point to dynamic morphological features of SH-SY5Y cells that merit further investigation.</p><p id="P19">In primary neurons and synaptosomes, mature synapses are structurally characterized by a presynaptic bouton containing clusters of small, clear SVs, often arranged in distinct pools and interconnected by filamentous connectors. These boutons feature a defined active zone aligned with the synaptic cleft and a postsynaptic compartment, typically a dendritic spine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. In differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, presynaptic-like structures were observed at axonal boutons containing SVLVs. These vesicles had a mean diameter of approximately 35 nm, which is slightly smaller than typical SV (<sup>∼</sup>45 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, C</xref>). These vesicles appeared to be devoid of any connectors, despite the presence of small clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, zoom-in), which would generally be found in SV pools. This implies the absence of a higher structural synapse organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A,C</xref>) Additionally, the presynapse-like bouton lacked the characteristic active zone and a postsynaptic counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, C</xref>). Similarily, varicosities along axons containing SVLVs and mitochondria are abundantly present. However, at these varicosities also no typical SV architecture, i.e. organized pools, connectors, tethers, and AZ were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The SVLVs were of pleomorphic shape and size, which indicates immature presynaptic compartment formation. We further observed multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which may be easily mistaken for presynaptic terminals due to their small vesicles enclosed in a large membrane, but are distinguishable by the protein decoration on the vesicles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). Large dense core vesicles (LDCV) presenting as 100 to 300nm dark vesicles were also seen in neurites as well as in close proximity to SVLVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). As cholesterol has been implied to aid in SV formation, we further investigated SH-SY5Y cells differentiated by this approach using high trouphput screening of EM sections. Results showed no amelioration in synaptic ultrastructure and was thus not further evaluated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Adding additional neurotrophic factors did not further synapse maturation</title><p id="P20">We attempted to trigger a more mature neuronal state by supplementing the culture with additional neurotrophic factors (NTFs), namely glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), which were subsequently added after DPD14 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. These SH-SY5Y cultures were subjected to protein profile analyses by fluorescent staining and western blotting, ultrastructural investigations, as well as functional assays. Comparative western blot analysis of SH-SY5Y cells differentiated with RA and BDNF alone or additional NTFs showed a slight increases of vGLuT1 and SYP from DPD 21 to DPD 28 in both conditions, but no difference between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Morphological analysis by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, unmerged in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>) revealed that SH-SY5Y cells treated with additional NTFs tended to exhibit more separated neurites in contrast to the prominent axon bundling observed with BDNF and RA alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A1-4</xref>). EM analysis showed that in spite of addional NTFs, presynaptic-like structures lacked a postsynaptic partner, AZ and vesicle connectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). In conclusion, we observed no significant changes following supplementation with additional NTFs, indicating that they do not further promote neuronal maturation in SH-SY5Y cells.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Synaptic activity cannot be achieved by common differentiation methods</title><p id="P21">To evaluate the functional maturation of SH-SY5Y cells, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings in both current clamp and voltage clamp configurations across four experimental conditions, DPD 21 and DPD 28, with and without neurotrophic factor supplementation. Current-clamp recordings demonstrated single action potentials in response to stepwise depolarizing current injection (from -60 to +160 pA in 20pA steps) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Voltage-clamp recordings, holding the cell at -60mV, showed no spontaneous postsynaptic potentials, indicating a lack of detectable spontaneous synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The absence of depolarizing or hyperpolarizing events suggests that differentiated SH-SY5Y cells do not establish functional synaptic connectivity under the applied differentiation protocol. Notably, even prolonged differentiation and trophic support failed to induce functional excitability or voltage-gated conductances typical of mature neurons. These results indicate that despite extended culture and supplementation, differentiated SH-SY5Y cells do not attain electrophysiological properties characteristic of mature, excitable neurons.</p><p id="P22">To further assess stimulus-evoked exocytosis, we performed live-cell imaging using the fluorescent dye AM4-64, which binds reversibly to the plasma membranes and is internalized by endocytic events. subsequent quenching of non-internalized dye enables visualization of endocytosed vesicles. In neurons, recently endocytosed vesicles have a higher probability to undergo evoked exocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. SH-SY5Y cells were assessed at DPD 21 and DPD 28. They were imaged after dye loading and quenching at 2-second intervals during high-potassium stimulation. While some fluoresenct puncta were observed in neurites at DPD 21 and increased in number at DPD 28, their apparent disappearence following stimulation was not due to vesicle exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Instead, time-lapse imaging revealed that vesicles remained fluorescent but moved along neurites and frequently shifted in and out of the imaging plane, which can mimick fluorescence loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S16-19</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">In this study, we evaluated the neuronal properties of SH-SY5Y cells differentiated using established protocols, with or without supplementation with additional neurotrophic factors over a 28-day culture period. Our aim was to assess their suitability as an in-vitro neuronal model so study synaptic properties and processes. While differentiated SH-SY5Y cells exhibit several neuronal features, such as expression of presynaptic proteins, they do not recapitulate the structural and functional aspects characteristic of mature synapses.</p><p id="P24">Our findings indicate that SH-SY5Y cells undergo morphological development reminiscent of primary hippocampal neurons, characterized by rapid neurite outgrowth and expression of β-tubulin III, a marker of mature neurons. At the ultrastructural level, axons and dendrites can be distinguished, and organelles relevant in neuro- and synaptogenesis, such as mitochondria and ER, are present.</p><p id="P25">We observed that presynaptic and postsynaptic markers are expressed under standard differentiation protocols incorporating RA, BDNF, cAMP and B27. Key presynaptic proteins, including synapsin I and synaptophysin, and the postsynaptic scaffold protein PSD95 were abundantly detected. Some clustering of presynaptic proteins was observed; however, no corresponding synaptic puncta were shown to overlap. The diffuse distribution of most of these synaptic proteins resembles their distribution in immature neurons, in which synaptic proteins are often synthesized but not fully trafficked to synaptic sites, resulting in diffuse rather than punctate localization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">The organization of cytoskeletal elements provides insights into SH-SY5Y cell neuronal maturity. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed the presence of intermediate filaments, which are essential for maintaining axonal integrity and function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. SH-SY5Y cells also exhibited actin-rich growth cones and distinct axon- and dendritic-like structures. In mature neurons, such cytoskeletal specializations are essential for synaptic function and neurite stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. Closer examination on the cytoskeleton in Cryo-EM revealed thin extensions containing straight actin bundles, consistent with tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), which transport cellular material between cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. These extensions were more abundant at early differentiation time points and were gradually replaced by axon-like neurites composed of microtubules. In SH-SY5Y cells, TNTs have been shown to mediate the transfer of α-synuclein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>, a protein implicated in Parkinson’s disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">Despite extensive neurite outgrowth, SH-SY5Y cells failed to form functional synaptic connections.

LDCVs were also observed. Taking together with the diffuse non-punctate distribution of synaptic proteins, these findings suggest that SH-SY5Y cells are unable to initiate synaptogenesis.</p><p id="P28">To further promote synaptogenesis, we differentiated SH-SY5Y cells in the presence of additional neurotrophic growth factors (GDNF, CNTF, IGF1), which have been reported to support neuronal maturation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. However, biochemical and structural analyses revealed no significant enhancement in synaptic protein expression or synaptic ultrastructure. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that SH-SY5Y cells, despite additional NTF supplementation, exhibited only single action potentials, reflecting limited excitability likely due to insufficient ion channel density or overall neuronal immaturity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. Such isolated action potentials are typical of immature neurons, in which ion channel kinetics and synaptic inputs are not yet fully developed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. The lack of spontaneous synaptic activity in voltage-clamp recordings further supports the conclusion that SH-SY5Y cells lack functional maturation.</p><p id="P29">To investigate potential endocytic and exocytic activity, we used dye AM4-64 (S. O. Rizzoli &amp; Betz, 2004; D’Aloia et al., 2024). Fluorescent puncta, corresponding to recently endocytosed vesicles, were observed in neurites, but rather than undergoing exocytosis upon repeat stimulation, they exhibited directional movements along neurites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. This behavior reflects intracellular transport dynamics, rather than exocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. The lack of neuron-like vesicle recycling relates to the absence of proper synapses in this cell model. As AM4-64 labels all membrane-bound compartments resulting from endocytosis, including early and recycling endosomes, lysosomes, and transport vesicles, the observed motility could be attributed to trafficking of these organelles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P30">We hypothesize that the failure of SH-SY5Y to undergo synaptogenesis may stem from a lack of target recognition mediated by cell adhesion molecules such as cadherins and integrins.

Z-projected images of ROI with small zoom-ins on puncta pre-stimulation (leftside) and z-projected images with zoom-ins on puncta acquired post-stimulation with KCl after 120s (rightside). Zoom-ins show the movement of labelled vesicles (red arrow). Scale bars: 10 µm and 2 µm (zoom-ins). Respective current-clamp mode recordings (right side on the top) to the corresponding immunofluorescence images demonstrated singular action potentials in response to stepwise depolarizing currents. y-axis shows membrane potential (mV); x-axis shows time (ms) Voltage-clamp recordings (right side on the bottom) showed no pontaneous post-synaptic potentials (sPSPs), suggesting no signals received from neighboring cells. x-axis shows time (ms); y-axis shows spontaneous currents (pA).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207554-f005"/></fig></floats-group></article>
