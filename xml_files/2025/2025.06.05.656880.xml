Injury to the somatosensory nervous system causes maladaptive plasticity that initiates and maintains chronic pain. Emerging evidence suggests that inflammatory cells of the innate immune system shape the response of the injured nervous system and thereby contribute to the pathogenesis of pain. Data from preclinical models and human patient biopsies have specifically implicated peripheral macrophage populations for a pro-algesic role, yet how these cell types influence damaged sensory neurons and whether they directly contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability is unclear. Here, we have developed an iPSC co-culture system to study the interactions of macrophages and sensory neurons in a fully humanised experimental model. We found that analogous to endogenous counterparts, iPSC-derived macrophages (iMacs) display a dynamic molecular and functional profile that is highly dependent on neuronal state. Co-culture with injured iPSC-derived sensory neurons (iSNs) induces morphological, gene expression, and secretory profile changes in iMacs that are consistent with the response of macrophages to nerve injury <italic>in vivo.</italic> iMacs in turn amplify spontaneous firing in damaged sensory neurons, implicating macrophages in this cardinal feature of neuropathic pain. These results illustrate the utility of an iPSC-based model to study signalling between these two cell types; they support a role for macrophages in directly amplifying damaged sensory neuron activity and highlight disrupting pathological signalling between these cell types as a promising strategy for future analgesic drug development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Neuropathic pain affects over 5 million people in the UK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, most of whom are failed by current treatments and live with often disabling pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Our knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology of pain progression has increased rapidly over recent years but this has so far failed to translate to major breakthroughs in treatment approaches. This suggests a need to expand the cell and signalling pathways traditionally targeted and to develop more advanced translational platforms in which new drug targets can be defined and tested.</p><p id="P4">Pain arises following damage because of maladaptive plasticity within the somatosensory nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Excessive electrical activity of sensory neurons is key to the initiation and maintenance of neuropathic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, and this has led to direct targeting of these neurons being the primary focus of analgesic development. However, a multitude of interacting cell types occupy the sensory nerve and dorsal root ganglion (DRG, where the cell bodies of sensory neurons are located) and contribute to nervous system plasticity following injury. Within this context, the precise environmental and cellular cues that drive sensory neuron hyperexcitability are not fully understood. Emerging evidence suggests that inflammatory cells of the innate immune system make an important contribution to neuropathic pain, but exactly which cell types are involved, and the critical signalling pathways that they engage are still unclear. Bridging this gap in our knowledge is important as a better understanding may allow us to disrupt pathological signalling for therapeutic gain.</p><p id="P5">In animal models of peripheral nerve damage, macrophages at the site of injury and in the corresponding DRG increase in number<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and undergo major changes in gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. These cells have been implicated in nerve regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> and depletion studies have suggested that they initiate and maintain neuropathic pain behaviours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Macrophage populations have similarly been associated with the human condition, with macrophage-associated genes being found enriched in DRG and nerve trunk tissue from patients with neuropathic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Using Morton's neuroma as a model system for human neuropathic pain, a recent study found a positive correlation between greater macrophage presence and higher paroxysmal pain scores in patients and specifically identified an increased intraneural density of CD163<sup>+</sup>MARCO<sup>+</sup> macrophages in neuroma tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, despite the evidence implying a prominent role for macrophages in neuropathic pain, we do not yet have a good understanding of how macrophages and damaged sensory neurons interact, and crucially, whether macrophages directly contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability.</p><p id="P6">Our understanding of macrophage involvement in pain pathophysiology has been greatly advanced by the use of experimental animal models. However, most drug targets identified in these models have failed to translate to patient benefit, which could in part be due to differences between the species. This makes a compelling argument to diversify our experimental platforms and to establish relevant testing models based on human tissue. Here, we have developed the first humanised co-culture system of sensory neurons (iSNs) and macrophages (iMacs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Our findings indicate that iSNs shape the morphology and gene expression and secretion of iMacs. This profile is altered to a putatively more pro-inflammatory state upon neuronal injury, and we identify features consistent with the response of macrophages to nerve injury <italic>in vivo.</italic> Finally, we show that iMacs are capable of directly augmenting damaged iSN hyperexcitability, thus replicating a cardinal feature of neuropathic pain. These findings demonstrate that disrupting pathological signalling between macrophages and damaged sensory neurons is a promising approach for future analgesic development. We therefore present our system which could be used as a translationally relevant analgesic discovery and testing platform.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>iPSC culture and maintenance</title><p id="P7">Experiments were conducted with three iPSC lines that have been previously characterised and described; SBAD2 (derived from skin fibroblasts of a 51-year-old male<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>), SBAD3 (derived from skin fibroblasts of a 36-year-old female<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>) and SFCi55ZsG (derived from skin fibroblasts of a female donor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>). iPSCs were maintained in mTesR Plus media (Stem Cell Technologies, #100-0276) on Matrigel (Corning, #354234) coated dishes.

Resting membrane potential values were corrected offline for a liquid junction potential of -15.5mV. One minute following establishing whole cell access, a two-minute recording was made in bridge mode to derive resting membrane potential and spontaneous action potential firing. Input resistance (R<sub>input</sub>) was derived from the membrane potential deflection caused by a 20pA hyperpolarising current pulse at −60 mV. To determine the minimal current injection to fire an action potential (rheobase), cells were depolarised from a holding potential of -60 mV by current steps (50 ms) of increasing magnitude (Δ10 pA) until an action potential was generated. Recordings were discarded in cases of poor whole-cell breakthrough (evident from excessive leak current or recording instability), or if neurons failed to fire an action potential to any level of current.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> scRNA-seq dataset of mouse myeloid cells</title><sec id="S17"><title>Surgical nerve damage in mice</title><p id="P21">Male and female C57BL/6JolaHsd mice were purchased from Envigo at 7 weeks of age and housed in groups of up to five in individually ventilated cages in a 12h light-dark cycle. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the United Kingdom Home Office Legislation (Scientific Procedures Act, 1986) and were approved by the Home Office to be carried out at King's College London. Mice underwent one of two models of nerve damage: partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL) or sciatic nerve crush. For both procedures, animals were anaesthetised under 2% isoflurane and pre-operatively administered 0.1mg/kg of the analgesic buprenorphine subcutaneously (s.c). After shaving the fur covering the left hip and leg region, the sciatic nerve was exposed via blunt dissection. For PSNL, roughly half of the nerve was tightly ligated with a suture (5.0 Vicryl suture, Ethicon, #W9982). For nerve crush, Watchmaker forceps (Dumont, #0304-5-PO) were placed horizontally around the nerve and pressed tightly for 10 seconds, the forceps were then placed vertically around the same section of nerve and again pressed tightly for 10 seconds. For sham surgeries the sciatic nerve was exposed but left untouched. In all cases, the wound was stapled shut with a Reflex 7mm metal wound clip (Fine Science Tools, #12032-07). Mice were transferred to a clean cage and left to recover in the animal unit. Animals were weighed and checked for autotomy daily for at least 3 days following surgery and wound clips were removed within 7 days of surgery.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Nerve dissociation and processing</title><p id="P22">1 week or 15 weeks after surgery, mice were transcardially perfused with 10 ml PBS to remove leukocytes from circulating blood. Ligated, crushed or uninjured (sham) nerves were dissected and placed into a petri dish containing F12 medium (Gibco, #21765-029). Ligatures were removed with tweezers, if still present, and nerves were cut to 0.5 cm, ensuring equal lengths of nerve either side of the ligation/crush site. Following dissections, samples were transferred into wells of a standard 96-well PCR plate containing 51μl of the following digestion mix: 6.25 mg/ml collagenase type IA (Sigma Aldrich, #C9891), 0.2% Pronase (Millipore, #53702), 0.4% Hyaluronidase (ABNOVA, #P52330) in F12 medium. Spring scissors were used to chop the tissue into small pieces (50x chops, cleaning scissors between samples with 100% ethanol). After this manual dissociation, the plate was incubated on a shaking platform (220 rotations per minute) at 37°C for 30 minutes.

We generated iSNs from one healthy control iPSC line (SBAD2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. These robustly differentiated into a homogeneous culture of neurons with extensive neurite outgrowth, and expressed the sensory neuron marker, BRN3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Concomitantly, we used a well-characterised embryoid body-based protocol to generate primitive macrophages from iPSCs (iMacs) in a process reminiscent of yolk sac haematopoiesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. iMacs were generated from three healthy control iPSC lines (SBAD2, SBAD3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and a previously characterised ZsGreen knockin-line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>). We confirmed successful iMac differentiation for all three lines based on morphology, expression of canonical genes such as IBA1, CD45 and CD64, and phagocytic competence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supp. Fig.1a-e</xref>). Macrophages are highly plastic, and their profile is dependent on the tissue in which they reside. iMacs are similarly able to acquire specific tissue-resident macrophage phenotypes in co-culture environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> but until now they have not been co-cultured with sensory neurons. iSNs and iMacs co-cultured in neuronal-based media with the addition of low levels of Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (M-CSF) were viable, and iMacs largely associated with clusters of iSN cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). While iMacs cultured alone in neuronal media exhibited an elongated or amoeboid morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), iMacs associated with iSN cell bodies took on a more complex morphology, including a reduced size with an increased number of processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f-h</xref>), consistent with the ramified morphology of endoneurial macrophages in the sciatic nerve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Co-culture successfully maintained the iMac populations for long periods (6 weeks), with iMac morphology appearing to increase in complexity at these time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>).

These clusters had reduced adherence, making the standard processing for immunocytochemistry (ICC) challenging. We therefore repeated experiments in co-cultures of iSNs transduced with AAV9-hSyn-mCherry and ZsGreen iMacs, which allowed us to monitor cell dynamics by endogenous fluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supp. Fig. 2b and c</xref>). Most iMacs were observed in neuron soma-associated clusters and appeared to exhibit a more ameboid profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supp Fig. 2ci</xref>), although quantification of individual cell morphology was hindered by the density of clusters. iMacs not associated with clusters remained amongst the neurites and typically were large with a flattened morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supp. Fig. 2cii</xref>). Our axotomy model resulted in a large amount of cellular debris, composed of severed neurites and dead neurons. Addition of iMacs to cultures of damaged iSNs starkly reduced the amount of this debris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), presumably via phagocytosis. To directly test this, we labelled iSNs prior to axotomy with AAV-hSyn-eGFP and could observe GFP+ particles within iMacs as early as 24hrs after co-culture, suggesting that iMacs actively phagocytosed neuronal debris from the cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Next, we asked whether the secretory profile of iMacs was also neuron state dependent by performing a discovery (n=3) multiplex immunoassay for 14 soluble factors with previous association to nerve injury and pain.

Similar to previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, we found that iMacs cultured alone generally secreted more of the cytokines and chemokines than iMacs co-cultured with healthy or damaged iSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Within our targeted panel, iMacs secreted more CCL3 and CCL4 when co-cultured with damaged compared to healthy iSNs, which we verified in single-target immunoassays performed on independent and larger sample sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f and g</xref>). Both chemokines contribute to neuropathic pain behaviours in mouse models of nerve injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.

Cells from each condition were labelled with an identifying hashtag antibody before being pooled into a single tube (to reduce sequencing variability) and scRNA-seq was then performed. Unbiased clustering separated iMacs into four discrete clusters marked by varying levels of SPP1, which encodes osteopontin, MRC1, which encodes the mannose receptor CD206, and MKI67, which marks actively cycling cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-b</xref>).

In addition to these marker genes, cells from each condition could be defined by distinct patterns of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). We explored whether iMac gene expression was dependent on iSN state (healthy vs damaged) and performed hypothesis-generating (owing to the single biological replicate) pseudo-bulk analysis to compare the two conditions. iMacs cultured with damaged iSNs were enriched for expression of several genes that characterise a neurodegenerative disease-associated microglial (DAM) state (such as ABCA1, LPL, CD9 and APOC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>) and those associated with pro-inflammatory conditions (such as C15orf48, CXCL8, NR1H3 and SLAMF7), while they exhibited a concomitant downregulation of genes associated with alternatively activated macrophage populations (such as DAB2, STAB1 and MMP12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary data table 1</xref>). Several of the genes enriched in iMacs co-cultured with damaged iSNs have previously been implicated in neuropathic pain.

Global expression profile alignment illustrated that injury-enriched mouse clusters mostly mapped to injury-induced SPP1<sup>high</sup>MRC1<sup>neg</sup> iMacs, while resident macrophage populations map to both iMacs cultured alone (SPP1<sup>low</sup>MRC1<sup>pos</sup>) and iMacs cultured with healthy iSNs (SPP1<sup>high</sup>MRC1<sup>pos</sup>). Finally, we observed enrichment of our three neuropathic pain-associated genes (Lgals3, Atf3 and Fabp5) across murine injury states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supp. Fig. 8b</xref>). These data illustrate the heterogeneity and dynamic nature of the macrophage response to nerve injury <italic>in vivo.</italic> They also demonstrate shared features between our injury-induced iMac populations and macrophage clusters observed at acute timepoints following nerve injury <italic>in vivo,</italic> supporting the validity of the <italic>in vitro</italic> model.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>iMacs augment hyperexcitability associated with neuron damage</title><p id="P34">Hyperexcitability and ectopic activity of sensory neurons are fundamental drivers of neuropathic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Macrophages secrete many soluble mediators that can sensitise sensory neurons but there is no causal evidence demonstrating that macrophages directly influence sensory neuron activity following damage. We performed patch clamp recordings to assess neuron injury-induced changes in excitability and whether the presence of iMacs further influenced neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). In terms of passive membrane properties, damaged iSNs exhibited a depolarised resting membrane potential, an increase in input resistance and a reduced capacitance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b-d</xref>). The latter likely reflects the loss of neurites and a shrinkage of soma size. Evoked action potential threshold (rheobase) was also reduced following neuronal damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e and f</xref>); however, this result should be considered in the context of a reduced capacitance of these neurons. While these data provide evidence for hyperexcitability following damage, there were no differences in passive properties or evoked firing between injured iSN with or without iMacs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b-f</xref>). Uninjured nociceptors are usually electrically dormant in the absence of stimulation and even following nerve injury paradigms, spontaneous activity is only seen at low levels <italic>in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>,</italic> which contrasts with <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> mouse DRG neurons exhibiting spontaneous activity have greater input resistance than those that do not<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> and so we asked whether our injury paradigm induced changes in spontaneous activity. A greater proportion of iSNs exhibited spontaneous activity following injury (3 of 42 healthy iSNs vs 19 of 87 damaged iSNs, p=0.046, Fisher's exact test, with and without iMac groups combined), but there was no difference between conditions with or without iMacs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>). However, while incidence was no different, we observed a stark difference in the frequency of firing of those neurons exhibiting spontaneous activity. Damaged iSNs alone fired spontaneous action potentials (APs) at low frequency (6.8 ± 5.0 APs/min), whereas equivalent neurons co-cultured with iMacs exhibited firing at considerably increased frequency (40.5 ± 13.1 APs/min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h-i</xref>). Together, these data suggest that neuronal damage induces hyperexcitability. They also show that spontaneous activity, a cardinal feature of neuropathic pain, can be directly augmented by macrophages.</p><p id="P35">To look for evidence of intercellular communication, we performed ligand-receptor analysis with a recently published dataset of healthy iSNs at different stages of maturity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.

CXCL8 (IL-8) has also been shown to heighten the excitability of sensory neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>, although which receptor this requires is not yet known.

LGALS3 encodes the multifunctional protein, Galectin-3, which is a TREM2 ligand with described roles in several aspects of macrophage biology.

Beyond gene expression changes, we observed increased secretion of CCL3 and CCL4 from iMacs co-cultured with damaged iSNs.
