In contrast, understanding of effects in cognitive brain areas, which potentially underpin more impactful effects of injury, remains limited. The current study addressed this limitation by using electroencephalography to index responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS-EEG) applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). In 18 mTBI patients and 22 healthy controls, TMS-EEG was used to index cortical inhibition and long-term depression (LTD)-like plasticity within DLPFC. These were assessed using paired-pulse TMS (short-[SICI] and long-[LICI] interval intracortical inhibition) and continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), respectively. Functional effects of injury were assessed via the N-back and Trail Making Test. Responses were quantified in both temporal (i.e., TMS-evoked potentials; TEPs) and spectral (i.e., TMS-related oscillations; TROs) domains. For TEPs, measures of inhibition and plasticity both tended to be reduced by mTBI. In contrast, TRO data suggested a contradictory increased response of patients to both paired-pulse stimulation and cTBS that was specific to high-frequency bands. In addition, while TMT performance was reduced in the mTBI group, this was unrelated to neurophysiological effects of injury. These findings highlight novel effects of mTBI on DLPFC neurophysiology and emphasise the importance of considering both evoked and induced activity when examining neurophysiological effects of mTBI.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can occur following any knock to the head and is often caused by common events like falls, motor vehicle accidents and contact sport. While once considered short-term injuries, we now know mTBI can cause significant and prolonged side-effects in a large proportion of patients. Up to 80% report ongoing symptoms 12 months after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">McMahon <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>), including motor deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">De Beaumont <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Pearce <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>), increased rates of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kerr <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>) and suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Fralick <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>), a 5-fold increase in the development of mild cognitive impairment and earlier onset of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Guskiewicz <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>). Despite this, we still lack a clear understanding of how the brain is altered after mTBI, which factors determine the clinical trajectory faced by a patient – particularly those that determine rapid resolution vs. prolonged deficit – and what interventions can be applied to influence recovery. Given the high global incidence of these injuries (69 million TBIs annually, ~80% of which are mTBI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Dewan <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>), this demonstrates the pressing need for a better understanding of how mTBI influences the brain.</p><p id="P3">Although mTBI is rarely associated with structural damage on conventional diagnostic imaging, changes in brain function have been well documented. One method that has been applied frequently in this space is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique able to assess excitability within intracortical circuits, and quantify the brain’s ability to change the nature of its synaptic connectivity (i.e., neuroplasticity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Suppa <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>). Conventional application of TMS involves stimulation over primary motor cortex (M1), with responses recorded in peripheral muscles providing indirect measures of cortical excitability. Using this approach, several studies have demonstrated injury-related changes in intracortical inhibitory circuits involving gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">De Beaumont <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Tremblay <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">De Beaumont <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Miller <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Pearce <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Di Virgilio <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Edwards and Christie 2017</xref>) receptors, as well as an altered neuroplastic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">De Beaumont <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Pearce <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>). These changes have been observed across broad post-injury timeframes ranging from days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Pearce <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>) to decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">De Beaumont <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Pearce <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>), and have been associated with deficits in motor learning and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">De Beaumont <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P4">While conventional TMS has provided important neurophysiological insights into mTBI, the direct relevance of this information is limited to the specific cortical circuits that contribute to generation of the MEP. In contrast, effects of mTBI involve brain networks that extend beyond M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Morelli <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>), and understanding the neurophysiological changes within these areas is likely to provide important insight into the cognitive effects of injury. One approach to address this limitation is to use electroencephalography to record the response to TMS (TMS-EEG) when applied over non-motor brain areas. This generates a TMS-evoked EEG potential (TEP), the amplitude and spatio-temporal characteristics of which reflect activity of cortical circuits within the stimulated cortex and interconnected areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Hernandez-Pavon <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>). Several recent studies have used this approach to investigate effects of mTBI within the dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC). Interestingly, results suggested an injury-related decrease in the excitation-inhibition balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Coyle <italic>et al</italic>. 2023b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Coyle <italic>et al</italic>. 2024</xref>), in addition to changes in the neuroplastic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Coyle <italic>et al</italic>. 2023a</xref>). Furthermore, the nature of these effects varied over the post-injury period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Coyle <italic>et al</italic>. 2023b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Coyle <italic>et al</italic>. 2023a</xref>).</p><p id="P5">These studies demonstrate the utility of TMS-EEG for quantifying neurophysiological effects of mTBI in DLPFC. In addition, they also suggest that further examination of injury-related changes in this area is warranted. The current study therefore sought to build on the existing work in two ways. First, it is possible to use TMS-EEG to record the response to the paired-pulse TMS measures of short-(SICI) and long (LICI) interval intracortical inhibition. While effects of these paradigms on the TEP are unlikely to directly reflect the mechanisms that have been defined in motor cortex with conventional TMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Premoli <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>), they nonetheless provide an additional index of neuronal activation/modulation that might provide unique insights to the effects of mTBI. Second, previous assessment of neuroplasticity was limited to an intervention thought to induce long-term potentiation (LTP)-like effects, whereas previous work from our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Opie <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">De Beaumont <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>) suggests mTBI also influences long-term-depression (LTD)-like mechanisms. Consequently, the current study used TMS-EEG applied to DLPFC to assess mTBI-related changes in the response to SICI and LICI, and continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS; thought to induce LTD-like changes). To investigate how neurophysiological effects of injury relate to functional deficits, performance on the N-back and Trail Making Test was also related to TMS-EEG measures; these tests involve DLPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Owen <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Zakzanis <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>) and are sensitive to mTBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Arciniega <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Li <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P6">A total of 40 participants were recruited, including 18 that had sustained an mTBI within the previous 24 months (mean age ± SD: 33.1 ± 13.2 years) and 22 healthy controls (28.8 ± 8.19) with no history of head injury. mTBI was defined as a head injury causing any of: <italic>(1)</italic> a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13-15 30 minutes after injury; <italic>(2)</italic> a period of post-traumatic amnesia not greater than 24 hours or <italic>(3)</italic> a loss of consciousness no greater than 30 minutes.

EMG was amplified (1000x) and band-pass filtered (20Hz-1kHz) using a CED1902 (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK) prior to digitisation at 2kHz through a CED1401 interface (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK).

The electrode impedance was maintained at less than 10 kΩ for the duration of all recordings. During collection of EEG, participants were instructed to keep their face relaxed, and to avoid blinking where possible. Auditory input during stimulation was minimised by playing white noise through in-ear headphones, with volume adjusted until TMS could no longer be perceived, or the upper limit of comfort was reached.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Tests of Executive function</title><p id="P11">Participants completed two computerised tests (via the Psychology Experimental Building [PEBL] platform; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Mueller and Piper 2014</xref>) of executive function at the beginning of each session, including: <list list-type="simple" id="L1"><list-item><label>-</label><p id="P12"><bold>Trail Making Test (TMT):</bold> In a series of 2 subtests, 26 consecutive numbers (TMT-A), or 13 consecutive numbers and 13 consecutive letters (TMT-B), were displayed across the screen.

The coil was held tangentially to the scalp and at an angle of 45 degrees to the sagittal plane, resulting in an anteriorly directed current flow in the brain. Stimulation was initially applied over the hand representation of M1, optimised to generate the largest and most consistent response within the right FDI following moderately suprathreshold TMS. Resting motor threshold (RMT) was identified for this location, corresponding to the stimulus intensity (% maximum stimulator output; %MSO) producing an MEP amplitude ≥ 50 μV in at least 5 out of 10 consecutive trials. Following identification of rMT, all subsequent stimulation was applied over the left DLPFC, identified as the midpoint between EEG electrodes F3 and F5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Rusjan <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). For both M1 and DLPFC sites, location of stimulation was logged relative to the MNI-ICBM152 head model using neuro-navigation software (Brainsight 2, Rogue, Canada). To avoid anticipation of the stimulus, all non-interventional TMS was applied at a rate of 0.2 Hz ± 10%. All TMS was applied with the EEG cap in place.</p><sec id="S9"><title>SICI &amp; LICI</title><p id="P16">SICI was assessed using a 70% rMT conditioning stimulus, 120% rMT test stimulus and interstimulus interval (ISI) of 2 ms. LICI was assessed with conditioning and test stimuli set at 120% rMT and ISI of 100 ms. Single-pulse stimuli were additionally applied at 120% rMT and 70% rMT: while the former allowed quantification of cortical excitability, the latter was used for correction of the TEP generated by SICIs conditioning stimulus (see below). As 104 stimuli were applied for each condition, assessment of ICI involved a total of 416 stimuli. To avoid a loss of participant attention, this was applied over 8 blocks of 52 stimuli, with each block containing equal numbers of each stimulus condition applied in a pseudo-randomised order.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Continuous theta burst stimulation</title><p id="P17">Continuous TBS involved bursts of three stimuli applied at 50 Hz that were repeated at 5 Hz for 40s, totalling 600 pulses<sup>32</sup>. This was applied over DLPFC at an intensity of 70% rMT using a Super Rapid stimulator (Magstim, Dyfed, UK). To avoid loss of stimuli, intensity was capped at 52% MSO for all participants, resulting in capped intensities for 7 mTBI patients and 13 healthy controls. Stimulus intensity was recalibrated over M1 for this machine, due to the different coil geometry and stimulus waveform (biphasic). Effects of cTBS within DLPFC were quantified by recording single-pulse TEPs before (Pre), directly after (Post 0) and 30 mins after (Post 30) application of the intervention. These data were collected using the branding iron coil and Magstim 200<sup>2</sup> stimulators (see above). Each TEP block was applied at 120% rMT, involved 104 stimuli and was recorded as two blocks of 52 to avoid loss of attention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Data Analysis</title><p id="P18">EEG data was analysed using MATLAB (R2021b, The Mathworks, USA) with EEGLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Delorme and Makeig 2004</xref>), Fieldtrip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Oostenveld <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>) and the TMS-EEG signal analyser (TESA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Rogasch <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>) toolboxes, whereas figures were generated using the matplotlib toolbox in python (v3.11).</p><sec id="S12"><title>Pre-processing</title><p id="P19">For recordings from both sessions, data were epoched around the TMS pulse (±1500ms) and baseline corrected (cTBS session: -1000 to -10 ms; ICI session: -1000 to -110 ms). The peak of the artifact produced by TMS was then removed by cutting the data from -6 to 13 ms (corresponding to the test stimulus in all conditions and encompassing SICIs conditioning and test stimulus), and -110 to -50 ms (LICI condition only, removing the conditioning stimulus artefact) and replacing the excised section using cubic interpolation. Data were consequently downsampled to 1000 Hz and visually inspected for noisy electrodes and epochs. Given the differences in TMS artefact for each of the ICI conditions, data from each stimulus paradigm were split into separate blocks for the remainder of the analysis. In contrast, data from the TBS session remained concatenated. The source utilised noise-discarding (SOUND) filter was then applied to reduce the large artifacts associated with TMS, in addition to replacing missing electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Mutanen <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Mutanen <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>). A regularisation parameter of 0.1 was used and 10 iterations were applied. An initial round of independent component analysis (ICA) was then run using the FastICA algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hyvärinen and Oja 2000</xref>) and independent components (ICs) representing the tail of the TMS artefact were removed. High-pass (&gt; 1 Hz) and notch (48-52 Hz) butterworth filters were then applied using the <italic>tesa_filtbutter</italic> function (zero phase, fourth order), prior to application of a second round of Fast ICA. ICs associated with ocular artifacts and persistent EMG activity were identified using the <italic>tesa_compselect</italic> function and removed after manual confirmation.

Consistent with previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Opie <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Opie <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Sasaki <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>), we therefore implemented a subtraction procedure to remove the TEP generated by the conditioning stimulus. This was achieved by aligning the single pulse TEPs applied at 120% rMT (for LICI) or 70% rMT (for SICI) to coincide with the timing of each conditioning stimulus (-100 ms for LICI; -2 ms for SICI) and subtracting them from the paired-pulse data.

For both local and global analyses, group-averaged data from baseline (TBS session) or test alone (ICI session) conditions was inspected to identify timing of commonly investigated TEP peaks, revealing early (P30, N45, P60) and late (N100, P180) components. However, given the high likelihood of sensory contributions to the late components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Biabani <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Conde <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Biabani <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Gordon <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Rocchi <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Biabani <italic>et al</italic>. 2024</xref>), TEP quantification focussed exclusively on the early peaks. As the timing of the early components was consistent across sessions and groups, quantification of TEP amplitude used consistent time periods across all stimulus conditions. For ROI analyses, the timing of each peak was first identified in group averaged test alone/Pre data as the maximum positive peaks between 22 – 37 ms (P30) and 53 – 67 ms (P60) and maximum negative peak between 38 – 52 ms (N45). The amplitude of each peak was then calculated as the average of the signal ± 5 ms relative to the timing of the peak, corresponding to 28 – 38 ms (P30), 39 – 49 ms (N45) and 56 – 66 ms (P60). These periods were then used for quantification of peak amplitudes within paired-pulse and post cTBS data. For global analyses, component amplitudes were examined across slightly broader time windows (P30: 22 – 37 ms; N45: 38 – 52 ms; P60: 53 – 67 ms) that better encapsulated peak timing across the scalp. Individual changes in TEP amplitude due to paired-pulse stimulation or cTBS were quantified relative to the size of the test TEP or baseline TEP, respectively.

For all single-pulse conditions, power values were then baseline corrected relative to the -800 to -400 ms pre-stimulus period. However, for paired-pulse conditions, the use of individual trial data meant that an influence of the conditioning stimulus remained present in our estimates of total power. Prior to baseline correction, the paired-pulse correction procedure was therefore repeated for SICI and LICI in the frequency domain. Following this, normalised indices of changes in oscillatory power associated with paired-pulse stimulation, or application of cTBS, were quantified. This was achieved by quantifying the percentage change in the area under the power curve (AUC) for paired-pulse and post-TBS data, relative to single-pulse and pre-TBS data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><sec id="S16"><title>TEP data - ROI analysis</title><p id="P23">Raw TEP data for each peak (P30, N45, P60) were compared between stimulus conditions (ICI: Test, SICI, LICI; cTBS: Pre, Post 0, Post 30) and groups (HC, mTBI) using Bayesian generalised linear mixed models (GLMM).

This was achieved by using TMS-EEG applied over DLPFC to index SICI and LICI (assessing intracortical inhibition), as well as the response to cTBS (assessing LTD-like plasticity), in participants that had suffered an mTBI in the previous 2 years. These responses were then compared to a group of healthy control participants without a history of head injury. For analyses in the time domain (i.e., TEPs), application of both paired-pulse TMS and cTBS modulated early TEP amplitude, but this was only apparent in the healthy control group. In contrast, analyses of the spectral response to TMS (i.e., TROs) revealed modulatory effects of all paradigms in both groups. However, the mTBI group tended to show an increased inhibitory response in higher frequency bands. Additionally, post-intervention responses to cTBS differentially predicted cognitive performance. Together these outcomes provide new evidence that mTBI is associated with neurophysiological changes within DLPFC.</p><sec id="S30"><title>Response to SICI and LICI</title><p id="P41">Alterations to intracortical inhibitory function represent some of the most reported outcomes of studies applying TMS after mTBI. In particular, several conventional TMS studies have identified injury-related changes in the activity of intracortical circuits involving GABAB receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">De Beaumont <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Tremblay <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">De Beaumont <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Miller <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Pearce <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Di Virgilio <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Edwards and Christie 2017</xref>), with some evidence also suggesting changes in GABAA-mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Pearce <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>). Importantly, this altered inhibitory function has been linked to mTBI severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">De Beaumont <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>), demonstrating the potential clinical relevance of these neurophysiological alterations. While these observations are important, a significant limitation of the field has been that injury-related changes to specific TMS-based indices of inhibitory function (i.e., via L/SICI or the cortical silent period) have only been recorded from primary motor cortex. In contrast, non-motor areas of cortex are likely to be important in the cognitive effects of mTBI; quantifying how inhibitory function in these areas is influenced by injury therefore has the potential to better inform our understanding of how cognitive side-effects develop following mTBI.</p><p id="P42">Within the current study, the control group showed inhibition of P30 in response to SICI (for both ROI and global analyses), whereas LICI inhibited N45 (ROI analyses only), and these effects are consistent with findings from some previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Rogasch <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Desforges <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Takano <italic>et al</italic>. 2025</xref>). While it is well established that conventional measures of SICI and LICI (i.e., those quantifying the response to stimulation with MEPs) reflect GABAergic processes, the mechanisms underpinning these measures when indexed with TMS-EEG remain unclear. However, it is important to note that a pharmacological study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Premoli <italic>et al</italic>. (2018)</xref> suggests that TMS-EEG indices of the response to paired-pulse stimulation are unlikely to be direct representations of their MEP-based counterpart. Consequently, the current state of the literature cannot support a specific interpretation of the mechanisms contributing to TMS-EEG indices of SICI and LICI, and further investigation is required. Nonetheless, it seems reasonable to suggest that these paradigms modulate neural activity, and that the nature of this modulation differs between paradigms; this is demonstrated by both MEP- and TEP-based indices.</p><p id="P43">In contrast to the control group, the mTBI group failed to demonstrate any significant changes in TEP amplitude in response to either SICI or LICI, and this was consistent across local and global analyses. Consequently, our time-domain data suggest that mTBI is associated with a reduction in the modulatory effects of SICI and LICI within DLPFC. However, it’s important to note that normalised indices of inhibition failed to provide sufficient evidence for differences between groups. Within the ROI analysis, consistent differences were noted for LICI of the N45, but these failed to meet our predefined criteria for practical significance. Consequently, further work is needed to better elucidate the nature of these effects. One important factor to be considered in future studies is standardisation of test TEP amplitude. This is common practice in conventional paired-pulse TMS measures, as the amplitude of the test motor-evoked potential can influence the amount of inhibition recorded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Opie and Semmler 2014</xref>). While we found no statistical evidence for between group differences in the response to single-pulse stimulation (in either local or global analyses), the 89% HDIs for ROI data suggest that the test TEP for all peaks of interest varied over a relatively broad range (P30: -0.3 to 1.6 μV; N45: -1.1 to 1.2 μV; P60: 0.05 to 2.4 μV), which would have increased variability of the normalised data. Standardisation of response amplitude was omitted from the current study as data collection began prior to the required tools being readily available. Toolboxes for adjusting stimulation parameters online to optimise TEPs using real-time feedback have recently been released and could be used in future studies (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Casarotto <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P44">To further explore the neurophysiological effects of mTBI, the spectral response to stimulation was also examined. In healthy controls, application of LICI was associated with inhibition of all oscillatory bands, and this was apparent in both ROI and global analyses. This pattern of response is consistent with outcomes reported by several previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Farzan <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Garcia Dominguez <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Rogasch <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Desforges <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>), possibly reflecting generalised inhibition of DLPFC output by LICIs activation of GABAB-mediated processes, although pharmacological validation of the underlying mechanisms is currently missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Rogasch <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>). For the mTBI group, effects were consistent with the control group at the global level, but failed to include the alpha and lower beta bands in ROI analyses. However, there were no between-group differences in normalised LICI, locally or globally, for any band. Consequently, differences in ROI analyses may be more reflective of slight variability in the topographic distribution of the response to stimulation in these sensor-level recordings, as opposed to specific effects of mTBI. Future work implementing comparisons of spatially filtered data will be important for clarification here. Nonetheless, when taken together, the data suggests that the inhibitory response to LICI within the spectral domain is maintained in DLPFC after mTBI. While this may appear contradictory to results in the time domain, it is important to note that our spectral analysis quantified total power. This metric includes inputs from both event-locked (i.e., those predominantly influencing time domain responses) and non-event-locked processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Roach and Mathalon 2008</xref>), which may explain the disparity between temporal and spectral results.</p><p id="P45">For SICI, ROI analyses in both groups failed to identify significant changes in any band. For the control group, this contrasts findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Desforges <italic>et al</italic>. (2022)</xref>, who reported inhibition across all frequency bands, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cash <italic>et al</italic>. (2016)</xref>, who reported inhibition specific to the alpha band. However, it seems likely that the disparity here stems from the previous studies including larger ROIs (Cash: 10 electrodes; Desforges: 5 electrodes) that can be expected to incorporate changes that extend more broadly across the scalp. In support of this, global analyses in the current study showed that the control group demonstrated inhibition of low frequency activity (i.e., theta, alpha and lower beta bands), but facilitation of high frequency activity (i.e., gamma band). As all previous investigations of the TMS-EEG response to SICI have focussed on ROI analyses, it is difficult to contextualise these results. However, recent work has suggested there may be some disconnect between the information reflected by low (i.e., &lt; 12 Hz) and high (i.e., &gt; 13Hz) frequency oscillatory activity generated by TMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Biabani <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). Specifically, lower frequency oscillations possibly reflect neural activity relating to somatosensory input, whereas higher frequency oscillations are more reflective of a direct neural response to TMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Biabani <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). In contrast to the previous work using ROI analyses in healthy participants, our global analyses would therefore suggest that application of SICI results in a facilitation of neural output. While we note the absence of evidence supporting a role of GABA in the effects of SICI within the DLPFC, this outcome is nonetheless consistent with previous work in both animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hofmann <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lozano-Soldevilla <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>) that reported an increase in gamma power following pharmacological potentiation of GABA<sub>A</sub> activity. Despite this, SICI tended to produce inhibition of higher frequency activity in the mTBI group, and this was significant for the upper beta band in both within- and between-group comparisons. Consequently, our results provide novel evidence that mTBI alters the spectral effects of SICI when applied to DLPFC. It will be interesting to validate this finding in an independent sample of mTBI patients, and to explore potential functional implications.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Response to cTBS</title><p id="P46">For the control group, global analyses of the response to cTBS failed to identify any significant change in TEP amplitude. However, ROI analyses instead found significant potentiation of N45 and inhibition of P60. This outcome contrasts findings from two previous studies that failed to identify changes in the early TEP components following cTBS over DLPFC, both in ROI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chung <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Nikolin <italic>et al</italic>. 2025</xref>) and global analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chung <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). While it remains unclear why the current study was able to identify significant changes in the early TEPs that were absent in previous work, methodological inconsistencies may have contributed, including differences in TBS intensity (current study: 70% RMT, Chung et al: 80% RMT, Nikolin et al: 75%RMT) and location of stimulation (current study: F3-F5 boundary, Chung et al: F3, Nikolin et al: F3). While N45 and P60 have been associated with GABAergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Premoli <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Darmani <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>) and glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Belardinelli <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>) processes, respectively, it is important to note that this relationship has been established in M1. In contrast, some evidence suggests responses in DLPFC may involve different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Rogasch <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>), although it remains unclear what these are. Nonetheless, there is consensus that the early TEP peaks are likely to reflect net activity of neural circuits activated by TMS (both excitatory and inhibitory), and the effects in the control group are therefore consistent with inhibitory effects of cTBS on neural activity. In contrast, the mTBI group failed to show any change in early TEP amplitude following cTBS. Furthermore, normalised changes in N45 were consistently reduced in patients, only just failing to reach a practical level of significance (&lt;1% in ROPE). Consequently, our time-domain data suggest a reduced response of DLPFC to cTBS following mTBI, particularly for the N45 potential.</p><p id="P47">For data in the spectral domain, ROI analyses failed to show any significant effects in either group. However, global analyses in controls revealed significant inhibition of activity in theta and alpha bands – a response that is partially consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chung <italic>et al</italic>. (2017)</xref>, who reported a reduction in ROI theta power after cTBS. While a similar response was also apparent in the mTBI group, they additionally demonstrated reductions of upper beta and gamma bands. Although the cause of this response is currently unclear, it is interesting to note the similarities with the spectral response to SICI (i.e., increased inhibitory response specific to high-frequency bands). Given the importance of GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated processes in generating both SICI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Ziemann <italic>et al</italic>. 1996</xref>) and high-frequency oscillatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Traub <italic>et al</italic>. 1996</xref>), it may therefore be possible that these similar spectral responses to separate interventions are underpinned by a common neurophysiological effect of mTBI (i.e., GABAergic dysregulation). This supports conclusions from our previous TMS-EEG work in primary motor cortex of mTBI patients, which also identified greater changes in GABA<sub>A</sub> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Opie <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Interaction between function and neurophysiology</title><p id="P48">While N-back performance was not different between groups, patients showed slightly lower accuracy in TMT-A, demonstrating a subtle injury-related deficit in visual attention and executive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Reitan 1958</xref>). However, this was unrelated to any neurophysiological measures. In contrast, normalised changes in P60 amplitude recorded 30 mins after cTBS were found to have differential relationships with performance in patients and controls. Specifically, a larger reduction in responses tended to correlate with increased TMT-B accuracy in mTBI patients but not controls. In contrast, more facilitated responses tended to correlate with increased reaction times on the 1-back for controls but not patients. Specific interpretation of these results is challenging, particularly given they appear unrelated to the studies main outcomes. Nonetheless, they appear to suggest that, irrespective of group, reduction of P60 following cTBS is beneficial for performance. This is consistent with previous work in older individuals, where increases in the P60 following iTBS to left DLPFC were correlated with improved performance on a paired-associative learning task (Goldsworthy et al, 2020), suggesting that preserved plasticity in the prefrontal cortex is important for cognitive performance. While the mechanisms that underpin P60 remain unclear, previous work has established connections with sensory reafference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Petrichella <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>); while this was within the context of the motor system, it may be possible that it serves a similar role in afferent communication in non-motor areas. For example, increased inhibition of competing or distracting information could be beneficial in the context of the tasks completed here. Despite this, the differential response between groups could suggest an injury-related alteration to the nature of this relationship. However, this will require substantiation in future work.</p><p id="P49">In conclusion, the current study used TMS-EEG – in conjunction with paired-pulse TMS, cTBS, and tests of executive function – to investigate the physiological and functional effects of mTBI on DLPFC. Our results in the time domain were generally suggestive of reduced response in patients. In contrast, data in the spectral domain suggested an increased response in patients. These disparities highlight the potential importance of considering different facets of the complex activity indexed by EEG (i.e., induced and evoked activity) when characterising the neurophysiological effects of mTBI. Finally, although unrelated to specific neurophysiological effects of mTBI, interactions between P60 modulation with cTBS and executive function were identified. These highlight new avenues of investigation for future studies in the field.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>supp_results</label><media xlink:href="EMS205960-supplement-supp_results.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d23aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S33"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by funding from the Neurosurgical Research Foundation of South Australia.
