Using <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> as a model, we found that gene transfer via various mechanisms is significantly restricted between strains from different clonal complexes (CCs), with the notable exception of lateral transduction, which occurs at high frequency. Interestingly, some strains exhibited a “promiscuous” ability to accept diverse mobile genetic elements. These strains were defective in the key immune defences of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, specifically the Type I restriction-modification systems that normally protect against foreign DNA. A broader analysis revealed that such immune-deficient mutants are widespread within <italic>S. aureus</italic> populations. Our study uncovered a trade-off that explains their persistence in nature: although these mutants are more susceptible to phage attack, they gain an evolutionary advantage by acquiring beneficial genes - such as those conferring antibiotic resistance - which enhance survival under selective pressure. These immune-deficient cells act as gateways for foreign DNA, which, once integrated and advantageous, can spread within the same CC. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for immune-deficient bacteria in facilitating the emergence of novel virulence factors and antibiotic resistance, emphasising their importance in shaping bacterial evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Horizontal gene transfer</kwd><kwd>transduction</kwd><kwd>conjugation</kwd><kwd>Restriction-Modification systems</kwd><kwd>bacterial immunity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between bacterial species plays a pivotal role in bacterial evolution, promoting adaptation to diverse environments, the spread of antibiotic resistance, and the emergence of new pathogens. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to address the antibiotic resistance crisis and mitigate the impact of bacterial pathogens on human health and the environment.</p><p id="P3">There are three main mechanisms of HGT in bacteria: transformation, conjugation, and transduction. During transformation, bacteria take up free DNA fragments from their environment, typically originating from neighbouring lysed cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. This DNA can be integrated into the chromosome through RecA-mediated homologous recombination (for chromosomal DNA) or maintained episomally as plasmids. For transformation to occur, bacteria must be naturally competent, a trait observed in a limited number of bacterial species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Conjugation involves direct cell-to-cell contact, where a donor bacterium transfers DNA to a recipient bacterium via a specialised structure known as a type IV secretion system or pilus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. In transduction, bacteriophages (phages) or phage satellites package and transfer bacterial DNA during their lytic cycle. Instead of packaging their own genome, they may inadvertently package chromosomal or plasmid DNA from the host, which is then delivered to a new host cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. As with transformation, the transferred chromosomal DNA must undergo recombination in the recipient strain to be incorporated into its genome. Importantly, since phages may encode virulence and other essential accessory genes, it is worth noting that phages can also increase the repertoire of genetic information in recipient cells through lysogenic conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. This process involves the incorporation of phage DNA into the bacterial genome during the lysogenic cycle of a temperate bacteriophage, resulting in the phage DNA integrating into the bacterial chromosome and becoming a prophage. Each of these mechanisms of HGT facilitates the exchange of genetic material, driving bacterial evolution and the dissemination of both beneficial traits, such as antibiotic resistance, and harmful traits that can contribute to pathogenicity.</p><p id="P4">The importance of these processes is underscored by the fact that many different mobile genetic elements (MGEs) have evolved strategies to utilise them for exceptionally high mobility in nature. Thus, not only conjugative plasmids and integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), which encode the complete conjugative machinery, employ conjugation for mobility, but so do mobilisable plasmids and integrative mobilisable elements (IMEs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. These MGEs do not encode their own conjugative machinery but can hijack it from conjugative plasmids or ICEs, respectively, to facilitate their efficient transfer in nature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. A similar scenario occurs with phage satellites and their helper phages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. While these elements cannot produce all the components required to generate infectious particles, they hijack those from their helper phages to promote their preferential packaging and widespread dissemination in nature.</p><p id="P5">In recent years, an important body of work has revealed the molecular basis of these mechanisms. These studies have individually quantified the efficiency of transfer associated with different mechanisms across various bacterial models. However, many of these studies suffer from two significant limitations. First, the efficiency of transfer of the different mechanisms was analysed individually, making it difficult in many cases to compare the effectiveness of different gene transfer mechanisms against one another. Second, in most of these studies, the donor and recipient cells used to measure the efficiency of specific systems were genetically identical, neglecting the impact that different bacterial immune systems may have on controlling the flow of genetic information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">In a recent study, we aimed to address the first question in the relevant human and animal pathogen <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> by simultaneously comparing the efficiency of transfer for the most important mechanisms present in this bacterium (conjugation and transduction). It is important to note that <italic>S. aureus</italic> is not naturally competent. Remarkably, our results revealed that, contrary to established dogma, which assumed that the mobility of classical genetic elements (via conjugation, transformation, or transduction) was higher than that of the bacterial chromosome (via generalised transduction), the chromosome in this bacterium is more mobile than classical MGEs when transferred via lateral transduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. This finding challenges the conventional understanding of mobility in bacterial genetics. However, as previously mentioned, both donor and recipient strains in this study were genetically identical, raising the question of whether these surprising results hold true when different clinical strains are used as donors or recipients in mobility experiments.</p><p id="P7">Here we initially aimed to address the second limitation by analysing the efficiency of transfer for different mechanisms when unrelated <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains were used as recipients. Our results highlight lateral transfer as the most powerful mechanism of transfer in this species. They also reveal that while the transfer of many MGEs occurs when donor and recipient are isogenic, this transfer is blocked when the donor and recipient are genetically unrelated, a process that severely limits the evolution of the recipient cells. Importantly, to overcome this problem, we recognised that immune-deficient strains naturally occur in nature, acting as gateways for the acquisition of new genetic information. If the acquired genes provide an advantage to the immune-deficient bacteria, they can then be shared with other members of the community, driving bacterial evolution and the emergence of novel virulence clones.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Impact of clonal complexes on horizontal gene transfer and genetic exchange</title><p id="P8">Like many important pathogens, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is divided into clonal complexes (CCs), which are groups of genetically related strains descending from a common ancestor. While all strains belong to the same species, those from different CCs can be genetically distinct, with differences significant enough in some cases to influence host tropism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. When compared, <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains belonging to different CCs not only exhibit variations in virulence genes but also possess different immune mechanisms that may significantly influence genetic flow between strains of different CCs. Among the immune systems present in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, Type I restriction-modification (RM) systems play a crucial role in shaping the genetic structure of this species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">To overcome the limitations of a previous study in which we compared different modes of gene transfer in <italic>S. aureus</italic> using donor and recipient strains belonging to CC8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, we now evaluated the transfer of various MGEs, as well as portions of the bacterial chromosome, using a collection of 27 strains that belong to 8 different CCs. Note that while most of these CCs are human-specific, some include strains infecting other hosts (see Supplementary Table 1 for details). For some of the CCs, we included multiple strains, allowing us to evaluate the potential existence of differences even among strains within the same CC.</p><p id="P10">In our first experiment, we included the following MGEs: phage 80α<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, SaPIbov1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and plasmids pI258<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and pGO1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, as well as a chromosomal marker mobilised by 80α by either generalised or lateral transduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. For phage 80α, we used a derivative carrying an <italic>ermC</italic> marker, conferring resistance to erythromycin, which allowed us to measure lysogenic conversion. SaPIbov1 is one of the prototypical members of the phage-inducible chromosomal islands (PICIs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, which are phage satellites that utilise helper phages for mobility. In these experiments, we used a SaPIbov1 derivative carrying a <italic>tetM</italic> marker in the <italic>tst</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. SaPIbov1 employs phage 80α as a helper, and in our experiments, we have successfully generated lysates that exclusively contain SaPIbov1 but not 80α, by using an 80α derivative mutant in the phage small terminase subunit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Importantly, the SaPIbov1 particles are composed of phage proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, meaning that SaPIbov1 and 80α particles have identical potential to inject the packaged DNA into the recipient cells (identical host tropism). The same phage (80α) was used to generate transducing particles capable of mobilising a chromosomal marker (Cd) via lateral transduction (LT) or plasmid pI258 via generalised transduction (GT). Finally, the conjugative plasmid pOG1 was used to measure inter-CC conjugation.</p><p id="P11">The results measuring 80α lysogenic conversion (integration in the bacterial chromosome) were dramatic and unexpected: it essentially did not occur when recipients belonged to a different CC than the donor (CC8) used to generate the phage lysate. The exceptions were two strains belonging to CC1 and one belonging to CC130. Even in these limited cases, lysogenic conversion occurred with frequencies that were more than 100 times reduced compared to those observed when strains belonging to CC8 were used as recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Somewhat less dramatic but still quite impactful were the unexpected results obtained when analysing the transfer of SaPIbov1 or pI258 (via GT). For these MGEs, most of the recipient strains were refractory to gene transfer, and as seen with 80α lysogenic conversion, the results obtained in those strains able to acquire foreign DNA were never at the level observed when the donor and recipient belonged to the same CC. Importantly, most of the strains capable of acquiring SaPIbov1 were also able to accept pI258, and vice versa, suggesting that the same mechanisms limit the transfer of these elements.</p><p id="P13">In contrast to the limited transfer observed for 80α, SaPIbov1, or pI258, the conjugative transfer of pGO1, the 80α-mediated transfer of the chromosomal marker via GT, and especially the transfer of the chromosomal marker via LT occurred in most of the strains used as recipients, with LT offering the highest frequencies of transfer overall. Interestingly, while LT and GT shared many of the strains that could accept DNA, there were discrepancies between the strains that were refractory to conjugation versus transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 1 and 2), suggesting the existence of specific mechanisms in these strains that block different processes.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Lateral transduction is the most efficient mechanism of gene transfer in <italic>S. aureus</italic></title><p id="P14">Since the previous study included only a few MGEs and markers located in specific regions of the bacterial chromosome, we expanded our repertoire of elements to determine whether the results could be generalised. Specifically, we included two additional temperate phages, ϕ11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and ϕSLT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, two additional SaPIs (SaPIbov5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> and SaPIpT1028<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>), and two additional chromosomal markers, which can be mobilised by phage LT using ϕ11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> or by SaPI LT using SaPIbov1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We also included two additional plasmids, pC221<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> and pUR3912<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, which can be mobilised by generalised transduction (both) or by conjugation (pC221). Note that pC221 is not conjugative but mobilisable, requiring pGO1 for mobility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. As summarised in Supplementary Table 2, most of the elements selected in this study are clinically relevant, encoding virulence or antibiotic resistance genes, as well as immune systems.</p><p id="P15">The results, individually represented for each element in Supplementary Fig. 3 and summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, confirm that lateral transduction transfer (LT), followed by generalised transduction (GT) and plasmid transfer via conjugation, are the most important mechanisms of transfer in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. In this species, however, phage, SaPI, and plasmid transfer via GT is severely blocked when strains from different clonal complexes (CCs) are used as recipients.</p><p id="P16">Finally, since all the strains used as recipients were sequenced, we analysed the possibility that the interference observed in the transfer of the MGEs could be related to the presence of similar elements in the recipient strains. Apart from three cases where the strains JP9199, JP9171 and JP9185 had prophages with the same repressor as ϕSLT, we did not find resident MGEs with the same repressor as the ones used to test mobility, nor did we find any correlation between the presence of MGEs with the same integrase in the strains and the transfer patterns (Supplementary Table 3). Moreover, as previously mentioned, since phage-mediated GT and LT worked well, but not the SaPI or plasmid transfer mediated by the same phages - implying that these elements could be injected - the results suggested that the arsenal of immune systems present in the recipient strains determined their ability to block or accept foreign DNA.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Promiscuous recipient strains are mutants in Type I RM systems</title><p id="P17">To test this idea further, we focused on two strains, JP9179 and JP9181, belonging to CC1, which were able to accept the transfer of all the MGEs and chromosomal markers used in this study. Since three other strains belonging to CC1 were quite refractory to the acquisition of some MGEs, the simplest explanation is that JP9179 and JP9181 were immune-deficient, meaning they were defective in bacterial immune systems. To test this possibility, we analysed the presence of defence systems in all strains used in these experiments as recipients. The repertoire of defence systems varied between the strains, with Type I and Type IV RM systems, Abi2, and RosmerTA being the most prevalent, present in 100%, 70.3%, 96.2% and 81.4% of the strains, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Related to strains JP9179 and JP9181, which carry Type I and Type IV RM systems, Abi2, AbiD, and AVAST_II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), we realised that the Type I RM system present in these strains is defective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), probably explaining the capacity of these strains to acquire exogenous DNA. In <italic>S. aureus</italic>, Type I RM systems involve three <italic>hsd</italic> genes (<italic>hsdR</italic>, <italic>hsdM</italic>, and <italic>hsdS</italic>) regulating DNA restriction, modification, and sequence specificity, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. <italic>S. aureus</italic> usually has two genomic locations encoding the <italic>hsdMS</italic> alleles, which cluster with pathogenicity islands vSaα and vSaβ, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, while <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains only encode one <italic>hsdR</italic> gene, which localises elsewhere in the bacterial chromosome. Previous studies have shown that Type I RM variants are associated with specific CCs, impacting the frequency of inter-CC HGT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table 4). Regardless of the variants carried in the different strains, all of them can interact with the conserved R subunit present in this bacterium. Importantly, in both JP9179 and JP9181 strains, there was a deletion in the region containing the <italic>hsdR</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), making these strains mutants in the restriction subunit. However, the two copies of the <italic>hsdMS</italic> genes present in these strains are potentially functional, indicating that these strains were unable to digest the incoming DNA but once inside the cells, they were able to modify it correctly. This process would favour the transfer of the elements to other immune-competent strains belonging to the same CC.</p><p id="P19">To confirm that the ability of the JP9179 and JP9181 strains (CC1) to acquire exogenous DNA was a consequence of their defect in the <italic>hsdR</italic> gene, we introduced either an empty plasmid or a derivative expressing the <italic>hsdR</italic> gene into these strains and analysed their ability to generate 80α lysogens using phage lysates obtained after induction of the 80α prophage present in a strain belonging to CC8. In these experiments, we also introduced these plasmids into RN4220, which belongs to CC8 and is mutant in <italic>hsdR</italic>. Supporting our hypothesis, expression of <italic>hsdR</italic> in JP9179 and JP9181 completely eliminated their ability to generate lysogens, while it had no effect on strain RN4220 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), confirming that JP9179 and JP9181 were immune-deficient due to the absence of <italic>hsdR</italic>. We then repeated the same experiments using an 80α lysate obtained after induction of the prophage from a CC1 strain. In this case, lysogenisation occurred at the same rate in all the CC1 strains but was abolished in the RN4220 strain expressing <italic>hsdR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To generalise our results, we next deleted the <italic>hsdR</italic> gene in strains JP9171 (CC133) and JP9172 (CC130) and tested lysogenic conversion of phage 80α (obtained from a strain belonging to CC8). Supporting the important role of h<italic>sdR</italic> in controlling HGT, deletion of this gene in the two recipient strains allowed them to acquire the 80α phage at high frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Finally, we tested the idea that once introduced into an immune-deficient cell, the acquired MGEs could then be mobilised intra-CC to other strains, as the immune-deficient cells would be able to methylate the DNA to be recognised as belonging to the CC. To do this, we used two 80α lysates: one obtained from RN4220 (CC8) and the other obtained after induction of the prophage present in the immune-deficient strain JP9179 (CC1). The lysates were then used to infect JP9179, JP9181, and JP9197, all belonging to CC1. Note that JP9179 and JP9181 are immune-deficient, while JP9197 is immune-competent. While the 80α phage from the CC8 strain was only able to generate lysogens in the immune-competent cells, the one from the CC1 donor was able to generate lysogens in all the CC1 strains used as recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). This result confirms that immune-competent cells act as gates for the entrance of foreign DNA, which is then shared (if beneficial) with the rest of the strains belonging to the same CC. Additionally, to test whether this phenomenon was restricted to phages or represented a more general mechanism, we used strains JP9153 and JP9171, both from clonal complex CC133. We had observed that although both strains appeared to carry a functional Type I RM system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), JP9153, but not JP9171, was refractory to the transfer of SaPIbov1 when the island originated from a CC8 strain (RN4220; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). By contrast, when the SaPIbov1 lysate was generated in a derivative of JP9171 carrying an <italic>hsdR</italic> mutation (within CC133), both JP9153 and JP9171 were able to accept the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This confirmed that appropriate methylation of the DNA enabled SaPIbov1 transfer to the previously resistant strain when donor and recipient belonged to the same clonal complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The fact that SaPIbov1 could be mobilised from RN4220 (CC8) to JP9171, but not to JP9153 (both CC133), suggests that the Type I RM system in JP9171 is either non-functional or not expressed. Notably, JP9171 harbours three additional immune systems (RM_Type_IV, PD.74.9, and AbiZ), which are absent in JP9153 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Whether the presence of these systems interferes with the expression of the Type I RM system is currently under investigation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title><italic>hsdR</italic> mutants are prevalent in natural populations</title><p id="P22">The previous results raised an immediate question: how frequently are mutations in <italic>hsdR</italic> found in natural populations? For this 'gateway' strategy to facilitate HGT effectively, these mutations should be present in nature. To test this, we analysed all the <italic>S. aureus</italic> complete genomes sequenced strains available in the NCBI database and quantified the number of strains carrying loss-of-function mutations (e.g. stop codon gained and frameshift mutations) in the <italic>hsdR</italic> gene. As a control for this analysis, we also quantified the number of mutations found in the <italic>hsdM</italic> or <italic>hsdS</italic> genes within these strains. Remarkably, while we found that 4% of the strains carried loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>hsdR</italic> gene (p-value 0.007 based on Poisson distribution, Supplementary Fig. 4), only 0.2% and 0.9% of the strains carried such mutations in either the <italic>hsdM</italic> or <italic>hsdS</italic> genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Importantly, the strains carrying mutations in <italic>hsdR</italic> belonged to different CCs, confirming that the presence of these immune-deficient cells is common across all lineages of <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Trade-off between phage susceptibility and DNA acquisition drives expansion of <italic>hsdR</italic> mutants</title><p id="P23">The high prevalence of <italic>hsdR</italic> mutants suggested either the existence of a mechanism that generates these mutations or, conversely, that the mutation of this gene somehow confers an advantage, promoting the expansion of <italic>hsdR</italic> mutants. While we have not found evidence supporting the first possibility, we speculated that an interesting trade-off may occur in <italic>hsdR</italic> mutants: although they are more sensitive to phage attack, which would typically eliminate them from the population, if the acquired DNA provides a significant advantage, these mutants could expand rapidly, explaining their high prevalence in the population.</p><p id="P24">To test this, we mixed JP9179 (CC1), which is an <italic>hsdR</italic> mutant, and JP9197 (CC1), that carries a functional R subunit, and infected the culture with a lysate containing phage 80α (carrying the <italic>ermC</italic> marker) produced by the strain RN4220 (CC8). After infection, the population was split into two: one part received no additional treatment, while the other was treated with erythromycin (whose resistance is encoded in the 80α prophage). After 0, 4 and 8 hours, the number of JP9179 and JP9197 cells present in both populations was measured. Supporting the idea of a trade-off between infectivity and benefits, in the absence of the antibiotic, the relative abundance of the immune-deficient cells (JP9179) decreased. However, after treatment with the antibiotic, the situation was completely reversed, with the immune-deficient strain JP9179 dominating the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). In conclusion, <italic>hsdR</italic> mutants persist in bacterial populations due to a trade-off between phage vulnerability and the acquisition of beneficial foreign DNA, which promotes their expansion under selective pressure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">Previous studies have found that <italic>S. aureus</italic> follows a clonal population structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> in which the gene exchange between different lineages seems to be extremely uncommon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. One of the main reasons for this is the presence of bacterial defence systems, in particular restriction-modification systems. RM systems can be found in over 95% of bacterial genomes, with the Type I RM system present in nearly half of the prokaryotic genomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Waldron et al. have found that nearly all <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates encode Type I RM systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the DNA motifs recognised by this system are unique to each clonal complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and therefore each clonal complex produces a unique DNA methylation pattern. Thus, different studies have shown that the distribution of MGEs, such as plasmids and bacteriophages, is dependent on the clonal complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">In this study, we provide experimental evidence that the transfer of MGEs between different strains is considerably impacted by the lineage to which donor and recipient cells belong. Importantly, we demonstrate that this is, surprisingly, not the case for chromosomal genes, which can be transferred efficiently between cells, regardless of the clonal nature of the strains. In particular, we confirm that the recently described phage- and SaPI-mediated lateral transduction are by far the most efficient way of HGT in <italic>S. aureus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. While in a previous study, where we used donor and recipient cells belonging to the same CC, we suggested that this was the case when comparing different mechanisms of transfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, the results obtained here, analysing transfer between CCs, are more striking, highlighting LT as the main mechanism of gene transfer in this species. Whether this also occurs in other species is currently under investigation.</p><p id="P27">Our results also highlight the role of GT and conjugation as important mechanisms of HGT in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. While GT was previously assumed to occur at very low transfer rates, our results indicate that it occurs at frequencies higher than those observed for the transfer of different MGEs, consistently-meaning that it occurs at similar frequencies regardless of the CC used as the recipient. A hypothesis explaining why LT and GT are not affected by RM systems is provided below. Similarly, conjugation appears to occur at a lower frequency than LT but at a higher frequency than GT. The minor role that RM systems may play here could be explained by either the expression of different strategies by some conjugative elements that block RM system activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> or because conjugation involves the transfer of single-stranded DNA, which is not cleaved by RM systems.</p><p id="P28">The results obtained with LT and GT raise the question of why, if the methylation patterns are the same, are chromosomal genes transferred but not MGEs? There are different ways in which DNA can be incorporated into the chromosome, such as RecA-mediated homologous recombination, and integrase-mediated site-specific recombination. The latter is the mechanism employed by bacteriophages, phage satellites, and other MGEs. Specifically, MGE-encoded integrases recognise a specific bacterial attachment site (<italic>attB</italic>) and mediate the recombination between this site and the attachment site present in the MGE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, resulting in the integration of the phage. Since the MGEs must be in a circular form for their integration, cleavage by the RM systems results in an MGE that cannot integrate or replicate, even if there is only one recognition site in the whole MGE sequence. On the contrary, RecA-mediated integration, which is used by LT or GT (for the mobility of chromosomal genes), can occur with both linear and circular DNA as long as there is sufficient homology between the incoming DNA and the target DNA. Thus, even if the incoming chromosomal DNA is cleaved in many pieces, the resulting fragments can still recombine with the chromosome of the recipient cell if still DNA is provided for the double recombination, leading to DNA integration. On this note, it has been suggested that SaPIs and plasmids could be more tolerant than phages to cleavage by exonucleases due to the redundancy of their genomes and their recombination capabilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. This could explain why these elements were less blocked than phages but more than chromosomal DNA in our experiments.</p><p id="P29">The presence of natural mutants defective in the Type I RM system represents a paradox. On one hand, R-deficient strains are more susceptible to phage predation and therefore should be negatively selected. On the other hand, having a defective RM system gives them the advantage of being able to horizontally acquire potentially beneficial genes. However, there is another layer of complexity to this system: R-deficient mutants can act as gateways for HGT between different clonal complexes. As discussed before, the population structure of <italic>S. aureus</italic> means that different clonal complexes rarely exchange MGEs because of the DNA motifs recognised by them. However, RM(-) gateways provide the platform to exchange genes between CCs by acquiring, methylating and transferring them to strains from the same clonal complex that were resistant to HGT from other CCs. A similar strategy was recently observed by Sheng et al., who reported the prevalence of insertion sequences (IS) in defence systems such as CRISPR-Cas, RM and Dnd systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. They found that out of 60 different immune systems, 12 carried insertions of IS1 and IS10, likely inactivating them. This further strengthens our proposal that immune-deficient mutants naturally occur in bacterial populations to facilitate HGT.</p><p id="P30">One might assume that R-deficient mutants would carry more MGEs than strains with functional RM systems. However, we noted that, interestingly, this was not the case (Supplementary Table 3). We hypothesise that the acquisition of new MGEs in an immune-deficient strain could result in conflicts amongst them if, for example, they use the host-bacterium replication machinery, or carry defence systems that target one another<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Additionally, it is possible that there are physical and metabolic constraints that hinder the increasing acquisition of several elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. A recent large-scale study showed that plasmid size and copy number depend on the cell’s metabolic capacity, with plasmid load consistently accounting for a similar percentage of chromosomal DNA across hosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Similar constraints may govern the balance between different MGEs, explaining the lack of high MGE numbers in immune-deficient strains. Besides these limitations, the fact that R-deficient strains are considerably more susceptible to phage predation makes them particularly vulnerable, and therefore, it is likely that spontaneous R-defective mutants are negatively selected in bacterial populations when there is no fitness advantage conferred by the MGE.</p><p id="P31">Our mutational analysis discovered that mutations in the R subunit are common in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, but not in the M or S subunits. Typically, RM systems are composed of two enzymatic activities: a methyltransferase (MS) and a restriction endonuclease (R). The R subunit cleaves the invading DNA, while the methyltransferase activity allows to differentiate self and incoming DNA by methylating specific DNA motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Beyond their function as defence systems, it has been reported that methylation by RM systems may play other roles such as DNA repair or regulation of gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. The R-deficient isolates in our collection (JP9179 and JP9181) differed by 214 core SNPs (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6), indicating that these strains have a common ancestor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, but have been evolving independently while maintaining a non-functional Type I RM system. Therefore, it is possible that the selective pressure to have a functional methylation machinery is higher than to have a functional immune system.</p><p id="P32">Given that we have shown that R-deficient strains act as a gateway for inter-CC HGT, it is plausible that other mechanisms are in place to modulate intra-CC genetic exchange, after all, there must be a fine balance between acquiring new potentially beneficial genes and facing phage predation. While strains from the same clonal complex had the same Type I RM systems, we found additional immune systems that were present in some but not all strains of the same CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). For instance, in CC1, the type IV and II RM systems, RosmerTA, AVAST II, Dodola, AbiJ and PD-λ-5 were only present in a proportion of the strains. Similarly, the type IIS RM system, PD-T4-9, and AbiZ were only found in some strains of the CC133, and Shango was present in only one strain of the CC15, suggesting that these immune systems may play a role in controlling intra-CC gene flow.</p><p id="P33">The observation that RM systems limit HGT in <italic>S. aureus</italic> is consistent with historical practices in bacterial strain identification. The widespread use of phage typing to distinguish <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains implicitly relied on the fact that certain phages could infect only specific lineages, suggesting a barrier to phage-mediated gene transfer across strain boundaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Although the molecular basis for this specificity was not fully understood at the time, it is now evident that RM systems play a central role in restricting the flow of genetic material between strains. This evolutionary strategy likely contributed to the genomic stability of individual lineages and helps explain the lineage-specific distribution of mobile genetic elements observed in modern <italic>S. aureus</italic> populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P34">In summary, our study demonstrates that lateral transduction is the most powerful route for horizontal gene transfer in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, with MGE transfer restricted between strains from different clonal complexes. Since HGT is essential for bacterial evolution, we show that bacteria overcome the limitations imposed by the Type I RM system by using immunodeficient mutants, which are prevalent in nature and serve as gateways, facilitating HGT between different clonal complexes. These findings highlight the overlooked role of immune-deficient bacteria in pathogen adaptation and evolution.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Bacterial strains</title><p id="P35">The full list of bacterial strains and MGEs used in this study is provided in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.
