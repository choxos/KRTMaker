The reason often invoked is the dysregulation of the immune system, which is both cause and consequence of ageing. However, we do not all age in the same way, and increased susceptibility may not be solely due to immune dysregulation affecting resistance to infection. There are many possible ways to make a host less tolerant to infection by dysregulating key physiological or metabolic processes. We hypothesised that the increase in susceptibility to infection over age can be linked to both immune ageing and decreased tolerance, and importantly, that it will depend on genotype and sex of the host. We assessed susceptibility to Gram-negative bacterial challenge in both sexes in 22 <italic>Drosophila</italic> isolines at young and old ages, and leveraged variation between genotypes to investigate how frequently an increase in susceptibility to infection was more associated with a decline in resistance or disease tolerance mechanisms. To achieve this, we assessed pathogen load to report on host immune decline. Strikingly, in most cases, greater infection susceptibility at old age was driven by reduced tolerance, although we also frequently identify cases that suffered <italic>bona fide</italic> immunosenescence, e.g. impaired resistance. We screened across bacterial pathogens during systemic and oral infections and found sex-specific signatures in survival in young and old individuals, but increased susceptibility with age occurred in both sexes. Pairing infection survival with lifespan data, we find that transcending genotype variation, susceptibility at old age predicts lifespan in males only, regardless of the existence or direction of sex bias in longevity. This work highlights that increased infection susceptibility is an early-arising ageing phenotype that occurs in both sexes, but only predicts lifespan in males, paralleling burgeoning evidence in mammals for male-biased effects of age on infection and its connection with mortality. Our data support a model where infection susceptibility increases with age following the same multiplicative pattern as organismal mortality, with existing failures making new failures more consequential. We propose that the term “immunosenescence” be used specifically to describe proven dysregulation of immune tissue resistance mechanisms. We argue that to fully understand the drivers of age-related susceptibility to infection, it is essential to consider genotype, sex, and their interaction, as well as the dysregulation of non-immune functions that influence the ability to control pathogens.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Susceptibility to infection increases with age across taxa and is observed in diverse laboratory animal models, wild animal populations, and in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Froy <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R118">Zajitschek, Zajitschek and Bonduriansky, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Driesschaert <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R116">Wrona <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). However, we do not understand what underpins the increase in susceptibility to pathogens over ageing, and despite established population diversity in ageing phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Belsky <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ahadi <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bronikowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Nogalska <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>), we know little about variation in increased infection susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Corbally and Regan, 2022</xref>). A long-standing assumption is that increased infection risk is necessarily underpinned by the deterioration of immune functions that act to reduce pathogen burden. As such, numerous animal models and clinical studies give a patchy view of immune tissue ageing, establishing, for example, reduced immune cell function during a particular infection condition. However, many functions other than immunity decline with age, potentially before the decline of the immune system itself. The decline of key metabolic, digestive or neuronal functions could potentially result in an increase in susceptibility to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Shen <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R112">Weis <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Palmer, 2022</xref>) if they decrease the ability to tolerate the consequences of infections (e.g. increased sensitivity to tissue damage or decreased repair). If mechanisms that influence the ability to tolerate infections suffer a functional decline over age, this challenges resistance-focussed assumptions around age-related increased susceptibility to infections, and different therapeutic targets will be needed to limit increased susceptibility to infection. The scarcity of models that allow for experimental and longitudinal analysis means we do not know the relative contributions of immune system failure and reduction in other physiological functions to increased infection susceptibility at old age, in any system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Corbally and Regan, 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Host susceptibility is determined by two, largely distinct but non-mutually exclusive strategies: resistance and disease tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Schneider and Ayres, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Martins <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Resistance describes the host’s ability to directly limit the pathogen burden, and is determined by the action of canonical immune effectors such as antibodies, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phagocytic cells. Disease tolerance (hereafter referred to as tolerance) does not directly affect pathogen proliferation, but describes the host’s ability to limit disease severity and maintain health in spite of a dynamic pathogen load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Råberg, Sim and Read, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Råberg, Graham and Read, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Read, Graham and Råberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ayres, 2020</xref>). Tolerance is a broad term encompassing processes such as the sensitivity to, and repair of, tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Medzhitov, Schneider and Soares, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">Soares, Gozzelino and Weis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Soares, Teixeira and Moita, 2017</xref>), and maintenance of cellular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Richardson, Kooistra and Kim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">Troha <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>) and metabolic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Dionne <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R112">Weis <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Ganeshan <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R115">Willmann and Moita, 2024</xref>). Consequently, an increase in susceptibility due to a decrease in tolerance can arise from defects in various physiological processes; in other words, from anything that is not a <italic>bona fide</italic> immune function. Since both resistance and tolerance are underpinned by diverse mechanisms, it is impossible to measure them all, and difficult to determine which to measure in order to quantify the contributions of each strategy to susceptibility. One cannot simply measure the quantity of investment in a given mechanism. For instance, immune cells present in similar numbers may have differing functional efficiencies across individuals, or within an individual over ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kaczorowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the efficiency of a mechanism may be a more suitable measure than its quantity, and not necessarily correlated. Immune efficiency depends on a balanced response, the threshold of which is unknown and could be detrimental if exceeded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Gong <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Rappe <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">Vivekanandan <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Ghaffarpour <italic>et al</italic>., 2025</xref>). Indeed, changes in immune function with ageing are often linked to a reduction in regulatory mechanisms leading to over-production, rather than under-production, of immune components, like AMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Ferrucci and Fabbri, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, immune mechanisms are operating within a complex system, and a decrease in efficiency of one arm of defence could be compensated by another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">McKean and Lazzaro, 2011</xref>). This reasoning could apply within a single strategy, but studying the relative contribution of resistance and tolerance to differences in susceptibility is further complicated by their interconnectedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Howick and Lazzaro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Duneau <italic>et al</italic>., 2025</xref>). For example, during an intestinal infection, reduced tissue repair capacity could increase infection-induced damage to the gut barrier. This damage could result in reduced nutrient absorption, impacting the host’s ability to mount an energetically costly immune response, thereby reducing resistance. To address the challenges due to this interconnection of resistance and tolerance, recent theoretical modelling combined with empirical testing have suggested that studying pathogen dynamics and pathogen loads at key points of an infection can establish their relative contributions without targeting specific mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Duneau <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Duneau and Ferdy, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Duneau <italic>et al</italic>., 2025</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Analysing pathogen load is an ideal way to assess host performance without exhaustively defining the parameters involved: it is the result of pathogen proliferation within the host, and it necessarily depends on both the host’s ability to control the proliferation and to sustain its impact. However, it is extremely challenging to measure in mammalian models, as most infections are within tissues and consequently not easily accessible, multiple sampling over time is limited by ethical concerns, and the number of hosts per experiment is usually small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cunnington, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kaito <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, a single pathogen load estimate at a randomly selected timepoint during an infection can be very transitional, and not usefully representative of the infection trajectory or outcome, as pathogen load could equally be increasing or decreasing at that point. This is further complicated by the impossibility to quantify the full pathogen population within the mammalian host, where a single subsampling may not be representative of the whole burden, especially when the pathogen infects several tissues. Following pathogen load over ageing would be the ideal way to establish the connection between susceptibility and defence strategies, i.e. resistance and tolerance, if these technical challenges could be overcome.</p><p id="P5">Using insects to address some of the outstanding fundamental questions in immune system ageing is one possible approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kaito <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Corbally and Regan, 2022</xref>). In mammals, age-related increased susceptibility can be attributed to age-related alterations in both the adaptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Carr <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Froy <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) and innate arms of immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Benayoun <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Lu, Wang and Benayoun, 2022</xref>). Increased susceptibility to infection is also observed in invertebrate systems that possess only innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Laws <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Khan, Prakash and Agashe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Sheffield <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is a cornerstone genetic model system that has classically been used in the biology of ageing, biogerontology and immunity fields due to high genetic conservation in relevant signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Corbally and Regan, 2022</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> innate immune response largely centres on the action of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) induced downstream of Toll and Imd NF-kB signalling pathways, on macrophage-like, phagocytic immune cells (hemocytes), and on intestinal epithelial innate immune mechanisms including production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R113">Westlake, Hanson and Lemaitre, 2024</xref>). In ageing <italic>Drosophila</italic>, AMP expression becomes dysregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Pletcher <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Landis <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Lai <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Carlson <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), which is reflective of transcriptional profiles in ageing vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">Tremblay <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">Tian <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, AMP induction becomes less specific to bacterial infections in older individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Shit <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), and hemocytes decline in their phagocytic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Mackenzie, Bussière and Tinsley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Horn, Leips and Starz-Gaiano, 2014</xref>). Overall, there is a consensus that older flies are more susceptible to infections, including by bacteria, viruses and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">Sciambra and Chtarbanova, 2021</xref>), suggesting that immune ageing in insects follows a broadly similar pattern to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Fabian <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In this study, we assessed pathogen load to elucidate which immune strategies underpin increased infection susceptibility over age, and whether immune ageing correlates with longevity. We first show that aged individuals from a genetically heterogeneous population have a reduced ability to survive a range of bacterial infections, including systemic and oral, and Gram-negative and Gram-positive infections controlled by different immune responses. We leveraged co-variation in early- and late-life susceptibility to systemic infection with the natural <italic>Drosophila</italic> pathogen, <italic>Providencia rettgeri</italic>, and in lifespan of unchallenged individuals, in a subset of isogenic lines of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetic research panel (DGRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Mackay <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Increased susceptibility was ubiquitous across genotypes and sexes, but varied strongly in magnitude. The change in the <underline>P</underline>athogen <underline>L</underline>oad <underline>U</underline>pon <underline>D</underline>eath (PLUD) with age across the panel enabled us to estimate the relative contribution of immune strategies to increased susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Duneau <italic>et al</italic>., 2025</xref>). This showed that, most commonly, increased susceptibility was driven primarily by lowered tolerance. However, in several genotypes, the increase in susceptibility to systemic infection was mainly due to a loss of resistance, i.e., a decreased control of pathogen load. Tracking the PLUD across the lifecourse in a genotype showing reduced tolerance at old age suggested that the driver for increased susceptibility can remain consistent. We showed that there was no association between early-life susceptibility and lifespan in either sex. However, there was a significant negative correlation between late-life susceptibility and lifespan in males, regardless of the existence or direction of sex bias in longevity. Overall, we showed that pathogen load associated with mortality risk can show variable routes to increased susceptibility – with loss of tolerance being the most common driver – although death can also be driven by <italic>bona fide</italic> loss of immune function. These findings establish that further work across systems should not only focus on dysregulation of immune tissue resistance mechanisms but also on the dysregulation of non-immune functions, and how they impact the ability to control infections.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Drosophila stocks and husbandry</title><p id="P7">Flies were maintained at 25 °C in 60-70% humidity on a 12:12 light:dark cycle.

The design of this experiment was not to characterise specific genotypes, but to generate variability and correlate susceptibility at different ages, lifespan and PLUD within one large experiment.

With a range of approximately 5 log(HR) in both sexes (i.e. the mortality rate of the most susceptible genotype was about 150 times higher than the least susceptible line), we detected a high variability in susceptibility at young age across genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Both the ability to mount an efficient immune response (i.e., resistance) and to tolerate the consequences of the infection (i.e., tolerance) are assumed to decrease with age, but the relative impact of their decline on the susceptibility of older individuals can be difficult to untangle. Variation within populations in the ability to maintain immune competence over age, well-documented in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Belsky <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ahadi <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), suggests that individuals’ immune systems may fail in different ways and at different times. It is particularly challenging to know when the decline in non-immune mechanisms have an impact on host susceptibility to infection. Furthermore, the chronology of physiological declines and their implications could vary depending on genotype, including sex, on environmental factors, or on their interaction. Analysing pathogen load, i.e. asking the pathogen to report on host responses, offers a way to uncover chronology of increasing susceptibility and the relative contribution of declining resistance and tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Duneau <italic>et al</italic>., 2025</xref>).

Leveraging the variation generated by infecting both sexes of multiple host genotypes with a single bacterial pathogen, we showed that susceptibility when young and its decline correlate between sexes while susceptibility when old does not. We also showed that the increased susceptibility can be attributed to a decline in resistance, but most frequently to a decline in tolerance. By correlating susceptibility at different ages with lifespan, we demonstrated that immune competence at old age predicts longevity in males only, regardless of the existence or direction of sex bias in lifespan.</p><sec id="S25"><title>Increase in susceptibility as an early arising ageing phenotype</title><p id="P31">A standing question in the field of immune ageing is whether increased susceptibility to infection arises only in late life, or begins to manifest earlier.

We detected a correlation between male and female susceptibility to infection in young individuals, suggesting that the sexes shared similar baseline susceptibility, strongly influenced by development / genotype. Furthermore, the magnitude of age-related increase in susceptibility was also correlated between sexes. However, somewhat counter-intuitively, the correlation in susceptibility broke down when individuals were old. This breakdown could be attributed to environmental factors that accumulate differentially during ageing - such as lifestyle differences or varying environmental stresses. However, our study was performed under standardised and constant laboratory conditions, suggesting that environmental heterogeneity cannot fully explain this pattern, unless considering an interaction between genotype (sex) and environment. Instead, our findings could point to a fundamental characteristic of biological ageing processes.</p><p id="P34">Understanding whether biological ageing follows an additive or multiplicative pattern has been a longstanding question since Gompertz (1825) described mortality as increasing exponentially with age. The Gompertz model follows an additive pattern in log space that translates to multiplicative effects in linear space - a distinction relevant for interpreting mortality data. Our observed pattern supports this Gompertz framework: the correlation in age-related changes between sexes, combined with the breakdown of correlation in final susceptibility levels, implies that age-related increase in susceptibility operates additively in log space. This means ageing effects accumulate such that each increment of biological time adds a constant amount to log susceptibility, which translates to multiplicative effects in linear space where existing damage makes organisms progressively more vulnerable. This indicates that immune ageing follows the same fundamental pattern as organismal ageing. The mathematical structure explains how males and females can experience similar ageing processes yet diverge toward different endpoints - additive effects in log space naturally cause divergence from initially correlated baselines. These findings suggest that accumulated biological damage follows universal patterns that operate somewhat independently of initial genetic differences.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Sexual dimorphism is likely affecting different tissues</title><p id="P35">We detected a correlation between male and female susceptibility in old compared to young individuals, suggesting that both sexes suffer a decline in immune function.

Additionally, tolerance is mediated through regulation of immune signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Merkling <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Prakash <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Prakash, Monteith and Vale, 2023</xref>), known to be dysregulated with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Franceschi <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Pletcher <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Landis <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Lai <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). As such, we might expect age to negatively affect tolerance. However, only a handful of research mechanistically assesses age-related immunity in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and elsewhere, especially in terms of tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Sheffield <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">Sorci, Léchenault-Bergerot and Faivre, 2021</xref>). Increased susceptibility to <italic>E. coli</italic> with age was found to be unrelated to changes in resistance, and suggests a reduction in tolerance with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Ramsden, Cheung and Seroude, 2008</xref>). Age-related susceptibility to Flock House virus was shown to be tolerance-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Sheffield <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), and dysregulation of AMPs upon bacterial infection can damage tissue, impacting function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Shit <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Our results support the need to pursue further research into tolerance-dependent, increased susceptibility to infections over age.</p><p id="P38">There are concerted efforts to maintain immune responses to acute infections in elderly humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Mannick <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cox <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), and therapeutic targeting of the immune system has been posed as a promising anti-ageing intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Neves and Sousa-Victor, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Borgoni <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Mannick and Lamming, 2023</xref>). Our data strengthens the argument that individuals do not age uniformly, that genetic variation (including sex) can determine routes to age-related increase in susceptibility, and susceptibility can increase due to causes which are not directly linked to immune decline <italic>per se</italic>. This will be an important consideration for developing strategies to limit susceptibility in older individuals. We have shown that by interrogating pathogen load in combination with susceptibility, the combined effects of declining systems can be measured and attributed to failures in resistance or tolerance. Our findings establish that further work across systems should not only focus on <italic>bona fide</italic> immune dysregulation of immune tissue resistance mechanisms but should also concentrate on the dysregulation of non-immune functions, and on how they impact the ability to control infections. As such, studies of age-related infection susceptibility should not use the term <italic>immunosenescence</italic> without demonstrating that increased susceptibility is directly linked to a decline in <italic>bona fide</italic> immune functions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"
