Proteins involved in lipid metabolism, such as the monoacylglycerol lipase Rv0183, play critical roles during both the active and dormant phases of Mtb and present novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Through high-throughput screening at the European Lead Factory, we identified a novel chemotype characterized by a hydroxypyrrolidine ring, which demonstrated potent inhibition of Rv0183 and promising results in whole cell bacterial studies. Subsequent co-crystallization studies of this chemotype with Rv0183 revealed non-covalent interactions within the lipase's binding pocket, elucidating the inhibitory mechanism. Comparative analysis, augmented by AI-driven 3D-point-cloud approaches, distinguished Rv0183's ligand-binding cavity from that of human monoacylglycerol lipase, implying the possibility for species-selective inhibition. This selectivity was further supported by molecular docking simulations which validated the experimental binding affinities and predicted strong, specific binding modes. Our study presents not only the structural basis for the inhibition of Rv0183 by these novel hydroxypyrrolidine-based inhibitors but also demonstrates the utility of integrating computational and empirical methods to achieve species-specific targeting. This approach could minimize off-target effects in humans, marking a significant step toward developing more effective antitubercular therapies. The potential to selectively inhibit Mtb in its dormant state could lead to treatments that prevent the persistence and resurgence of the disease, addressing a crucial gap in the fight against tuberculosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Tuberculosis (TB) is a significant health threat due to its high mortality rate and the challenges associated with its treatment and prevention. In 2023, a total of 1.25 million people died from TB and another 10.8 million people fell ill with TB worldwide. These numbers make <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), the causative agent for TB, again the leading single infectious killer after COVID-19 had replaced it for three years <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Accordingly, Mtb has been added to the updated Bacterial Priority Pathogens List in 2024 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. WHO has called for a 90% reduction in TB-death for 2030 in its 'The End TB Strategy' <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The disease's ability to go in latency, coupled with the risk of inadequate treatment compliance leads to more and more drug resistant strains. Most antibiotics used to treat tuberculosis work on replicating bacteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. However, a major chance - and challenge - to eradicate TB is the bacterium's ability to transition from a replicating to a non-replicating state, the latter having less susceptibility to the action of antibiotics and resulting in poor treatment outcomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. To address this issue, it is crucial to identify and target proteins that are active during dormancy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Proteins in lipid metabolism of Mtb have been identified as having great potential as drug targets, due to their important roles in the generation of energy, maintenance of cell integrity, and the synthesis of the cell wall during dormancy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The Mtb genome encodes a remarkable number of serine hydrolases compared to other bacterial pathogens and humans: they represent 4.4% of the Mtb proteome, whereas this enzyme class represents 1.5-2.2% in other pathogens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and 1.2% in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Studies from two independent laboratories indicate that the serine hydrolase monoacylglycerol lipase Rv0183 remains active during the dormant/persistent and the reactivation stage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Rv0183 was found in the cell wall and in the culture medium as secreted lipase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Sera of TB patients show a humoral immune response with IgG antibodies specific for Rv0183 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. The lipase has been associated with the degradation of lipid droplets present in adipocytes or foamy macrophages, resulting in the generation of free fatty acids that may be used as energy supply during dormancy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Rv0183 seems to be important but not essential, as clarified by high density mutagenesis studies of Sassetti et al. in 2003 and by CRISPR interference-based functional genomics method of Bossh et al. in 2021. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Knockouts of the homologous gene <italic>MSMEG_0220</italic> in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> drastically altered colony morphology and changes susceptibility to antibiotics. This observation suggests that the phenotype change could impact bacterial stability within macrophages and alter intercellular interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. A study of the role of Rv0183 in mouse alveolar macrophages shows that persistent expression of Rv0183 enhances the immune response by increasing the expression of several cytokines which subsequently can cause tissue damage and host cell death <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Based on the observations, that i) Rv0183 is actively expressed during dormancy and the active stage of Mtb, ii) loss of the ortholog gene in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> results in significant changes of cell morphology and drug susceptibility, and iii) Rv0183 modulates the immune response in alveolar macrophages, we study Rv0183 as target for pharmacological inhibition aiming at potential beneficial therapeutic output of individuals infected with Mtb.</p><p id="P5">In previous studies, we determined the three-dimensional (3D) structure of Rv0183 using X-ray crystallography <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Rv0183 has an α/βP hydrolase fold harboring a catalytic triad (S110, D226 and H256) with a cap structure that covers the binding pocket. The cap of Rv0183 adopts a Z-like shape typical for lipases with high specificity for monoacylglycerol (MG) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Based on the ability of the mycobacterial lipase Rv0183 to effectively hydrolyze MGs of different chain lengths, it also has been termed as monoacylglycerol lipase from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (mtbMGL) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Rv0183 also hydrolyzes diacylglycerol, yet to a lesser extent than MG; no activity towards triacylglycerols was observed in different laboratories <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Our previously reported crystal structures already gave important insights into the nature of the binding pocket: They reveal binding modes and orientation of the acyl-chain of the MG substrate and give first indications, that selective inhibition of Rv0183 over human MGL is possible upon analysis of similar and distinct features of the binding pocket <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">To achieve the goal in identifying inhibitors for Rv0183, we successfully applied at the European Lead Factory (ELF), acting as a shared platform for drug discovery that was funded by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) and the Innovative Health Initiative. The ELF library houses a high-quality compound library of unique chemical compounds with drug-like properties from pharmaceutical companies, academic partners and medicinal chemists <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. There, we pursued a high-throughput screening (HTS) effort to generate effective starting points for our drug discovery efforts against Rv0183. This paper presents the first small molecule inhibitors of Rv0183 that we obtained from this ELF screening campaign. While the complete screening library contained approx. 470 000 compounds, 33 compounds were selected as potential hits and included in the quality hit list (QHL). All compounds of the QHL demonstrated an IC50 in the low μM range/ pIC50 &gt; 5. We co-crystallized three inhibitors named ELF1, ELF5, and ELF8 with Rv0183 and determined high resolution structures. Importantly, these compounds demonstrated growth inhibitory activity against MtbH37Rv when grown with monoolein as a sole carbon source. These three lead compounds share a 3-hydroxypyrrolidin-1yl-methanone moiety which is substituted by different ring systems. Our crystallographic analysis reveals that 3-hydroxypyrrolidin-1-yl-methanone moiety is strategically positioned to engage in a critical interaction in proximity to the catalytic site of Rv0183. Furthermore, we identified interactions of the substituted pyrazole, pyrimidine and oxazole ring systems along the substrate binding pocket. We also employed an innovative 3D-point-cloud based approach to compare the binding cavities of the inhibitor-binding sites in the available structures of Rv0183 and their human orthologs. Our analysis disclosed a discrete and distinctly apart grouping of Rv0183 from the human monoacylglycerol lipase (hMGL).

This resulted in 2219 compounds that gave a Z-score ≤ -4 and a decreased activity (termed effect) ≥ 25% at an inhibitor concentration of 10 μM. A total of 2382 compounds were selected at this stage (including 132 Bayesians and 31 nearest neighbors) of which 2263 compounds being available for further testing. After retesting of these components in the same assay (Z-prime 0.92-0.94 and S/B range of 10.8-11.3) 413 molecules could be confirmed as active for Rv0183 inhibition with more than 25% inhibition at compound concentrations of 10 μM (Z-score ≤ -4). The selected compounds were tested in dose-response experiments (DRC) using both primary and orthogonal assays. Additionally, the confirmed active compounds were tested in the thermal shift assay (TSA) to provide evidence of target engagement. A total of 93 compounds were selected based on specific criteria, including a pIC50 &gt; 4.8 and a hill slope of 0.5 to 1 in one of the DRC experiments (to exclude compounds with nonspecific effects on the target), or a thermal shift either ≥ 1.5°C (TSA score 1) or falling between the cut-off (4*SD of the mean Rv0183 + DMSO) and 1.5°C (TSA score 2).

Furthermore, ELF5 exhibits the highest number of hydrogen bond acceptors and hydrogen-bond donors (HBA/HBD = 7/2). This is corroborated by the crystal structure, which reveals one additional bond compared to the other compounds.

The matched portion corresponds to 33% of the 7PRM cavity. 26% represents the proportion of the Rv0183 cavity that overlaps with the human MGL cavity following alignment of the 3D point cloud.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, all 3 compounds were able to inhibit the growth of <italic>Mtb</italic>H37Rv, albeit at high micromolar concentrations (MIC values &gt; 50 μM).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P48">In this research, we describe the identification and detailed structural characterization of 3 compounds out of a library of 470,000 that act as potent inhibitors for the lipase Rv0183. The inhibitors have a low MW (398-418 Da) and good druggability scores, IC50 values (4.2-9.5μM) and share a hydroxypyrrolidine as a common element that is bound close to the active site. These inhibitors represent a valuble group of potential compounds for selective inhibition of Rv0183 upon for further development.</p><p id="P49">Different structures of Rv0183 have been published, both in free and substrate-mimic-bound forms and demonstrate a large substrate binding pocket that is formed by the core lipase and the cap thus fine-tuning the overall shape of the cavity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Similar cap dynamics has been observed structurally for other monoacylglycerol lipase, namely human MGL, MGL from <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. H257 and the yeast monoacylglycerol lipase YJU3p <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. Although the volume of the binding pocket varies due to its dynamic nature, the physicochemical properties remain consistent.</p><p id="P50">In the three structures published here, the residues of the second helix of the cap, namely Q164, E165, L166, and F168 seem to have high flexibility with respect to side-chain placement either inwards towards the substrate binding cavity or towards the surface of the protein. Side-chain flexibility in this part of the cap has also been observed for orthologs of Rv0183, with Leu166 of Rv0183 corresponding to the so-called gatekeeper residue I145 from <italic>Bacillus sp.</italic> H257 and I178 in the human ortholog <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. Flexibility of the cap can open up another entrance to the binding pocket. It has been proposed for other MGL homologs from human and <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. H257 that the glycerol product of the enzymatic reaction can exit the binding pocket through a glycerol exit channel <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. Some density indicating an alternate conformation for ring 1 with the OH group pointing to the opposite direction is also present in the complex structure with ELF5. In this conformation, a weak H-bond might form between the OH-group and Y181 of Rv0183 (3.5 Å O-O distance, not shown) that is reminiscent of the glycerol-binding by E256 in MGL from <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. H257.</p><p id="P51">The ELF inhibitors create a network of hydrogen bonds around the active site to the hydroxypyrrolidine, while the other ring systems are located within a cavity mainly formed by hydrophobic side chains. These inhibitors are positioned in the binding pocket similarly to the substrate mimic maglipan (hexadecylbutylphosphonofluoridate)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. The hydroxypyrrolidine adopts a position similar to the glycerol moiety in the structure of MGL from <italic>Bacillus sp.</italic> H257 (variant D196N for catalytic inactivity) in complex with the substrate 1-laureoyl-glycerol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. For ELF1, ELF5 and ELF8 the hydroxy-group of the hydroxypyrrolidine ring 1 is hydrogen-bonded to H109 and E257. At the hydrophilic bottom of the binding pocket of Rv0183, the nucleophile S110 can perform the nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon, while the oxyanion is stabilized by the oxyanion hole residues, as described by Grininger et. al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. In the ELF-inhibitor complexed structures, backbone NH-atoms of M111 and L39 are in hydrogen bond distance to the carbonyl-carbon at the equivalent position. The other parts of the ELF-inhibitors have mostly hydrophobic interactions in the tunnel formed by hydrophobic side chains. This portion of the pocket provides a favorable environment for the alkyl-chain of the monoacylglycerol substrate.</p><p id="P52">ELF1 differs prominently from ELF5 and ELF8 with respect to the branching that occurs at the pyrazole ring (ring 2). Therefore, ELF1 is shorter in length despite the same number of rings, but broader and the methoxy-phenyl (ring 3A) reaches the entrance to the surface of the protein. ELF8 and especially ELF5 are covered underneath the cap due to the elongated arrangement of the ring systems. ELF5 is the only inhibitor that has an additional hydrogen bond to the protein apart from ring 1, which is between the HN-connection between ring 4 and 5 and to the flexible cap residue Q164 (B-factor: 46.2 Å<sup>2</sup>).</p><p id="P53">ELF8 showed the best inhibition properties (pIC50 = 5.37) along with the highest increase in melting temperature (Δ Tm = 7.3 °C). The higher molecular weight (418 Da) and LogD (4.37) values is due its trifluoralkoxy-substitution on ring 4. Substitution of a methyl or alkoxy groups with a fluorinated homologues (e.g., trifluoromethyl (CF<sub>3</sub>) or OCH<sub>3</sub> to OCF<sub>3</sub> group) is used frequently in medicinal chemistry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. The C-F bond has high strength, a large dipole moment, strong electronegativity, and small size. The increase of lipophilicity of a compound harboring a CF<sub>3</sub> group often leads to advantageous modulation of biophysical and pharmacokinetic properties like hydrophobicity, electrophilicity and ligand-protein interaction (increase in logD, lower passive permeability). The -OCF<sub>3</sub> group is sometimes also associated with increased metabolic stability, possible due to reduced O-demethylation and reduced oxidative metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Considering further development of Rv0183 inhibitors, it its therefore very good to see that such advantageous trifluoromethoxy-benzene groups can smoothly be embedded in the ligand binding cavity of the target protein Rv0183. The binding poses of the ELF-inhibitors as observed experimentally were also identified by molecular docking within the CavitOmix platform with especially robust conformations and strongest predicted binding for ELF8 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). This provides an outstanding starting point for further compound development aided by <italic>in silico</italic> approaches.</p><p id="P54">In the initial phase of the high-throughput screening one goal was to find species-selective inhibitors. In the deselection campaign we were looking for an inhibitor that did not bind to the structurally highly similar human homolog. Even though this criterion was not considered in the selection process initially, no compound in the QHL showed distinct activity on the human ortholog, demonstrating the strength and selectivity of the screening process.</p><p id="P55">Inhibition of human MGL has been a long-standing pharmacological target for neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation and cancer. The production of fatty acids by human MGL acts as pro-tumorigenic signal and fatty acids are used for tumor growth. The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is a monoacylglycerol and a prominent metabolic target of human MGL in the brain. Raising endocannabinoid-levels via blockage of its metabolism, is a sought-after therapeutic option especially for chemotherapy-induced neuropathy and further nourished multiple drug-development campaigns <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. The goal of our study is to inhibit Rv0183 specifically, without affecting the human ortholog. This is important because of the observed negative effects of the efficient irreversible binding of general human MGL inhibitors, such as JZL-184, that cross the blood-brain barrier <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P56">The sequence identity between human MGL and Rv0183 is conserved to 34%, although the overall structure is very similar. Jiang et al. recently reported the structure of a potent selective inhibitor, LEI-515, developed through high throughput screening against human MGL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. The compound binds to human MGL through a covalent reversible mechanism (PDB-code: 8AQF). A comparison of the LEI-515 sulfonyldifluoropentanol moiety binding to human MGL with the ELF hydroxypyrrolidin binding to Rv0183 reveals similar main-chain mediated oxyanion hole hydrogen bond network to the carbonyl oxygen at the bottom of the binding pocket. However, the hydrophobic fluorine moiety of LEI-515 engages in strong hydrophobic interactions via V270 in human MGL, while on the equivalent position in Rv0183 the charged residue E257 plays a crucial role in expanding the hydrogen bond network with the hydroxypyrrolidin of the ELF inhibitor structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, the HTS of more than 200,000 compounds selectively for human MGL did not lead to any structure containing a hydroxypyrrolidin in their QHL containing 50 compounds <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P57">To investigate the differences in the binding pockets in more detail, we used a novel structural bioinformatics method described as the Catalophore™ approach. This technology analyses binding-site similarities by comparing 3D point clouds representing different physico-chemical properties projected by the amino acids into the cavity's empty space. It allows the identification of similar binding sites independently of overall amino acid sequence identity or protein structure, thereby broadening the search space for structurally unrelated proteins which might still comprise similar function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>. Originally showcased to identify promiscuous biocatalytic activity of enzymes, the method has developed into an efficient tool for <italic>in silico</italic> drug-repurposing and side-effect screens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. The different clustering of active site cavities from human proteins and Rv0183 further confirm great potential for designing inhibitors that specifically target the mycobacterial lipase.</p><p id="P58">Testing the ability of these compounds to inhibit Rv0183 at the whole cell level is complicated due to the non-essential nature of this gene under standard, aerobic growth conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. However, by modifying the growth medium to make Mtb reliant on monoolein catabolism for growth, we were able to use standard microtiter plate MIC methodologies to demonstrate genuine growth inhibitory activity of the compounds against the bacterium. While these are promising preliminary results indicating potential on-target activity at the whole cell level, we have not assessed the growth-inhibitory activity of the same compounds with different carbon sources and therefore cannot explicitly conclude that compound activity is monoolein-specific. Furthermore, the MIC values of the 3 tested compounds (50-100 μM) were far in excess of the IC50s determined against purified recombinant protein; this could be due to cell permeability issues, but could also point to a mechanism of action independent of Rv0183. The role of Rv0183 in allowing Mtb to grow on monoolein as a sole carbon source would be best assessed using gene knockout/knockdown strains, however this is beyond the scope of this work.</p><p id="P59">To the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated the role of monoacylglycerol metabolism on the physiology and life cycle of Mtb. It is unlikely Mtb relies on monoacylglycerol as a sole carbon source at any point during the infection cycle, due to the wide variety of carbon sources available within the host milieu <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. However, monoacylglycerol metabolism is likely to be an important process for lipid recycling (e.g., phospholipid metabolism and cell membrane remodeling), as well as an intermediate process in the catabolism of more complex lipid species, such as triacylglycerols, which are known to be carbon sources for the bacterium during host infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. Intracellular triacylglycerols accumulation and subsequent hydrolysis is also known to be important for <italic>Mtb</italic> to tolerate certain <italic>in vitro</italic> generated stress conditions, such as hypoxia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup> and nutrient starvation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>. It is therefore possible that Rv0183 inhibition would have a more dramatic effect under more infection-relevant conditions (such as growth within macrophages, or in <italic>in vitro</italic> non-replicating model systems), and therefore such assays would form the basis of any future microbiological work on these compounds.</p></sec><sec id="S24" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P60">In conclusion, our study has made a significant advancement in the development of selective inhibitors against Mtb by targeting the lipase Rv0183. Guided by an extensive high-throughput screening campaign of nearly half a million compounds, we have identified a trio of hydroxypyrrolidine-ring compounds—ELF1, ELF5, and ELF8—as potent inhibitors, demonstrating species-specific interaction with their bacterial target. These inhibitors exhibit not only low micromolar IC50 values but also desirable drug-like physicochemical attributes, affirming their promise for further drug development. Structural elucidation and molecular docking have revealed their non-covalent binding within the active site of Rv0183 and reinforcing the feasibility of species-selective inhibition. The Catalophore™ comparative analysis further distinguishes the binding site of Rv0183 from its human ortholog, mitigating potential cross-reactivity concerns and reinforcing the specificity of these inhibitors. Finally, we could also show that these compounds were active against live <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> when grown with monoolein as the sole carbon source. These findings facilitate the next steps toward novel combination therapies aimed at treating both active and dormant tuberculosis infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Material S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS206478-supplement-Supplemental_Material_S1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d35aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Material S2</label><media xlink:href="EMS206478-supplement-Supplemental_Material_S2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d35aAcFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Parts of the work leading to these results have received support from the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking under Grant Agreement n' 115489 "the European Lead Factory" and Grant Agreement No 806948 "ESCulab", resources of which are composed of financial contribution from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7 /2007-2013), from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, EFPIA companies' in kind contribution and Medicines for Malaria Venture.</p><p>This research was funded by Austrian Science Fund (FWF), Grant SFB Lipid Hydrolysis FWF F73 and by the Austrian Science Fund ÖAW APART-MINT 12033.
