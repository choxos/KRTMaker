While key components of cyanobacterial FL tolerance have been identified, their genetic enhancement remains unexplored. We applied adaptive laboratory evolution to <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PCC 6803 under two complex FL regimes, including one lethal to the starter strain (LT), to generate FL-adaptive alleles. Our analysis revealed 44 fully segregated novel mutations in 24 monoclonal evolved strains, 28 of which affected proteins or structural RNAs. We focused on three mutations for further study. Mutations in Pam68, involved in photosystem II (PSII) assembly, and Sll0518 were present in all evolved strains, indicating early emergence. These mutations increased tolerance to non-lethal FL conditions when introduced into LT, with the Pam68 mutation possibly protecting PSI by increasing the proportion of less active PSII monomers. A gain-of-function mutation in RpaB, regulator of phycobilisome association B, was found in three strains tolerant to lethal FL. When introduced into LT, this mutation significantly increased tolerance to both lethal FL and high light conditions, associated with downregulation of photosystem accumulation and light harvesting. As RpaB has plant homologs, this finding could potentially be used to improve agricultural productivity under variable light conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>adaptive laboratory evolution</kwd><kwd>fluctuating light</kwd><kwd>Pam68</kwd><kwd>photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>RpaB</kwd><kwd>Synechocystis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cyanobacteria are unique prokaryotes capable of oxygenic photosynthesis.

Therefore, we applied ALE to evolve novel alleles conferring FL tolerance in Synechocystis, resulting in the identification of distinct candidate mechanisms for tolerance to different types of light fluctuations. Mutation of the cyanobacteria-specific protein Sll0518 and of Pam68, which is involved in the early assembly of PSII and is conserved between cyanobacteria and flowering plants, conferred tolerance to moderate FL conditions. The drastically increased tolerance to both FL and HL conditions conferred by a mutation in RpaB, regulator of phycobilisome association B, which has homologs in eukaryotic algae and flowering plants, holds promise for potential application in plants to enhance FL tolerance and photosynthetic efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Generation of FL-tolerant batch cultures through adaptive evolution</title><p id="P6">We adapted Synechocystis strains to tolerate fluctuating light (FL) using adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE), building on previous methods for generating high light (HL) tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.

These protocols modified an existing FL regimen for <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, which alternated between high and low light phases. The first protocol, "FL0", maintained the original 1-min HL / 5-min LL rhythm but increased light intensity. Starting with 700 μmol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for HL (HL<sub>700</sub>) and 50 μmol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for LL (LL<sub>50</sub>), the intensity of the HL and LL phases were gradually altered to 1200 (HL<sub>1200</sub>) and 12 μmol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (LL<sub>12</sub>), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).

Under their respective final FL conditions, FL+ strains exhibited higher growth rates and increased cell density compared to FL0 cultures, although with lower chlorophyll content.

Genome sequence analysis yielded a mutation matrix revealing 412 mutations (234 in FL0 and 269 in FL+) absent in both LT and WT strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P15">The majority of these mutations (349 total, 201 in FL0 and 223 in FL+) were located within coding regions of the genome. Almost all (342 total, 198 in FL0 and 218 in FL+) were single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), while seven (3 in FL0 and 5 in FL+) were insertions or deletions (InDels). Among the coding region SNPs, 277 (157 in FL0 and 182 in FL+) resulted in non-synonymous exchanges, modifying the amino acid sequence of 89 proteins (53 and 56 in FL0 and FL+, respectively) with known function and affecting an additional 188 proteins (104 and 126 in FL0 and FL+, respectively) with unknown functions. A comparative analysis among the 24 strains showed considerable variability in the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The distribution of allele frequencies across the two FL-ALE experiments was extremely polarized: almost two-thirds of the mutations were classified as ‘low-frequency’ occurring in ≤ 10% of the reads, while about one-quarter of the alleles were fully segregated, exhibiting a frequency of 100%, indicating their presence in virtually every read from the respective samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). In contrast to the allele frequencies reported for the subset of the HL-ALE experiment which did not include external mutagens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, the high proportion of low-frequency alleles appears to be characteristic of our FL-ALE experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>FL adaptive haplotype</title><p id="P17">Genomic analysis identified 101 fully segregated mutations that were present in the evolved strains, LT, or WT, but absent from the published Synechocystis reference genome. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on these mutations showed a clear distinction between adapted strains and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). FL0 strains shared 39 fully segregated mutations, including 6 novel alleles (absent in LT/WT controls), and exhibited shorter genetic distances among themselves compared to FL+ clones. FL+ strains displayed increased phenotypic variability, as reflected by larger genetic distances.</p><p id="P18">Of the 101 fully segregated mutations, 44 were novel (not present in LT or WT), including 16 mutations in non-coding regions, 24 protein-altering mutations, and four mutations in structural RNAs. Of these 28 fully segregated mutations, affecting proteins or structural RNAs, five were common to both FL0 and FL+ strains, three were specific to FL0 strains, and 20 were specific to FL+ strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Three mutations (in <italic>rpoDI, sll0518, pam68</italic>) occurred in all 24 evolved strains, and five loci harbored multiple mutations. Functionally, the mutated genes were involved in various processes, including transcription (6), translation (2), metabolism (2), and photosynthesis (2) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Three mutations were selected for further analysis: <italic>sll0518<sub>A133V</sub></italic>, a missense mutation in a gene encoding a cyanobacteria-specific protein of unknown function, <italic>pam68<sub>S113G</sub></italic>, a missense mutation in <italic>pam68/sll0933,</italic> encoding a factor involved in the early assembly of PSII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, and <italic>rpaB<sub>T183P</sub></italic>, a missense mutation in the <italic>rpaB/slr0947</italic> gene, encoding the regulator of phycobilisome association B, the inactivation of which reduces the efficiency of energy transfer from phycobilisomes to PSII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. The <italic>sll0518<sub>A133V</sub></italic> and <italic>pam68<sub>S113G</sub></italic> mutations were common to all 24 evolved strains, suggesting that they arose early in the adaptive process. The RpaB<sub>T183P</sub> mutation was exclusive to three FL+ strains, and its importance in conferring FL+ tolerance is further supported by the independent occurrence of another mutation of RpaB (RpaB<sub>D194G</sub>) in three other FL+ strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P20">In conclusion, the genomic analysis revealed a higher frequency of fully segregated, protein-altering mutations in FL+ strains compared to FL0 strains. A substantial subset of these mutations was exclusive to FL+ strains, indicating more extensive genetic adaptation to the stringent FL+ conditions. Conversely, fewer fully segregated mutations were specific to FL0 strains. The shared mutations between FL+ and FL0 strains, particularly those present in all evolved strains, suggest their importance in conferring improved tolerance to the initial FL conditions common to both protocols.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Recapitulating FL tolerance in LT cells and interplay of FL and HL tolerance</title><p id="P21">To assess the individual contributions of mutations identified through FL0 and FL+ adaptive ALE to FL tolerance, three specific mutations (<italic>sll0518<sub>A133V</sub>, pam68S<sub>113G</sub></italic>, and <italic>rpaB<sub>T183P</sub></italic>) were introduced into the LT strain. The growth of these mutant strains was then evaluated under final FL0 and final FL+ conditions. The <italic>sll0518<sub>A133V</sub></italic> and <italic>pam68<sub>S113G</sub></italic> mutants showed significantly enhanced FL0 tolerance compared to the LT control, with cell density increases of 107% and 131%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). However, these strains failed to grow productively under final FL+ conditions. In contrast, <italic>rpaB<sub>T183P</sub></italic> displayed growth comparable to LT under FL0 conditions but outperformed all other strains under final FL+ conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p id="P22">To explore whether these mutations also affect growth under constant light intensities, the mutant strains and LT control were cultured under constant low light (LL<sub>12</sub>) and constant high light (HL<sub>1200</sub>) conditions. Under LL<sub>12</sub>, <italic>sll0518<sub>A133V</sub></italic> exhibited slightly increased growth, <italic>rpaB<sub>T183P</sub></italic> showed slightly decreased growth compared to LT, while <italic>pam68<sub>S113G</sub></italic> grew similarly to LT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Under HL<sub>1200</sub> conditions, which are lethal for non-evolved LT cells, only <italic>rpaB<sub>T183P</sub></italic> demonstrated productive growth, while LT, <italic>sll0518<sub>A133V</sub></italic>, and <italic>pam68<sub>S113G</sub></italic> failed to grow (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P23">To investigate the potential correlation between tolerance to final FL+ conditions and constant HL (HL<sub>1200</sub>) conditions, we examined whether mutations conferring HL tolerance could also impart resistance to FL+ conditions. This hypothesis was based on the observation that the <italic>rpaB<sub>T183P</sub></italic> strain exhibited tolerance to both final FL+ and constant HL<sub>1200</sub> conditions. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the growth of three previously characterized strains: HL1, HL2, and HL1/2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Contrary to our hypothesis, none of the HL-tolerant strains exhibited growth under FL+ conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). This observation suggests that the mechanisms underlying tolerance to constant HL and fluctuating HL conditions may be distinct, and that adaptations to one condition do not necessarily confer tolerance to the other.</p><p id="P24">In summary, the results indicate that two mutations (<italic>sll0518<sub>A133V</sub></italic> and <italic>pam68<sub>S113G</sub></italic>) identified in all strains adapted to final FL0 or FL+ conditions confer enhanced tolerance to FL0 when individually introduced into the LT strain. However, these mutations alone do not provide tolerance to FL+ conditions. Conversely, a mutation specific to FL+ adaptation (<italic>rpaB<sub>T183P</sub></italic>) imparts tolerance to both FL+ and constant HL conditions, even in the absence of the four common mutations found in the FL-adapted haplotypes. This suggests that the FL-adapted haplotype mutations are not prerequisite for FL+ or HL tolerance. The results also reveal that mutations conferring HL tolerance do not necessarily provide tolerance to FL+ conditions, which consist of alternating 1-min pulses of HL intensity and LL intensity, respectively. This observation, coupled with the fact that LT strains can grow under FL0 conditions (with a short HL phase followed by a longer LL phase) but not under continuous HL<sub>1200</sub>, indicates that extended LL phases enable cells to withstand otherwise lethal light intensities. In contrast, brief LL phases appear to exacerbate the detrimental effects of the HL phase.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>The Pam68<sub>S113G</sub> mutation enhances photosynthetic protein accumulation under LL and stabilizes monomeric PSII under FL</title><p id="P25">The <italic>pam68<sub>S113G</sub></italic> mutation, involving a serine-to-glycine substitution at position 113 of the Sll0933/Pam68 protein, demonstrated enhanced tolerance to final FL0 conditions compared to the LT progenitor strain.

While total Pam68<sub>S113G</sub> levels were found depleted under FL0, thylakoid-associated levels were unaltered or slightly increased (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), suggesting that the mutant protein may have an enhanced affinity for its thylakoid protein targets and that overexpression of the WT Pam68 protein might improve FL tolerance through increasing total and thylakoid-associated Pam68 levels.

While the Pam68<sub>S113G</sub> mutation did not affect the accumulation of the PSII assembly intermediate RC47, it did lead to a depletion of dimeric PSII under FL0 conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). As dimeric PSII is more abundant in the Pam68 deletion mutant <italic>ins0933</italic> mutant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, this implies that the Pam68<sub>S113G</sub> mutation has an opposite effect compared to Pam68 depletion.

Together with an apparent shift of the Pam68<sub>S113G</sub> protein towards higher molecular weight fractions under FL0 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), this may indicate that the increased FL tolerance is due to an increased affinity of Pam68<sub>S113G</sub> for its thylakoid-localized substrate.
