Therapeutic targeting of Trp metabolism could be relevant to several pathologies. In cancer, IDO1 acts as an immune checkpoint suppressing effector T cell function. Yet, direct inhibition of IDO1 has had limited success in clinical trials. Therefore, alternative approaches to Trp metabolism therapeutic targeting are needed. We screened a library of 597 natural products (NPs) or NP derivatives for their effect on kynurenine production in triple negative breast cancer cells. This revealed 24 candidate inhibitors of kynurenine production. Amongst them, artemether, a member of the artemisinin family of anti-malarial drugs, suppressed kynurenine production, likely via an endoperoxide bridge-dependent mechanism. The Euphorbia factor L9 (EFL9) inhibited kynurenine production likely via a C7-benzoylation-dependent mechanism. Neither artemether nor EFL9 affected JAK/STAT signaling or IDO1 levels. Targeted metabolomics analyses demonstrated that artemether suppressed kynurenine production through heme sequestration, a mechanism that would affect all members of the IDO/TDO family of metalloenzymes. EFL9 affected purine and amino acid metabolism and the cellular redox balance. Comparisons to the effects of ouabain, a NP regulator of IDO1 levels, and Linrodostat, a clinically used small molecule IDO1 inhibitor, revealed distinct metabolic profiles, with ouabain and EFL9 showing the largest overlap. Importantly, the kynurenine-suppressing activity of artemether and EFL9 is not cancer cell-specific. Overall, our findings set the foundation for the use of derivatives of artemether or EFL9 as novel Trp metabolism-targeting therapeutics.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Tryptophan metabolism</kwd><kwd>immune checkpoints</kwd><kwd>natural products</kwd><kwd>IDO1</kwd><kwd>artemisinin</kwd><kwd>euphorbia factors</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>drug screening</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The catabolism of L-Tryptophan (Trp) by antigen presenting, infected, or cancer cells represents a well-studied metabolic immune checkpoint pathway with therapeutic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Trp is an essential amino acid with low abundance in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). It is assimilated from nutrients and can serve a range of physiological functions, including protein synthesis and production of neuroactive metabolites required for serotonin synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Over 90% of available Trp is catabolised through the kynurenine pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The first step of the kynurenine pathway is mediated by the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Depending on the tissue, one of two isoforms can be expressed, IDO1 or IDO2. In the liver, the first step of the kynurenine pathway and rate-limiting reaction is performed by Trp deoxygenase or TDO. However, IDO1 is also present in the liver and seems to be exacerbated in disease, playing an essential role in regulating the local immune landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Downstream metabolites of the pathway are involved in energy metabolism (<italic>de novo</italic> NAD<sup>+</sup>), neuromodulation (e.g. kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid), or immuno-regulation (e.g. kynurenic acid, kynurenine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Inhibiting Trp metabolism has been identified as a potential immune checkpoint-targeting therapy. By depleting Trp, IDO1/2 and/ or TDO are deprived of their primary substrate and thus kynurenine production is impaired, preventing the immunosuppressive effects of kynurenine, including inhibition of effector T cells through Trp and glucose starvation, and preferential differentiation of regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Metabolites downstream of kynurenine, such as kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid and cinnabarinic acid interact with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Furthermore, Trp depletion has been shown to contribute to neoantigen formation by interfering with translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). The same translational defects can also trigger activation of general control non-derepressible-2 (GCN2) dependent starvation responses, which impair growth and activate autophagy pathway, likely to clear cancerous mutations and thus decrease tumour progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).</p><p id="P3">In breast cancer, the rate-limiting and Trp catabolic enzyme IDO1 is highly upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). In fact, IDO1 is significantly upregulated in most solid cancers, functioning as a prognostic biomarker of disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Mechanistically, IDO1 expression in cancer cells is induced by proinflammatory stimulation via the IFNγ receptor (IFNγR). This activates the JAK1/2-STAT1 pathway which is required for IDO1 expression. TNF further amplifies IDO1 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). IDO1 converts Trp into an alkyl-phenylketone called N-formylkynurenine, further converted by formamidase to kynurenine. In this way, IDO1 induces Trp starvation of cytotoxic T cells, preventing attack against the tumour, as well as promoting differentiation of regulatory T cells via kynurenine-AhR regulated transcriptional reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Energetically, the kynurenine pathway ultimately generates <italic>de novo</italic> NAD<sup>+</sup> molecules, thus contributing to growth and survival of IDO1-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). For these reasons, a series of small molecule inhibitors that interact directly with IDO1 such as Indoximod, Epacadostat, Linrodostat mesylate, Navoximod or PF-0684003, as well as peptide vaccines, have been designed for IDO1-targeted therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Of these, Indoximod, a Trp mimetic, has been clinically approved for the treatment of melanoma in combination with chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). The limited clinical efficacy through direct IDO1 inhibition supports the need for novel approaches of targeting the kynurenine response, such as interfering with Trp metabolism, or targeting other linked physiological parameters, such as ionic dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Natural products (NPs) have been selected through millions of years of evolution to be bioactive. They account for almost a quarter of all drugs (50% in cancer) in terms of origin or inspiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). NPs have high chemical and stereochemical flexibility and have been used for cancer treatment, examples include the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, currently FDA approved for the treatment of breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, or taxol derivatives which work as microtubule inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Interestingly, some natural compounds have also been identified as potential IDO1 inhibitors with mild/ moderate activity: natural quinones, such as ubiquinone, which has been synthetically modified to improve its potency, or vitamin K3, also known for its function in regulating cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Flavonoids reduced survival of human cervical cancer cells by direct interaction with IDO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), and curcumin has been shown to supress JAK/STAT-mediated IDO1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Breast cancer shows limited responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), with most common treatment options being chemotherapy, surgery, hormone therapy as well as some targeted therapies such as Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. However, the most severe type of breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), has been shown to have increased immune infiltration and thus better response to immunotherapy, leading to FDA approval of the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody therapy, Pembrolizumab, for early-stage TNBC treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). The limited response of TNBC to conventional treatments highlights the need for developing better immune checkpoint targeted therapies for these patients. We have previously characterised the inhibitory effect on IDO1 in TNBC cell lines of two natural compounds, digoxin, first identified in foxglove (<italic>Digitalis lanata</italic>), and a compound extracted from the <italic>Acokanthera schimperi</italic> and <italic>Strophanthus gratus</italic> plants, ouabain, both members of the cardiac glycoside family. We showed that cardiac glycosides are indirect modulators of kynurenine production, causing decreased activation of the main IDO1 transcriptional regulator, STAT1, potentially achieved via dysregulation of the intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Here, using an assay that quantifies kynurenine secretion, we screened a library of 597 NPs or NP derivatives. We identified and validated two compounds that inhibited kynurenine production and Trp metabolism: artemether, an acetal derivative of the endoperoxide-containing sesquiterpene artemisinin, and Euphorbia factor L9 (EFL9). Mechanistically, artemether, but not EFL9, inhibited kynurenine production through a heme-dependent mechanism, a strategy that could potentially affect all metalloenzymes of the IDO/TDO family.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>A screen of 597 unique NPs or derivatives identifies 24 inhibitors and 1 enhancer of kynurenine production in TNBC cells</title><p id="P6">We have previously identified the cardiac glycoside drugs, ouabain and digoxin, as inhibitors of the kynurenine response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) using a colorimetric assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Using the same assay, we screened the effect of a library of 597 NPs or NP derivatives on kynurenine production by MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells following treatment with IFNγ and TNF. The combined compound library consisted predominantly of terpenoids with other classes of compounds such as: alkaloids, phenylpropanoids, polysaccharides and casbene-derivatives (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). The full list of compounds is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1A</xref>. The first round of screening included all compounds and was used to identify compounds of interest (COIs), which affected kynurenine production without impacting on cell viability. Ouabain was used as a NP positive control given its effect on kynurenine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). We identified COIs either based on fold-change in kynurenine levels (2-fold decrease or 1.4-fold increase) compared to the Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated cells (ran in triplicate in every plate) or based on a change in kynurenine levels by more than three standard deviations (SD) from the mean of the DMSO-treated control. These arbitrary thresholds were used to allow selection of a range of compounds for further validation. With regards to fold-change, we initially aimed to select kynurenine fold-change thresholds equivalent to 50% change either side of the control. However, due to the low resolving power of the assay at high kynurenine concentrations, we selected a 40% increase as an initial threshold for detecting potential enhancers of kynurenine production. With regards to SD difference, only plates that had a 3xSD difference between the positive (ouabain) and negative (DMSO) control were included in the analysis (see Methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Each compound was tested in two independent replicates, and the workflow of the pharmacological screen is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>. We identified 50 COIs (shown in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), 44 of which caused a reduction in kynurenine production. All inhibitory and enhancer COIs gave a viability value equal to or over 0.7 of that corresponding to the vehicle unstimulated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The kynurenine, fold change, SD variation and viability data for all tested compounds included in the screen, as well as for the controls, are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1A and B</xref>.</p><p id="P7">All the COIs and an arbitrarily selected set of 8 borderline compounds (for example, compounds that resulted in a 0.51 decrease in kynurenine, or viability of 0.69) were chosen for further validation (58 compounds in total). For the validation round, we designated as inhibitory hit compounds those that caused a 2-fold decrease in kynurenine reduction and a decrease greater than mean-3xSD of the DMSO control. As enhancers, we designated compounds that increased kynurenine production by 1.4-fold and mean+3xSD of the DMSO-treated control. This identified 24 inhibitory hits, and 1 enhancer (Forskolin) hit (shown in green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). All hits had a viability score above the 0.7 threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1A</xref> shows the data for each compound tested in the validation round. The identified hits were ordered based on the magnitude of the kynurenine production inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>) and a literature search identified a list of signalling pathways previously linked to these compounds. These included NF-kB signalling, JAK/STAT activation, AKT/PI3K signalling, MAPK/JNK/ERK/p38 activation, cell cycle regulation and ion transport mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Artemisinin derivatives that carry an endoperoxide structure suppress kynurenine production without impacting on expression of IDO1 and the JAK/STAT pathway</title><p id="P8">Having identified 24 compounds with inhibitory activity against the kynurenine response, the next step was to select candidates for further mechanistic studies. We selected compound classes that exhibited a correlation between their chemical structure and their biological activity, indicating a potential role of specific chemical groups in modulating the kynurenine response. For each compound class, the most potent kynurenine inhibitory compounds were selected for further studies, together with a structurally similar but biologically inactive member of the class, selected as a negative control. The first class of compounds that we focused on consisted of artemisinin derivatives, traditionally used as anti-malaria therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>).</p><p id="P9">All compounds that carried the oxygen endoperoxide bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), highlighted with the red box, demonstrated activity either as COIs (artemether, artemisinin, artesunate and dihydro-artemisinin) or as validated hits (artemether). The endoperoxide bridge has been identified as the moiety responsible for the anti-malaria activity in artemisinin derivative molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Notably, deoxyartemisinin, an artemisinin derivative that lacks the endoperoxide core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), was also included in the screen and showed no activity against the kynurenine response. Titration of artemether and deoxyartemisinin showed that only the former induces a concentration-dependent decrease in kynurenine production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), without affecting viability. Artemether had no impact on IDO1 mRNA or protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-F</xref>). Consistent with this finding, artemether did not affect activation of the JAK/STAT pathway or expression of PD-L1, another immune checkpoint protein downstream of the same pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). This suggests that, unlike our previous findings with ouabain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), artemether does not reduce kynurenine by interfering with IFNγ signalling and subsequent IDO1 expression. Overall, artemether suppressed kynurenine production correlating with a potential activity from the endoperoxide bridge structure within the molecule of artemether, without affecting JAK/STAT signalling or IDO1 levels.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Euphorbia factors with a C7 modification suppress kynurenine production without impacting on expression of IDO1 and the JAK/STAT pathway</title><p id="P10">We examined a series of diterpenoid NPs from <italic>Euphorbia</italic> sp. with a lathyrane skeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We identified EFL2 as a COI, with some activity on the kynurenine response, while EFL9 was identified as a hit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1A</xref>). EFL1 and all the other members of the class included in the screen had no impact on kynurenine. EFL9 has not been widely researched, and little is known about its biological activity. Structurally, EFL2 and EFL9 share a C7 modification, which is not found in any of the other class members included in this screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that the C7 modification might be responsible for their effect on kynurenine production. Titration of the hit (EFL9), the COI (EFL2), and another member of the class with similar structure but no C7 modification (EFL3) was carried out. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> shows that both EFL9 and EFL2 suppress kynurenine production in a dose-dependent manner, with EFL9 being more potent. None of the three factors tested affected viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), IDO1 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), or IDO1, (p)STAT1 and PD-L1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E, F</xref>). This result demonstrated that EFL2 and EFL9 inhibit kynurenine production likely via a C7-benzoylation-dependent mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Artemether and EFL9 and EFL2 suppress kynurenine production from non-transformed primary mammary epithelial cells</title><p id="P11">Having shown that artemether and EFL9 and EFL2 decrease kynurenine levels in MDA-MB-231 cells, we tested whether these effects were restricted to cancer cells. The effect of ouabain, artemether (and its control deoxyartemisinin), EFL9 and EFL2 (and their control EFL3) on kynurenine and IDO1 expression were measured in primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) from two different donors. We found that kynurenine levels in HMECs follow the same trend as in MDA-MB-231 cells in response to artemether, EFL9, and ouabain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). None of the compounds affected cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). As in the case of breast cancer cells, ouabain caused a decrease in IDO1 mRNA and protein levels, whereas artemisinin derivatives and Euphorbia factors did not affect IDO1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). These results demonstrated that the effects of ouabain, artemether, EFL9 and EFL2 on kynurenine are not specific to cancer cells, suggesting that these compounds might affect core processes involved in Trp metabolism and kynurenine production.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Artemether, EFL9, and ouabain have overlapping and distinct effects on Trp metabolism in TNBC cells</title><p id="P12">Having shown that artemether and EFL9 affect kynurenine through IDO1 expression-independent mechanisms, we further assessed their impact on Trp metabolism. To this end, we measured intracellular levels of Trp metabolites by mass spectrometry in control (DMSO-treated) cells and in response to treatment with artemether and EFL9. EFL9 was selected for these experiments as it showed the most potent effect on kynurenine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). We also compared the metabolic profiles of artemether- and EFL9-treated cells to those of cells treated with ouabain or the clinically used small molecule IDO1 inhibitor, Linrodostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out on all the detected metabolites (135 metabolites) and showed a clear separation of the 4 treatment conditions, with some similarity observed between the artemether and DMSO conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). The data set was then reduced to metabolites that could be confidently annotated (47 metabolites). There was still separation between the four groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), albeit weaker likely due to reducing the number of included metabolites. The EFL9 group seemed to be the most heterogenous, as well as the most distinct from the DMSO group, while artemether-treated cells showed the highest similarity to the DMSO condition. Finally, ouabain treated samples gave the tightest grouping based on PC1, showing some overlap with the EFL9 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Next, we performed pair-wise comparisons between the cell lysate metabolites in the DMSO-treated group and the three drug-treated groups. These analyses included the annotated metabolites only. Ouabain treatment led to statistically significant changes in the levels of 4 metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), whereas artemether and EFL9 treatment resulted in statistically significant changes in 5 and 11 metabolites, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). All drugs led to an increase in the Trp levels in the cell, while decreasing the levels of formyl-5-hydroxykynurenamine and 5-hydroxy-L-Trp. Ouabain and EFL9 decreased the levels of N-formylkynurenine. Both artemether and EFL9 also suppressed levels of kynurenic acid. Interestingly, only artemether decreased intracellular heme levels. EFL9 also decreased the levels of 5’-methylthioadenosine and L-alanine.</p><p id="P15">Having observed overlaps between the effects of artemether and EFL9 on Trp metabolism in MBA-MB-231 cells, we explored their combinatory effect. We found that artemether and EFL9 have additive effects on kynurenine suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E, F</xref>), suggesting that they operate through independent mechanisms. Our metabolic profiling experiment had indicated that only artemether treatment led to a decrease in heme levels. Indeed, restoring heme levels through addition of hemin reversed the effect of artemether without affecting kynurenine levels in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G, H</xref>). In agreement with this, inhibition of heme biosynthesis with succinyl acetone (SA) also led to a reduction in kynurenine levels in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G, H</xref>). We also measured levels of secreted metabolites in culture supernatants in response to ouabain, artemether and EFL9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). All three drugs showed a decrease in N-formylkynurenine, formyl-5-hydroxykynurenamin and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, while the levels of Trp in the supernatants were elevated in comparison to the DMSO control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S3 and S4</xref>). This indicated that the intracellular reduction in N-formylkynurenine was not due to increased export of kynurenine but a result of kynurenine pathway inhibition. Taken together, these results reveal that artemether and EFL9 have overlapping and distinct effects on Trp metabolism and kynurenine production. Artemether controls kynurenine production through heme sequestration whereas EFL9 causes a high number of metabolic changes, affecting purine and amino acid metabolism in the cell.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Comparison of changes in Trp metabolism due to NP kynurenine production inhibitors and the direct IDO1 inhibitor Linrodostat</title><p id="P16">Our analyses gave us the opportunity to compare the metabolic effects of NP and NP-derived inhibitors of kynurenine production (artemether, EFL9, and ouabain) and of Linrodostat in MDA-MB-231 cells. We confirmed that Linrodostat suppressed kynurenine levels in a concentration dependent manner, without impacting on viability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>).

Of note, ouabain, which suppresses IDO1 levels, and Linrodostat, which inhibits IDO1 activity, demonstrated completely overlapping profiles in terms of downregulated metabolites. Ouabain downregulated the levels of the immediate IDO1 reaction product, N-formylkynurenine, as expected based on its negative effect on IDO1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Ouabain also impacted on the serotonin/indole pathway, reducing metabolites such as formyl-5-hydroxykynurenamine, which is a serotonin-derived IDO-enzyme reaction product, but also upstream metabolites such as 5-hydroxy-L-Trp, which is a direct metabolite of Trp produced by Trp hydroxylases 1 and 2 (TPH1/2). Alongside Trp, Linrodostat also upregulated a unique range of key Trp metabolites, including formylanthranilic acid and indole derivatives such as 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde/indole acetic acid and indoleacetaldehyde. In addition, Linrodostat also upregulated other metabolites such as vitamin B6 (pyridoxine/ adermine), purine/energy carrying metabolites (adenosine monophosphate, isonicotinamide) and amino acid levels (valinium).</p><p id="P18">Artemether decreased the levels of metabolites downstream of the TPH1/2 initial reaction and decreased kynurenic acid. As mentioned above, artemether was unique in suppressing heme levels. The direct metabolite of the IDO1-mediated conversion of Trp to kynurenine, N-formylkynurenine, was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). EFL9, like ouabain, decreased the levels of the immediate reaction product of the IDO1 reaction, N-formylkynurenine, and the downstream metabolites kynurenic acid and L-alanine (a by-product from the synthesis of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid). EFL9 also affected the serotonin pathway, decreasing levels of the TPH1/2 direct reaction product, 5-hydroxy-L-Trp, as well as decreasing IDO-mediated conversion of serotonin to formyl-5-hydroxykynurenamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">We investigated the effect of 597 natural products or derivatives on kynurenine production, as an indicator of IDO1 immune checkpoint activity in breast cancer and identified 24 inhibitors and 1 enhancer with low cytotoxic activity. The identification of an IDO1 enhancer might be of interest for conditions were IDO1 is underactive, such as autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Reassuringly, the top inhibitory hit of the screen, alantolactone is a known inhibitor of the JAK/STAT pathway, as well as of other inflammatory mediators including NF-kB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>), which are major regulators of IDO1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). Overall, a large subset of the identified hits have been documented to play a role in inflammation, cell cycle progression, PI3K/AKT or MAPK signalling, and several compounds were shown to also have some activity on ion transport. For this study, we decided to focus on two compound classes that showed a clear correlation between chemical structure features and biological activity: artemisinin derivatives and Euphorbia factors. We selected one representative member from each class, artemether and EFL9, and investigated their effect on kynurenine production, the JAK-STAT pathway, and Trp metabolism. We show that both of these drugs are able to downregulate kynurenine levels without interfering with IDO1 expression or STAT1 activation. Rather, artemether suppresses kynurenine production likely through sequestration of heme, by directly binding to the ferrous heme, which can potentially lead to free radical generation, as reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>) while EFL9 affects the Trp catabolism pathway in a similar but not identical manner to the IDO1 inhibitor Linrodostat.</p><p id="P20">Our findings reveal a currently unrecognised role in the regulation of immune metabolism for artemisinin derivatives, which are the WHO recommended treatment for malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Our results enhance our limited understanding of the mechanism of action of artemisinin derived drugs, particularly since we show that the effect of artemether on kynurenine also occurs in non-cancerous cells. The endoperoxide bridge in artemisinin is thought to be the moiety responsible for the compound’s activity. Although the exact target of artemisinin and its mechanism of action are not fully elucidated, one of the popular current hypotheses is that the endoperoxide structure of the drug interacts with Fe(II) released by malaria parasite-induced degradation of haemoglobin, which creates a toxic activated oxygen within the artemisinin molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Interestingly, artemisinin-related compounds were shown to also have anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity on cancer cells, as well as inhibiting angiogenesis. The exact mechanism of action is unknown; however, increased iron-dependent reactive oxygen species, DNA damage and disrupted mitochondrial membrane have all been proposed as potential mechanistic explanations for these effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). Interestingly, in patients, malaria infection with <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> was associated with increased kynurenine production and Trp depletion that could not be abolished by treatment with artemether-lumefantrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). In our experiments, however, artemether suppressed the kynurenine response in a concentration-dependent manner. Artemether decreased heme levels in breast cancer cells and restoring heme abolished its effect on kynurenine. This is particularly consistent with the structure of the IDO1 enzyme, which is a heme-containing dioxygenase and is believed to exert its mechanism of action by subtracting a proton from the substrate using an iron-bound dioxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). Our findings support that artemether inhibits IDO1 activity by hijacking heme by direct binding from the cytosol and preventing the activation of IDO1. Importantly, this mechanism would impair activity of IDO2 and TDO, which are also metalloenzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>), providing an alternative approach to Trp metabolism targeting to the current specific targeting of IDO1.</p><p id="P21">Of note, artemether also decreased the levels of kynurenic acid, which is an immunoregulatory metabolite. For example, due to its inhibitory effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> import, kynurenic acid has been shown to decrease inflammation by decreasing NF-kB activation and to prevent T cell activation and function through decreased cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). Additionally, it has been reported that kynurenic acid inhibits the IL-23/IL-17 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>). Kynurenic acid has also been shown to trigger the dimerization and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor AhR, which subsequently regulates the expression of genes that control the immune response (e.g., increase in IL6 production), but also Trp metabolism (e.g., lack of AhR increases levels of kynurenic acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>).</p><p id="P22">The second class of compounds that we studied included Euphorbia factors. Just as in the case of artemisinin derivatives, all compounds that showed activity had a common chemical feature: the addition of an aromatic moiety on C7 of the core structure. Euphorbia factors have not been investigated in great detail. Some studies have linked the L2 factor with decreased NF-kB-mediated lung inflammation, or decreased hepatocarcinoma progression in mice, associated with STAT3 and Akt inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>). Euphorbia plant derivatives might also have anti-cancer properties, decreasing migration and angiogenetic potential of colon cancer cells, as well as lowering the pool of cancer stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>). Here, we did not observe any effects on STAT1 activation. Euphorbia-derived phytochemicals have also been shown to act as drug resistance modulators, to alleviate HIV-1 and bacterial infections or to disrupt the mitochondrial respiratory chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>). In our study we show that there is a substantial overlap in the metabolic profile of EFL9 and ouabain. This is particularly interesting given the reported effect of some Euphorbia factors on ion transport, which is another common characteristic with the mechanism of action of ouabain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). However, we identify a specific Trp metabolic signature for EFL9, which is distinct from that of both ouabain and artemether. EFL9 was shown to downregulate both N-formylkynurenine, the direct product of IDO1 activity, and kynurenic acid in cells. A larger number of serotonin pathway metabolites were affected by EFL9, including formyl-5-hydroxykynurenamine, the reaction product of IDO-mediated serotonin degradation decreased in cellular lysates. Similarly, the TPH 1/2 metabolite 5-hydroxy-L-Trp, a serotonin precursor, was also downregulated in cells. EFL9 also downregulated cellular 5-methylthioadenosine, which is an important player in the glutathione pathway, thus maintaining the cellular redox balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>). Interestingly, EFL9 increased levels of LysPC (lysophosphatidylcholine), 1-18:0-lysoPC and 1-16:0-lysoPC. LysPC is a signalling phospholipid produced by caspase 3-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent activation of phospholipase A2 (iPLA2), and functions by recruiting phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>). The elevation in LysPC suggests that EFL9 treatment might thus promote immune mediated tumour-clearance. On the other hand, phosphatidylcholine synthesis, via fatty acid metabolism, is often upregulated in cancer cells, and has been linked to cellular proliferation and cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>). Thus, further experimental evidence would be required to investigate the anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects of EFL9 via phosphatidylcholine/lysophosphatidylcholine upregulation.</p><p id="P23">Linrodostat is a direct inhibitor of IDO1 which interferes with the heme binding pocket and does not allow the assembly of the enzyme with its iron core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>). Thus, unlike artemether, Linrodostat did not impact the cellular heme levels. Instead, it downregulated the same key metabolites as ouabain: 5-hydroxy-L-Trp, N-formylkynurenine and formyl-5-hydroxykynurenamine, metabolites that were also downregulated by EFL9. However, Linrodostat had a distinct profile from artemether and EFL9, particularly when analysing the list of upregulated metabolites. Linrodostat increased the levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde and indoleacetaldehyde, both of which are metabolites downstream of serotonin, and this indicates potential oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>). Linrodostat also upregulated a range of metabolites that were not affected by the other drugs tested in this study. The unique metabolic signature of Linrodostat suggests that neither artemether nor EFL9 fit the profile of a direct IDO1 inhibitor. However, we report overlapping metabolic profiles for EFL9, ouabain and Linrodostat in cells, which will need to be further studied in future biochemical and functional studies.</p><p id="P24">In conclusion, by screening a library of 597 NPs and their derivatives, predominantly terpenoids, for effects on kynurenine production by triple-negative breast cancer cells, we discovered two inhibitors, artemether and EFL9. We identify chemical features that are required for the biological activity of these compounds. By studying the Trp catabolic pathway, and by comparison with the previously described IDO1 regulator ouabain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) and with a clinically used selective IDO1 inhibitor (Linrodostat), we demonstrate distinct metabolic profiles, with ouabain and EFL9 showing the largest overlap in terms of key Trp metabolites. We show that artemether suppresses the kynurenine response by interfering with intracellular heme availability, a mechanism that would affect all members of the IDO/TDO family of metalloenzymes and could be relevant to its clinical use as an anti-malarial drug. Importantly, we demonstrate that the kynurenine-suppressing activity of artemether and EFL9 is not specific to cancer cells. Overall, our findings set the foundation for future studies to explore these NPs and/or their chemically modified derivatives as novel tools to regulate Trp metabolism in cancer and other pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell culture</title><sec id="S12"><title>Culture conditions</title><p id="P25">Human triple-negative metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells were provided by our collaborator, Mustafa Djamgoz.

Easy internal calibration was used to achieve mass accuracy &lt; 1 parts per million (ppm). MS2 data was collected alternating between Higher Collisional Dissociation mode with stepped collision energies (35, 40, 45 %) and Collision-Induced Dissociation Mass Spectrometry mode with a fixed collision energy of 40 %. Dynamic exclusion was set for n = 1 over 4s. Once collected, all files were converted to centroided. mzML and mgf formats using ProteoWIzard msconvert.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Analysis</title><p id="P46">For metabolomics analysis data were processed through bespoke XCMS scripts (provided by the Bioscience Technology Facility at the University of York) to look for exact MS1 matches of the Trp pathway metabolites, with annotations verified and additional annotations included using high-resolution MS2 data processed through Sirius.</p><p id="P47">The raw data files were converted to centroided mzML and mgf formats using ProteoWIzard msconvert. The mzML format files were used as inputs for feature detection using bespoke scripts written in R with functions from the XCMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>). Features were detected with the centWaveWithPredictedIsotopeROIs method, with the following function parameters: ppm = 10; signal to noise threshold (snthresh) = 3; range of peak elution times (s) (peakwidth) = c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>); peak definition: number of data points exceeding a set intensity threshold (prefilter) = c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, 1000); integration method for peak quantification (integrate) = 2 (real data); accepted closeness of two signals in m/z dimension (mzdiff) = -0.1. Duplicate features and features outside the time between 0.7 and 28 min were removed using custom scripts. Features were subsequently grouped using a modified <italic>scms group()</italic> function. Adducts and isotopes were detected using CAMERA. Feature MS1 values were matched to a custom database comprising predicted [M+H] + or [M+H] + ions of the Trp pathway as defined by pathway ID SMP0000063 in the HMDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>). The best representative MS2 spectra (defined as nearest to the MS1 precursor feature apex) were extracted with custom scripts from the .mgf files and converted to .ms2 format using custom scripts for input into Sirius. Feature tables were initially filtered to: 1) only retain features found at least once in any sample with an area value greater than the mean + 3 x the SD value of blank samples; 2) retain any features with a HMDB database hit; and 3) retain features that are probably mono-isotopes (as calculated by CAMERA). Sirius matching was then performed on available initially filtered features, using Sirius 5.8.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>) all default databases and instruments were set to Orbitrap with 5 ppm tolerance. Sirius outputs were merged with feature tables. These were manually further edited to remove redundant and near-baseline features and reconcile HMDB and Sirius annotated features.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Materials and natural products</title><p id="P48">403 NPs were purchased from MedChemExpress.

All experiments were carried out with up to 4 biological repeats, therefore, the sample size was too small to perform normality analysis confidently, and normal distribution was assumed for all data. All data were thus plotted as means and SD, and statistical analysis was performed using an ordinary one-way ANOVA, coupled with a Bonferroni’s post-test (when specific pairs of conditions were compared), or a Tukey’s post-test when all conditions were compared against each other.</p><p id="P50">For statistical analysis of the metabolomics data, the Metaboanalyst software was used. Metaboanalyst applied a data integrity check to each set of data uploaded, excluding metabolite entries that exhibited constant or no value for all the treatment conditions included in the data set. All data were median normalised and log10 transformed. Principal component analysis was used to verify correct clustering of the data based on treatment conditions. Further statistical analysis was carried out on annotated data only. The data were split in 3 files containing paired conditions. A data integrity check was applied to each set of data resulting in exclusion of metabolite entries that exhibited constant or no value for all the treatment conditions included in the data set. Comparisons were carried out using an unpaired t-test and fold change analysis. Differentially abundant metabolites of were identified based on the following thresholds: FDR ≤ 0.1 and fold change value ≥ 1.5.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS206238-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d59aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS206238-supplement-Supplementary_Tables.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d59aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Tony Larson and Adam Dowle at the Metabolomics and Proteomics Lab in the University of York Bioscience Technology Facility for assistance with Trp metabolomics.
