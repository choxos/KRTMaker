Recently, the zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> communities have employed this method in genetic screening pipelines that assess phenotypes in founders (F0), referred to as “crispants”. In contrast, phenotyping crispant mice has been avoided as results are believed to be confounded by genetic mosaicism, requiring that only established mouse lines undergo phenotypic assessment. Here, we targeted seven genes associated with visible recessive phenotypes. We observed the expected null phenotype in up to 100% founders per gene. Crucially, we achieved 100% editing efficiency in all but two animals. Genetic mosaicism was common, but did not confound an animal’s phenotype when comprised of mutations that all disrupted the targeted gene. Mosaicism included short in-frame mutations, but these were sufficient to disrupt function of five genes. Several founders were compound heterozygotes carrying a null and a non-null allele (short in-frame mutation or late truncation), enabling functional assessment of the non-null allele to dissect protein function. Our results set the stage for using crispant founders for initial phenotypic assessment in genetic screening, before selecting candidates for further study. This will dramatically reduce animal numbers.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Phenotypic analysis of single and multi-gene mutants is critical for assessing the function of individual genes, redundancy between related genes, and genetic interactions. While molecular and cellular phenotypes resulting from genetic disruption in monocellular organisms and cultured cells can be informative, whole animals are required to identify affected tissues throughout development and assess more complex phenotypes. Model organisms used by geneticists include <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (fruit fly), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (nematode worm), <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (African clawed frog) and <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (zebrafish), but the mouse is the “workhorse” for understanding mammalian genetics and modeling human disease.</p><p id="P3">Experimental techniques can be divided into two categories: forward genetics (phenotype-driven) and reverse genetics (gene-driven)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In mice, forward genetics began with the collection of animals with visible traits by 19<sup>th</sup> century “mouse fanciers”. These traits occurred naturally in wild populations or arose spontaneously in laboratory colonies. Subsequently, the mutation rate was enhanced by mutagenising the male germline with radiation (primarily X-rays) or chemicals (primarily N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, ENU) or by “gene-trapping” using transposons (Sleeping Beauty or PiggyBac). Of these, the “supermutagen” ENU is most frequently used to screen for phenotypic traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. ENU is a DNA alkylating agent that creates small lesions, mostly single base pair changes, creating hypomorphic/hypermorphic/neomorphic/dominant-negative/null/neutral alleles. Dominant traits (e.g. development of cataracts) can be detected in G1 offspring derived from the mutagenised males. Recessive traits (e.g. embryonic lethality) require further breeding of G2 females with G1 males to achieve homozygosity of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in G3 offspring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. ENU mutagenesis has also been used to screen for dominant suppressors of genetic diseases (thrombocytopenia, Rett syndrome and Factor V Leiden), revealing key disease pathways and druggable targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The greatest challenge in these screens is identifying the causative mutation(s). ENU mutagenesis is random and G1 pups carry ~40-70 intragenic lesions (and many more intergenic ones). The vast majority of these have no/little phenotypic consequence and mutation(s) underlying observed phenotypes must be determined in pedigrees derived from the G1 animals by linkage analysis or by a combination of whole exome sequencing (WES) and genotyping of G3 animals. If G1s cannot be bred due to fertility or health problems, then identification of causative mutations is not possible. Overall, ENU screening involves several challenges and huge numbers of animals (especially for recessive traits), highlighting a clear need for a more efficient and cost-effective method.</p><p id="P4">The sequencing and annotation of model organism genomes has revolutionised genetic studies. Of ~20,000 protein-coding genes in the human genome, 80-90% are conserved in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Reverse genetics approaches predominantly involve knocking out individual genes to produce null alleles. Such studies have been carried out at a small scale by individual laboratories on their genes of interest, and at a large scale by the International Mammalian Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). The IMPC’s aim is to identify the function of every protein-coding gene in the mouse genome by producing a knock-out mouse line for each<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Initially, mouse lines were created by gene targeting in cultured embryonic stem (ES) cells, which were then used to produce chimeras comprising both wild-type and mutant ES cells. If the mutant cells contributed to the germline, mutant mouse lines could be established upon breeding these chimeras. Over the last decade, CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been adopted to improve the efficiency of gene editing in ES cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, and – more importantly – to perform gene targeting directly in zygotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. This has accelerated mouse model production and enabled mutations to be introduced onto different strain backgrounds (circumventing the need for backcrossing). There are several ways to deliver the single guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 nuclease to zygotes, with the best results obtained when recombinant sgRNA and Cas9 protein are combined to form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP), which is introduced into zygotes via electroporation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Null alleles can be produced by excising a critical exon with sgRNAs targeting either side; or by creating insertions/deletions (indels) within a critical exon using one sgRNA and relying on imperfect repair via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). Founders are bred and quality control assays are performed on N1 animals to verify disruption of the targeted gene before mouse lines are established and analysed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">CRISPR/Cas9 technology has also been adopted for forward genetic screening of cellular phenotypes in both cultured cells and <italic>in vivo</italic> in model organisms (including mice) by introducing Cas9 with a genome-wide or bespoke library of sgRNAs at a low multiplicity of infection such that each cell carries one sgRNA and, as a result, its target gene is disrupted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. To assess whole animal phenotypes, recent studies using zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> have performed <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic screens for phenotypes of interest by introducing RNPs into zygotes and phenotyping the resulting F0 founder animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. These founders are named “crispants”, a portmanteau of CRISPR and mutant. Crispants are genetically mosaic, but they display the null phenotype associated with the targeted gene due to high levels of indel formation. The resulting mutations can be identified by sequencing the sgRNA target sites in the founders. As both copies of the targeted gene are disrupted, recessive phenotypes can be assessed.</p><p id="P6">The mouse community remains sceptical about whether phenotypic assessment of F0 crispant mice can produce reliable results, with initial studies reporting phenotypic variability due to genetic mosaicism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Here, we target seven genes associated with recessive visible traits such as coat colour and demonstrate that up to 100% of crispant mice per gene displayed the expected null phenotype despite genetic mosaicism. Our results were due to very high levels of Cas9-mediated double-stranded breaks and the resulting production of loss-of-function mutations. We then asked whether it was possible to target two genes per zygote as this would be desirable when assessing genetic redundancy or genetic interactions. Unfortunately, we found that this decreased the viability to a level that made it not worthwhile. Genes would therefore need to be targeted sequentially in zygotes to introduce secondary mutations. We obtained a relatively high proportion of non-mosaic founders that were compound heterozygous for two null alleles or one null allele and one short in-frame mutation. When compound heterozygous founders carrying a short in-frame mutation displayed the recessive loss-of-function phenotype, this mutation pin-pointed a critical functional protein domain. Overall, our findings demonstrate the validity of phenotypic analysis of crispant mice.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Crispant mice display recessive coat colour phenotypes</title><p id="P7">Phenotypic assessment of mouse crispant founders is generally avoided due to fears that genetic mosaicism would invalidate results. To determine whether phenotypic assessment of founders is biologically informative, we selected genes that when mutated present with recessive visible phenotypes. Mice with altered appearance first became popular among mouse fanciers and there are now over 300 “named” alleles – named after their phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Most of the genes responsible and the causative mutations have now been identified. We chose genes for this study that have a recessive phenotype, no impact on viability or health, and a phenotype visible on a C57BL/6J background. We mimicked previously published null alleles (exon deletion or nonsense mutation) by targeting affected exons with a single sgRNA, introducing insertions/deletions (indels) from the repair of Cas9-induced double stranded breaks via NHEJ/MMEJ. We used strict off-target criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> whereby all sgRNAs had a least three mismatches to unintended targets, at least one of which was in the 11 bp “seed” region adjacent to the PAM, and all sgRNAs had a predicted frameshift frequency &gt;67% (assessed using inDelphi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>). We first selected two coat colour genes, as any phenotypic mosaicism would be clearly visible, allowing us to distinguish between a full, partial or absent knock-out phenotype and link this to the mutations carried by each founder.</p><p id="P8">Mutations in <italic>Tyrp1</italic> (tyrosinase related protein 1) result in brown coat colour on a nonagouti (a/a) background. Although the original “brown” allele, <italic>Tyrp1<sup>b</sup></italic>, is a SNP (c.329G&gt;A) resulting in the p.C110Y missense mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, many other historical “brown” mouse lines contain large deletions at this locus. We therefore decided to knock out <italic>Tyrp1</italic> by targeting a constitutive, translated exon located in the first half of the gene and with a length indivisible by three. The gene is composed of 8 exons, with alternative splicing affecting the length of exons 1 and 8. The open reading frame starts in exon 2 and ends in exon 8. We targeted exon 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), previously deleted by the KOMP project in ES cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> (<italic>Tyrp1<sup>tm1a(EUCOMM)Wts</sup>i</italic>). We electroporated 19 mouse zygotes with RNP and produced four founder animals (21% viability), all of which had a fully brown coat colour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P9">PCR amplification of the targeted locus from tail-tip genomic DNA (gDNA) of three founders (#4083, #4084 and #4085) produced at least one band that differed in size from the wild-type reference, indicating the presence of large indels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-D</xref>). Sanger sequencing of the amplicons produced mixed chromatograms that we deconvoluted using DECODR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and Synthego ICE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> software (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1; Table S2</xref>). DECODR was better at detecting longer deletions, so this software was primarily used throughout this study.</p><p id="P10">Since the trait is recessive, we were surprised that DECODR detected 26.9% wild-type (unedited) sequence in founder #4084, suggesting editing occurred in 3/4 alleles at the 2-cell stage, leaving 1/4 alleles unedited. This would mean that 50% cells carry a functional allele, which is at odds with the absence of black fur in this animal. One possibility was that this founder carried larger “unseen” deletions that abolish one or both primer annealing sites, so the PCR amplicon represented only a subset of the total alleles and therefore overestimated the proportion of unedited sequence. Quantification by qPCR around the genotyping primer annealing sites revealed that this is not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C,E</xref>). Deep amplicon sequencing (DAS) revealed that a similar proportion of reads (20.4%) contained a duplication of an adenine base (c.644dupA; p.H215QfsX48; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). We therefore conclude that DECODR (and ICE) mis-assigned this sequence as unedited when it actually contains an out of frame (+1 bp) insertion, consistent with the fully brown coat phenotype.</p><p id="P11">Surprisingly, founder #4086 appeared to carry a single allele: a short in-frame (12 bp) deletion (c.636_647del), resulting in the loss of four amino acids (p.D212_H215del) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G-H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1; Table S2</xref>). It seemed unlikely that this founder would be homozygous for this allele, as the same repair event would had to have happened in both copies of <italic>Tyrp1</italic>, and this repair product was not predicted by inDelphi. qPCR analysis around the genotyping primer annealing sites found that gDNA abundance was decreased by ~50% over the 5’ primer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that this founder was heterozygous for a “unseen” deletion spanning the 5’ primer annealing site. To identify the “unseen” deletion in founder #4086, we adapted ELF-CLAMP (<underline>E</underline>nrichment of <underline>L</underline>ong DNA <underline>F</underline>ragments using <underline>C</underline>apture and <underline>L</underline>inear <underline>Amp</underline>lification)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> where regions of interest (up to 2 kb) are amplified from viewpoints using <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription followed by Nanopore long read RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). We detected a large deletion-insertion (Δ140insCTT) within exon 3, which would lead to a frameshift mutation: c.794_933delinsCTT; p.I169Lfs*49 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B</xref>). This was confirmed by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. Although a 140 bp deletion at a single cut site is relatively large, there are reports of on-target CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletions in mouse zygotes up to 600 bp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">With the knowledge that both alleles must be disrupted to cause the brown phenotype, both alleles in this compound heterozygous founder (#4086) must be non-functional, indicating that the four amino acid deletion is sufficient to destroy TYRP1 protein function. However, a report that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in cell lines can cause genome damage in cis with small <italic>de novo</italic> mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> raises the alternative possibility that undetected damage nearby may be responsible for disrupting <italic>Typr1</italic>. Using ELF-CLAMP, we sequenced the region flanking this mutation and did not detect any additional mutagenesis, ruling this out (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). The 12 bp (four amino acid) deletion is located in the tyrosinase domain (residues 183-417), and therefore demonstrates the functional importance of this domain <italic>in vivo</italic>. Consistent with this, a chemically induced (ENU) allele with a missense mutation in the tyrosine domain, <italic>Tyrp1<sup>b-Btlr</sup></italic>; c.887A&gt;G; p.Y296C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>), also confers a brown coat colour. Overall, all four founders reliably displayed the null phenotype because we achieved complete editing and all <italic>de novo</italic> mutations carried by these animals were loss-of-function alleles (including short in-frame indels).</p><p id="P13">We next targeted a second coat colour gene, <italic>Slc45a2</italic> (solute carrier family 45, member 2), which when mutated results in a light grey coat on a nonagouti background – named “underwhite”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. The gene is composed of seven constitutive exons and the open reading frame spans them all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The <italic>Slc45a2<sup>uw</sup></italic> allele contains a 7 bp deletion in exon 3, truncating the protein (c.773_779delCGTCGCT; p.S258CfsX44)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. As we were unable to identify an sgRNA in this exon that met our off-target criteria, we instead mimicked <italic>Slc45a2<sup>uw-10Btlr</sup></italic>, which phenocopies <italic>Slc45a2<sup>uw</sup></italic> mice and encodes a nonsense mutation in exon 1 (c.39T&gt;A; p.Y13X). Electroporation of 39 zygotes resulted in 21 founders (53.8% viability; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Only two (9.5%) displayed the full underwhite phenotype, six (28.6%) had a patchy grey and black coat, and the remaining 13 (61.9%) appeared wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This result could not be explained by a lack of mutagenesis as no unedited sequence was detected in any founders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We therefore asked whether we could determine the functional importance of the mutated N-terminal cytoplasmic domain from genotypic analysis. PCR amplification resulted in a single band for three phenotypically wild-type founders (#4062, #4064 and #4079) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Founders #4064 and #4079 were compound heterozygotes carrying two short deletions at a 1:1 ratio, one of which was in-frame: c.35_43delCCTATCAAT; p.T12T,Y13_S15del in #4064 and c.32_37delATACCT; p.H11H,T12_Y13del in #4079 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3; Table S2</xref>). We conclude that short in-frame deletions in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain do not disrupt S45A2 protein function. Founder #4062 was a compound heterozygote carrying a complex deletion-insertion comprising a short deletion and an insertion including 82 bp from intron 1 (c.36_42delCTATCAAins[AA,385+647_385+566]), and a 479 bp deletion that was detected by ELF-CLAMP (c.1-1_385+93del) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3; Table S2</xref>). Since the underwhite phenotype is recessive, only one of these needs to be functional for the mouse to appear wild-type. The deletion-insertion provided an alternative start codon, predicted to enable the translation of a protein containing a short deletion, p.S2_Q14del (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, S3). The finding that short-in frame mutations at the target site do not abolish S45A2 protein function explains the phenotypic variability in these founders.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Crispant knock-out mice display recessive visible phenotypes</title><p id="P15">We selected four more genes linked to recessive visible phenotypes to knock out in crispant founders.

Incomplete editing and the presence of short in-frame variants that retain function are of particular concern. By using recessive visible traits, we could determine whether individual founders displayed the expected phenotype. Incomplete editing was very rare: we achieved 100% editing in all but two animals in this study. Genetic mosaicism was common, but did not impact the phenotype when all alleles present disrupted function, including short in-frame indels.</p><p id="P31">The standard approach for generating null alleles is targeting a critical exon with an sgRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Repair by NHEJ/MMEJ can generate frameshift mutations, which lead to the presence of premature termination codons (PTC) that target transcripts for nonsense mediated decay (NMD). This approach does not consider in-frame indels (which theoretically represent a third of repair products) to be sufficient to disrupt genes. Our results demonstrate that the best strategy to generate a null allele is to ensure that an sgRNA abolishes protein function by considering the protein domain structure and targeting an essential functional domain. We also show that targeting a domain of unknown function can reveal its functional importance in crispants. Short in-frame indels induced by the sgRNAs in this study disrupted protein function in <italic>Tyrp1, Fgf, Tgm3</italic> and <italic>Bmp5</italic>, but not in <italic>Slc45a2</italic> and <italic>Adamts20</italic>.</p><p id="P32">It is recommended to avoid targeting too close to the N-terminus of a gene because transcripts with a PTC &lt;150 nt downstream of the start codon may also escape NMD, due to translation from a downstream in-frame start codon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Our sgRNA targeting <italic>Slc45a2</italic> was within this range and there are three in-frame start codons just downstream.

While the phenotypes assessed here were detectable in individual animals, traits with lower penetrance could be assessed in cohorts of crispants (generated from a single round of mutagenesis). In situations when CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis results in no live pups, it can be hard to determine whether this is due to technical failure or because the targeted gene is essential during embryogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. The presence of developmental phenotypes in crispant embryos would suggest that the targeted gene is essential. Therefore, mouse lines could be generated by producing founders with incomplete editing (by reducing targeting efficiency or injecting CRISPR/Cas9 reagents into one blastomere in 2-cell embryos), which could be bred to generate heterozygotes. Similarly, when knocking out both copies of a gene causes infertility in both sexes, defects in gametogenesis could be detected in crispants, and mouse lines could instead be established using this strategy. Crispants can also be used for initial phenotypic assessment when investigating genetic interactions. IMPC mouse lines are generated on C57BL/6N and crispants could be produced on other strain backgrounds to assess for phenotypic modifiability. It is often desired to study the interaction between two genes. Unfortunately, we show that targeting both genes simultaneously dramatically reduces viability. Instead, we propose to establish/obtain a mouse line with a mutation in the first gene and use this line as donors to mutate the second gene in crispants. This strategy can be applied to screen for genetic suppressors of disease – which can reveal potential therapeutic targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P35">Making genotype-phenotype associations with non-null alleles helps to dissect protein function. We produced compound heterozygous crispants carrying an in-frame mutation and a null allele in five of the six genes that we targeted for disruption. For recessive traits, the presence or absence of the null phenotype in these founders revealed whether in-frame indels were sufficient to abolish protein function. C-terminal deletions can be used to assess the importance of the domain(s) downstream of a truncating mutation. As demonstrated here for <italic>Adamts20</italic>, truncating and in-frame variants can be generated using the same sgRNA. Compound heterozygous crispants could be bred to establish mouse lines with the alleles of interest for phenotypic confirmation and mechanistic studies. Mosaic animals carrying potentially informative variants could be also bred to segregate alleles for phenotypic analysis.
