To elucidate the relationship between the aberrant folding and aggregation of Aβ and mutant Tau and neuronal function, we monitored neuronal activity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> AD models across age. Our findings reveal that expression of both Aβ and Tau lead to significant reductions in neuronal activity and function in young adult animals preceding the accumulation of amyloid aggregates. Notably, Aβ expression and aggregation in muscle tissue produced comparable detrimental effects on neuronal activity as its expression in neurons, suggesting that proteotoxic stress in muscle can influence neuronal function. This may occur through the propagation of Aβ from muscle to neurons or through retrograde signaling pathways.

The neuropathological hallmarks of AD are the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary Tau tangles. However, in the early presymptomatic stages of the disease, neuronal hyperactivity of cortical and hippocampal brain areas was observed in sporadic and familial forms of AD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Several factors could lead to the hyperexcitability of selected neurons and neuronal circuits in AD including perturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, NMDA receptor activation, Aβ and Tau themselves as well as genetic risk factors such as apolipoprotein E (APOE) and presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1 and PSEN2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Thus far, it is not understood how hyperexcitability eventually leads to reduced neuronal activity. As neuronal activity promotes the production and secretion of Aβ by e.g. activating endocytosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, the hyperexcitability in the early stages of AD could be a pathogenic driver of the disease. However, in contrast to murine Aβ models, Tau<sup>P301L</sup> expressing mice did not show a hyperexcitability and were marked by a loss of excitatory neuron function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Additionally, transgenic mouse models that express mutant Tau<sup>P301S</sup> showed impaired synaptic function in the hippocampus and mutant Tau<sup>P301S,G272V</sup> mice displayed axonopathy without overt neuronal loss before fibrillary Tau tangles were formed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, despite an increasing number of studies on AD pathology in diverse model systems, it is poorly understood how the expression and aberrant folding and amyloid fibrils formation of Aβ and mutant Tau lead to neurodegeneration.</p><p id="P3">In this study, we aimed to elucidate how the expression and aggregation of human Aβ and Tau in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are linked to neuronal activity as aging and pathology progress. For that, we used <italic>C. elegans</italic> Aβ and Tau models, analyzed neuronal activity, function, and organismal physiology over the course of Aβ and Tau aggregation. Neuronal activity was measured using a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, GCaMP6m. To facilitate a rapid and reliable assessment of neuronal activity of our AD <italic>C. elegans</italic> models, we established a microfluidic device that permits the trapping and immobilization of living nematodes in a non-invasive manner.</p><p id="P4">We have further established a new sub-stoichiometrically fluorescently tagged neuronal Tau pathology model in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that carries two patient derived point mutations, P301L and V337M <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The pan-neuronal expression of Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> led to age-dependent aggregation, cell-cell propagation, and severe proteotoxicity on cellular and organismal level. Using our previously established Aβ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and the novel Tau model, we found that both AD-associated amyloid proteins lead to a significant decrease of neuronal activity and function already in young adults before an accumulation of amyloid aggregates. Importantly, neuronal activity is equally impaired when the amyloid protein is expressed in a peripheral tissue, suggesting a retrograde signaling of the proteotoxic challenge to the neurons.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Microfluidic devices permit the study of neuronal activity in living animals by quantifying GCaMP6m fluorescence intensity levels</title><p id="P5">In this study, we aimed to assess neuronal activity in Alzheimer’s disease models that express the Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> peptide as well as wild-type Tau (Tau<sup>WT</sup>) and mutant Tau (Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup>) to correlate the aggregation propensity and proteotoxicity of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> and Tau with their effect on neuronal activity and function.</p><p id="P6">Neuronal activity can be analyzed using calcium-dependent fluorescence measurements by applying genetically encoded calcium indicators such as GCaMP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. As neuronal action potentials lead to an influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions through voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, this results in a rapid increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations that are sensed by the GCaMP sensor and used as a proxy for neuronal activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. We have generated a <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuronal GCaMP strain that expresses GCaMP6m panneuronally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). These imaging analyses are challenging in living animals that can move out of the imaging area or out of focus. Applying anesthetics on the other hand will affect their neuronal activity. To restrict the movement of the animals while recording the neuronal GCaMP fluorescence of the whole animal, we established a microfluidic device that traps the nematodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). This allows a noninvasive quantification of GCaMP fluorescence in living animals.</p><p id="P7">The workflow of the analysis using the microfluidic channels is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1C</xref> and starts with the synchronization of the nematodes. In this study, we analyzed young adult (4 days after hatching) animals as well as day 7, and day 10 old nematodes to reflect the progression of aging. Notably, animals expressing disease-associated aggregation-prone proteins display a reduced lifespan (median of 9 days for Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> animals) and the time points of our analysis were chosen to account for the shortened lifespan of the disease models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. For the GCaMP recordings, the nematodes were trapped into the microfluidic channels and their fluorescence intensity was recorded. The nematodes in the channels remain alive and are not harmed during this procedure. The animals can move with their head and tail and still lay eggs, suggesting that the physiological behavior is not impeded. Further, the experiment, starting from the loading of multiple nematodes into the microchannels to imaging the last one at the microscope, takes less than 30 minutes.</p><p id="P8">To determine the level of calcium-based neuronal signaling in the nematodes, we quantified the fluorescence intensity as well as the protein levels that report on the abundance of the expressed GCaMP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1C-E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>) and then normalized the fluorescence intensity to the GCaMP protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). This normalization was used for all subsequent analyses in this study to account for variations in GCaMP expression levels at different ages of the animals and different strains. To further verify our observations above, we also performed this analysis in <italic>unc-13</italic> mutant animals that are impaired in synaptic vesicle fusion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and as expected, they showed a significant decrease in the GCaMP intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). As additional control, we applied the calcium channel inhibitor Nemadipine A to GCaMP-expressing control nematodes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Nemadipine A treated animals exhibited a significant decrease of the GCaMP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). We conclude that our experimental setup can be used to report on the average neuronal activity of living <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Neuronal function declines prior to the onset of significant Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> aggregation</title><p id="P9">Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-expressing animals show an age-dependent increase in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> aggregation, propagation and severe proteotoxicity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. To correlate the expression and aggregation of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> with its effect on neuronal function, we crossed the strain with the panneuronal GCaMP (nGCaMP6m) reporter with the strain expressing neuronal Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (nAβ) or control animals that only express the fluorescent protein mScarlet in the neurons (termed nmScarlet) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We then measured the neuronal activity at two time points, <italic>i.e</italic>., on day 4 of life (young adults) with the start of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> aggregation and on day 7 of life (older adults) when the animals show severe Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> aggregation as demonstrated previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A and Fig. S5A,C+D</xref>). Notably, compared to the control, we observed a severe reduction in neuronal activity already in day 4 old Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> animals. Day 7 old Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> animals showed, as expected, a reduction in neuronal activity. At this age, Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> aggregation affects all neurons, resulting in severe proteotoxicity as shown previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, the neuronal activity on day 4 was lower compared to that of day 7 for Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). This may seem contradictory at first glance, but could be explained with a survivorship bias as the median lifespan of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> animals is 9 days <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, animals that are more severely affected by the aggregation and proteotoxicity of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> may have already died before reaching day 7.</p><p id="P10">Next, we asked the question how Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> expressed in a distal tissue affects neuronal activity. To address this, we made use of a muscle Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> strain that expresses the Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> peptide in body wall muscles (mAβ) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and crossed this strain as well as muscle mScarlet control nematodes (termed mmScarlet) with animals expressing neuronal GCaMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed a similar reduction in neuronal activity when Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> is expressed in muscle tissue, which also already occured in young adult animals (day 4). Upon closer inspection, we noticed that the detrimental effect of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> on neuronal activity is on day 7 more pronounced when Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> is expressed in muscle compared to a neuronal expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2D-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B and Fig. S5B-D</xref>). This could be a direct effect of propagated Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> from muscle to neurons and / or transduced by a signaling cascade as aging progresses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. We conclude from this data set that the neuronal activity decreases early in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-expressing animals and occurs before a significant accumulation of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> aggregates. In addition, the neuronal activity seems equally affected by distally expressed Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Generation of neuronal <italic>C. elegans</italic> Tau models based on the human Tau-0N4R isoform</title><p id="P11">The obtained data with the Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> model posed the question whether the early decline of neuronal activity in AD animals is specific for Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> or a general phenomenon in response to aggregating disease-associated amyloid proteins. We set out to perform the same analysis with the second amyloid protein that is associated with AD, Tau. Tau is a microtubule-binding, intracellular protein that can become hyperphosphorylated and can form neurofibrillary tangles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Several point mutations have been identified in familial cases of AD that render Tau aggregation prone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. We generated strains that express the human 0N4R variant Tau in a non-modified form that is referred to as wild-type Tau (Tau<sup>WT</sup>) and a mutant Tau form harboring two patient-derived mutations, P301L and V337M (Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup>) in the neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Analogously to the Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> model, Tau is expressed in an untagged and sub-stoichiometrically mScarlet-tagged manner using an IRES element for its synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3B+D</xref> + <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. The substoichiometric tagging with mScarlet limits a perturbation of the amyloid fibril formation by the fluorescent protein yet enables a visualization and assessment of Tau aggregation by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) in a non-invasive manner. Surprisingly, neuronal Tau expression increased with the progression of aging from day 4 (young adult animals) up to day 10 (past their fertile period) for both Tau<sup>WT</sup> and Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3C+E</xref> + <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S7A</xref>) and differed in that regard from nAβ animals that showed decreased Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> expression with aging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S7B+C</xref>). The increased abundance of Tau with aging is likely due to an increased stability of the protein as the transcription increased only for Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> between days 4 and 7 and did not further increase to day 10 and was not changed at all for Tau<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Mutant Tau shows age-dependent aggregation and propagation</title><p id="P12">Next, we analyzed the aggregation of Tau using FLIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). FLIM is an advanced microscopy technique capable of providing a deeper understanding of the molecular environment of a fluorophore. Amyloid formation leads to the quenching of the mScarlet fluorophores that are fused to Tau, which reduces the fluorophore’s fluorescence lifetime (τ) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Thus, the fluorescence lifetime can be used as readout for the aggregation of Tau <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The control (nmScarlet) and Tau<sup>WT</sup> were soluble whereas Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> aggregated already in young adult animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4B+C</xref>). The aggregation of Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> is also depicted by the color change in the false-colored images where blue areas indicate regions of low lifetime (= aggregates) and reflected by the overall decreased τ values of the head neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). We observed further that the aggregation of mutant Tau (Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup>) increased with age while the control and Tau<sup>WT</sup> remained soluble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). These results highlight that the increased abundance that was observed for both Tau<sup>WT</sup> and Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> with aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3C+E</xref>) is not necessarily leading to a higher aggregation propensity and that instead the P301L and V337M mutations cause Tau aggregation.</p><p id="P13">A hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases is the spreading of the disease-associated amyloid proteins. We hence analyzed spreading of Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> to other tissues. To quantify this, we measured the Tau levels in the coelomocytes, scavenger cells that take up extracellular material from the body cavity. Of note, only proteins that are released from the neurons as part of the spreading and propagation of Tau can enter the extracellular space and get endocytosed by coelomocytes where the proteins can be subjected to lysosomal degradation. We crossed the Tau strains with a strain that expresses GFP in the coelomocytes that serves as a marker to easily identify them and then quantify Tau levels in the coelomocytes. On day 4 and day 7, we detected a 2.8-fold (day 4) or even 3.5-fold (day 7) increase of mutant Tau compared to Tau<sup>WT</sup> in the coelomocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4D-F</xref>). When we normalized the abundance in the coelomocytes to the Tau expression levels, it became clear that the spreading of Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> was still significantly higher than that of Tau<sup>WT</sup> yet only in older animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D+E</xref> right plot), when we also observed strong aggregation of Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> by FLIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4A-C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Aggregation of Tau is associated with severe organismal defects</title><p id="P14">Next, we performed a phenotypic analysis of the new Tau strains to comprehensively characterize them and to assess the proteotoxicity of Tau. Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> expression led to a significantly reduced lifespan with a median lifespan of 14.2 days in comparison to the median lifespan of nmScarlet control of 16.5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>). Further, we assessed several physiological parameters that report on the fitness of animals. We observed a severe 48% reduction in the number of progenies, from a mean number of 267 offspring for nmScarlet control animals to 139 for the Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Additionally, the development of the mutant Tau animals was severely delayed. This was already apparent on day 3 of life and even more on day 4 of life, when about 48 % of all mutant Tau animals were still in a larval stage while the control animals all reached adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Alongside this, a chemotaxis assay revealed that mutant Tau animals were impaired to respond to the volatile attractant 2% Benzaldehyde with a mean chemotaxis index of 0.76 as compared to N2 wild-type and Tau<sup>WT</sup> animals showing a mean chemotaxis index of 0.89 and 0.9 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Finally, motility, as assessed by thrashing frequency in liquid media, was reduced in older mutant Tau animals with a mean thrashing frequency of 1.5 Hz compared to nmScarlet control animals with a thrashing frequency of 2 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Notably, we also observed toxicity for the expression of Tau<sup>WT</sup>, which was unexpected as Tau<sup>WT</sup> does not aggregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4A+B</xref>). We noticed that Tau<sup>WT</sup> elicited its detrimental effect only in assays that report on longer periods of the nematodes’ life e.g. lifespan (up to day 25) and fecundity assay (up to day 8), whereas we did not observe defects in development on days 3 and 4 of life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), chemotaxis on day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>) and motility on day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Defects in motility could only be detected on day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Thus, the expression of Tau<sup>WT</sup> exerted a negative and aggregation-independent effect on the physiology of adult nematodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4A-C</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We set out to further study the neuronal ectopic expression of human Tau<sup>WT</sup> in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The endogenous <italic>C. elegans</italic> Tau ortholog, PTL-1, is expressed in several neurons, most strongly in ALM, AVM, and PLM touch neurons, and is required for neuronal integrity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. PTL-1A and PTL-1B are two isoforms and show less than 50% sequence identity with human Tau (44% for PTL-1A and 47% for PTL-1B) that is however restricted to the microtubule binding domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8B</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Mutation of <italic>ptl-1</italic> leads to neuronal morphological defects and a shortened lifespan <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. We could reproduce these data and observed a reduction in the lifespan of <italic>ptl-1</italic> mutant (<italic>ok621</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8A</xref>). It has previously been shown that the shortened lifespan of <italic>ptl-1</italic> mutant animals can be rescued by ectopic expression of <italic>ptl-1</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. However, when we crossed the <italic>ptl-1</italic> mutant with our newly generated neuronal human Tau<sup>WT</sup> strain, we observed an even further reduction in lifespan from a median lifespan of 14.45 days (<italic>ptl-1</italic> deletion mutant) and 14.33 (pan-neuronal overexpression human Tau<sup>WT</sup>) to 11.23 days for the cross of <italic>ptl-1</italic> mutant and neuronal human Tau<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8A</xref>). These data show that human Tau differs from its <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog and cannot substitute for it. Thus, the cross of <italic>ptl-1</italic> mutant and human Tau<sup>WT</sup> is deficient for the endogenous Tau protein and expresses a protein that is dominantly negative on the physiology of the nematode. Importantly, Tau<sup>WT</sup> does not exert its toxicity by aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A+B</xref>). We thus argue that Tau<sup>WT</sup> is not a suitable control for the aggregation-associated toxicity of Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> and instead the mScarlet-expressing strain should be used as control for the toxic gain-of-function of amyloid fibril forming Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup>.</p><p id="P16">Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> on the other hand showed in all behavioral assays a proteotoxic effect.

We observed a severe reduction of the relative GCaMP intensity in Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> already in young adult animals (day 4 of life) that persisted throughout aging (days 7 and 10 of life; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6B-D</xref>). We conclude, the expression of the highly aggregation-prone Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> results in a severe reduction of neuronal activity already starting in young adult animals similarly to Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> expression. Importantly, the severe defects in neuronal activity occur early (young adult, day 4 old animals) and precede the continued buildup of Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> aggregates with aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4A-C</xref>). Notably, we also observed reduced GCaMP intensities upon expression of Tau<sup>WT</sup> in young adult animals (day 4) that however increased with aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6B-D</xref>), further supporting that ectopic expression of Tau<sup>WT</sup> expression alters the physiology of the animal. It could be that calcium signaling and or storage are perturbed in older Tau<sup>WT</sup>-expressing animals. We then asked the question whether the loss of neuronal activity is associated with neurodegeneration. To monitor neuronal integrity, we crossed animals expressing Tau<sup>WT</sup> and Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> with a strain expressing GFP in the mechanosensory neurons (<italic>mec-4::gfp</italic>) to visualize neuronal morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>).

Here, we used a sub-stoichiometric labelling approach that we previously used for Aβ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> to obtain transgenic Tau lines that express an excess of untagged Tau to preserve the properties of the protein and a sub-stoichiometrically mScarlet-tagged Tau to monitor the aggregation by FLIM in living animals. We observed an increased aggregation of Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> with aging and did not detect a specific onset of aggregation as previously detected for Aβ whose aggregation starts in the cholinergic IL2 neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">The expression and aggregation of Tau<sup>P301L,V337M</sup> elicited multiple disease-associated phenotypes such as reduced lifespan, delayed development as well as impaired fecundity, motility and neuronal activity.

The loss of neuronal activity, as assessed by GCaMP recording, manifests also in an impaired neuronal function as reflected in chemotactic defects. Although the aggregation of Aβ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and mutant Tau further increases as the animals age, the neuronal activity is already at its minimum for young adult animals of these AD strains. We thus speculate that an early loss of neuronal function is a common hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p id="P22">In contrast to studies conducted in murine APP/Aβ models, we did not detect an early hyperactivity preceding the degeneration of neurons. It is possible that other factors such as the processing of the amyloid precursor protein and genetic risk factors that are absent in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are required for the hyperexcitability in selected brain regions. We have, however, analyzed systemic neuronal activity in the nematode. Thus, the activity of selected neurons or neuronal circuits might differ. To address this caveat, the GCaMP sensor could be expressed in neuronal subpopulations.</p><p id="P23">Surprisingly, we observed that the expression and aggregation of Aβ in muscle tissue had a similar detrimental effect on neuronal activity as its expression in neurons. This poses the question how the proteotoxic stress in muscle tissue affects neuronal activity. Aβ can propagate from cell to cell and hence Aβ expression and aggregation in muscles can lead to spreading of Aβ into neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Alternatively, signaling pathways could relay the proteotoxicity of the muscle tissue to the neurons. Trans-cellular signaling of proteotoxicity and capacity of molecular chaperones has been observed before but mainly for signaling from neurons to peripheral tissue <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Much less is known about a retrograde signaling from peripheral tissues to the nervous system. Such a signaling circuit from muscle to neurons has been observed in Drosophila. E.g., muscle FOXO/4E-BP signaling leads to a decreased feeding behavior, resulting in reduced insulin release that in turn promotes FOXO/4E-BP activity in other tissues to mitigate systemic aging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. It is possible that the reduced neuronal activity in response to Aβ aggregation in muscle tissue could be communicated by a signaling pathway that may also involve neuromuscular junctions that provide a direct contact between muscle cells and neurons.</p><p id="P24">In this study, we have furthermore advanced the methodological portfolio to assess neuronal activity in living nematodes in a non-invasive manner using a microfluidic device.

Additionally, to prevent the nematodes from getting flushed through the device during loading, each microfluidic channel was interrupted by a constriction, where its width was reduced to 12 or 20 μm, respectively. Further dimensions of the design can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>, while the corresponding lithography mask was designed in CleWin 4.0 Layout Editor (WieWeb Software) and printed on film (JD Photo Data). It is worth noting that, while tested, no pillars have been introduced near the entrance of the final design as we have not been able to confirm their previously described advantages on <italic>C. elegans</italic> orientation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P44">The microfluidic mold was fabricated using single-layer photolithography as described previously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. First, a single-side polished silicon wafer was cleaned using acetone, isopropanol, and de-ionized water, before being pre-baked at 200 °C for 10 min. Once cooled to room temperature, SU-8 50 negative photoresist (Kayaku Advanced Materials) was manually dispensed onto the wafer for spin coating. The photoresist was first distributed at 500 rpm for 15 s with an acceleration of 200 rpm/s before reduced to the final thickness using 1800 rpm for 30 s with an acceleration of 300 rpm/s. The wafer was then transferred to a hotplate for soft baking at 65 °C for 7 min before the temperature was ramped to 95 °C for a further 22 min. Finally, the wafer was cooled down to 75 °C on the hotplate before being removed and left to cool to room temperature for further processing. To transfer the design, the photoresist was exposed to 365 nm UV under contact mode for 40 s using an EVG620 NT mask aligner until a total exposure dose of 400 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> was reached. The resist was post-exposure baked at 65 °C for 1 min before being moved to another hotplate for 6 min at 95 °C and cooled down to room temperature. The design was developed in a bath with SU-8 Developer (Kayaku Advanced Materials) for 5 min using manual agitation before development was stopped by rinsing the wafer with isopropanol followed by de-ionized water and dried using a nitrogen gun. To reduce stress inside the material, the resist was hard baked at 150 °C for 10 minutes before being cooled down to room temperature. Finally, the wafer was coated with (Tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl)trichlorosilane (CAS 51851-37-7, abcr) under vacuum for 1 h to increase reusability.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>PDMS microchannel fabrication for <italic>C. elegans</italic> imaging</title><p id="P45">Preparation of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was carried out by combining Sylgard 184 curing agent and Sylgard 184 base elastomer (Dow) in a ratio of 1:10 (w/w) followed by vigorous mixing for 5 min. The mixture was poured over the SU-8 mold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>) and the PDMS was degassed in a desiccator for approx. 30 min until no air bubbles were visible. The PDMS was solidified in an oven at 50 °C overnight, before being cut and carefully peeled off the wafer. The wafer sized PDMS was then separated into single devices using a razor blade. In- and outlets of 1.5 mm were applied using a biopsy punch (Ted Pella). Dust was removed from individual devices using Scotch tap before they were cleaned using soap water (Decon 90, Decon Laboratories), 70% ethanol, and ultrapure water. To remove any residual water or ethanol, PDMS devices were dried using compressed air and incubated on a hot plate at 120 °C for 5 min. Bonding of PDMS devices to glass coverslips (No. 1.5) was performed using a plasma asher (Zepto, Diener Electronic). For that, the surfaces of the glass and the PDMS were exposed to the air plasma for 30 s before being brought into contact immediately under gentle pressure. The bond was then stabilized by baking the devices at 80 °C for 5 min on a hotplate.</p><p id="P46">To load the nematodes into the PDMS channels a 1 ml low-binding pipette tip was placed at the inlet and a syringe with a flexible tubing was added at the outlet. The syringe was filled with M9 media, and the channels flushed from the outlet until the pipette at the inlet was filled half. Nematodes were picked from plates into the M9 reservoir within the pipette tip and worms were allowed to sink by gravity. By pulling slightly on the syringe, the nematodes entered the device and were separated into the microchannels where they were trapped along the sides of their bodies.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Imaging of GCaMP6m intensity and normalization of intensities to protein levels</title><p id="P47">GCaMP6m intensities of nematodes were recorded on day 4, 7, and 10 of life, with day 1 being the day of synchronization. Nematodes were synchronized and grown until the desired age and loaded onto the fabricated PDMS microfluidic devices as described above in groups of up to six animals. For day 4-old nematodes, channels with a width of 40 um were used while older animals (day 7 and 10) were imaged in 60 um wide channels. Images of individual nematodes were taken using a custom-built widefield microscope (IX83, Olympus) with an sCMOS camera (Zyla 5.5, Andor) and a 10x objective (Plan N 10x / 0.25, Olympus). GCaMP6m was excited at 470 nm from a four-wavelength high-power light emitting diode light source (LED4D067, Thorlabs). To record GCaMP6m of individual nematodes, 2 sets of images series comprised of 10 images each were taken with an exposure time of 170 ms using the software Micro-Manager <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Additionally, a brightfield image series of each nematode was taken as a reference with an exposure time of 10 ms. Fluorescence intensities of single nematodes were quantified using Fiji by selecting the most focused and stable image out of the two fluorescence image series. Normalization of the acquired GCaMP6m intensities to the GCaMP6m protein levels was performed to account for varying GCaMP6m expressions between different strains. Based on the GAPDH-normalized GCAMP6m protein levels, a normalization factor was calculated by dividing the mean expression level of control nematodes (i.e., neuronal or muscular expressing mScarlet strains) by the value for Ab/Tau-expressing nematodes for day 4, 7, and 10, respectively. Subsequently, the GCaMP6m intensity values were multiplied by the normalization factor, resulting in GCaMP6m intensities normalized to protein levels.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Nemadipine A treatment</title><p id="P48">The L-type calcium channel inhibitor nemadipine A was dissolved in DMSO. Nemadipine A or DMSO as a solvent control was added to the liquid NGM agar at a final concentration of 2 µM before pouring. Nematodes were synchronized by egg-laying on agar plates containing nemadipine A or DMSO and grown to the desired age in the presence of nemadipine A or DMSO. nGCAMP6m intensities of nemadipine A- and DMSO-treated animals were recorded using an LSM-880 (Zeiss) confocal laser scanning microscope.

GFP was excited at 488 nm using an Argon laser, while mScarlet was excited at 543 nm using the HeNe laser. Transmitted-light images of the nematodes (T-PMT Transmission) were overlayed with the fluorescence image.

Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) was performed using a confocal laser scanning microscope LSM-880 (Zeiss) with a pulsed laser (PicoQuant). The fluorescence lifetime was measured by time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC). mScarlet was excited with a 560 nm pulsed laser at 40 MHz with 60% laser intensity.

Representative confocal fluorescent images of a young adult animal (4 days old) of the novel pan-neuronal GCaMP6m strain (nGCaMP6m). The image on the right is 100-fold magnified (scale bar is 200 μm). Inset shows respective close-up of the head region depicted on the left.

Schematic representation of the design of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device used for the imaging of living <italic>C. elegans</italic> (top image). Animals enter the device at the inlet by gravity and are sucked into the channels by applying gentle negative pressure. The constriction prevents animals from escaping at the opposing side. Inside the channels the animals are mechanically trapped along their body and <italic>C. elegans</italic> are straightened. The device allows imaging of multiple animals simultaneously. The image depicted at the bottom is 100-fold magnified with a scale bar of 200 µm.</p><p>C. Workflow for the quantification of GCaMP6m fluorescence intensity in living <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a readout for the assessment of neuronal activity. Generation of age-synchronized cohorts of young adults (day 4 of life) and older animals (day 7 and 10 of life) (1). Imaging experiments are performed using PDMS microfluidic devices to record GCaMP6m fluorescence intensities from alive animals. In the subsequent analysis step GCaMP6m fluorescence intensities are quantified from single snapshot images. Age-synchronized nematodes are lysed to obtain the crude protein fraction (2). Lysates are analyzed by Western blots. GCaMP6m protein levels are quantified relative to GAPDH and are used to normalize GCaMP6m fluorescence intensities.</p><p>D.
