While disease-specific folds of insoluble tau filaments have been established, it remains unclear whether the smaller, earlier species also differ across tauopathies. Here, we characterise these small tau aggregates from post-mortem brain of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration, Pick’s disease, and healthy controls. Using two complementary single-molecule assays, we confirm that small tau aggregates vary in abundance, morphology, and post-translational modifications. AD features specific long, fibrillar-shaped aggregates enriched in phospho-epitopes, while PSP aggregates are shorter, round, and selectively phosphorylated at serine-356, a site we identify as correlating with markers of inflammation and apoptosis. Aggregate properties co-vary with cellular stress signatures and align with disease-specific seeding profiles, suggesting distinct pathological mechanisms. These findings suggest that small tau aggregates are not a shared intermediate, but instead encode disease-specific mechanisms, with potential as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterised by the pathological aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. These include Alzheimer’s disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and Pick’s disease (PiD). Under physiological conditions, tau dynamically associates with microtubules, modulates their stability, and supports axonal transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In disease, tau becomes aberrantly phosphorylated and aggregates, losing its normal function and gaining toxic properties that contribute to neuronal dysfunction and death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Despite pathological tau aggregation being a shared hallmark of tauopathies, the diseases are pathologically distinct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. AD, the most prevalent tauopathy, features a mixture of 3-repeat (3R) and 4-repeat (4R) tau pathology and is considered a secondary tauopathy as tau aggregation is facilitated or accelerated by prior beta-amyloid (Aβ) pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Clinically, AD is primarily characterised by cognitive decline, with early impairment in declarative and working memory. In contrast, PSP and CBD are primary tauopathies that are typically associated with shorter disease duration compared to AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Both give rise to mixed movement disorders, with a variable degree of cognitive impairment that may precede or follow motor deficits. PSP and CBD are characterised by prominent glial tau pathology in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, in addition to neuronal tau inclusions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. PSP has tufted astrocytes, while CBD has astrocytic plaques. In contrast, PiD, a rare form of frontotemporal dementia, is defined by 3R tau pathology and the presence of intraneuronal Pick bodies. Tau inclusions have also been reported in astrocytes in PiD, though these are less prominent than in PSP and CBD and their role remains poorly understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. While reactive astrocytosis is observed in PiD, it may be a response to neuronal loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, in contrast to PSP and CBD. PiD often manifests in midlife and progresses rapidly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In addition to differences in tau isoform composition and astroglial involvement, emerging evidence suggests that disease-specific patterns of neuroinflammation may also contribute to divergent pathogenic trajectories across tauopathies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The factors underlying these disease-specific differences remain unclear but may involve differences in tau isoform expression, post-translational modifications (PTMs), local cellular environments, or co-pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have revealed that each tauopathy is characterised by distinct tau filament structures, with highly conserved disease-specific folds of the insoluble aggregates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Schematic 1A</xref>), suggesting that conformational differences underlie their divergent clinical and pathological phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. While these larger, insoluble inclusions have historically been the focus of tauopathy research, growing evidence suggests that small, diffusible tau aggregates are the more toxic forms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> that play a central role in disease development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. For example, these small aggregates can impair synaptic function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, disrupt protein homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and trigger neuroinflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. In several recent models, diffusible aggregates correlate more strongly with neurodegeneration than insoluble tau tangles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>; in contrast, the insoluble species may potentially serve as protective ‘sinks’ that sequester the freely diffusing oligomers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, though they may also contribute to cytotoxicity. However, the low abundance, structural heterogeneity, and lack of specific molecular markers of these oligomers have made them exceptionally difficult to study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. As a result, it remains unclear whether these small aggregates exhibit disease-specific differences, or whether they represent a common cytotoxic intermediate across tauopathies. In this study, we refer to these smaller“soluble” tau aggregate species as “small tau aggregates” to distinguish them from insoluble fibrils. They are retained in the low-detergent fraction at medium speed centrifugation, exhibit multivalency, and are variously described in the literature as “soluble,” “diffusible,” or “oligomeric” tau. The significance of the variation in size, within and between tauopathies, is uncertain.</p><p id="P5">To address this gap, we systematically characterised the small tau aggregates formed during the earlier stages of aggregation extracted from post-mortem brain of individuals with AD, PSP, CBD, PiD, and age-matched controls without any disease pathology, all sampled from the same brain region (frontal cortex). We applied two complementary single-molecule methods: MAPTau, a tau aggregate pull-down assay coupled with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, and tau aggregate-specific single-molecule array (Simoa)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, an ultrasensitive bead-based immunoassay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Schematic 1B</xref>). Together, these techniques allow us to quantify and characterise tau aggregates with high sensitivity and molecular specificity, without the need for conformation-specific antibodies. This enables not only detection of aggregate levels, but also detailed profiling of their size, morphology and post-translational modifications. In parallel, we assessed the seeding activity of sarkosyl-insoluble tau aggregates using isoform-specific biosensor assays, to explore potential functional consequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Schematic 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Our goal was to determine whether the small diffusible tau aggregates show disease-specific features, and whether their molecular characteristics could shed light on the distinct pathological mechanisms of different tauopathies.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Quantitative profiling of tau species reveals disease-specific aggregation patterns</title><p id="P7">We began by broadly characterising tau species and their distribution across tauopathies using post-mortem brain homogenate from individuals with pathologically confirmed and clinically concordant AD (AD dementia), PSP (PSP Richardson’s syndrome or PSP-Parkinsonism), CBD (corticobasal syndrome), PiD (frontotemporal dementia), and age-matched neurologically healthy controls (HC) with mild age-related pathology. We measured the amounts of tau and tau aggregates in the brain homogenate fraction, and sarkosyl insoluble tau, as well as their relative distributions across both fractions. All samples were derived from the same brain region (frontal cortex) to enable direct comparison. Summarised patient details are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> (full details in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The small (soluble) tau fraction was obtained from a high-salt, low-detergent homogenisation buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.8 M NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% Sarkosyl, 10% sucrose, 21,000 × g), which retains small, diffusible tau species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Within this fraction (“homogenate”), we first measured total tau (monomeric and aggregated tau) using a commercial sandwich ELISA targeting pan tau. While CBD, PiD, AD, and HC showed similar levels of tau, PSP exhibited significantly lower levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To quantify the small tau aggregates within the brain homogenate fraction, we applied a previously developed Simoa assay using an HT7 antibody sandwich configuration, which selectively detects aggregated tau<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> and not monomers. Small tau aggregate levels were significantly elevated in AD brain homogenate compared to all other disease groups and HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). When normalised to total tau levels in the homogenate, the proportion of tau present as aggregates was the highest in AD, but notably also elevated in PSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, CBD and HC showed similarly low aggregate-to-total tau ratios.</p><p id="P10">To further assess the distribution of tau into monomeric, small aggregates and insoluble species, we performed a separate sarkosyl extraction to isolate the detergent-insoluble tau fraction. We quantified insoluble tau aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) and determined the absolute total amount of tau aggregates (soluble tau and sarkosyl insoluble tau, in ng, extracted from 120 mg of post-mortem brain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). We also compared the relative contribution of monomeric and aggregated tau in the brain homogenate, and sarkosyl insoluble tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). Due to epitope availability particularly in the insoluble fraction their amount is likely underestimated. AD showed the highest levels of sarkosyl-insoluble tau, with lower levels in CBD, PiD and PSP, while HC had minimal levels. When comparing the relative contribution of each tau species to the total tau pool, striking differences emerged. In AD, a substantial portion of total tau (7 ± 6%) was present as insoluble aggregates, whereas in CBD only a small fraction was insoluble (0.4 ± 0.4%), despite high overall tau levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). This suggests that CBD maintains a large pool of tau with limited conversion into aggregated forms, while PSP, with low total tau levels, shows a relatively high proportion of aggregation in the brain homogenate fraction.</p><p id="P11">As the tauopathies included in this study are characterised by distinct tau isoform distributions (PiD is classified as a 3R tauopathy, PSP and CBD as 4R tauopathies, and AD as a mixed 3R/4R tauopathy) we next assessed isoform composition within the tau pool in the brain homogenate. We quantified 4R tau levels using a commercial ELISA, and developed an additional Simoa assay that specifically detects 4R-positive aggregates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1B, C</xref>), which we normalised to total tau and total tau aggregate levels in the brain homogenate, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1D</xref>). These ratios are approximate since some 4R aggregates also contain 3R tau. The resulting 3R/4R patterns in both total tau and aggregates in the brain homogenate were overall consistent with the known disease classifications, indicating that isoform-specific aggregation is preserved in the soluble phase.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Super-resolution imaging reveals disease-specific tau aggregate morphologies</title><p id="P12">Having established that the small tau aggregates present in brain homogenate differ in abundance and distribution across tauopathies, we next characterised their morphology, a property that remains largely unexplored but may provide insight into disease-specific aggregate features. We applied single-molecule super-resolution microscopy to tau aggregates captured from brain homogenate using the MAPTau<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Aggregates were immobilised on a PEG coated surface using monoclonal tau antibodies, labelled with the same monoclonal, fluorescently conjugated antibody, and imaged with TIRF microscopy, enabling visualisation and quantitative analysis of individual aggregates. For each aggregate, we extracted morphological parameters including length, area, and eccentricity to compare the aggregate shape and size distributions across diseases.</p><p id="P13">Representative super-resolution images revealed small, round aggregates in all groups, while AD samples also contained a distinct population of long (&gt;200 nm), fibrillar-shaped aggregates not observed in other tauopathies or HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). To quantify this, we first measured the mean aggregate length per sample, which was significantly higher in AD compared to PSP, PiD, CBD, and HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The cumulative distributions of aggregate length showed a right-shifted profile in AD consistent with a higher proportion of longer aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly, the presence of long aggregates in AD was not attributable to overall aggregate abundance: they remained detectable even upon dilution, while PSP samples imaged at fivefold higher concentration remained crowded but exclusively composed of small, round aggregates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1E</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To better classify aggregate length distributions across diseases, we categorised all aggregates by length into three bins: small (&lt;100 nm), medium (100–200 nm), and long (&gt;200 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The number of small aggregates was comparable across all tauopathies (2335 ± 189 aggregates per FOV) and slightly lower in healthy controls, indicating a shared baseline of early aggregation. In contrast, AD exhibited an increase in both medium and long aggregates, suggesting the presence of an additional, disease-specific population. When expressed as a proportion, long aggregates (&gt;200 nm) were significantly more abundant in AD (21 ± 8.9%) compared to other tauopathies (6.5 ± 3.9%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Consistently, AD also showed a higher proportion of elongated, fibrillar-shaped aggregates (eccentricity &gt;0.9; AD: 21 ± 2%, other tauopathies: 15 ± 2%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To assess whether these fibrillar-shaped aggregates also carried disease-relevant post-translational modifications, we performed super-resolution imaging using the phospho-tau specific AT8 antibody (pS202/pT205). As with HT7, AT8-positive aggregates in AD also included long fibrillar-shaped species, and the proportion of AT8-positive aggregates &gt;200 nm was significantly higher in AD than in every other group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>, mean length and percentage of fibrils of AT8-positive tau aggregates in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1F</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We next assessed AT8 epitope availability by calculating the localisation density (localisations per super-resolved pixel, corresponding to 13x13 nm<sup>2</sup>) within each aggregate as a proxy for phosphorylation load. In long aggregates (&gt;200 nm), AD showed significantly increased AT8 localisation density compared to all other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>), with a mean of 10.4 ± 0.5 localisations/pixel versus 5.5 ± 1.4 localisations/pixel in the other conditions. This difference was specific to AT8, as HT7-based localisation densities were similar across aggregate lengths and disease states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1G</xref>). Finally, to compare phosphorylation between short and long aggregates, we calculated the localisation density ratio (&gt;200 nm vs. &lt;100 nm). All groups showed enrichment of AT8 in long aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>), suggesting this modification is generally associated with long, fibrillar forms.</p><p id="P17">Together, these findings indicate that AD is characterised by a specific population of long, fibrillar-shaped tau aggregates in the brain homogenate fraction, which may be structurally and biochemically distinct from those in other tauopathies.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Small tau aggregates exhibit disease-specific phosphorylation profiles</title><p id="P18">Given the morphological and AT8 phosphorylation status differences observed in AD, we next sought to systematically examine the phosphorylation patterns of small tau aggregates across tauopathies. To do this, we employed aggregate-specific Simoa assays targeting defined phospho-epitopes, alongside single-molecule co-localisation microscopy, to map the presence and overlap of key phosphorylation sites on individual tau aggregates.</p><p id="P19">We first quantified the overall abundance of small aggregates in the brain homogenate that carry specific phospho-epitopes using aggregate-specific Simoa assays. We used the previously developed assay to detect AT8 (pS202/pT205) positive tau aggregates and developed further assays to specifically detect tau aggregates positive for pT217, pT181, and pS356 rather than monomers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). AD samples showed significantly increased levels of AT8-, pT217-, and pT181-positive aggregates compared to the other tauopathies and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). To account for differences in overall aggregate burden, we normalised to the levels of total tau aggregates in the brain homogenate fraction as detected by the HT7 antibody pair. Phosphorylation at AT8 and T217 remained significantly enriched in AD, while T181 no longer showed significant differences across groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2B-E</xref>). In contrast, aggregates positive for phosphorylation at S356 showed a distinct profile. pS356-positive aggregates were most abundant in PSP and nearly absent in AD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Total pS356 levels did not differ across diseases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2F</xref>), indicating that pS356 is present in AD but likely only in monomeric tau or masked within aggregates, suggested by recent findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">To assess the co-occurrence of phospho-epitopes within individual aggregates, we performed two-colour single-molecule co-localisation imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2G-I</xref> for 488) and quantified the proportion of AT8-positive aggregates that also carried a second phospho-epitope (T217, T181, or S356). In AD, on average 54 ± 11% of AT8-positive aggregates were co-labelled with pT181 and 68 ± 17% with pT217. In contrast, less than 20% of AT8-positive aggregates were positive for either epitope in PSP, CBD, and PiD, and fewer than 10% showed co-localisation in HC samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F, G</xref>). For S356, co-localisation with AT8 was uniform across all groups (around 30%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>), consistent with its distinct aggregate profile.</p><p id="P21">We next analysed the fluorescence intensity of individual aggregates, using signal intensity as a proxy for aggregate size and/or epitope density. In AD, AT8-positive aggregates were overall brighter, consistent with the increased size/phosphorylation density observed by super-resolution imaging (pT217 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>, pT181 and pS356 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2J</xref>). Aggregates were then stratified based on whether they were co-labelled with a second phospho-epitope (pT181, pT217 or pS356). Co-localised aggregates were overall brighter/larger, with most high-intensity aggregates showing co-localisation. In PiD and CBD, AT8 aggregates were generally dimmer, consistent with their smaller size as observed by super-resolution imaging.

We normalised these to the levels of total tau aggregates determined through HT7 (mid-region epitope), to determine the proportion of truncated aggregates. A large proportion of tau aggregates retained the N-terminus across all diseases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, the C-terminus was detected in less than 10% of aggregates in controls and non-AD tauopathies, while in AD, on average 22 ± 12% aggregates retained the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Linear discriminant 1 (LD1), with percentage of long aggregates, C- and N-terminal truncation as top contributing features, explained 69.0% of between-class variance while LD2 explained 22.3% of variance, with percentage of long aggregates, percentage of 4R tau aggregates and pS356 as top contributing features. Notably, AD samples clustered furthest from all other groups on the first dimension, and CBD on the second dimension, consistent with their distinct fibrillar aggregate morphology and PTM profile.

Although the small aggregates characterised above are hypothesised to be toxic and potentially seed-competent, we observed no seeding above background when using homogenate directly, likely due to the high protein load impairing cell viability. As a result, we turned to sarkosyl-insoluble tau aggregates, which are enriched in misfolded conformers and are more commonly used in established biosensor assays. Seeding assays provide a functional, quantitative readout of tau’s ability to induce aggregation in a prion-like manner, a process suggested to underlie tau propagation and disease progression <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P32">To evaluate isoform-specific seeding activity, we used tau biosensor HEK293 cell lines expressing either full-length wild-type 3R- or 4R-tau fused to eGFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.

AD showed comparatively low BAX and p53 levels but increased Iba1 and GFAP, consistent with a more glial-dominant phenotype.

While much of the field has focused on large, insoluble fibrillar aggregates, increasing evidence suggests that small tau aggregates formed during the earlier stages of aggregation play a more central role in disease pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Here, we systematically characterised these small tau aggregates in brain homogenate across AD, PSP, CBD and PiD, using two complementary single-molecule techniques. We found that these aggregates differ not only in abundance but also in morphology, tau isoform composition, post-translational modifications, and associated markers of cellular stress. Together, our findings suggest that these small tau aggregates differ between diseases, with implications for molecular diagnostics and stratified therapies for tauopathies.</p><sec id="S14"><title>Distinct aggregate properties reflect divergent disease mechanisms</title><p id="P48">A central finding of this study is that AD contains a distinct population of long, fibrillar-shaped aggregates in the brain homogenate fraction that are absent from other tauopathies. These fibrils are highly phosphorylated at disease-relevant sites (e.g. AT8, T217), and are associated with increased localisation density, suggesting a higher phosphorylation load per aggregate. In contrast, other diseases such as PSP and CBD displayed predominantly small, round aggregates, despite similar or higher levels of total tau in the brain homogenate fraction. This morphological divergence may reflect differences in tau conformation, proteostasis, or aggregation kinetics across diseases. That these fibrillar-shaped aggregates in AD are still diffusible yet structurally distinct supports the hypothesis that small tau aggregates may encode pathogenic characteristics before they transition to insoluble deposits.</p><p id="P49">Our findings further reveal that tau aggregates are not uniform across tauopathies, but rather vary in morphology, functional activity and associated cellular responses. Small aggregates exhibit disease-specific morphologies and post-translational modifications, which in turn correlate with differing biological effects in each disease. For example, in AD, fibrillar and hyperphosphorylated aggregates are accompanied by astroglial and microglial activation, while in CBD, tau aggregates show robust seeding activity but low associated inflammation. PSP presents a distinct profile: high proportion of small aggregates in the homogenate, low seeding, and high inflammasome activation, suggesting a localised, inflammatory pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that tau aggregates may play different roles across diseases – acting as seeds, inflammatory triggers, or relatively inert by-products depending on their specific molecular features.</p><p id="P50">These interpretations are supported by recent findings showing that the morphology and PTMs of small tau aggregates differ across tauopathies and correlate with distinct cellular responses. Recent work supports the idea that not all small tau species are functionally equivalent. Meng <italic>et al</italic>. showed that hyperphosphorylated tau can spontaneously form small, round oligomers that trigger TLR4-dependent responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. This provides a plausible mechanism by which the small, round aggregates could engage innate immune signalling. Yang <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that recombinant tau oligomers impair synaptic plasticity in a TNFα-dependent manner, whereas fibril-derived soluble aggregates disrupt plasticity independently of TNFα<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P51">In addition to morphology and phosphorylation, we also observed disease-specific patterns of tau ubiquitination and truncation. AD aggregates more frequently retained the C-terminal tau epitope and were less often ubiquitinated, whereas in non-AD tauopathies, aggregates lacking the C-terminus showed higher co-localisation with ubiquitin. This may suggest divergent aggregate clearance mechanisms or differential engagement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system across tauopathies, potentially contributing to differences in aggregate stability or turnover.</p><p id="P52">These findings reinforce the concept that distinct soluble tau aggregates have distinct functional properties, with some requiring or synergising with inflammatory cues to impair neuronal function. In this context, the combination of small tau aggregates and high inflammation observed in PSP may drive localised, rapid pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. In contrast, AD is less associated with inflammation in the frontal cortex and features more fibrillar-shaped aggregates, which may facilitate progressive spread, while CBD may follow a seeding-dominant but comparatively less inflammatory trajectory.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>pS356-positive aggregates as a distinct pathological subclass</title><p id="P53">Among all aggregate markers tested, phosphorylation at S356 stood out for its disease specificity and association with cellular stress. pS356-positive aggregates were enriched in PSP, nearly undetectable in AD, and strongly correlated with markers of apoptosis (BAX), inflammation (Iba1, ASC), and stress response (p53). Although total pS356 levels were similar across diseases, their reduced detectability in AD aggregates may reflect epitope burial, consistent with recent structural studies.</p><p id="P54">The structural accessibility of S356 is disease-dependent; while in PSP and CBD S356 is exposed on the outer surface of tau filaments, in AD PHFs it is buried within the fibril core. This suggests that pS356 not only marks 4R tauopathies but also reflects the conformational pathway underlying aggregation. Its presence on soluble aggregates in PSP and CBD indicates that even small tau species in these diseases adopt structures that permit phosphorylation at this site. In contrast, in AD, the inaccessibility of Ser356 may prevent such modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> (even in the presence of relevant kinases), explaining the near absence of detectable pS356-positive soluble aggregates in AD in our study.</p><p id="P55">Given the known role of pS356 in blocking proteasomal degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, its presence in PSP may allow tau aggregates to evade clearance and accumulate, leading to the high proportion of soluble tau aggregates that we observed. While this could reflect an aberrant process or even a compensatory attempt to stabilise misfolded tau under stress, we suggest it more likely to ultimately lead to the build-up of bioactive tau species that may trigger inflammatory cascades. In support of this, we observed increased inflammatory and apoptotic markers in PSP, and specifically linked pS356-positive aggregates to elevated levels of BAX, p53, ASC specks, and Iba1. These inflammatory cascades may in turn further exacerbate tau pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Additionally, the negative charge introduced at S356, located within the microtubule-binding domain, may also modulate local tau conformation and protein–protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, potentially altering the aggregation trajectory itself. Overall, these findings suggest that detectable S356 phosphorylation is both a structural and functional marker of tauopathies that adopt a PSP/CBD-like trajectory, with potential implications for disease classification and therapeutic targeting.</p><p id="P56">Our findings also raise the question of causality between PTMs and tau conformation. Do disease-specific PTMs, such as pS356, shape the aggregation trajectory and promote the adoption of particular filament folds? Or do distinct folds emerge early and constrain the accessibility of certain PTM sites, thereby encoding divergent modification profiles? The burial of sites such as S356 within the core of mature filaments, as seen in AD PHFs, suggests that once aggregation has occurred, conformational constraints may limit further modification, effectively locking in the PTM profile. However, in the early aggregation stages modifications may still play a key role in directing tau toward particular aggregation pathways. Understanding the temporal order of PTM acquisition and aggregation could provide crucial insight into the initiation and divergence of tauopathy subtypes.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Fast vs slow tauopathy</title><p id="P57">Molecular and cellular consequences of disease-specific PTM profiles may also help explain the divergent patterns of tau aggregation observed across tauopathies. The higher abundance and fibrillar morphology of soluble tau aggregates in AD may reflect the slower progression of disease, allowing neurons to sequester tau into mature aggregates. In contrast, PSP progresses more rapidly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Here, tau may accumulate as smaller, stress-associated aggregates, (potentially due to the availability of pS356 phosphorylation on the aggregates). Thus, differences in aggregate burden and morphology likely reflect not just aggregation propensity, but also disease stage, regional vulnerability, and cellular capacity to manage tau pathology.</p><p id="P58">An additional consideration is that differences in aggregate abundance may partly reflect differential neuronal survival. In Alzheimer’s disease, longer disease duration and slower neurodegeneration may allow neurons to persist despite tau pathology, providing the opportunity for aggregates to accumulate and mature. In contrast, in PSP, where disease progression is typically more rapid, early neuronal loss may limit the detectable aggregate burden at the time of sampling, rather than reduced aggregation per se. Further work with larger datasets could compare the tau aggregate signatures of fast <italic>vs</italic>. slow progressors within each tauopathy.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Seeding competence of insoluble tau</title><p id="P59">While soluble aggregates are increasingly suspected to be the primary toxic species, functional assays have historically focused on insoluble material. To probe whether tau aggregates differ in their ability to template pathology, we measured the seeding capacity of sarkosyl-insoluble tau in 3R and 4R biosensor lines; AD and PiD strongly seeded 3R tau, CBD seeded 4R tau, and AD and PSP exhibited minimal 4R seeding. These findings suggest that seeding competence is not solely determined by isoform content or aggregate abundance but likely reflects underlying conformational or biochemical features of the aggregates themselves. The 3R cell line is much more sensitive than the 4R cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, which would explain why minimal seeding was detected with PSP and AD seeds. With CBD, on the other hand, tau may adopt a more seed-competent conformation, or be modified in a way that enhances templated aggregation.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Implications for biomarker development and targeted therapeutics</title><p id="P60">This overall heterogeneity implies that tau aggregates play divergent roles across diseases depending on their molecular characteristics. These insights highlight the need for disease-specific approaches to both diagnosis and therapy. Soluble tau aggregates, when characterised by features such as phosphorylation state or morphology, may serve as more precise biomarkers than bulk tau levels. Likewise, tau-targeting interventions may benefit from tailoring to the specific aggregate species and mechanisms predominant in each tauopathy.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="P61">While valuable for showing distinct morphologies of tau aggregates in disease-specific cases, this study is not free of limitations. While we focused on tau aggregates extracted from a single brain region, tau pathology is known to vary spatially, and regional differences in aggregate profiles may further inform disease mechanisms. The study design also does not capture how tau aggregation evolves over time. Moreover, the limited sample size (n = 4 for PiD and n = 5 cases for other disease groups) limits the generalisability of some findings and may reduce power to detect subtle differences across diseases or correlated within each disease group. Finally, while we identified correlations between tau aggregate features and inflammatory markers, causality cannot be inferred. Additional studies using longitudinal models or human-derived systems will be required to clarify the directionality and mechanisms underlying these associations.</p><p id="P62">In conclusion, we demonstrate that the small tau aggregates exhibit disease-specific signatures of their molecular and functional properties, which are associated with divergent cellular responses across tauopathies.

In cases where multiple spots met this criterion, the closest spot was selected as the co-localised pair. To estimate chance co-localisation, the centroid coordinates of the second channel were transposed along the x-dimension, and the distance-based analysis was repeated.

Distinct folds of the late-stage insoluble tau filaments are associated with different tauopathies, as revealed by cryo-EM. In this study, we asked whether disease-specific differences are already apparent at the level of small tau aggregates. To address this, we analysed tau species retained in the brain homogenate (high salt, low detergent). (B) Small tau aggregates were profiled using two complementary single-molecule methods. The single-molecule pull-down assay captures and images individual tau aggregates using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, enabling direct visualisation and quantification of their morphology and post-translational modifications. In parallel, Simoa provides digital, ultrasensitive quantification of epitope-specific aggregates using bead-based immunoassays. Both approaches use a monoclonal antibody sandwich that selectively detects tau species containing at least two epitopes (≥ dimers), excluding monomeric tau. (C) Sarkosyl-insoluble aggregates were assessed in a 3R/4R tau biosensor assay to measure isoform-specific seeding capacity. Aggregate features were linked to disease-specific profiles of cellular stress and inflammatory markers, enabling mechanistic insights into tauopathy heterogeneity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206427-f006"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Summarised patient characteristics.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" style="border-top: 1px solid #000000">Disease<break/>(pathology)</th><th valign="top" align="left" style="border-top: 1px solid #000000"># of<break/>cases</th><th valign="top" align="left" style="border-top: 1px solid #000000">Age ± S.D.<break/>[years]</th><th valign="middle" align="left" style="border-top:solid 1px #000000">Region</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-top:solid 1px #000000">AD</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-top:solid 1px #000000">5</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-top:solid 1px #000000">76.4 ± 5.0</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-top:solid 1px #000000">BA6/8</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">PSP</td><td valign="top" align="left">5</td><td valign="top" align="left">74.8 ± 5.4</td><td valign="top" align="left">BA46</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">PiD</td><td valign="top" align="left">4</td><td valign="top" align="left">71.3 ± 2.5</td><td valign="top" align="left">BA9/10/46</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">CBD</td><td valign="top" align="left">5</td><td valign="top" align="left">77.0 ± 3.5</td><td valign="top" align="left">BA9/10/46</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000">HC</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000">5</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000">73.8 ± 4.7</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000">BA6/8</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Detailed patient characteristics.
