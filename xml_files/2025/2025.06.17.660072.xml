Phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> are virulent amyloids that contribute to cytotoxicity, immune modulation, and biofilm stability. PSMα3 forms cross-α amyloid fibrils and shares sequence and structural features with LL-37, a human host-defense peptide that assembles into α-helical structures. Here, we uncover RNA as a potent, context-dependent modulator of their aggregation and activity. RNA consistently reduces LL-37’s cytotoxicity toward human cells without compromising its antibacterial function, suggesting a selective host-protective mechanism. In contrast, RNA preserves PSMα3’s cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity over time, likely by promoting liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) and stabilizing bioactive fibrillar polymorphs, enabling <italic>S. aureus</italic> to fine-tune its virulence strategies. At higher concentrations, RNA drives both peptides toward distinct aggregated states, amorphous for LL-37 and fibrillar for PSMα3, underlying their divergent functional outcomes. The amyloid inhibitor EGCG abolishes the bioactivity of both PSMα3 and LL-37, overriding RNA’s modulatory effects. Together, our findings establish RNA as a key modulator of both virulent amyloids and host-defense peptides, with broad implications for microbial immune evasion, innate immunity, and amyloid-associated diseases. Moreover, they highlight phase transitions as a tunable mechanism for regulating peptide bioactivity and a promising therapeutic target across infectious and neurodegenerative conditions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Bacterial amyloids are proteins capable of forming ordered fibrils, playing a crucial role in biofilm stability, surface adherence, cell toxicity and immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. These amyloids are vital for the survival and virulence of many bacteria, enabling them to colonize and persist in diverse environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Some examples of bacterial amyloids include the Csg and Fap proteins from <italic>Enterobacteria</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, respectively, which play a role in biofilm stability. The phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) produced by <italic>Staphylococci</italic> contain amyloid-forming short peptides which play multiple functional roles central to the pathogenicity and immune evasion strategies of <italic>S. aureus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> .</p><p id="P3">Among bacterial amyloids, PSMα3 stands out as highly cytotoxic against a broad range of microbial and human cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. It adopts a unique cross-α amyloid structure, where α-helices are stacked perpendicular to the fibril axis in paired sheets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The formation of cross-α amyloids has been correlated with toxic activity, and the properties of these fibrils may regulate PSMα3’s various functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. PSMα3 shares self-assembly of α-helices with LL-37, a human host defense peptide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Moreover, the LL-37 antimicrobial active core (residues 17–29) shows sequence similarity to PSMα3, and the formation of fibrils composed of densely packed cationic amphipathic α-helices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. The similarity supported the hypothesis that PSMα3 might recapitulate functions of LL-37, and indeed, they share the activation of the signal inhibitory receptor on leukocytes-1 (SIRL-1) which is a negative regulator of myeloid cell function and dampens antimicrobial responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Such common functions might be related to molecular mimicry and the ability of bacterial peptides to hijack immunomodulation pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Indeed, PSMαs interact with the formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) on immune cells, initiating immune responses such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These reactions are critical for recruiting and activating immune cells, thereby amplifying the inflammatory response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">LL-37 has been shown to bind RNA released from dying cells, forming stable complexes that protect the RNA from enzymatic degradation and promote its uptake by dendritic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Once internalized, these RNA–LL-37 complexes activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs), triggering cytokine production and dendritic cell maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Beyond LL-37, other human antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), such as β-defensins, also form higher-order assemblies that organize nucleic acids into nanostructures with defined periodicity. These nanocomplexes potently stimulate TLRs, highlighting that innate immune activation is influenced not only by ligand identity, but also by the nanoscale geometry and spatial organization of the complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Interestingly, nucleic acid interactions also play a key role in the immune activation triggered by bacterial amyloids. For example, PSMs co-assemble with extracellular DNA (eDNA), and CpG-rich DNA specifically promotes PSMα3 fibrillation, forming co-aggregates that colocalize with DNA in biofilms. These complexes activate TLR pathways and induce anti-dsDNA autoantibody responses in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Similar mechanisms are seen in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic>, where curli fibers bind eDNA, enhance fibrillation, and engage TLRs signaling, also promoting autoimmunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that amyloid–DNA complexes in bacterial biofilms are not only structural components but also potent immunomodulators with potential links to autoimmunity.</p><p id="P6">The similarities between LL-37 and PSMα3 prompted us to investigate their interaction with RNA and the resulting structural and functional implications on cell toxicity. Our findings show that both PSMα3 and LL-37 can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the presence of RNA, and transition into solid aggregates as a function of incubation time and RNA concentration. LLPS is in general a critical process in cellular organization in which proteins or other molecules separate into distinct liquid phases, forming dynamic, membraneless compartments central to cellular processes such as metabolism, RNA regulation, and stress response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. PSMα3 also penetrates HeLa cells, localizes within the nucleolus, and colocalizes with nucleic acids. We observed dynamic and reversible molecular behavior within the nucleolus, mirroring in vitro observations of PSMα3’s LLPS with RNA.</p><p id="P7">Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a polyphenol primarily found in green tea and recognized as an amyloid inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, disrupts the cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity of both PSMα3 and LL-37. In contrast, RNA differentially modulates their activity, suggesting distinct mechanisms linked to their self-assembly dynamics, morphologies, and toxic pathways. These findings provide new insights into RNA-mediated self-assembly in bacterial physiology and highlight potential biomedical applications for combating resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>PSMα3 interacts with RNA in vitro</title><p id="P8">The interactions between PSMα3 and RNA were assessed using an Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA), comparing the binding affinity of PSMα3 to single-stranded PolyA RNA and double-stranded Poly (AU) RNA. The RNA molecules were labeled with the IR800CW fluorescent dye (as detailed in the Methods section). Freshly dissolved PSMα3, at varying concentrations, was incubated with each RNA type at a constant concentration for 30 minutes at 37°C. The EMSA results revealed that PSMα3 exhibits a stronger binding affinity to double-stranded Poly (AU) RNA, as evidenced by significant shifts at lower peptide concentrations compared to single-stranded Poly(A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P9">A high density of PSMα3 fibrils was observed after 2 hours of incubation with Poly (AU) RNA using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while incubation with Poly(A) RNA under the same conditions resulted in amorphous aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Consequently, we decided to focus our subsequent investigations on the behavior of PSMα3 in the presence of double-stranded Poly (AU) RNA.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Poly (AU) RNA concentration-dependent induced transitioning of PSMα3 condensates to solid aggregates</title><p id="P10">To better understand the nature of the PSMα3-RNA interaction, we visualized their mixtures via fluorescence microscopy, using PSMα3 labeled with Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) at the C-terminus (PSMα3-FITC), which is known to form fibrils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. 100 μM PSMα3-FITC was incubated with either 50 ng/μl or 400 ng/μl propidium iodide (PI)-labeled RNA in a close to physiological buffer of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl).</p><p id="P11">With the addition of 50 ng/μl RNA, PSMα3 formed liquid-liquid phase separated droplets that clearly colocalized with the RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The liquid nature of the droplets was further validated by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis, where we observed a rapid recovery of the PSMα3-FITC signal shortly after bleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). However, after a longer incubation of 2 hours, no fluorescence recovery was detected, suggesting that the condensates aged and transitioned to a more aggregated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). In addition, we observed the encapsulation of RNA within PSMα3-FITC “coated” droplets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">In contrast to the effect of 50 ng/μl RNA, the addition of a higher RNA concentration of 400 ng/μl to PSMα3 resulted in immediate aggregation, with no observed phase of droplet formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). FRAP analysis indicated no recovery of signal after bleaching, likely due to the formation of solid structures rather than droplets with liquid-like properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). These aggregates also showed colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), indicating that the PSMα3-RNA interaction persisted in both the LLPS and solid states.</p><p id="P13">Turbidity assays showed that a 30 min co-incubation of 100 μM PSMα3 with varying concentrations of RNA displayed an increased turbidity up to 50 ng/μl, while higher RNA concentrations displayed a decrease in turbidity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). This suggests that 50 ng/μl can be a critical concentration between soluble species, which might be able to phase separate, and the formation of aggregates. The decrease in particle size above 50 ng/μL can be a result of either the formation of smaller particles or aggregation into larger clusters, which can settle out of suspension, removing them from the light-scattering medium and reducing turbidity.</p><p id="P14">Alternatively, it may indicate the dissolution of phase-separated droplets, as observed in systems like Ddx4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. We then used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to better visualize the effect of RNA on PSMα3 morphology.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>RNA concentration-driven changes in PSMα3 fibrillar morphology and aggregation</title><p id="P15">The TEM micrographs showed that in the absence of RNA, 100 μM PSMα3 formed nanotube-like fibrils after 2 hours, growing wider or with some twist after 24-hours co-incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Incubating PSMα3 with a low concentration of 10 ng/μL RNA displayed accelerated fibril formation, with more strongly twisted, wide, sheet-like fibrils observed after both 2 hours and 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). With the addition of 50 ng/μL RNA, PSMα3 fibrils have a similar twisted morphology after 2 hours, while at a longer incubation time of 24 hours, we observed a significant morphological shift into more thin amorphous aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). At the higher concentration of 400 ng/μL RNA, PSMα3 formed dense, thin fibrils after 2 hours, but with a possible fragmentation into smaller species or rearrangement into amorphous aggregates after 24 hours of co-incubation. This indicates that RNA concentration and time of co-incubation affect the density and morphology of PSMα3 fibrils. This corresponds to the differences observed by light microscopy of co-aggregates contexture of LLPS droplets vs solid aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P16">These observations were further supported by TIRF microscopy using the amyloid-specific dye AmyTracker630 (AT630). TIRF analysis was performed at 50 ng/μL and 400 ng/μL RNA, which induced phase separation and solid aggregation of PSMα3, respectively. With the addition of 50 ng/μL RNA to PSMα3-FITC, a strong AT630 fluorescence signal was detected after 2 hours co-incubation, but not after 30 minutes. This suggests a time-dependent transition into amyloid-like species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Conversely, at 400 ng/μL RNA, a significant AT630 fluorescence was observed already after 30 minutes of co-incubation, consistent with a rapid formation of amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). These findings highlight a concentration- and time-dependent modulation of PSMα3 phase separation and structural transitions, where RNA promotes LLPS at lower concentrations and drives rapid amyloid formation and unique fibrillar morphologies at higher concentrations.</p><p id="P17">Solid-state circular dichroism (ssCD) spectroscopy reveals that PSMα3 lacks a defined secondary structure both immediately after preparation and following 2 hours of incubation. However, upon addition of RNA, a clear shift toward an α-helical conformation is observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). This supports the notion that RNA not only accelerates aggregation but also promotes or stabilizes the α-helical fibrillar architecture, potentially consistent with cross-α amyloid structures.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>RNA modulates the antibacterial activity of PSMα3</title><p id="P18">The antimicrobial activity of PSMα3 against <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was evaluated under varying RNA concentrations and incubation times using the PrestoBlue Cell Viability Assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Freshly dissolved 10 μM PSMα3 exhibited potent antibacterial activity, completely abolishing bacterial viability. After 2 hours of incubation, PSMα3 retained its full activity, comparable to its freshly prepared state. The presence of RNA at 50 ng/μL and 400 ng/μL had no impact on its antimicrobial function within this timeframe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P19">In contrast, after 24 hours of incubation, PSMα3’s antibacterial activity was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), also at 20 μM, suggesting a decrease in its effective concentration or changes in its morphology. Notably, the addition of RNA at 50 ng/μL or 400 ng/μL prevented this loss of activity, indicating that RNA plays a stabilizing role of toxic species. These findings suggest that RNA influences PSMα3 aggregation dynamics and morphology, thereby modulating its long-term antimicrobial effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>RNA modulates PSMα3 cytotoxicity against human HeLa cells</title><p id="P20">The effect of RNA on the cytotoxicity of PSMα3 against human HeLa cells was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, an indicator of cell membrane damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Freshly dissolved PSMα3 exhibited substantial cytotoxicity, causing approximately 80% cell death at 20 μM and 50% at 10 μM. The presence of RNA did not significantly alter the toxicity of freshly dissolved PSMα3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>), similar to the antibacterial activity. However, following 2 hours of incubation, PSMα3 cytotoxicity was significantly reduced, possibly due to aggregation and a loss of active peptide concentration. This reduction occurred earlier than the loss of antibacterial activity, which was only observed after 24 hours of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). This discrepancy may reflect differences in how membrane composition and media conditions influence PSMα3 aggregation kinetics, or it may indicate distinct mechanisms underlying cytotoxicity versus antibacterial membrane disruption.</p><p id="P21">Notably, co-incubation with RNA helped maintain PSMα3 cytotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner. With 50 ng/μL RNA, the 2-hour incubated PSMα3 retained cytotoxicity comparable to its freshly dissolved form, suggesting that RNA prevents activity loss due to incubation. However, after 24 hours, 50 ng/μL RNA was insufficient to preserve cytotoxicity.</p><p id="P22">In contrast, at 400 ng/μL RNA, partial cytotoxicity was maintained for both 2-hour and 24-hour incubated PSMα3, compared to the freshly dissolved sample.</p><p id="P23">Overall, these findings suggest that RNA prevents the incubation-induced loss of both antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). This effect appears to be concentration- and co-incubation time-dependent, likely linked to RNA-induced morphological variations of PSMα3 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>PSMα3 targets nucleolar nucleic acids in HeLa cells with LLPS dynamics</title><p id="P24">The interactions and localization of PSMα3 were next explored in HeLa cells with the addition of 20μM FITC-PSMα3 just before imaging. PI was added to the cell medium as a marker for cell death, as it selectively penetrates dead cells and binds to their nucleic acids.</p><p id="P25">Confocal microscopy images revealed that PSMα3 induces significant toxicity as indicated by membrane damage, intracellular PSMα3 aggregate formation, and positive PI staining. PSMα3 also enters the nuclei, with a notable concentration in the nucleolus, indicated by the foci of green fluorescence (marked by white arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). The composite images demonstrated clear colocalization of PSMα3 with nucleic acids in the nucleolus, as seen by the overlap of the green PSMα3-FITC signal and the red fluorescence from PI-stained nucleic acids.</p><p id="P26">FRAP analysis of 20 μM PSMα3-FITC within the nucleolus of HeLa cells indicated mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). The Pre-bleach panel shows the initial fluorescence distribution, with the nucleolus marked by the white arrow. Following photobleaching, a localized reduction in fluorescence was observed. Notably, within 60 seconds, significant fluorescence recovery was observed in the nucleolus, highlighting the dynamic and reversible molecular behavior of PSMα3 in this cellular compartment. The results overall suggest an interaction between PSMα3 and nucleolar RNA/DNA within cells, which mirrors our in vitro findings where PSMα3 interacted, and underwent LLPS and formed solid aggregates in the presence of RNA.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>EGCG directly binds PSMα3 and inhibits its fibrillation and bioactivity, even in the presence of RNA</title><p id="P27">Since RNA appears to protect or maintain PSMα3’s toxic functions, potentially by influencing its fibril formation and morphology, we investigated the corresponding and combined effects of an inhibitor of fibril formation. One such inhibitor is epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin in tea and a known amyloid inhibitor, including of PSMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">The addition of EGCG to PSMα3 at a 1:1 molar ratio did not significantly alter its cytotoxicity against HeLa cells. However, at a fivefold molar excess, EGCG completely abolished PSMα3’s cytotoxic effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). To examine the structural changes underlying this effect, we analyzed fibril formation kinetics and morphology in the presence of EGCG. TEM micrographs revealed that a fivefold molar excess of EGCG disrupted fibril formation of 100 μM PSMα3, instead inducing amorphous aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Consistently, kinetics assays of fibril formation showed that EGCG inhibited the Thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence curve otherwise indicating the fibril formation of 100 μM PSMα3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). These findings suggest that EGCG reduces PSMα3 toxicity by modulating its fibril formation and morphology.

Peak broadening was also observed in the aromatic region of EGCG, especially for protons H1 and H2, compared to the reference spectrum of EGCG alone, indicating that the interaction is visible from the EGCG side as well. Notably, slight opalescence was observed in the sample following preparation, potentially reflecting early-stage aggregate formation. Additionally, the presence of multiple cross-peaks between non-sequential residues (i+3 or i+4) in the two-dimensional (2D) <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) spectrum indicates a well-defined structure of PSMα3 in this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>).

PSMα3 signals remained stable, with only a ~10% decrease in intensity, whereas EGCG signals exhibited substantial degradation, with nearly 50% loss over the same time frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). Given the ~1.5-day duration of the 2D NMR measurements, it is estimated that over 60% of EGCG remained in solution during data acquisition, allowing for reliable observation of its interaction with the peptide. Of note, EGCG’s activity has been shown to depend on its chemical stability and the surrounding conditions.

We applied heat shock at 65°C for 15 minutes and found that RNA significantly affected LL-37’s phase behavior in a concentration-dependent manner. Specifically, with the addition of 100 ng/μL RNA, LL-37 formed condensates that colocalized with the RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>).

Unlike LL-37, PSMα3 shows a time-dependent reduction in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), likely due to a transition from soluble species to irreversible fibril morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). At lower RNA concentrations, PSMα3’s cytotoxic activity against human cells is initially preserved but diminishes over time. This time-dependent decrease likely reflects a transition from soluble liquid-like droplets to solid aggregates within the RNA-PSMα3 complex.

Following incubation, the samples were centrifuged three times for 3 minutes at 1.5g, with the supernatant discarded and the pellet resuspended in 1X PBS after each spin. The resuspended cells were then stained with 50 μg/mL wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) CF633 for 30 minutes. After staining, the cells were washed three times by centrifugation with PBS to remove excess WGA. During the final wash, the cells were resuspended in 0.1 mg/mL PI solution.</p><p id="P64">Prior to imaging, the samples were loaded into an ibidi μ-Slide VI 0.4. Imaging was performed using a ZEISS Elyra 7 Super-Resolution Microscope equipped with a 63× Apochromat alpha Plan-Apochromat Oil immersion DIC objective, NA 1.4, and pco.edge sCMOS cameras. Lattice structured illumination images were acquired and processed using the ZEN black software at the Life Sciences and Engineering (LS&amp;E) Infrastructure Center, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel. The experiments were conducted three times with similar observations.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Thioflavin T fluorescence fibrillation kinetics assay</title><p id="P65">Thioflavin T (ThT) (Sigma Aldrich) is a widely used fluorescent dye for detecting and analyzing amyloid fibril formation kinetics. Fibrillation curves in the presence of ThT typically exhibit an initial lag phase followed by rapid fibril elongation. To accurately capture the fibrillation lag time, PSMα3 was pre-treated before the experiment. The peptide was dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of 1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP- Sigma Aldrich) and Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA- Sigma Aldrich) to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL, followed by bath sonication for 10 minutes at room temperature. The organic solvents were then evaporated using a mini-rotational vacuum concentrator (Christ, Germany) at 1,000 rpm for 2 hours at room temperature.</p><p id="P66">For the experiment, freshly prepared 100 μM PSMα3 peptides, with or without 500 μM Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) at a 1:5 molar ratio, were prepared in 50 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.4 containing 150 mM NaCl. ThT was prepared by diluting a stock solution in ultrapure double-distilled water (UPddw) and filtered before use to reach a final concentration of 200 μM Blank control solutions containing all components except for the peptide were prepared for each reaction.</p><p id="P67">The assay was conducted in black 96-well flat-bottom plates (Greiner Bio-One), which were sealed with a thermal seal film (EXCEL Scientific) to prevent evaporation. Samples were incubated in a plate reader (OMEGA) at 37°C, shaking at 500 rpm for 85 seconds before each reading cycle, for up to 1,000 cycles of 6 minutes each, totaling approximately 100 hours. Fluorescence was measured in triplicate using an excitation wavelength of 438 ± 20 nm and an emission wavelength of 490 ± 20 nm. All values were averaged, background fluorescence was subtracted using blank controls, and the results were plotted over time. Standard error of the mean is shown as error bars. The entire experiment was independently repeated at least three times on different days to ensure reproducibility.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Solid-State Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy</title><p id="P68">Solid-state circular dichroism spectroscopy(ss-CD) was conducted with PSMa3 to assess their fibrillar secondary structure components in presence and absence of Poly (AU) RNA. For preparation of peptide and RNA samples, see Peptide and Poly (AU) preparation section. PSMa3 was prepared at a working concentration of 100 μM in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl at 0 ng/μL, 50 ng/μL or 400 ng/μL Poly (AU) RNA. The reaction mixes were incubated for 0 min, 2 h and 72 h at 37 °C in a non-shaking thermocycler. Following incubation, soluble reaction components were removed via dilution washing with 150 μL water and centrifugation at 12.500 rcf for 30 min. 20 μL of the sediment were resuspended in 180 μL water for a second washing centrifugation step at 12.500 rcf for 30 min. 180 μL of the supernatant were discarded and 18 μL of sediment applied to a <italic>Chirascan Series fused silica disc</italic> (AP/CSSD, Applied Photophysics) in three times 6 μL steps. After every sample application onto to the silica disc, all liquid was evaporated at 37 °C for 5–10 min until only an opaque film remained visible. For secondary structure determination of aggregated/fibrillar peptide components on the silica disc, the disc was inserted into a <italic>Chirascan solid sample holder</italic> (CS/SSH, Applied Photophysics) and the circular dichroism recorded in the far-UV (180–250 nm, step size 1 nm, time-per-point 1 s) using a CD spectropolarimeter (Applied Photophysics). To counteract sample anisotropy, CD spectra were recorded at least four different disc rotations and the results averaged. Prior to data analysis, silica disc and buffer/water backgrounds were subtracted from recorded sample spectra. Poly (AU) RNA-only background spectra showed complex and high amplitude signals that did not appear for samples in combination with peptides and were therefore not subtracted from sample spectra.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>NMR experiments</title><p id="P69">To prepare the reference samples for NMR analysis, 0.521 mg of PSMα3 was dissolved in 180 μL of 20 mM MES (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid) buffer at pH 6.0, supplemented with 5% (v/v) deuterium oxide (D<sub>2</sub>O). From this solution, 170 μL was transferred into a 3.0 mm NMR tube for spectral acquisition. In parallel, a 4 mM stock solution of EGCG was prepared in the same 20 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0). From this, a working solution containing 0.5 mM EGCG in 20 mM MES with 5% (v/v) D<sub>2</sub>O was prepared to match the buffer conditions of the peptide sample. A volume of 170 μL was then transferred into a separate 3.0 mm NMR tube for use as the EGCG reference.</p><p id="P70">All NMR experiments were recorded on a Bruker 700 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance cryoprobe (Prodigy) and an AVANCE NEO console. One-dimensional (1D) <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra were acquired using the Bruker library pulse sequence zggpw5 for water suppression. The acquisition parameters were: acquisition time (AQ) = 1.90 s, spectral width (SW) = 12.31 ppm, recovery delay (D1) = 1.5 s, and 64 scans. All experiments were conducted at 35 °C, under which optimal spectral quality was obtained.</p><p id="P71">Two-dimensional (2D) <sup>1</sup>H–<sup>1</sup>H TOCSY (Total Correlation Spectroscopy) spectra were collected using the Bruker pulse sequence dipsi2gpph19.

Recovery delay (D1) was set to 1.5 s. 2D <sup>1</sup>H–<sup>1</sup>H NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) spectra were acquired using the noesyfpgpph19 pulse sequence, with acquisition parameters identical to those used for TOCSY. The mixing time was set to 300 ms. Total experimental time for the combined 2D TOCSY and NOESY experiments was approximately 30 hours. NMR data processing was carried out using TopSpin 4.5.0 (Bruker), and spectral assignments for the 2D TOCSY and NOESY spectra were performed using POKY software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>.
