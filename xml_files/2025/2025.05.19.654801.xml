This spatial restriction is likely to be governed by local activation of key microtubule regulators around the chromosomes in oocytes, but the identities of these microtubule regulators and the mechanisms remain unclear. To address this, we developed a novel assay to visualise spatial regulation of spindle-associated proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes by inducing ectopic microtubule clusters. This assay identified several proteins including the TPX2 homologue Mei-38 that localise more strongly to microtubules near the chromosomes than away from them. We identified a microtubule-binding domain containing a region highly conserved also in humans. The domain itself is regulated spatially, and contains a conserved serine and a nearby PP2A-B56 docking motif. A non-phosphorylatable mutation of this serine allows the domain to localise to ectopic microtubules as well as spindle microtubules, while mutations in a PP2A-B56 docking motif greatly reduced the spindle localisation. As this phosphatase is concentrated at the kinetochores, it may act as a novel chromosomal signal spatially regulating spindle proteins within oocytes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>spindle</kwd><kwd>oocyte</kwd><kwd>phosphatase</kwd><kwd>Drosophila</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Due to the absence of centrosomes, the spindle is self-assembled in the oocytes of most animal species. As the oocytes have a large volume, it is crucial to assemble one bipolar spindle around the chromosomes and suppress spindle formation in other parts of the ooplasm. This spatially restricted spindle assembly requires the local activation of key proteins important for bipolar spindle assembly near the chromosomes. This spatial regulation is not only limited to microtubule nucleation factors but also to other regulators of microtubule dynamics and organisation, because non-spindle microtubules are present all over the oocyte yet fail to organise into a spindle. Chromosomes serve as spatial cues, which can be sensed by key regulators of the spindle assembly. These proteins can then be locally activated to execute their functions, together with many other ubiquitous proteins whose activity is not spatially regulated.</p><p id="P3">The Ran-Importin pathway is the most studied system for spatial regulation in oocytes. Ran is a small GTPase with two forms: active RanGTP and inactive RanGDP. RanGDP is converted into RanGTP by chromatin-bound RCC1, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Cytoplasmic Ran GTPase-activating protein (RanGAP) promotes GTP hydrolysis to GDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Due to chromosomal localisation of RCC1, the RanGTP concentration is higher around the chromosomes, generating a RanGTP gradient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Proteins important for spindle assembly are inhibited by Importin binding, and RanGTP releases them from Importin for local activation near the chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. These proteins are collectively called “spindle assembly factors”. So far, over 20 spindle assembly factors have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Among the spindle assembly factors, TPX2 is one of the first and most studied factors. TPX2 plays multifaceted roles in spindle assembly in meiosis. After RanGTP releases TPX2 from importin inhibition, TPX2 interacts with Aurora A to activate it and with Kinsein-5 to modulate its distribution at the spindle. TPX2 also forms condensates on microtubule lattices and recruits other microtubule nucleators, Augmin and γ-TuRC, for branching microtubule nucleation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p><p id="P5">TPX2 plays crucial roles in spindle microtubule assembly, pole focusing and size control in mouse oocytes and/or <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p id="P6">In <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, a dominant negative Ran prevents spindle microtubule assembly, while hyperactive RanQ69L can induce spindle-like structures in the absence of chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. However, in mouse oocytes, abolishing the Ran-GTP gradient either by expressing dominant negative or hyperactive Ran leads to defects in the meiosis I spindle without disrupting spatially-restricted spindle assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Similarly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes, these dominant mutants affects spindle organisation, but a spindle is formed only around the chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. In human oocytes, expressing dominant negative Ran severely delayed impaired spindle assembly around the chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Therefore, these observations suggest a varied importance of the Ran pathway in different species, but also the presence of alternative mechanisms for the spatial regulation of proteins important for bipolar spindle assembly in oocytes.</p><p id="P7">The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) containing Aurora B kinase was proposed as an alternative signal for spatial regulation in oocytes. The CPC is essential for spindle microtubule assembly in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. The CPC is activated on the chromosomes independently of Ran [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], and directly phosphorylates and inactivates microtubule-destabilising proteins, such as MCAK/KIF2C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] and Op18/Stathmin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. In addition, the CPC co-operates with the phospho-docking protein 14-3-3 to locally activate spindle-associated proteins around the chromosomes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes. 14-3-3 binds to Kinesin-14 Ncd to prevent it from binding to non-spindle microtubules away from the chromosomes. Chromosome-bound CPC phosphorylates an additional site on Kinesin-14 Ncd to release it from inhibition by 14-3-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Many more spindle-associated proteins have been found to be regulated by 14-3-3, including the CPC and the centralspindlin complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>].</p><p id="P8">Rcc1 and the CPC are two chromosomal cues so far identified for the spatial regulation of spindle-associated proteins in oocytes. However, it is unknown whether they can account for all of the spatial regulation in oocytes, as no systematic studies have been done to identify spatially-regulated spindle proteins, chromosomal signals or regulatory mechanisms. In this report, we developed a novel method to assess whether the binding of a protein to microtubules is spatially regulated by inducing ectopic microtubules in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes. Our findings on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> TPX2 homologue Mei-38 suggest a protein phosphatase-based mechanism that spatially regulates this spindle-associated protein.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Induction of ectopic microtubules revealed spatial regulation of Mei-38 binding to microtubules in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes</title><p id="P9">To identify the spindle-associated proteins that are locally activated near the chromosomes and bind to microtubules, we have induced ectopic microtubule clusters by treating <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> oocytes with a microtubule stabilising drug taxol/paclitaxel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). After taxol treatment, we immunostained wild-type mature oocytes using antibodies against various spindle-associated proteins or mature oocytes expressing GFP-tagged spindle-associated proteins using a GFP antibody, together with an α-tubulin antibody and DAPI.</p><p id="P10">Without taxol treatment, mature <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes naturally arrest in metaphase I with a bipolar spindle. After a brief taxol treatment, the bipolar spindle associated with the chromosomes was still recognisable, although the morphology was often distorted to various degrees. In addition, many ectopic microtubule clusters were formed all over the oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). The intensity and morphology varied but the maximum signal intensity of some clusters was comparable to that of the spindle microtubules. For the localisation of spindle proteins, we classified the outcomes into two types depending on whether they are spatially regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). (1) If a spindle protein indiscriminately binds to microtubules, it would equally localise to the entire spindle and ectopic microtubule clusters. (2) If a protein has a higher affinity to microtubules near the chromosomes than further away, a higher concentration of the protein would be observed on the spindle microtubules near chromosomes than ectopic microtubules with a similar microtubule density.</p><p id="P11">Among 12 spindle proteins that we tested, three showed equal localisation to all microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig</xref>), indicating they are unregulated (type 1). They include TACC, KInesin-13 Klp10A, and Kinesin-5 Klp61F. For example, TACC showed uniform distribution on the spindle microtubules and ectopic microtubules, reflecting the intensity and pattern of tubulin signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). To quantify the signal intensity, a line was drawn along the long axis of the spindle and another line was drawn over a microtubule cluster with roughly the same tubulin intensity as the spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). The intensity of the signal was measured along the lines, and normalised using the maximum intensity of the spindle microtubules in each oocyte. The mean signal intensity of TACC roughly follows the tubulin mean intensity along the spindle axis and also along the line drawn across ectopic microtubule clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). These proteins are likely to bind to microtubules indiscriminately under this condition. In other words, they are not regulated spatially in terms of microtubule binding.</p><p id="P12">In contrast, the other nine proteins showed stronger signals on the spindle microtubules, especially near the chromosomes, than ectopic microtubules indicating that they are spatially regulated (type 2). They include Mars/HURP, the CPC subunits, Ncd/Kinesin-14, Mink/NuSAP, Cyclin B and Mei-38/TPX-2, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2 and 3 Fig</xref>). For example, the signal of the GFP-tagged Mars was much stronger on spindle microtubules than on ectopic microtubule clusters, even where the tubulin intensity was comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). Furthermore, the GFP-Mars signal was stronger near the chromosomes, and became weaker away from the chromosomes even within the same spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). Quantification showed that the GFP-Mars signal intensity on the spindle microtubules decays much more sharply further away from the chromosomes than the tubulin intensity. Moreover, the GFP-Mars signal on ectopic microtubules is comparable to the background without a distinct peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>). Therefore, Mars binding to microtubules is strongest near the chromosomes, becomes progressively weaker further away along the spindle, and virtually absent on ectopic microtubules, indicating that Mars is spatially regulated in terms of microtubule binding.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Truncation analysis narrowed the region sufficient for spatial regulation</title><p id="P13">We focused our study on Mei-38, the TPX2 homologue, among the spatially regulated proteins we identified, as it apparently lacks sequences potentially regulated by previously known mechanisms, such as importin-binding sites and 14-3-3 binding sites. Mammalian TPX2 is regulated by Ran-importin through nuclear localisation signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] but Mei-38 lacks nuclear localisation signals, as well as the Aurora A and Kinesin-5 interaction domains found in mammalian TPX2 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P14">In taxol-treated oocytes, Mei-38 localised to the spindle microtubules much more strongly than to ectopic microtubule clusters, even where the tubulin intensity was comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>. Furthermore, within the same spindle, the Mei-38 signal was stronger near the chromosomes and became gradually weaker towards the poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). Quantification showed that the Mei-38 signal intensity on the spindle microtubules decays more sharply further away from the chromosomes than the tubulin intensity. Moreover, the Mei-38 signal on ectopic microtubules is close to the background with a very small peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To define domains responsible for spindle binding and its spatial regulation, we carried out a taxol assay in oocytes expressing various GFP-tagged truncated Mei-38 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2A and 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5 Fig</xref>). Goshima (2011)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] has identified three regions conserved among the TPX2 family across species including humans. Mei-38(1-278), Mei-38(95-323) and Mei-38(95-278), lacking the conserved region 1, 3 or both, still maintained spatial regulation identical to the full-length protein, although the signal intensity is lower than the full-length Mei-38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2A and 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5 Fig</xref>). This demonstrates that these regions are not essential for spindle localisation or spatial regulation.</p><p id="P16">Mei-38(143-278) and (176-278) localised uniformly to spindle microtubules but much more weakly to ectopic microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2A and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5 Fig</xref>), suggesting that the area between the conserved regions 1 and 2 contributes to spatial regulation to some degree. Mei-38(1-221) lacking the conserved regions 2 and 3 failed to localise to any microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2A and 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5 Fig</xref>), suggesting the conserved region 2 and the C-terminal flanking area are important for microtubule association. We have identified Mei-38(176-278) containing the conserved region 2 as the shortest fragment sufficient to localise to spindle microtubules. This fragment is still under spatial regulation, as it showed much stronger localisation to the spindle microtubules than to ectopic ones. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). A smaller fragment, Mei-38(176-242), failed to localise to any microtubules. A western blot confirmed that this fragment was expressed at a similar level to the full-length or other truncated proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6 Fig</xref>). Mei-38(195-323) failed to localise to any microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>), probably because of a very low protein level seen in a western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6 Fig</xref>).</p><p id="P17">In summary, we narrowed down the region sufficient for the spindle localisation and spatial regulation in oocytes, although another region also contributes to spatial regulation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Identification of a microtubule-binding domain containing a highly conserved sequence</title><p id="P18">To assess the microtubule-binding activity separately from oocyte-specific regulation, we took advantage of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic cultured cell line, S2. A previous report (Goshima, 2011)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] showed that GFP-Mei-38 expressed in S2 cells is associated with filamentous microtubule networks in interphase, and assessed the microtubule binding activity of some truncated proteins. We found that fragments that bind to spindle microtubules in oocytes, including Mei-38(176-278), were able to associate with interphase microtubules in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). Unexpectedly, Mei-38(176-242), which failed to localise to any microtubules in oocytes, was able to associate with interphase microtubules in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). Therefore, this deleted sequence 243-278 is dispensable for microtubule binding <italic>in vitro</italic> or in S2 cells, but required for spindle microtubule localisation in oocytes.</p><p id="P19">Mei-38(176-242) contains region 2, which is highly conserved also in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. To test whether Mei-38(176-242) has intrinsic microtubule binding activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, we produced the fragment in bacteria as a fusion with MBP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7 Fig</xref>). Pure porcine tubulin dimers were incubated with bacterially produced Mei-38(176-242) and were polymerised into microtubules by taxol addition. After microtubules were spun down, the microtubule fraction (pellet) and non-binding fraction (supernatant) were analysed by western blot using an MBP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). MBP-Mei-38(176-242) was found in the microtubule fraction, while degradation products including the one with the size corresponding to MBP were missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). In agreement with S2 cells, this showed that the recombinant Mei-38(176-242) has an intrinsic microtubule-binding activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, it fails to localise to the spindle or ectopic microtubules in oocytes.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>S225 is responsible for spatial regulation of the Mei-38(176-278) binding to microtubules</title><p id="P20">We then decided to focus on Mei-38(176-278), the smallest fragment that localises to the spindle in oocytes, because it is still spatially regulated. This fragment shows significantly stronger localisation to the spindle microtubules compared to ectopic microtubules in taxol-treated oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C and D</xref>). It contains three sequences of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>): (1) a central highly conserved region containing the potential phosphorylation site S225 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>), (2) the N-terminal flanking region 198-203 which matches a docking motif of PP2A-B56 (L/F/xxI/VxE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], (3) the C-terminal flanking sequence 243-278 that is dispensable for microtubule-binding <italic>in vitro</italic> or in S2 cells, but required for spindle localisation in oocytes.</p><p id="P21">We tested the role of S225 in binding of Mei-38(176-278) to spindle and ectopic microtubules in taxol-treated oocytes by mutating it to alanine (S225A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4B and C</xref>). Strikingly, this mutated fragment, Mei-38(176-278,S225A), localised to all microtubules equally including ectopic microtubules, completely abolishing spatial regulation of microtubule binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4D</xref>). This result demonstrated that S225 is solely responsible for spatial regulation of this fragment.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>PP2A-B56 docking enhances Mei-38 localisation to spindle microtubules</title><p id="P22">Next we looked into the role of a flanking PP2A-B56 docking motif located near S225. This sequence is conserved among <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. To test its role, we mutated 3 consensus residues of this motif to alanines (B56-3A) in Mei-38(176-278) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). This mutation greatly reduced the localisation of Mei-38(176-278) to the spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>). It suggests that a failure to dephosphorylate this fragment by PP2A-B56 suppresses the localisation to spindle microtubules. To test the involvement of S225 in this process, we further introduced a non-phosphorylatable mutation, S225A, to generate Mei-38(176-278,B56-3A,S225A). The spindle microtubule localisation was restored by S225A in taxol-treated oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>), suggesting that dephosphorylation of S225 by PP2A-B56 is important for spindle microtubule localisation.</p><p id="P23">We then looked into the role of the C-terminal flanking sequence 243-278. Mei-38(176-242) that lacks this sequence 243-287 has intrinsic microtubule-binding activity but fails to localise to the spindle in oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>). Addition of this sequence 243-278 enables the spindle localisation in oocytes. We hypothesised that the sequence 243-278 promotes dephosphorylation of Mei-38 on the spindle. Without this sequence, Mei-38(176-242) remains to be fully phosphorylated in oocytes even near the chromosomes/spindle, preventing its binding to both spindle and ectopic microtubules. To test this hypothesis, we mutated S225 of this fragment to alanine. As predicted, this mutant fragment, Mei-38(176-242,S225A), localised to the spindle microtubules in taxol-treated oocytes, although weakly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>). Therefore, this fragment, Mei-38(176-242), failed to localise to the spindle microtubules in taxol-treated oocytes, partially because the sequence 243-278 is important for dephosphorylation at S225 which normally takes place in the spindle area.</p><p id="P24">The S225A mutation abolished spatial regulation of Mei-38(176-278), allowing it to localise equally to both spindle and ectopic microtubules. In contrast, introduction of S225A to either Mei-38(176-278, B56-3A) or Mei-38(176-242) enhanced the localisation to the spindle microtubules, but the localisation to ectopic microtubules was weaker than the spindle. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5A and B</xref>). This indicates that, while S225 is solely responsible for spatial regulation of Mei-38(176-278), there is a cryptic mechanism that spatially regulates Mei-38 in the absence of the PP2A-B56 docking site or the C-terminal region 243-278.</p><p id="P25">Finally, we tested importance of S225 and PP2A-B56 docking motif for the localisation of the full-length Mei-38. We first expressed the GFP-tagged full-length Mei-38 with non-phosphorylatable or phospho-mimetic mutations at S225, Mei-38(S225A) and Mei-38(S225D), in oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>). The distribution pattern of the non-phosphorylatable mutant, Mei-38(S225A), was similar to Mei-38 without the mutation in taxol-treated oocytes, although the signal appears to be weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6B</xref>). On the other hand, a phospho-mimetic mutant, Mei-38(S225D), failed to localise to either spindle or ectopic microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6B</xref>). This suggests that single phosphorylation of S225 is sufficient to prevent the full-length Mei-38 from binding to microtubules, but the full-length Mei-38 also has another mechanism that suppresses microtubule binding away from the chromosomes, which is consistent to our truncation analysis. Next, to test whether PP2A-B56 docking is important for the localisation of the full-length Mei-38, we expressed the GFP-tagged full-length Mei-38 with mutated PP2A-B56 docking site, Mei-38(B56-3A), in oocytes.</p><p id="P26">The distribution of the Mei-38(B56-3A) localisation in taxol-treated oocytes was similar to Mei-38 without the mutation, but the signal was generally weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C</xref>). This docking site may be less important in the context of the full -length Mei-38.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">The bipolar spindle forms only around the meiotic chromosomes in oocytes without centrosomes in the exceptionally large cytoplasm. This requires key proteins to be locally activated in oocytes. In this study, we have developed a novel method to assess spatial regulation of specific proteins in oocytes by inducing ectopic microtubules using taxol. We have identified 10 spindle-associated proteins that are spatially regulated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes in terms of microtubule binding. Our analysis of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> TPX2 homologue Mei-38 suggests a phosphatase-driven mechanism, in which inhibitory phosphorylation of Mei-38 is removed by PP2A-B56, concentrated at kinetochores, enabling it to bind to spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6D</xref>).</p><p id="P28">In oocytes, spatially restricted activation of key proteins around the chromosomes is important for the following reasons. (1) Oocytes lack centrosomes, the main microtubule organising centres in mitotic cells, and need to restrict a high level of microtubule nucleation/stabilisation to the proximity of the chromosomes. (2) Non-spindle microtubules co-exist with spindle microtubules in oocytes, but should not organise into bipolar spindles. Key microtubule organising proteins, such as cross-linkers and motors, must be active only near the chromosomes. (3) The density of non-spindle microtubules in oocytes is low, but the volume of the oocyte is far larger than that of the spindle (&gt;1,000 times in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes). A large number of non-spindle microtubules may outcompete spindle microtubules for binding of key microtubule-associated proteins. To overcome this, oocytes need to either produce a far larger amount of the proteins than required, or activate the microtubule-binding activity of these proteins only near the chromosomes.</p><p id="P29">Understanding the mechanisms governing spatial regulation of proteins important for spindle formation in oocytes remains still limited. For local activation of the spindle-associated proteins in oocytes, Rcc1 (GEF) and the CPC (a kinase complex) are the two chromosomal signals that have been identified so far. Further studies have identified the downstream pathways leading to local activation of key proteins, which involve Ran-Importin and 14-3-3, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] However, it is still unknown whether they account for all of the spatial regulation in oocytes, as no systematic studies have been carried out to identify chromosomal signals, spatially-regulated proteins or the underlying regulatory mechanisms.</p><p id="P30">Although proteins regulated by known mechanisms have been systematically identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] these studies could not uncover an entirely new mechanism of spatial regulation. Instead, comprehensive understanding of spatially restricted spindle assembly in oocytes requires the systematic identification of spatially regulated proteins regardless of the mechanisms. In-depth studies of each spatially-regulated protein could discover a new chromosomal signal and/or a signaling pathway, or add to a list of proteins controlled by a known mechanism. Studies of all spatially regulated proteins could lead to comprehensive understanding of chromosomal signals and the regulatory mechanisms.</p><p id="P31">We developed a novel method to visualise a spatial distribution of microtubule binding affinity by inducing ectopic microtubule clusters in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes. Using the method, we have successfully identified 10 spindle-associated proteins that are spatially regulated in terms of microtubule binding. A limitation of our method is that it only assesses general microtubule-binding activity. It does not assess interaction with dynamic microtubules, or other activities, such as nucleation, cross-linking or motor activities. Furthermore, spatial regulation of some proteins may be indirect, as they may bind to another proteins that is spatially regulated or recognise spatially restricted signatures or structures. Nevertheless, our newly developed method is straightforward and rapid, and can be easily applied to other species to uncover conserved principles for spatial regulation in oocytes.</p><p id="P32">Among spatially regulated proteins we identified, we focused our studies on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> TPX2 homologue Mei-38, as it appear to lack sites potentially regulated by known mechanisms. Our truncation and mutational analysis has identified a microtubule-binding domain (176-278) in Mei-38 that contains a highly conserved sequence among the TPX2 family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. We demonstrated the microtubule-binding activity of this domain <italic>in vitro</italic>, in interphase cultured cells and in metaphase I oocytes. Previous studies have identified multiple microtubule-binding domains in vertebrate TPX2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] including a recent comprehensive study which tested all 10 modules in TPX2 individually and in combinations both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells. They detected microtubule binding activity in six modules, but not in the module R6 which possibly corresponds to the microtubule-binding domain we identified in Mei-38. However, it is uncertain which module in TPX2 corresponds to this domain of Mei-38, as the overall organisation and primary sequence differ significantly between the two. All modules in TPX2 may have a potential microtubule-binding activity with considerable redundancy, but the actual activity of each module may change during evolution.</p><p id="P33">Our analysis of Mei-38 revealed a mechanism possibly driven by dephosphorylation. The spindle-binding domain, Mei-38(176-278), is under spatial regulation in oocytes, showing much stronger localisation to the spindle microtubules than to ectopic microtubules. A phospho-mimetic mutation at S225 prevented binding to any microtubules, while a non-phosphorylatable mutation abolished the spatial regulation, resulting in indiscriminate binding to both spindle and ectopic microtubules. These results suggest that phosphorylation at S225 inhibits microtubule binding, and that this inhibitory phosphorylation is removed exclusively in the spindle area to allow binding to spindle microtubules.</p><p id="P34">Our results further suggest that the protein phosphatase PP2A-B56 promotes spindle microtubule binding of Mei-38(178-278) by targeting S225 through the adjacent PP2A-B56 docking motif. Additionally, our results also suggest the involvement of another flanking region in dephosphorylation at S225, and the presence of a cryptic mechanism which becomes evident only in the absence of the PP2A-B56 docking site or the flanking region. Furthermore, another region outside of 178-278 also contributes to spatial regulation, suggesting multiple layers of regulation on Mei-38.</p><p id="P35">As one of the two isoforms of PP2A-B56 is concentrated at the kinetochores in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] we propose that this phosphatase serves a new chromosomal signal that locally activates proteins important for spindle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6D</xref>). In oocytes, studies on PP2A-B56 have primarily focused on its regulation of kinetochore-microtubule attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>] A protein phosphatase represents a new type of chromosomal signals, distinct from the previously known signals, a kinase (the CPC) and a GEF (Rcc1). Since inhibitory phosphorylation is a common way to block protein-protein interactions including microtubule binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>] phosphatase-driven mechanisms may be widely used to locally activate more spindle-associated proteins near the chromosomes in oocytes. Furthermore, considering that PP2A-B56 is concentrated at the kinetochores also in mammalian oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>] this phosphatase may act as a chromosomal signal in mammalian oocytes as well. It would be of great interest to test potential roles of PP2A-B56 or other phosphatases in mammalian oocytes.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Molecular techniques</title><p id="P36">Standard molecular techniques were followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>] Plasmids expressing Mei-38 or its variants were generated as below.
