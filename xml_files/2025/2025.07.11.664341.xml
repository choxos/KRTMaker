GATA4 regulates cardiogenesis through the expression of its target genes, only some of which have been identified. We have used a gain of function model based on pluripotent embryonic ectoderm explants from <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos expressing GATA4, to identify a set of downstream targets of GATA4 which are also regulated by Nodal, a known cardiogenic signal. GATA4 was shown to be required for the expression of target genes <italic>tbx2</italic> and <italic>prdm1</italic> in vivo, likely acting in a direct fashion by interacting with their regulatory regions. In addition, <italic>tbx2</italic> and <italic>prdm1</italic> are shown to have roles of their own in vivo, as downregulation of <italic>tbx2</italic>, a positive target, and overexpression of <italic>prdm1</italic>, a negative target, interferes with cardiac development in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos.</p><p id="P2">The conservation of the <italic>GATA4-TBX2-PRDM1</italic> regulatory relationship was shown in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Loss of function of GATA4 lead to downregulation of <italic>TBX2</italic>, upregulation of <italic>PRDM1</italic> expression and failure of cardiogenesis. GATA4-deficient cells failed to form normal cardiomyocytes, with most cells adopting alternative fates and only a small minority expressing an aberrant cardiomyocyte phenotype. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis documented severe reduction of cardiomyocyte and endothelial cell transcriptomes and upregulation of transcriptional profiles of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Disruption of TBX2 function did not alter cardiomyocyte differentiation efficiency but led to the formation of hypertrophic cardiomyocytes characterised by defective sarcomeres and deficient calcium signalling. In addition, we show that whilst <italic>PRDM1</italic> is not essential for formation of cardiomyocytes it is implicated in suppression of alternative cell fates.</p><p id="P3">The results presented establish a conserved regulatory relationship between GATA4 and its target genes <italic>TBX2</italic> and <italic>PRDM1</italic> and roles for these genes in the modulation of cardiomyocyte development, expanding the cardiac gene regulatory network and providing further insight into how cardiogenesis proceeds.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Heart development and homeostasis is controlled by the collective action of numerous transcription factors (TFs) which come together to form complex and dynamic gene regulatory networks (GRN) that define and maintain cellular identity. Disruption of the cardiac GRN is associated with the development of congenital heart defects (CHDs), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Fahed et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Tan et al., 2002</xref>). The established core network of TFs that orchestrate cardiac development, includes GATA4/5/ 6, NKX2-5, HAND1, 2, TBX2/ 5/ 20 and proteins belonging to the MADS domain family such as MEF2 and SRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Akerberg and Pu, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Bruneau, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Olson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Paige et al., 2015</xref>). Evidence from mouse knockout models has shown that the absence of any one of these factors results in an array of severe cardiac defects that almost invariably lead to embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Bruneau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Firulli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Koutsourakis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Kuo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Srivastava et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Stennard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Watt et al., 2004</xref>) highlighting vulnerability of the cardiac GRN to perturbation.</p><p id="P5">GATA4 is a core member of the cardiac GRN with well documented roles in all stages of heart development as well as in post-natal life. Early experiments in mice identified an indirect role for GATA4 in visceral endoderm which is essential for cardiac morphogenesis in the overlying mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Kuo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Molkentin et al., 1997</xref>). Subsequent studies have identified cell autonomous roles for GATA4 in the developing heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Watt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Zeisberg et al., 2005</xref>). Evidence for the importance of GATA4 in human heart development is exemplified by the characterisation of a heterozygous mutation, G296S, linked with congenital heart disease (CHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Garg et al., 2003</xref>). Cardiomyocytes generated from CHD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) show defects in contractility and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Ang et al., 2016</xref>). The molecular basis for this phenotype was shown to be the inability of the mutant GATA4 protein to recruit TBX5 to common targets in chromatin, leading to downregulation of cardiac targets and to aberrant de-repression of endothelial targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Ang et al., 2016</xref>). It is worth noting that this heterozygous mutation in patients is associated with the occurrence of a range of atrial and ventricular septal defects of a severity often requiring surgical correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Garg et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, heterozygous mice carrying the corresponding mutation appear grossly normal, with a proportion showing mild defects in post-natal atrial septal closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Misra et al., 2012</xref>), highlighting the limitations of mouse models of CHD.</p><p id="P6">In addition to being required for heart development, GATA4 has been shown to be sufficient to drive cardiomyocyte differentiation of permissive embryonic cells either on its own in pluripotent ectodermal explants from <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Latinkić et al., 2003</xref>), or together with Baf60c in mouse early embryonic mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Takeuchi and Bruneau, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, GATA4 is used in most cocktails of cardiac TFs for reprogramming of non-cardiac cells to cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Garry et al., 2022</xref>). For example, <italic>GATA4</italic> along with additional cardiac GRN members <italic>MEF2</italic> and <italic>TBX5</italic> is sufficient for reprogramming of fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Garry et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Xie et al., 2022</xref>). The requirement for GATA4 for normal cardiac development, as outlined above, and the ability of GATA4 to steer the genomic program of non-cardiomyocytes towards a cardiomyocyte fate reaffirms it as a key component of the cardiac GRN.</p><p id="P7">Mechanistic studies focused on mapping of GATA4 occupancy sites in chromatin in different models such as mouse embryos, cardiomyocytes derived from human iPSCs and adult hypertrophic hearts, are beginning to identify the roles of GATA4 at the chromatin level by defining its stage-, signal- and cell type-specific targets. Besides the core cardiac GRN, numerous additional transcription factors regulate multiple aspects of cardiac development such as cardiac cell type diversification and morphogenesis. The emerging expanded cardiac GRN includes genes such as <italic>TBX2</italic> which has been shown to regulate the formation of the Atrio-Ventricular Canal (AVC) by repressing the transcriptional program for chamber cardiomyocytes. To describe an expanded cardiac GRN, it will be necessary to obtain and integrate a better knowledge of regulatory relationships between its nodes.</p><p id="P8">A simple model for studying the cardiac GRN is offered by overexpression of GATA4 in pluripotent ectodermal explants from blastula stage <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos. GATA4 is sufficient to reprogram explant cells fated to become epidermis towards cardiomyocytes in a process which mimics normal heart development by producing beating cardiac tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Latinkić et al., 2003</xref>). In this model, in addition to cardiomyocytes GATA4 induces endothelial cells as well as anterior endoderm, in keeping with its known roles in vivo. GATA4-driven cardiogenesis was shown to be enhanced by Wnt antagonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Latinkić et al., 2003</xref>), in agreement with the well documented role of Wnt antagonism in heart development. Besides GATA4 expression, pluripotent explants from <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos can be directed towards cardiomyocyte fate by Nodal/Activin signalling, the principal inducer of mesoderm and endoderm in vertebrate embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Logan and Mohun, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Takahashi et al., 2000</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> explants, Nodal signalling acts in a concentration dependent manner, with a high dose required for induction of endoderm and cardiomyocytes and a lower dose for skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Logan and Mohun, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Takahashi et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p id="P9">As both GATA4 and Nodal induce cardiomyocytes, we used both cardiogenic triggers in this report to identify and characterise putative components of the cardiac GRNs as co-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A subset of DEGs were validated as GATA4 targets in vivo as well as in explants. Interference with normal expression of two such targets, <italic>tbx2</italic> and <italic>prdm1</italic> is shown to affect heart development in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos. The wider relevance of the data obtained in <italic>Xenopus</italic> is shown by our results which demonstrate the essential roles of GATA4 and its target gene <italic>TBX2</italic> in differentiation of human cardiomyocytes from iPS cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Identification of GATA4 targets under cardiogenic conditions</title><p id="P10">To dissect the genomic program for cardiogenesis regulated by GATA4 we employed a well-established gain of function model using pluripotent ectodermal explants from blastula stage <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Latinkić et al., 2003</xref>). As GATA4 plays key roles in the development of multiple cell types of mesodermal and endodermal origin, and is sufficient to specify endodermal, endothelial and blood cells in <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal cap explants, we designed an experimental approach for selection of cardiogenesis-related genes regulated by GATA4. This consisted of defining a set of genes regulated by cardiogenic conditions: GATA4 (G4), GATA4 in the presence of Wnt antagonist Dkk-1 (G4D), which enhances cardiogenesis, and high level of Nodal/Activin signalling, known to induce cardiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>). At the same time, these genes were not regulated by a lower level of Nodal/Activin which induces skeletal but not cardiac muscle, and by Dkk-1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>). In this model it takes approximately 2 days for GATA4 to induce cardiac differentiation as assessed by expression of cardiomyocyte markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We focussed on the early stages of the genomic program which was expected to include immediate-early and delayed-early targets, by sampling at 2.5h, 5h and 7.5h after excision of animal cap explants and activation of inducible GATA4-GR fusion by addition of dexamethasone (DEX). We performed polyA+ RNA-seq and calculated DEGs at each stage relative to control. The three conditions produced a highly concordant impact on gene expression for each time point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B-D</xref>); therefore, we combined these to define DEGs per condition. We found 1,092 DEGs (690 activated, 402 repressed) for GATA4 (G4), 1,067 (602 activated and 465 repressed) for GATA4 + Dkk-1 (G4D), and 1,696 (829 activated and 867 repressed) for Nodal. Comparing between conditions we found exceptional overlap of 914 genes differentially expressed in G4 and G4D, 83.7% and 85.7% of their genes respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The overlap with Nodal DEGs was more limited with 403 genes shared between the three cardiogenic treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We performed gene set enrichment using Enrichr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Kuleshov et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>), and we calculated enrichments for all intersection groups indicated in the upset plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We found a clear induction of cardiac gene expression programmes in the intersection of GATA4 and Nodal DEGs, with terms such as Heart Development (FDR &lt; 10<sup>-7</sup>, intersection of G4/G4D/Nodal) and Cardiac Progenitor Differentiation (FDR &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup>, intersection of G4/G4D/Nodal). We further found an enrichment in Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to transcription factor driven regulation of gene expression in the intersection of GATA4 and Nodal conditions, with enrichment of terms such as Regulation Of Transcription By RNA Polymerase II (FDR &lt; 10<sup>-23</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Validation confirmed DEGs which satisfied the selection criteria (regulated by G4, G4D and high Nodal but not low Nodal/Activin) at all time points such as <italic>fst, map3k12, rgs2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Other DEGs were validated at some but not all time points.</p><p id="P13">Upregulated DEGs include known Nodal target <italic>lefty1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cheng et al., 2000</xref>); at 2.5h <italic>lefty1.S</italic> is induced strongly by Nodal, as expected from a direct target of Nodal signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). However, as the gene is also induced by low level of activin/Nodal signalling at that time, it is not validated as a DEG induced by cardiogenic conditions. The expression of <italic>lefty1.S</italic> induced by cardiogenic but not non-cardiogenic conditions is sustained beyond 2.5h, thus identifying it as a DEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Additional upregulated DEGs include <italic>igf2</italic> and <italic>ephA4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>), Tbx family transcription factors <italic>tbx2</italic> and <italic>tbx5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) and <italic>gata2, hoxc13</italic> and <italic>lmo2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>).</p><p id="P14">In addition to upregulated DEGs, we have identified DEGs which are downregulated in response to cardiac inducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). They were most consistently observed at 2.5h, the proximal time point at which direct action of G4, G4D and Nodal is most likely.

As shown in Fig2B, downregulation of GATA4 using morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) leads to upregulation of <italic>id3</italic> at gastrula and neurula stages; interestingly, even though <italic>id2</italic> and <italic>id4</italic> were not confirmed as DEGs, their expression was also upregulated by GATA4 MOs, suggesting an indirect mode of action. Downregulation of GATA4 and most closely related cardiogenic GATA factor, GATA5, led to upregulation of <italic>prdm1</italic>, and to downregulation of <italic>tbx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). This analysis has shown that GATA4 is required for normal expression of <italic>id3, prdm1</italic> and <italic>tbx2</italic> in vivo.</p><p id="P17">We next asked if GATA4 directly regulates <italic>id3, prdm1</italic> and <italic>tbx2</italic> through association with their regulatory regions. For this analysis we identified consensus GATA binding sites within 10 kb upstream and 2 kb downstream of their translation start sites and tested their presence in genomic DNA associated with exogenous GATA4. For all 3 genes, the minority of tested sites were found to associate with GATA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3B-C</xref>), suggesting that GATA4 is directly and specifically regulating their expression.</p><p id="P18">We subsequently tested if <italic>tbx2</italic> and <italic>prdm1</italic> have roles of their own in <italic>Xenopus</italic> heart development. The expression of <italic>tbx2</italic>, a GATA4 target upregulated by cardiogenic conditions, was downregulated by MOs, and this led to reduced and deformed heart formation in majority of embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D</xref>). The role of <italic>prdm1</italic> as a target of GATA4-mediated downregulation was tested by mRNA-mediated overexpression, which caused morphological defects such as cardia bifida and linear heart tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3E</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>tbx2</italic> and <italic>prdm1</italic> are targets GATA4 in cardiogenesis and that their normal expression is required for early heart development in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>GATA4 is required for normal expression for <italic>PRDM1</italic> and <italic>TBX2</italic> during human iPSC-CM differentiation</title><p id="P19">We next sought to establish whether these findings are translatable to human development using iPSC-cardiomyocyte (iPSC-CM) differentiation to model human cardiomyogenesis. Firstly, the expression of <italic>GATA4, PRDM1</italic> and <italic>TBX2</italic> was examined during normal iPSC-CM differentiation. Consistent with previous studies <italic>GATA4</italic> expression is observed from the onset of differentiation with a noticeable increase in expression at day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), coincident with the establishment of the early cardiac progenitor (CP) pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Churko et al., 2018</xref>). Its expression rises throughout differentiation peaking approximately when beating becomes apparent (day 9-10 of differentiation). Expression of <italic>PRDM1</italic> peaks early at day 3 and decreases when <italic>GATA4</italic> expression initially peaks at day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Conversely <italic>TBX2</italic> expression becomes prominent only after the peak in <italic>GATA4</italic> expression. The expression patterns of these genes support the notion that the regulatory relationship between GATA4, <italic>PRDM1</italic>, and <italic>TBX2</italic> may be a conserved feature of cardiogenesis.</p><p id="P20">To establish whether the expression pattern of <italic>PRDM1</italic> and <italic>TBX2</italic> depends on GATA4, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing was used to inactivate <italic>GATA4</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Knockout of the protein was confirmed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3B</xref>). RNA-sequencing and RT-PCR was then used to examine the expression of the target genes in the GATA4 null line. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C-D</xref>, the expression of <italic>PRDM1</italic> and <italic>TBX2</italic> is disrupted in the absence of GATA4, with <italic>PRDM1</italic> expression being 2.1-fold higher than normal, and <italic>TBX2</italic> expression being 2.7-fold lower than normal. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that GATA4 regulates <italic>TBX2</italic> and <italic>PRDM1</italic> in cardiogenesis in humans as well as in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Additional DEGs identified in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> screen showed dysregulation in the GATA4 null iPSC-CMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H</xref>), suggesting that GATA4-regulated GRN has more extensive conservation besides TBX2 and PRDM1.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>GATA4 deficient iPS cells fail to form functional cardiomyocytes</title><p id="P21">The GATA4 null iPSC lines were differentiated using Wnt modulation protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Burridge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Lian et al., 2012</xref>) and were examined up to Day 32 of differentiation. No beating was observed in 12 independent differentiation experiments. Staining for TNNT2 by immunofluorescence was used to detect cardiomyocytes in iPSC-CM differentiation of WT and GATA4 null lines. On average there was a 4-8 fold decrease in the number of TNNT2 positive cells (TNNT2+) formed from GATA4 -/- iPSCs in comparison to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). In the few mutant cells that expressed TNNT2 the signal also appeared weaker. Mean fluorescence per cell was used to quantify this and the average signal in the GATA4-/- TNNT2+ cells was found to be 2.5 times lower than for WT TNNT2+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).

(<italic>lower panel</italic>) TBX2 mutant cells tended to exhibit more diastolic Ca<sup>++</sup> sparks than WT cells, although this was not statistically significant (P = 0.09; X<sup>2</sup> test) (M) The heatmap displays the normalised RNA-seq data for a selection of CP and CM differentiation markers, n = 2. (N) A selection of GO terms found to be upregulated in the TBX2<sup>c.700_761del</sup> mutant at day 10 of differentiation.
