Within pre-mRNAs, latent splice sites (LSSs) resemble proper splice sites but are usually not used because their activation can introduce in-frame STOP codons. The nuclear suppression of splicing (SOS) mechanism prevents the use of LSSs. Although the SOS mechanism is not fully understood, recent studies have identified initiator-tRNA and the NCL protein as key components. To discover additional regulators, we performed a genetic screen targeting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with an siRNA library and a luminescence reporter for latent splice site activation. This identified five RBPs — ALYREF (THOC4), PPIE, DDX41, DHX38, and HNRNPA2B1 — whose knockdown significantly increased LSS usage in the reporter. RNA-Seq analysis after knocking down each of these RBPs confirmed these results, showing widespread LSS activation in hundreds of mRNAs. Among these, we focused on ALYREF, a conserved protein involved in mRNA export and splicing. Using fPAR-CLIP, we found that U5 snRNA is ALYREF's main binding partner. Overexpressing ALYREF deletion mutants activated latent splicing, and affinity purification confirmed its interaction with U5 snRNA. These mutants exhibited different binding properties, highlighting the importance of specific structural elements within ALYREF in SOS regulation. Our findings reveal that nuclear RBPs play a key role in suppressing LSS activation and suggest that ALYREF has a novel role in maintaining splicing accuracy within the spliceosome, advancing our understanding of the SOS mechanism.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">In higher eukaryotes, the generation of correct mature messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts depends on the precise splicing of precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA). This process involves removing non-coding intronic sequences and assembling exons into the final mRNA product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Berget et al. 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Chow et al. 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Darnell 1978</xref>). Alternative splicing (AS) significantly increases mRNA and protein diversity by allowing for the selective inclusion or exclusion of exons. Despite its biological importance, many aspects of this complex and highly regulated process are still not well understood. A key step in this process is choosing the donor and acceptor splice sites (i.e., 5’SS and 3’SS), which define the boundaries of the intron to be removed. While the mechanism of single-intron transcript splicing has been extensively characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Konarska et al. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Papasaikas and Valcarcel 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Wachutka et al. 2019</xref>), many aspects of the regulation of AS still require elucidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Sperling 2017</xref>). Understanding these aspects will help explain how changes in AS influence processes such as apoptosis and cell proliferation, and how they contribute to numerous human diseases, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kelemen et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lee and Rio 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chabot and Shkreta 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Papasaikas and Valcarcel 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Accumulating evidence suggests the presence of a nuclear mechanism known as suppression of splicing (SOS), which regulates splice site selection to prevent the utilization of intronic splice sites that could introduce premature in-frame stop codons. This mechanism operates independently of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) and other degradation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Li et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Miriami et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Wachtel et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kamhi et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Nevo et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Arafat and Sperling 2022</xref>), and is confirmed by studies in nematode mutant strains lacking essential NMD genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Nevo et al. 2015</xref>). The significance of the SOS mechanism is highlighted by the presence of millions of 5’SS-like sequences within intronic regions that remain unused under normal growth conditions (latent splice sites, LSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Li et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Miriami et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kamhi et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Sperling and Sperling 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kamhi et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Nevo et al. 2012</xref>). Use of the overwhelming majority (&gt;98%) of LSSs as 5’SS would result in the incorporation of in-frame STOP codons into the mRNA, a deleterious process observed under cellular stress and in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Nevo et al. 2012</xref>). Although the exact mechanisms of SOS are not yet fully understood, critical roles have been identified for initiator-tRNA (ini-tRNA), which, apart from its cytoplasmic function in protein translation, is involved in base pairing with the AUG sequence in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kamhi et al. 2010</xref>). This interaction, likely occurring in a complex with auxiliary proteins, establishes a register for reading frame recognition by SOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Sperling and Sperling 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kamhi et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Sperling 2019</xref>). Recently, nucleolin (NCL) was identified as the first protein component associated with SOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Shefer et al. 2022</xref>) through: (<italic>i</italic>) NCL's direct and specific interaction with ini-tRNA in the nucleus, but not in the cytoplasm; (<italic>ii</italic>) its association with ini-tRNA and pre-mRNA in spliceosomal fractions; (<italic>iii</italic>) demonstrating that the recovery of suppression of latent splicing by ini-tRNA complementation is NCL dependent; and (<italic>iv</italic>) activation of hundreds of latent splice sites in coding transcripts upon NCL knockdown. We suspect that NCL operates together with other molecular components that still need to be identified to gain a complete understanding of the SOS mechanism.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we searched for protein components of the SOS mechanism by developing a luminescence-based reporter system, which monitors LSS activation. Using this reporter system, we screened a library of siRNAs targeting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to identify key players in this process. The screen identified five prominent candidates: ALYREF (also known as THOC4), PPIE, DDX41, DHX38, and hnRNPA2B1. All five candidate proteins are nuclear and have previously been implicated in splicing, either through direct interactions with the spliceosome or through functional roles in pre-mRNA processing. The evolutionarily conserved ALYREF is an abundant RBP and part of the TREX complex required for mRNA export. ALYREF is recruited to mRNA during splicing and becomes a core component of the exon junction complex (EJC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Masuda et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chi et al. 2013</xref>). Peptidylprolyl isomerase E (PPIE), a member of the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) family, contains an RNA-binding domain and was previously implicated in splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Thapar 2015</xref>). DEAD-box helicase 41 (DDX41) has been linked to the spliceosome through mass spectrometry analyses, and its mutations have been associated with myelodysplastic syndromes that are characterized by splicing factor mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Polprasert et al. 2015</xref>). DEAH-box helicase 38 (DHX38), an ATPase member of the DEAD/H box family of splicing factors, is essential for the catalytic step II in the pre-mRNA splicing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Zhou and Reed 1998</xref>). It appears to interact transiently with the spliceosome through its non-conserved N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Schwer and Guthrie 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang and Guthrie 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wang et al. 1998</xref>). Finally, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (HNRNPA2B1), part of the A/B subfamily of ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, associates with pre-mRNAs in the nucleus and plays a significant role in pre-mRNA processing, metabolism, and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Han et al. 2010</xref>). We further demonstrate by RNA-seq that the knockdown of each of these five splicing-associated factors results in the activation of hundreds of LSSs, introducing in-frame STOP codons and implicating these proteins in splice-site selection</p><p id="P6">We focused on studying ALYREF, due to its known interactions with the spliceosome and the export machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Masuda et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chi et al. 2013</xref>). We comprehensively identified ALYREF binding sites on its RNA targets with nucleotide resolution using fPAR-CLIP [fluorescent photoactivatable ribonucleoside enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Anastasakis et al. 2021</xref>)], revealing U5 snRNA as the primary partner of ALYREF. Affinity purification of nuclear complexes assembled with overexpressed wild-type (WT) ALYREF confirmed its binding to U5 snRNA. Furthermore, overexpression of ALYREF deletion mutants resulted in the activation of latent splicing, similar to the effects observed with ALYREF knockdown. ALYREF deletion mutants also showed differences in their binding to U5 snRNA and other spliceosome components, indicating the absence of elements essential for SOS regulation. In addition to nominating new components of the SOS, our study demonstrates a novel role for ALYREF in splice site selection and SOS through its binding to U5 snRNA, an important component of the spliceosome throughout all stages of the splicing reaction. More broadly, these results support a model in which networks of abundant nuclear RBPs suppress latent splicing events. The diversity of these RBPs likely ensures that the SOS mechanism operates robustly across variable sequence contexts, safeguarding transcriptome fidelity through cooperative surveillance.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>A reporter-based RNAi screen identifies RNA-binding proteins involved in SOS</title><p id="P7">RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are crucial regulators of AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kamhi et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kelemen et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Akerman et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Papasaikas and Valcarcel 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Fiszbein and Kornblihtt 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Sperling 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dvinge 2018</xref>), and we reasoned that they likely also play a role in mediating the SOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kamhi et al. 2010</xref>). To search for RBPs involved in SOS, we used a previously established siRNA library specifically focused on RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Jenal et al. 2012</xref>) and used it with a newly developed luminescence-based reporter system, named IRS1 (IRES-based Reporter for SOS #1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). This system is based on a minigene derived from the CAD gene (Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthetase 2, Aspartate Transcarbamylase, and Dihydroorotase). This minigene contains a latent 5' splice site (LSS) within its second intron, which is suppressed by SOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Li et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Wachtel et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kamhi et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kamhi et al. 2010</xref>). We cloned a Renilla luciferase gene downstream of the intron, directing its translation via the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Petersen et al. 2006</xref>). The design allows the Renilla luciferase sequence to be split between the 3' end of the latent exon (residues 1-40; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, bold green line) and the 5’ end of the downstream exon (residues 41-190; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, bold blue line). Note that disrupting the pseudoknot (PK) structure in this region inhibits IRES-mediated translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jan and Sarnow 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Schuler et al. 2006</xref>). The open reading frame (ORF) of the Renilla luciferase gene is positioned out of frame with the initial ATG start codon. Consequently, during normal splicing, Renilla expression remains minimal. Only latent splicing produces an intact CrPV IRES (residues 1-190; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, magenta heavy line), resulting in Renilla luciferase expression. Thus, latent splicing levels can then be quantified by quantifying Renilla luciferase activity and normalizing it to the activity of Firefly luciferase, which is expressed from an independent promoter and not influenced by Renilla luciferase levels. We generated three additional control constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The two positive controls, IRS2 and IRS3, carry point mutations that change the translation start codon from ATG to ACG and AAA, respectively, and activate latent splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kamhi et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kamhi et al. 2010</xref>). The third mutant, IRS6, served as a negative control and carries a CAG to GCA mutation at the 3’SS used for both authentic and latent splicing, thus inactivating both splicing events.</p><p id="P8">The four IRS constructs were individually transfected into HEK 293T cells, and 48 h post-transfection, the Renilla and Firefly luciferase output was measured. As expected, mutation of the start codon (both IRS2 and IRS3) resulted in a substantial increase in Renilla luciferase expression. As expected, a low Renilla signal was obtained with IRS1 under normal growth conditions, indicating minimal latent splicing, also seen in the negative control IRS6. Under heat shock, which suppresses SOS and activates latent splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Miriami et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Nevo et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Nevo et al. 2015</xref>), IRS1 showed a robust Renilla signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>), demonstrating its utility as a reporter for screening activators of latent splicing.</p><p id="P9">Using our reporter system, we calibrated and conducted a high-throughput genetic screen in human osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells to identify RBPs that suppress SOS and activate latent splicing (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Materials and Methods</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Cells grown in 384-well plates were transiently transfected with either the IRS1 or IRS6 plasmids, and RBPs were knocked down using a pool of four different siRNAs. After seventy-two hours, the cells were harvested, and we measured the Renilla to Firefly luciferase ratio. We calculated the average activation of latent splicing following RBP knockdowns by normalizing the luciferase signal from the IRS1 sample against the negative control (IRS6). Positive hits were identified only if the luciferase increase was observed in both replicates and was at least one standard deviation greater than the average signal from the entire microplate. This screening revealed ten RBPs whose knockdown led to the activation of latent splicing (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We validated the results of our high-throughput screening by measuring latent splice site activation in our reporters after knockdown of our ten identified hits with each individual siRNA from the initial pool of four. For validation, we required that at least two siRNAs activate latent splicing. This rescreen revealed six hits: RBP2, DHX38, THOC4, RBM27, PPIE, and DDX41 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Knockdown of negative control RBPs, UPF1 (RENT1) and ELAVL3, did not activate latent splicing, confirming our previous results that SOS is indeed not dependent on UPF1 and thus NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Wachtel et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Nevo et al. 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P11">In addition to the six hits from the screen, we also tested the effect of three heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) - HNRNPA1, HNRNPA2B1, and HNRNPC - on our reporter system as well as on the CAD minigene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Li et al. 2002</xref>), considering their well-established roles in splicing regulation and nuclear mRNA processing. Of these additional targets, only HNRNPA2B1 knockdown resulted in latent splice site activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), further highlighting the variability in function of the hnRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Geuens et al. 2016</xref>). RT-PCR after knockdown of DHX38 confirmed the expected increase in reporter mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Because of their well-established role in splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Schwer and Guthrie 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Masuda et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chi et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Polprasert et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Thapar 2015</xref>), we concentrated our follow-up efforts on characterizing ALYREF, PPIE, DHX38, DDX41, and HNRNPA2B1 as potential components of the SOS system.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Analyzing the impact of knockdown of potential SOS factors on latent splicing</title><p id="P12">We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of our five candidate genes in globally suppressing latent splicing. Therefore, we conducted RNA-Seq analysis following siRNA knockdown in HeLa cells. The changes in gene expression for each mRNA were calculated using DESeq2, confirming that the knocked-down five factors were expressed well below the controls (with one exception) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). To identify activated LSSs in the RNA-seq reads, we used the QoRTs tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hartley and Mullikin 2015</xref>) to quantify split reads, i.e., sequence reads spanning exon junctions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Across all samples, we identified over 94,000 unique active LSSs, each supported by at least one split read. This represents nearly 7% of our total of 1.34 million curated LSSs, and is consistent with our previous report that identified 70,000 LSSs upon NCL knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Shefer et al. 2022</xref>). When we increased the stringency of our criteria to require at least four split reads at every LSS, we still found over 5,000 LSSs activated by the knockdown of any of our five RBPs. Notably, LSSs supported by at least four split reads exhibited higher overlap rates than those supported by a single read (Jaccard index of ∼24% vs. ∼20%, respectively), consistent with higher probabilities of capturing transcripts expressed at higher levels.

Co-transfection of the CAD WT minigene with the ALYREF expression constructs showed that both deletion constructs activated latent splicing in the CAD minigene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>).

This includes splicing proteins having an RNA recognition motif (RRM), which bind to the pre-mRNA and the U snRNAs. Splicing also involves a number of DExD/H helicases essential for the dynamic changes during the splicing reaction that remodel the spliceosome, as well as for proofreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">De Bortoli et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Strittmatter et al. 2021</xref>).

Through a targeted siRNA screen directed against RBPs using a luminescence-based reporter platform, we identified ALYREF, PPIE, DHX38, and DDX41 as potential SOS factors. Future work with other reporters and screening conditions might identify more RBPs involved in SOS. Using the IRS vectors, we also identified hnRNPA2B1 as a potential SOS factor. In the screen, we could also confirm our previous observations that SOS is not dependent on NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Wachtel et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Nevo et al. 2015</xref>) by specific knockdown of UPF1.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>An automated approach for detecting activated LSSs using RNA-seq</title><p id="P23">As described previously, identifying activated latent splice sites (LSSs) from RNA-seq requires both detection of noncanonical splice junctions and interpretation of surrounding expression patterns. While our previous work incorporated manual curation to remove artifacts and ambiguous events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Shefer et al. 2022</xref>), the scale of the current dataset necessitated a reproducible, automated pipeline. We therefore developed a filtering strategy based on relative expression across exonized regions, which yielded slightly more conservative results than manual inspection but remained consistent in overall significance and LSS profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S4</xref>). Importantly, this approach allows robust comparison across knockdown conditions and can be applied to future perturbation studies. Although LSS activation, as defined here, has not been systematically assessed in other large-scale splicing datasets, related phenomena such as aberrant exonization, intron retention, and noncanonical junction use have been reported in various contexts. For example, ENCODE Consortium RBP knockdown experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Van Nostrand et al. 2020</xref>) identified widespread splicing changes, though activation of latent sites per se was not explicitly characterized. Rogalska et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Rogalska et al. 2024</xref>) showed that knockdown of core spliceosomal proteins in HeLa cells induces substantial alternative splicing changes, including novel exon usage and intron retention. Their work highlighted the regulatory potential of the core spliceosome itself, revealing distinct AS patterns tied to specific complexes and subcomplexes. However, these studies did not explicitly characterize latent splice sites or examine their suppression as a conserved regulatory mechanism. Our findings build on this foundation by identifying specific RBPs that act as SOS factors to repress LSS activation and by dissecting the domain-level requirements for spliceosomal engagement. These data provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how splicing fidelity is maintained and how its disruption leads to the widespread activation of latent junctions. Cross-study comparisons are challenging due to differences in cell lines, sequencing depth, and annotation frameworks, but our observation of ∼5,000 reproducibly activated LSSs aligns with reported ranges of misspliced junctions in response to splicing factor depletion e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Boutz et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dvinge 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Rogalska et al. 2024</xref>).

This is likely also caused by the use of only one case replicate here. In contrast, we had two in our previous study, which reduced the stochastic variability associated with quantifying rare transcripts through RNA-seq experiments. While this aspect has less impact in determining whether factor knockdown results in increased LSS activation, since all four values used in Fisher’s exact test are affected, it has a greater impact on which specific LSSs are identified as activated. As a result, direct interpretation of which LSSs are activated should be approached with caution and should ideally be performed only after further curation of these datasets. Nonetheless, it is remarkable that the analysis of activated LSSs detected in more than one sample reveals distinct patterns that separate samples with specific siRNA targets from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B,C</xref>), suggesting shared functional consequences of knocking down these five factors.</p><p id="P25">We also note here that the sequencing depth for our experiments (∼100 million reads) is only about half that of our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Shefer et al. 2022</xref>).

These results portray ALYREF, PPIE, DHX38, and hnRNPA2B1 as novel SOS factors. We further demonstrate by RNA-seq that knockdown of each of these five splicing-associated factors results in increased usage of alternative donor splice sites that introduce in-frame STOP codons, thus suggesting they are functionally involved in controlling the selection of splice sites. These findings implicate ALYREF, PPIE, DHX38, and hnRNPA2B1 as functionally important in suppressing aberrant splice site usage. Although each has previously been linked to RNA processing, our results newly demonstrate that knockdown increases usage of 5′ latent splice sites that introduce premature stop codons.

We now add ALYREF as an SOS factor through multiple binding targets within the supraspliceosome, including the pre-mRNA and mRNA, the CBC and EJC, but also through binding to U5 snRNA, a major spliceosome component placed at the heart of the spliceosome. We also identify a collection of RBPs newly implicated in SOS.</p><p id="P34">Further studies will be required to decipher the mechanism of SOS and determine the detailed role of the different factors involved. Namely, if SOS protein factors recognize specific sequence motifs on the pre-mRNA, or on the spliceosomal U snRNA, or some play a role through protein–protein interaction, or both, as the above speculative model predicts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S17"><title>Plasmids</title><p id="P35">CAD WT minigene construct (Syrian hamster CAD) was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Li et al. 2002</xref>). A luminescence-based reporter system IRS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Schuler et al. 2006</xref>) construct was prepared by cloning a luminescence-based reporter system based on a CAD minigene system that has been established and extensively studied in our group. It contains a latent 5’SS in its second intron, which has been repeatedly shown to be under SOS regulation. The reporter was constructed in the following manner: the first three exons and the two introns of the CAD minigene were used, and the first 40 nucleotides (1-40) of the cricket paralysis virus IRES (CrPVI) was inserted immediately upstream to the latent 5’SS in the second intron. The remaining sequence of CrPVI (nucleotides 41-190) was cloned immediately downstream of the 3’SS of the second intron, at the beginning of the third exon. This construct was cloned into the psiCHECK2 vector such that the Renilla luciferase gene would be expressed only when latent splicing has occurred to generate the full-length CrPVI IRES. This reporter construct was verified and its efficacy assessed ex-vivo by transfection experiments in which latent splicing was elicited by stress conditions and/or point mutations known to abrogate SOS. Two positive controls, IRS2 and IRS3, carry point mutations that change the translation start codon from ATG to ACG and AAA, respectively. Pre-mRNAs expressed from these mutants are expected to give a Renilla luciferase signal, because the mutations they carry have been previously shown to elicit latent splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kamhi et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kamhi et al. 2010</xref>). The third mutant, IRS6, which was used as a negative control, carries a CAG to GCA mutation at the 3’ splice site used for both authentic and latent splicing, thus inactivating both splicing events. The four reporter constructs were verified by DNA sequencing, and quantitative estimates of latent splicing were made using luminescence as described above.</p><p id="P36">Expression vectors of WT and deletion mutants of ALYREF WT, Δ130-150 and Δ195-240 (EX-H9330-M45; 130-150_EX-H9330-M45, and 195-240_EX-H9330-M45, respectively) cloned into the pReceiver-M45 Expression clone, having an HA tag, were purchased from GeneCopoeia.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Screen of a library of siRNA against RNA binding proteins</title><p id="P37">First, the four luminescence IRS vectors were analyzed in a 96-well microplate. Forty-eight hours post-transfection into HEK 293T, using the Dual Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Next, the luminescence vectors were used to screen a library of siRNA pools for the knockdown of 766 RNA binding proteins (RBDs) in human cells. Each pool of siRNA consists of a mix of 4 different potent on-target siRNAs arrayed in 384-well microplates, with each well containing reagents that are directed to only one gene. U2OS cells were transiently transfected by either IRS1 or IRS6, 24hr post-transfection cells were plated on a 384-well microplate that was prepared with a battery of siRNA targeting various RBDs. The plates were thereafter incubated for 72 hours, and the luciferase output was monitored using the Dual Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The screen was carried out in duplicate, and the average normalized luciferase reading from IRS1 and IRS6 was calculated. A final filtration step was carried out by dividing the IRS1 reading by the control IRS6. This step controls for any change in the Renilla luciferase output that is not derived from the eliciting of latent splicing, because the 3' SS in the IRS6 was mutated (see above). Genes were considered positive hits only when the luciferase increase was seen in the two screen repeats and the increase was (at least) more than one standard deviation above the average read of the entire microplate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). These hits were subsequently verified and validated by deconvolution, where the siRNA pool was deconvoluted and each individual siRNA from the pool was tested. Hit verification requires at least two distinct siRNAs against one gene showing increase in the luciferase reading output, avoiding any potential off-target effects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The IRS1, IRS6 vectors were also used for the analysis of the effect of downregulation of a number of hnRNPs, using a 96-well microplate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Knockdown of selected gene transcripts</title><p id="P38">HEK293 or HeLa cells were individually transfected with siRNA (the relevant ON-TARGETplus Human siRNA SMARTpool, Dharmacon) targeted to each of the following gene transcripts: hnRNPA2B1 (L-011690-01-0005), ALYREF (L-012078-00-0005), PPIE (L-009466-01), DHX38 (L-013428-00-0005) and a non-targeting siRNA as control (D-001810-01-05) (Dharmacon).

Using quantifications of split reads (i.e. junction reads) obtained with the QoRTs package, we computed junction usage relative to the canonical junction which contains the intronic sequence in which the junction of interest is located. We selected those junctions that exhibited an increase in relative usage of at least 50% between the case and control samples. Furthermore, for the junctions that passed this initial thresholding, we constructed expression profiles for the intronic regions exonized through the use of LSS or adSS3n junctions (i.e. exon extension) and evaluated them visually or automatically for consistency with expectations for exonized regions. Of note, in building expression profiles we eliminated reads mapping in the intronic region downstream from the LSS or adSS3n, in effect minimizing the impact of intronic transcriptional noise. The automated evaluation required that the “case” sample exhibited higher expression levels across 90% of the exon extension and 1.5-fold or higher expression level across 60% of the exon extension. This automated approach has the benefit that it eliminates human inconsistencies, but this is at the expense of not eliminating all false positives.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Evaluation of SOS status</title><p id="P44">As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Shefer et al. 2022</xref>), disturbance of the proper function of the SOS mechanism in specific samples can be inferred from an increase in the number of LSSs with elevated usage (i.e. activated). Here we applied the same method to evaluate the number of activated LSSs upon knockdown of specific factors. Specifically, we conducted a one-sided Fisher’s exact test (FET) with four quantities: LSSs activated in the “case” relative to “control” (i.e. activated), LSSs activated in “control” relative to “case” (i.e. de-activated), activated adSS<sub>3n</sub>, and de-activated adSS<sub>3n</sub> (adSS<sub>3n</sub> serve as proper controls since they do not lead to the inclusion of in-frame STOP codons). Visual evaluation of all expression profiles becomes prohibitive for this analysis due to the high number of junctions that pass the initial thresholding based on split read support of splice junctions, so we evaluated whether replacement of the visual with the automatic evaluation of profiles yields similar results. For this purpose, we conducted four comparisons (DDX41, DHX38, PPIE, THOC4 vs. AA4) where expression profiles were evaluated both visually and automatically as described above. In all four cases, the p-values associated with corresponding FETs were very similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S4</xref>), with the “automated” evaluation yielding only slightly higher values (i.e. more conservative). This is likely due to the inability of the automatic evaluation to eliminate as many false positive cases as in the case where profiles are evaluated visually.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Evaluation of activated LSS commonalities</title><p id="P45">To evaluate the significance of observed LSS activated upon knockdown of two separate factors, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations (ten thousand replicates) that allowed us to estimate the expected number of LSS activated in two separate samples.

reporter system.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> A schematic representation of the IRS reporter. The scheme depicts the cloned pre-mRNA where the sequence of the CrPV IRES is split between the latent exon (green) and the downstream exon (blue). The two possible 5' alternative splicing events are illustrated. When splicing occurs at the authentic 5’ splice site (left), no Renilla is expressed because its sequence is out of frame of the first AUG, and it cannot be expressed from the CrPV IRES as the transcript lacks the essential nucleotides from the 5’ end of that IRES. However, when latent splicing occurs (right), Renilla is expressed through an intact CrPV IRES (magenta). Large box-exon; small box-latent exon; colored lines - indicated split IRES sequences; ATG – initiation codon sequence; red octagon – in-frame stop codon. (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic drawings of the four Renilla constructs: IRS1, the reporter construct; IRS2 and IRS3, constructs in which the start codon sequence was mutated from ATG to ACG, or AAA, respectively; IRS6, in which the 3’ splice site was mutated. Expected Renilla expression (+) or lack of expression (-) from the IRS constructs is indicated on the right. <bold>(C)</bold> HEK 293T cells were transfected with each of the indicated plasmids. Forty-eight hr. post-transfection luminescence levels were measured from Renilla and Firefly luciferase (Promega Dual-Luciferase system). Levels of latent splicing are expressed as the ratio between the luminescence of Renilla luciferase to that from the Firefly luciferase. As expected, the Renilla luciferase levels increase significantly (p&lt;0.01) in cells transfected with IRS constructs having a mutation in the start codon (ATG-&gt;ACG, ATG-&gt;AAA; IRS2 and IRS3 respectively), as a consequence of latent splicing. Background levels are observed in the cases of IRS1 and IRS6.
