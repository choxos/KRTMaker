Here, we found that FMS-IgG binds to mast cells in a MRGPRX2/b2-dependent manner, leading to mast cell recruitment and IL-6 secretion. Transferring serum-IgG from FMS patients to mice induced FMS-like symptoms and increased skin mast cells, indicating that FMS-IgG acts through mast cell activation. The ablation of mice Mrgprb2 mast cells or deleting Mrgprb2 receptors prevented IgG-induced heightened sensitivity to mechanical and cold stimuli. Stimulating human LAD2 cells with FMS IgG elicited MRGPRX2-dependent IL-6 production. Consistent with mice findings, mast cell density and tryptase levels increased in human FMS skin samples compared to healthy controls. Taken together our results suggests that FMS IgG mediates hypersensitivity via activation of mast cells bearing the MRGPRX2 receptor and that these cells are a potential therapeutic target.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic condition characterised by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disruptions, and cognitive impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Individuals with severe forms of this disorder often struggle to maintain activities of daily living, leading to significant personal distress and substantial economic burden including for families and the economy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Despite the high prevalence of FMS, therapeutic options remain limited. While many patients may experience modest improvements with light exercise, recommended medication treatment with low-dose tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors is effective in only a minority of patients and often drug tolerance develops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This highlights the critical need for new, effective therapeutic strategies informed by a deeper understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of FMS. Recent evidence indicates that many patients with severe FMS harbour immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies that may be responsible for the core symptoms of the disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Purified serum IgG from FMS patients (FMS-IgG) injected into rodents induces profound mechanical and thermal hypersensitivities, reduced locomotion, and decreased grip strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Additionally, sensory nerve fibres, including C fibres and Aδ fibres, show increased responsiveness to mechanical stimuli, and the small nerve fibre density in the skin is reduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Notably, IgG from healthy controls (HC; HC-IgG) and FMS serum from which IgG has been depleted do not produce these effects. These findings meet the Witebsky-Rose criteria for autoimmunity, suggesting that mechanisms of FMS may be underpinned by IgG autoimmunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Increased binding of patient-derived IgG to satellite glial cells surrounding sensory nerve bodies in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) correlates with the pain intensity reported by FMS patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms through which IgG causes FMS symptoms have remained unclear. Better understanding could pave the way for therapeutic strategies that go beyond reducing serum immunoglobulin levels.</p><p id="P5">A growing area of interest in FMS research is the involvement of mast cells in pain modulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Mast cells, traditionally associated with allergic responses, are located near peripheral nerves and can influence pain sensitivity through the release of pro-inflammatory mediators such as histamine, cytokines (IL-6), and proteases (tryptase)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Certain genetic variants involved in mast cell signalling and degranulation have been suggested associated with FMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Prior research has demonstrated an increased density of skin mast cells in FMS, suggesting a potential link between mast cell activation and clinical symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">In both humans and rodents, specific receptors expressed on mast cells, such as MRGPRX2 (humans) and Mrgprb2 (rodents), play a crucial role in mast cell activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. These receptors, which respond to a broad range of ligands, trigger mast cell degranulation, releasing substances including cytokines (IL-6) and chemokines (CCL2) to amplify pain signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and promote further mast cell recruitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. IgG has not, been reported to directly bind to these receptors, however it can bind to Fc receptors (FcγRs) on mast cells. promoting degranulation with release of pro-inflammatory mediators such as histamine, cytokines (IL-6), and tryptase which can contribute to nociceptor sensitisation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. These processes cause hyperalgesia and allodynia, where painful stimuli are perceived as more painful, and normal stimuli are perceived as painful respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Antidromic release of substance P from already-hyperactive sensory fibres activates mast cells to drive the release of mediators and further sensitise these fibres, perpetuating the pain phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. We hypothesised that pro-algetic FMS IgG exerts its effect through activation of mast cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Administration of human FMS-IgG in mice induces pain-related behaviour</title><p id="P7">To explore the role of mast cells in the development of FMS-typical hypersensitivity to stimuli, we administered human FMS-IgG systemically to wild type (WT) mice and observed its effects on pain behaviour and mast cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Mechanical hypersensitivity was assessed using Von Frey filament test, a widely accepted method for quantifying pain sensitivity in response to mechanical stimuli. Mice were tested by applying calibrated filaments with forces 0.07 g and 0.4g to the plantar surface of both hind paws. Mice treated with FMS-IgG exhibited a significant decrease in paw withdrawal thresholds by Day 4 with each of three FMS preparations, indicating heightened mechanical sensitivity compared to mice treated with HC-IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1 B-C</xref>). We utilised the Cold Plantar Assay to evaluate cold allodynia, measuring paw withdrawal latencies in response to a cold stimulus applied to the plantar surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D</xref>). Mice treated with FMS-IgG demonstrated a significant decrease in paw withdrawal latencies compared to HC-IgG treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To assess the impact of FMS-IgG on neuronal activity, we performed in-vivo calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) imaging on L4 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in live Pirt-Cre GCaMP6 mice. This genetically modified model allows for real-time visualization of neuronal activity. The technique provides insights into the excitability of DRG neurons in response to various stimuli, helping to assess changes in sensory neuron activity, particularly in pain-related studies. For this experiment, a noxious, high intensity pinch and a dynamic, low intensity brush stimuli were applied. Following FMS-IgG administration, DRG neurons exhibited significantly higher calcium influx in FMS mice compared to HC-IgG-treated controls in response to either stimulus, indicating enhanced neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). These findings strongly indicate that passive treatment with IgG from FMS patients induces nociceptor activation compared to IgG from HC (HC-IgG).</p><p id="P9">An unexpected increase in faecal output and softer stool consistency was observed in mice treated with all three preparations of FMS-IgG, not reported previously; these changes are suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like bowel irregularities commonly reported by people with FMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F-G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Treatment with human FMS-IgG increases mast cell numbers in hind paws and back skin of wildtype mice</title><p id="P10">To investigate whether the mast cells skin density was increased, 14μm sections of the glabrous hind paw footpad were harvested from samples taken from all three FMS-IgG injected animal groups (n = 9 experiments/treatment) on day 4 and stained using immunofluorescence. There was a three-fold increase in Avidin positive mast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) after treatment with FMS-IgG relative to HC-IgG (p &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Significantly increased mast cell density at day 4 was also identified in 4μm wax preparations of non-glabrous dorsal mouse skin (n=1/treatment) assessed via brightfield microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>FMS-IgG has greater affinity for peritoneal mast cells relative to HC-IgG</title><p id="P11">To further investigate any systemic role of FMS-IgG on mast cells, peritoneal mast cells (PMCs) were collected on day 4 post-treatment and concentrated. Mast cells, human IgG and nuclei were stained using Immunofluorescence and Avidin-fluorescence and colocalised using ImageJ’s ‘colocalization finder’. PMCs treated with FMS-IgG exhibited increased surface-bound IgG compared to HC-IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P12">The findings of mast cell accumulation in skin and of increased systemic FMS-IgG binding to mast cells indicate potential cell activation and therefore highlight that these cells might have relevance for the development of the FMS-model phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Ablation of Mrgprb2-positive mast cells reduce hypersensitivity specifically in FMS-treated mice</title><p id="P13">To evaluate the impact of mast cell depletion on FMS-related pain behaviour, we again conducted behavioural tests using a von Frey filament assay to assess mechanical allodynia in mice treated with FMS-IgG. We utilised Cre-driven diphtheria toxin A (DTA) to selectively deplete Mrgprb2 (b2)-positive mast cells, specifically targeting all connective tissue mast cells, without affecting the circulating mucosal mast cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Mice treated with FMS-IgG following b2DTA-mediated mast cell depletion exhibited reduced (normalised) mechanical hypersensitivity by day 4 compared to wild type (WT) FMS-IgG-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). Cold allodynia was also markedly reduced in b2DTA FMS mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). The absence of mast cells had no impact on faecal matter production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>), or on stool consistency measured with the Bristol stool chart (not shown). These data suggest that connective tissue_mast cells are essential for the development of pain hypersensitivity in response to FMS-IgG, linking IgG induced mast cell activation directly to the pain symptoms in FMS. In contrast, IgG mediated abnormal stool production is not dependent on these cells.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The absence of mast cells does not prevent pain development in CRPS-IgG-treated mice following injury</title><p id="P14">In persistent c<underline>o</underline>mplex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), patients experience pain, allodynia, hyperalgesia, and persistent limb swelling long after the resolution of the inciting tissue injury. A CRPS IgG passive transfer-trauma model reproduces these features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The experimental procedure is shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Mice treated with human CRPS IgG, after small hind paw trauma developed unilateral hind paw hyperalgesia to both mechanical and cold stimuli and increased hind paw swelling as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 B-E</xref>); however, these mice did not exhibit any change in fecal output, unlike their FMS counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 F-G</xref>). To evaluate the impact of mast cell depletion on CRPS-related pain behaviour, we repeated these tests using Cre-driven diphtheria toxin A (DTA) to selectively deplete b2-positive mast cells. The selective depletion of Mrgprb2-expressing mast cells produced no reduction in either mechanical or cold allodynia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4D</xref>) contrasting the findings with FMS transfer. Notably, a slight reduction of paw swelling in mast cell depleted mice was identified, potentially indicating diminished CRPS-related neurogenic inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4 E</xref>). Mast cells do not appear to significantly influence the development or progression of CRPS-related hypersensitivities. These findings indicate a differential role of mast cells between CRPS and FMS.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Elimination of the mast cell receptor Mrgprb2 reduces hyperalgesia associated with FMS and normalises skin mast cell numbers</title><p id="P15">The Mrgprb2 receptor has previously been identified as a key player in the development and maintenance of several forms of inflammatory pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. The role of this receptor in FMS-IgG mediated behaviour and mast cell activation was investigated using Mrgprb2 knock-out (b2KO) mice. We conducted mechanical paw withdrawal and cold plantar assays to assess mechanical and thermal allodynia in FMS-IgG treated mice. FMS-IgG treated b2KO mice exhibited reduced (normalised) mechanical and cold allodynia and reduced mast cell recruitment by day 4 relative to wild type (WT) FMS-IgG treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-E</xref>). These results highlight an essential role of the Mrgprb2 receptor for IgG-mediated pain sensitisation in this model.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Quantification of FMS-IgG binding and activation of mast cell in the Presence or Absence of MRGPRX2</title><p id="P16">To investigate whether the activation of mast cells in the FMS-IgG transfer model may be caused by direct binding, we performed flow cytometry analysis on cultured human mast cells (LAD2), both WT and MRGPRX2-KO (KO) cells, after treatment with either FMS-IgG or HC-IgG. LAD2 mast cells incubated with FMS-IgG showed a higher proportion of IgG-positive cells (FcεRIα+ C-kit+) compared to those treated with HC-IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Notably, MRGPRX2 KO LAD2 cells demonstrated a significant reduction in FMS-IgG binding with all three tested FMS preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B-E</xref>). To understand whether IgG binding <italic>in vitro</italic> leads to mast cell activation, Elisa was performed to quantify secretion of IL-6, a proinflammatory cytokine released by mast cells which has previously been implicated in FMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The bind of FMS-IgG correlated with increased release of IL-6 in LAD2 wild-type (WT) compared to MRGPRX2-KO (knockout) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>). Overall, these findings suggest that IgG from FMS patients can activate MRGPRX2 receptors on mast cells to release IL-6, potentially contributing to a pro-nociceptive environment in FMS tissues. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this effect and the role of mast cell signalling pathways in FMS and other chronic pain conditions</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Mast cell density is increased in FMS patient skin compared to healthy volunteers</title><p id="P17">Group differences in mast cell measures between patients with FMS and healthy volunteers (HV) were identified. Both the density and the total percentage of mast cells in biopsies from the proximal thigh were substantially higher in FMS patients relative to HV (Mast Cell Density: median [IQR]: FMS = 107.1 [66.7–138] cells/mm<sup>2</sup>, HV = 46.4 [43.5–62.6] cells/mm<sup>2</sup>; p = 0.0006; Mast Cell Percentage: median [IQR]: FMS = 14.60% [9.1–18.6], HV = 9.3% [7.5–11.2]; p = 0.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). Over half the participants with FMS (n=10) had mast cell densities greater than three standard deviations above the mean HV threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7B</xref>). Correlation analyses were performed between cutaneous mast cell densities and patients’ phenotypic FMS parameters as documented by the SFNSL and PDQ. The patients’ skin mast cell densities showed significant correlations of mild to moderate strength with several of these parameters, whereas inverse correlations were rarely observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Anti-tryptase staining is enhanced in FMS skin relative to HV</title><p id="P18">The AA1 antibody used to stain for mast cells in human skin unexpectedly often also stained tissue around the mast cells.

These findings suggest that tryptase isoforms are elevated in FMS skin, likely released from mast cells, and may be an important biomarker in FMS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">Previous work has demonstrated that patients with severe fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) invariably harbour pathogenic serum IgG autoantibodies which, upon passive transfer to mice elicit core elements of the condition including mechanical and cold hypersensitivities, reduced grip strength and locomotion, and small skin fibre pathology. Increased FMS-IgG binding to satellite glia cells was demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. However, direct evidence relating to mechanisms through which pathogenic IgG exert their effects has been lacking. The present study provides compelling evidence that the pathogenic effect of FMS-IgG on mechanical and cold hypersensitivities is mediated by mast cells and that a crucial role is played by the MRGPRX2 receptor.</p><p id="P20">We first provided evidence from behavioural studies which validates previous findings on mechanical and cold hypersensitivities, both through reproduction and by demonstrating via <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of dorsal root ganglion cells that IgG-induced sensitisation of nociceptive afferents is reflected in increased responsiveness of neuronal DRG cell bodies <italic>in vivo</italic>. Increased skin mast cell density in FMS has historically been reported by two independent groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>; mast cell accumulation may indicate activation of these cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We hypothesised that pathogenic FMS-IgG may cause skin mast cell accumulation, and further, that mast cells may cause pertinent elements of the IgG transfer-induced FMS phenotype.</p><p id="P21">To investigate this, we first conducted immunofluorescence and immunochemistry experiments showing that mast cell numbers in the skin of FMS-IgG transfer mice are indeed significantly increased; our results are consistent with the historical results in patient skin and with our hypothesis. Increased mast cell density was identified in both glabrous and non-glabrous skin indicating widespread IgG effects. We next demonstrated increased binding of FMS-IgG to peritoneal mast cells <italic>in vivo</italic> suggesting that direct IgG binding may contribute to abnormal mast cell recruitment. When we subsequently probed the effect of connective tissue mast cell knock out using Mrgprb2DTA mice we found that the sensitising effects of FMS patient IgG are abrogated suggesting that mast cells are essential to their development. These changes were consistently observed after injection of preparations from each of three different FMS donors.</p><p id="P22">However, we also discovered that mast cell involvement is not ubiquitous in autoantibody mediated chronic pain. Complex Regional Pain Syndrome is a severe chronic limb pain condition typically triggered by tissue injury or trauma to a distal limb and associated with localised increased neuropeptide release and neuroinflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Clinically, CRPS is considered a ‘sister’ condition to Fibromyalgia, with both conditions categorised under the umbrella ‘primary chronic pain’ in the WHO ICD-11 classification system. These are conditions with pain as the primary clinical problem, rather than pain caused by other disease or tissue change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Prior research demonstrated that persistent CRPS may also be caused by pathogenic serum-IgG, but which become harmful only in the context of limb injury, a key difference from FMS-IgG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. We now show that the skin mast cell density is normal in this CRPS ‘passive-transfer-trauma model’, and the pain phenotype is unaffected by mast cell knockout. This is consistent with earlier, independent investigations indicating that the skin mast cell density in the affected skin of <italic>patients</italic> with <italic>persistent</italic> CRPS is normal, highlighting probable lack of abnormal activation, contrasting the findings in FMS skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Mast cells appear to be a key player in the pathogenesis of FMS, but not necessarily in other chronic pain conditions even when they are associated with neuroinflammation.</p><p id="P23">Activation of the MRGPRX2 or Mrgprb2 receptor on mast cells triggers a predominantly IgE-<italic>independent</italic> activation pathway, leading to degranulation. This pathway plays a key role in conditions where mast cell activation occurs unrelated to allergens. It results in the release of substances like histamine, proteases, cytokines (IL-6), and chemokines that contribute to inflammation and pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The release of substance P from peptidergic nociceptors has previously been demonstrated to result in the recruitment of mast cells, in addition to activating the MRGPRX2/b2 receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. With this in mind we probed the effect of selective Mrgprb2 knockout and found that the FMS phenotype was abrogated in Mrgprb2—FMS-IgG injected animals. The skin mast cell density was normalised, strongly suggesting that Mrgprb2 receptors are involved in mediating the pathogenic effects of FMS-IgG on mast cells.</p><p id="P24">The MRGPRX2/b2 receptor has not previously been identified as critical for mast cell activation in immune responses mediated by IgG, to our knowledge. Such mast cell activation might result from direct receptor binding or, alternatively the receptor may be part of a signalling pathway complex that facilitates downstream effects of FMS-IgG binding to other receptors like FcγRs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P25">Therefore, investigating any direct binding and activation of FMS-IgG autoantibodies to mast cells in an MRGPRX2-dependent manner was crucial for further clarification of the mechanism of its involvement in causing hypersensitivities. To investigate the role of the MRGPRX2/b2 receptor in IgG binding, we utilized the human LAD2 cell line. We found that wildtype LAD2 cells treated with FMS-IgG exhibited stronger IgG binding compared to those treated with HC-IgG. Furthermore, knocking out MRGPRX2 in LAD2 (X2-KO) cells reduced the IgG positive population. To understand whether IgG binding leads to activation of MRGPRX2 in mast cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, ELISA was performed to detect IL-6. An increase in IL-6 secretion in WT cells treated with IgG from FMS patients compared to X2-KO cells was observed. This supports the idea that MRGPRX2/b2 may play a role in mast cell-mediated IL-6 release in FMS patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that is crucial in the role of pain modulation and the regulation of immune cell activity, including mast cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Thus, the interplay between IL-6 and mast provides an explanation for the increase of mast cell observe in FMS patients and FMS treated mice.</p><p id="P26">Our findings demonstrate for the first time that connective tissue mast cells are a critical element facilitating FMS IgG transfer-mediated hypersensitivities to the core FMS phenotype elements of mechanical and cold stimuli. We further provide evidence that CTMCs are directly bound by FMS-IgG and that this process requires the presence of the Mrgprb2 receptor. The presence of MRGPRX2/b2 on cells also leads to raised secretion of IL-6, a key pro-inflammatory cytokine associated with autoimmune disease with potential for therapeutic options <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. One limitation to the interpretation of IgG-induced IL-6 secretion in LAD2 cell is that various other receptors like Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) can also cause release of IL-6. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that the MRGPRX2 receptor may function in coordination with other receptors. FcγRs have been linked to IgG binding in autoimmune diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Studies showing the synergistic interaction between MRGPRX2 and FcεRI via IL-33 suggest that FcγRs may also contribute to this mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">Having established an important role for mast cells upon FMS-IgG transfer, we have then forward translated our experimental findings by examining thigh skin of a UK cohort of FMS patients and controls. We were able to both confirm historical findings of strongly increased skin mast cell density in FMS skin for the first time in UK patients, and to provide preliminary evidence of a correlation with pertinent FMS disease parameters including pain intensity, pressure and temperature sensitivity, urinary- and GI-symptoms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). We further show, for the first time evidence for another mast cell activation marker in patient skin, increased intra- and extra-cellular tryptase.</p><p id="P28">Overall, our findings indicate that FMS-IgG has unique properties that promote the activation of connective tissue mast cells (CTMC), a process which requires the presence of the MRGPRX2 receptor. This activation may drive changes critical to the IgG transfer phenotype and potentially play a key role in the clinical manifestation of FMS. These results highlight the ability of FMS-IgG to differentially activate mast cells, leading to IL-6 release and potentially contributing to a pro-nociceptive tissue environment in FMS. The MRGPRX2 receptor appears to be a promising therapeutic target for FMS; blocking or modulating its function could potentially alleviate symptoms experienced by patients suffering from FMS.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P29">This study was designed to investigate the mechanism by which FMS serum-IgG leads to pathogenic effects via the activation of connective tissue mast cells (CTMC) and the mast cell MRGPRX2/b2 receptor.

The median is represented on the centre line with the error bars indicating the inter-quartile range at 0.25 to 0.75. Participants with FMS had significantly increased cell densities and a higher positive percentage of mastocytes relative to HV. (B) Scatter plot of mast cell densities against total number of cells within tissue sections for participants with FMS and HV. About half of participants with FMS (n=11) had mast cell densities greater than three standard deviations above the mean HV threshold. The red dots represent participants with FMS whilst the blue dots represent HV participants. The red dashed line represents the 2 standard deviations (SD) threshold for HV while the blue dashed line represents the 3 SD threshold for HV. (C) Bar plots comparing Mast Cell Staining Intensity (Left), Pericellular Staining Intensity (Middle), and Background Staining (Right) between HV (left bars) and FMS (right bars) groups. Blue bars represent scores less than 2, while orange bars indicate scores of 2 or higher. (D) <italic>The grading of mast cell staining outcomes across four levels</italic> (0, +1, +2, +3), based on three key parameters: background staining, mast cell staining intensity, and pericellular space staining. These parameters are graded independently, allowing for different combinations across a single examined image. <italic>Grade 0:</italic> Minimal background staining, mast cell staining with the nuclei clearly visible, no pericellular staining. <italic>Grade +1:</italic> Minimal background staining, darker mast cell staining with the nuclei visible, and slight staining of the pericellular space. <italic>Grade +2:</italic> Noticeable background staining, intense mast cell staining, nuclei is obscured by chromogen, pronounced pericellular space staining. <italic>Grade +3:</italic> More prominent background, dark mast cell staining, increased, staining in the pericellular space. Statistical significance is indicated as follows: *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001.
