TrAEL-seq is a robust method for profiling DNA replication genome-wide that works in unsynchronised cells and does not require treatment with drugs or nucleotide analogues. Here, we provide an updated method for TrAEL-seq including multiplexing of up to 6 samples that dramatically improves sample quality and throughput, and we validate TrAEL-seq in multiple mammalian cell lines. The updated protocol is straightforward and robust yet provides excellent resolution comparable to OK-seq in mammalian cell samples. High resolution replication profiles can be obtained across large panels of samples and in dynamic systems, for example during the progressive onset of oncogene induced senescence. In addition to mapping zones where replication initiates and terminates, TrAEL-seq is sensitive to replication fork speed, revealing effects of both transcription and proximity to replication Initiation Zones on fork progression. Although forks move more slowly through transcribed regions, this does not have a significant impact on the broader dynamics of replication fork progression, which is dominated by rapid fork movement in long replication regions (&gt;1Mb). Short and long replication regions are not intrinsically different, and instead replication forks accelerate across the first ~1 Mb of travel such that forks progress faster in the middle of regions lying between widely spaced Initiation Zones. We propose that this is a natural consequence of fewer replication forks being active later in S phase when these distal regions are replicated and there being less competition for replication factors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">DNA replication is initiated by the firing of replication origins. Origins in budding yeast are exactly defined by specific DNA sequences but in mammalian cells are heterogeneously distributed and poorly defined with replication initiation events concentrated in, though not restricted to, large Initiation Zones of up to 150kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. The pattern of Initiation Zone usage varies between cell types, but is robust across multiple cells in a population, showing that Initiation Zone usage is specified even if individual initiation sites are not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Discovering the set of Initiation Zones used in any given cell-type is a substantial undertaking, and we therefore have little understanding of how active Initiation Zones are specified in different cells, or how variable Initiation Zone usage really is.</p><p id="P5">Replication initiation can be profiled genome-wide by isolation of replication intermediates (OK-seq, SNS-seq, Bubble-seq) though these methods involve significant biochemical purifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Flow sorting of precise S-phase fractions identifies early origins though spatial resolution is lower (Repli-seq)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], while nucleotide analogue incorporation reveals initiation events if cells are synchronised or long read single molecule sequencing applied (INI-seq, DNAscent) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. DNA end mapping methods also yield replication profiles: GLOE-seq, which detects all single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends can profile Okazaki fragments in a DNA ligase mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], while TrAEL-seq, which detects free single stranded DNA 3’ ends in double stranded DNA has a strong selectivity for leading strand ends and provides DNA replication maps even on unsynchronised wildtype cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Finally, since DNA polymerase usage differs between leading and lagging strands, replication profiles can be constructed using polymerase mutants that incorporate excessive ribonucleotides on one strand or the other (PU-seq) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. There is considerable discordance between these methods in the fine scale mapping of initiation events, but the general clustering events into Initiation Zones is widely reproduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]</p><p id="P6">DNA replication forks traverse large replication zones, often &gt;1 Mb in mammalian cells, with particularly large replication zones being prone to incomplete replication resulting in fragile site expression if fork progression is impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Replication fork speed is regulated to ensure complete, high fidelity replication, being increased in large replication zones where replication continues late in S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], but reduced under conditions of high oxidative damage or transcriptional load to minimise the hindrance to fork progression from obstacles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Although DNA fibre assays are widely used to measure replication fork processivity, these assays do not provide genomic information and therefore the effects of genome structure and localised obstacles cannot be determined. TrAEL-seq has great potential in this regard as it can detect the distribution of replication forks across the genome in both asynchronous and synchronised populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].</p><p id="P7">Impediments to DNA replication cause replication stress. Endogenous sources of replication stress include nucleotide depletion, unrepaired DNA lesions, misincorporated ribonucleotides, repetitive DNA sequences, secondary DNA structures and collisions with transcription units (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]). The mutagenicity of transcription-replication conflicts has been particularly studied and arises both from direct interactions between the replication and transcription machinery, and from the replication inhibitory effects of R-loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, exclusion of replication initiation from very large genes creates extended regions requiring contiguous replication; these are prone to under-replication and form fragile sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. However, such mutagenic interactions are necessarily rare, indeed mammalian cells regulate transcription to minimise such transcription-replication conflicts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], and it is not clear whether the transcriptional machinery routinely delays the passage of replication forks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].</p><p id="P8">DNA replication is the target of both classic and targeted chemotherapeutics, and although we have an excellent understanding of the biochemical impact of these treatments, revealing how replication fork processivity is affected and how this is affected by features such as chromatin structure and transcription units remains extremely challenging. We previously demonstrated the utility of TrAEL-seq in profiling DNA replication in unsynchronised steady state cell populations, and here we present a six-way multiplexing modification that dramatically improves quality and throughput while reducing cost. We validate TrAEL-seq in multiple human cell lines and show that TrAEL-seq reveals dynamic changes in replication fork processivity across the genome.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>Multiplexed TrAEL-seq in mammalian cells</title><p id="P9">The throughput of TrAEL-seq library synthesis can be increased by adding a 4 nucleotide inline barcode to the first TrAEL-seq adaptor allowing libraries to be pooled for processing after initial adaptor ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Although we previously multiplexed pairs of samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], the resulting barcode efficiencies were poor so we redesigned the adaptors and changed manufacturer, resulting in dramatically better barcode fidelity and minimal unassigned reads. Of 9 barcodes tested, 6 showed equivalent, high TrAEL-seq efficiency, providing similar read numbers when ligated competitively to a single sample of DLD-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S1A</xref>), and Replication Fork Directionality (RFD) profiles obtained through this 6-way multiplexing procedure were indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We rebuilt the TrAEL-seq bioinformatic pipeline to separate reads by inline barcode prior to mapping and introduced a new copy number-aware UMI deduplication step. We further added a quality control routine to ensure TrAEL-seq reads stem from DNA as in theory TrAEL-seq can also detect RNA; although we have observed no evidence of read contamination from abundant RNA species, TrAEL-seq may detect RNA that is complexed with DNA. TrAEL involves tailing of DNA 3’ ends with ATP following by adaptor ligation using an RNA ligase, and could therefore detect any nucleic acids terminating with a 3’ RNA nucleotide through terminal transferase-independent ligation of adaptor to such ends. DNA-derived reads have an invariant T at the first nucleotide from the A-tailing, whereas RNA-derived reads could start with any nucleotide, so by splitting reads into those which start with a T and those which don’t, unexpected sites of read accumulation can be assigned to DNA or RNA depending on representation in the no-T fraction. No-T reads constitute up to 5% of the mapped reads in some libraries, and although these largely follow the replication pattern, it is possible that other features such as nascent transcripts and R-loops contribute at some sites.</p><p id="P11">TrAEL-seq libraries generated using the refined multiplex protocol are generally of much higher quality and yield more unique reads than libraries generated using the original TrAEL-seq protocol, allowing high resolution analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1B</xref>). The improvement in quality was unexpected but is consistent and presumably stems from the re-designed adaptors as these form the only substantive difference in the updated protocol. Reproducibility and specificity are good as RFD plots generated from unsynchronised mammalian cell samples show very similar patterns of replication fork directionality and Initiation Zone s between biological replicates, but clear differences in Initiation Zone usage between lines as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1C</xref>). Replication profiles derived by TrAEL-seq also closely match those generated by OK-seq, as evident in a comparison of published TrAEL-seq and OK-seq data generated from activated mouse B cells in different laboratories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1D</xref>). Note that the directionality of replication forks measured by TrAEL-seq and OK-seq is the same as TrAEL-seq detects the 3’ end of the leading strand whereas OK-seq detects the 5’ end of Okazaki fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>].</p><p id="P12">Overall, the revised multiplexed TrAEL-seq protocol increases the quality, throughput and specificity of TrAEL-seq while maintaining the capability of the original method to assay complex systems without synchronisation, sorting, genetic modification or labelling. To aid in setting up the method, we provide a detailed protocol including solutions to common TrAEL-seq problems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental File 1</xref>).

Expression of HRAS<sup>G12V</sup> in human IMR90 fibroblasts initially causes hyper-replication (day 1), but this is unsustainable and proliferation soon declines (day 3), entirely ceasing by day 6 as cells enter senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. We acquired 4 replicate OIS time courses (time points at days 0, 1, 3 and 6), with individual libraries in each multiplexed replicate set showing expected differences in read count given the varying proliferation state of the cells over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>): TrAEL-seq reads increased dramatically from Day 0 to Day 1 but were very rare by Day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Pooling the replicate sets yielded high resolution RFD plots particularly at Day 1, with progressively decreasing resolution to Day 6 as expected since very few cells are replicating by this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>), but to our surprise we did not observe any change in Initiation Zone usage between Day 0 and Day 1 despite the dramatic increase in replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p id="P14">However, read count distribution across chromosomes was altered as hyper replication commenced. At Day 0, TrAEL-seq reads were evenly distributed, whereas at Day 1 reads were noticeably enriched at many early replicating regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). The strongest Initiation Zones are found in early replicating regions, and peaks of TrAEL-seq reads were often coincident with strong Initiation Zones at Day 1. To quantify this effect, we calculated the average read count in genomic regions as a function of distance from the nearest Initiation Zone, and observed in all four replicate sets that the normalised read count on Day 1 was greater within ~0.6Mb of Initiation Zones (p=0.005 by t test of AUCs) but relatively depleted at regions &gt;1Mb from Initiation Zones (p=0.049 by t test of AUCs), which are late replicating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). The strength of this effect was variable between biological replicates, but this is to be expected considering the dynamic changes in proliferation both before and after Day 1.</p><p id="P15">Multiplexed TrAEL-seq can therefore profile DNA replication in complex, dynamic systems to reveal both Initiation Zone usage and replication fork distribution. TrAEL-seq read density varies with replication state and is almost absent in non-proliferating Day 6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E,F</xref>), and furthermore TrAEL-seq read orientation is highly polarised around Initiation Zones at both Day 0 and Day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). Therefore, the vast majority of TrAEL-seq reads most likely arise from replication forks rather than noise or some other biological process, and although high levels of fork cleavage soon after initiation could give rise to an accumulation of polarised reads around Initiation Zones this is unlikely given the high proliferation rate of the IMR90 cells at Day 1. We therefore attribute this accumulation of TrAEL-seq reads around Initiation Zones to an uneven distribution of replication forks across the genome.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Variation in replication fork processivity over the human genome</title><p id="P16">As the change in TrAEL-seq read distribution occurred in response to an oncogenic stimulus, we examined datasets for other transformed lines and observed a read accumulation around Initiation Zones to a greater or lesser extent for all tested including DLD-1, IMR32, NCI-H23, HCT116 and KM-12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, this phenomenon is not unique to transformed cells or in fact to human cells as we also observed increased TrAEL-seq read density near Initiation Zones in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), in mouse embryonic stem cells and in activated mouse splenic B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Importantly, all of these samples derive from unsynchronised, unsorted cell populations assayed at steady state proliferation. Every part of the genome must replicate once per cell cycle, so in populations of unsynchronised cells the density of replication forks should be uniform across the genome as long as replisomes travel at a uniform speed. The fact that more replication forks are detected in some regions of the human genome indicates that replication forks spend longer replicating these regions than other regions of equivalent size. In other words, higher TrAEL-seq read density indicates a genomic region in which replication forks are either pausing more frequently or moving more slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Decreasing TrAEL-seq density with increasing distance from Initiation Zones therefore suggests that replication forks move faster in regions far from Initiation Zones that are replicated late in S phase, which has been independently observed using single molecule approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P18">To confirm by orthogonal methods that higher read counts around Initiation Zones are not a TrAEL-seq artefact, we first performed SSB-seq on DLD-1 cells, which should detect replication forks by extending and labelling both leading and lagging strand ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]: in accord with the TrAEL-seq data, SSB-seq reads are also biased towards Initiation Zones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2A</xref>). OK-seq is generally considered the gold standard replication fork profiling method, and we found that OK-seq reads in published B cell data are also biased towards Initiation Zones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2B</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. OK-seq detects Okazaki fragments rather than leading strand ends, but slower Okazaki fragment synthesis would cause Okazaki fragments to remain shorter than the 200bp size cutoff used in OK-seq for longer, and hence become over-represented compared to OK-seq reads from genomic regions in which synthesis is faster.</p><p id="P19">Many studies have suggested that interactions with the transcription machinery can impair fork processivity and, based on published DLD-1 PRO-seq data, we find that TrAEL-seq reads are enriched ~20% in the top 10% of highly expressed genes compared to surrounding sequence indicating that replication forks move more slowly through highly transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Reads lacking an initial T, which are predicted to be RNA-derived are slightly more enriched presumably through detection of nascent transcripts, but the contribution of these to the overall enrichment is &lt;10% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2C</xref>). Furthermore, an equivalent signal was observed when considering reads orientated forward or reverse to the direction of transcription, of which only the reverse reads could conceivably arise from detection of the nascent RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2D</xref>). The enrichment is more pronounced for co-directional than head-on interactions, and we saw no convincing evidence of an enrichment at the 3’ end of genes in the head-on interactions that would indicate frequent collisions or break formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2E</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Gene density is highest close to Initiation Zones in the human genome, so interactions with transcription may explain the difference in replication fork processivity around Initiation Zones. To investigate this, we generated a high resolution DLD-1 TrAEL-seq dataset by pooling technical replicates to obtain 49 million reads after deduplication, ~4x our normal sequencing depth (10-20 million after deduplication). We then repeated the analysis of TrAEL-seq read density versus distance from Initiation Zone, excluding regions that were in the top quartile for transcription based on PRO-seq read density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. This had almost no effect on the profile, so we further excluded probes overlapping the next two quartiles; importantly, even when only including regions in the bottom quartile for transcription (where transcription is essentially undetectable by PRO-seq) the TrAEL-seq read density profile was identical to the complete TrAEL-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, an equivalent analysis in hESC showed that exclusion of transcribed regions increased the average TrAEL-seq read enrichment around Initiation Zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>].</p><p id="P21">We conclude that the variation in replication fork speed with distance from Initiation Zone measured by TrAEL-seq and other methods cannot be caused by interactions with transcription.</p><p id="P22">This observation contrasts with a recent study reporting that treatment with the transcription inhibitor DRB accelerates replication fork speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Consistent with that finding, treatment of DLD-1 cells with DRB prevented the reduction in TrAEL-seq read density with distance from Initiation Zones, indicating that fork speed became uniform across the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, the over-representation of TrAEL-seq reads in highly expressed genes was unaffected except for a slight shift towards the transcriptional start site, which is to be expected given that DRB prevents RNA polymerase II moving from initiating to elongating mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). This short DRB treatment (2 hours) therefore has only a minimal effect on interactions between replication forks and transcription units detectable by TrAEL-seq, but a huge effect on replication fork progression. This contradiction is most easily resolved by considering that the effects of DRB on replication fork speed stem not from inhibition of transcription but from inhibition of a different kinase, for example casein kinase 2 is inhibited by DRB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>].</p><p id="P23">Overall, TrAEL-seq provides a wealth of information on replication fork dynamics with high sample throughput and low cost – the method involves no complicated procedures and has proved very reliable in our hands. Importantly, the capability of TrAEL-seq to analyse unsynchronised, unlabelled cell populations both minimises cell culture requirements and allows complex systems to be studied. Here we have leveraged large and varied datasets to assess the effect of transcription on replication forks during normal proliferation: we find that replication fork processivity increases in regions further from Initiation Zones that would be replicated later in S phase, and that transcription locally reduces replication fork processivity. However, these two observations are unconnected and the effect of distance from Initiation Zone (or time in S phase) on replication fork progression rate is not the result of interactions with transcription. It has long been known that replication fork speed is inversely proportional to the number of replication origins that fire, which can be attributed to limiting availability of replication factors (including but not limited to dNTPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>], and we suggest that replication fork speed increases during S phase simply because inter-origin distances are mostly small (&lt;1Mb) and therefore most forks terminate early in S-phase. Few replication forks traverse regions of &gt;1Mb, and as these regions far from replication Initiation Zones are replicated late in S phase when few other replication forks are active, competition for replication factors is low and the forks can proceed faster.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P24">Undifferentiated H9 hESCs were maintained on Vitronectin-coated plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A14700) in TeSR-E8 media (StemCell Technologies, 05990) and Essential 8 Medium (Gibco, A1517001) under 5% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37 °C.

This pipeline includes trimming of the poly(T) tail, separation of multiplexed sets, separation into T and no-T datasets, copy number aware UMI deduplication and mapping. For deduplication, high quality mapped reads (always unique) were deduplicated by mapped position and UMI, whereas for reads with mapping quality ≤ 20 only the UMI was used for deduplication but since an 8bp UMI only has 65k combinations (smaller than the library) the first 10 bases of the unique read sequence are added to the UMI before deduplication. Human and mouse libraries were mapped to GRCh38 and GRCm38 respectively. All S. cerevisiae yeast libraries were mapped to the R64-1-1 genome with the 2-micron plasmid assembly.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Data processing</title><p id="P49">Mapped BAM files were imported into Seqmonk (v1.48.2) and reads were trimmed down to 1 nucleotide at the 5’ end, representing the last nucleotide 5’ of the strand break. Quality filtering was set ≥20 for most analysis but this cutoff was removed for analysis of multi-copy regions. For read count comparisons within multiplexed sets, no normalisation was applied as the read count distribution within a multiplexed set should reflect the relative distribution of TrAEL-seq reads across the multiplexed samples. To compare across multiplexed sets, a total read count normalisation was applied to whole multiplexed sets, maintaining the relative distribution of read counts for samples within each multiplexed set.</p><p id="P50">RFD plots were calculated using the new SeqMonk strand bias quantitation option introduced for this purpose. Note that this option generates data from -100 to +100 which was scaled to -1 to +1 for plots for consistency with published RFD plots. Data was analysed in 20 kb windows spaced every 2 kb, split into positive and negative values and plotted on the same graph in different colours using GraphPadPrism.</p><p id="P51">Locations of Initiation Zones were determined using OKseqHMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. TrAEL-seq reads were then summed in 50 kb windows spaced every 50 kb for the relevant datasets, filtering regions with aberrant counts (e.g.: line-specific CNVs and peri-centromeres), and exported as Annotated Probe Reports. These were processed using the ‘read_distance_distribution2.R’ script (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/laurabiggins/TrAEL-seq">https://github.com/laurabiggins/TrAEL-seq</ext-link>) which calculates mean read count as a function of distance from the nearest of a set of defined features (in this case the centres of Initiation Zones), as well as the 96% confidence interval and the number of regions used for the calculation. Datasets were truncated at 3 Mb as very few regions of mammalian genomes are &gt;3 Mb from an Initiation Zone and therefore the confidence interval for these regions is very large.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary File 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS206434-supplement-Supplementary_File_1.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" id="d93aAcDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS206434-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d93aAcDcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S16"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>TrAEL-seq library sequencing and processing were performed by the Genomics (Geno06) and Bioinformatics (Bioinf01) teams at the Babraham Institute, which receive financial support from the Institute Core Capability Grant (BBSRC CCG).

TrAEL-seq for replication profiling in complex systems</title><p>A: Schematic of multiplexed TrAEL-seq – barcoded adaptors are incorporated early in protocol allowing samples to be pooled for processing. Multiple pools can be generated over a period of weeks then all processed into libraries together. B: Read counts from TrAEL-seq adaptors with 6 different indexes ligated competitively to one DNA sample of DLD-1 cells in a single reaction. Some barcodes affect ligation efficiency as the barcode is placed at the ligation junction, but these barcodes show equivalent ligation efficiencies. Error bars ± 1 S.D. n=4. C: Replication fork direction (RFD) plots of an example chromosomal region obtained from the competitive ligation experiment in B. RFD is calculated from read polarity as (R-F)/(R+F), such that positive values represent forks moving left-&gt;right and negative values represent forks moving right-&gt;left. Calculated in 20kb windows. D: Schematic of oncogene induced senescence timecourse in IMR90 with tetracyclin inducible HRASG12V. E: Number of reads obtained from TrAEL-seq libraries at each time point. Each replicate time course was multiplexed in a separate TrAEL-seq library, with indexes rotated to avoid index-specific effects. Error bars ± 1 S.D. n=4. F: Quantitative profiles of TrAEL-seq reads over an example chromosomal region at different timepoints leading to oncogene induced senescence. Reverse and Forward reads (which capture replication forks moving left-&gt;right and right-&gt;left respectively) are shown separately. Solid line shows mean signal, shaded band ± 1 S.D. n=4. G: RFD plots across the same example chromosome region shown in F, separated by oncogene induced senescence timepoint. Calculated in 10 kb windows spaced every 1 kb. H: Total TrAEL-seq read count across an example chromosomal region for Day 0 and Day 1 of oncogene induced senescence timecourse. Solid line shows mean signal, shaded band ± 1 S.D. n=4.

Each plot shows a different cell line, multiple lines indicate multiple biological replicates where available, solid line shows mean value, shaded band 95% confidence interval. B cell sample shows splenic B cells from C57BL/6 mice activated in culture. Read counts were summed in 50kb windows spaced every 50kb, with regions of altered copy number or aberrant read count removed. Distance was calculated from Initiation Zones determined using OKSeqHMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], and average read count determined in 100kb windows of distance from the centre of initation zones. Published datasets are from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>], note that IMR32 and NCI-H23 data were generated prior to the implementation of multiplexed TrAEL-seq, and are therefore derived from lower resolution datasets. B: Schematic showing how TrAEL-seq read density variations arise from variations in replication fork speed averaged across a population. C: Metaplot of TrAEL-seq read count in DLD-1 cells averaged across genes ±100 kb. Genes are stratified for transcriptional activity based on PRO-seq into 0-40%, 40-70%, 70-90% and 90-100% categories. D: Plots of total TrAEL-seq read count at increasing distance from replication Initiation Zones, stratified for nascent transcription level by PRO-seq. Analysis was performed as in A, but the genomic windows included were filtered to remove the top 25%, 50% or 75% of regions based on PRO-seq read count. E: Total TrAEL-seq read count at increasing distance from replication Initiation Zones in untreated DLD-1 cells or cells treated for 2 hours with 100 μM DRB. F: Metaplot of TrAEL-seq read count in DLD-1 cells ± DRB (datasets as in E), averaged across genes ±100 kb as in C.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206434-f002"/></fig></floats-group></article>
