These include severe forms of epilepsy with onset in infancy, including epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS) and later onset focal epilepsies, including sleep related hypermotor epilepsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> The KCNT1 potassium channel subunit is expressed widely in the central nervous system and is activated primarily by intracellular sodium and weakly by depolarization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> <italic>KCNT1</italic> mutations are dominantly-acting heterozygous missense changes in the KCNT1 potassium channel subunit and result in increased channel activity. Accumulating evidence indicates that reduced excitability of inhibitory neurons may be involved in hyperexcitability and seizures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup></p><p id="P6">Since the molecular basis of <italic>KCNT1</italic>-associated disorders involves increased KCNT1 channel activity in the central nervous system, its suppression is the basis of stratified therapeutic approaches. Until recently, the only pharmacological agents known to inhibit KCNT1 channels were the non-selective cation channel inhibitors quinidine, bepridil, and clofilium,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> each of which have potent effects on the cardiac action potential. Quinidine, which remains in clinical use as a class 1a antiarrhythmic, has been assessed in <italic>KCNT1</italic>-associated disorders, but dosing is limited by its inhibition of cardiac ion channels and dangerous effects on the heartbeat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> Because of this, attempts have been made to identify novel KCNT1 inhibitors that are more potent and selective over other ion channels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> Although they are yet to reach clinical use, the efficacy of KCNT1 inhibitors in suppressing electrical activity in mouse models of epilepsy is particularly encouraging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> Clinically, there have been case reports of KCNT1 epilepsy patients whose seizures have been reduced with the antitussive drugs tipepidine and dextromethorphan,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> the former of which has since been found to inhibit KCNT1 channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and by fluoxetine, which in addition to several other ion channels has now been found to inhibit KCNT1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Drug repurposing is the identification of new uses for existing medicines and is particularly attractive for rare genetic disorders as it is associated with significantly lower developmental costs and expedited route to clinical use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> Known drugs that are being assessed for new indications have substantial clinical data, including their safety profile. We therefore hypothesized that existing drugs could be identified that have previously unknown KCNT1 channel inhibition as an off-target effect and that computational techniques could assist their identification. We have previously utilized virtual high throughput screening to identify compounds predicted to occupy the pore in the structure of the chicken KCNT1 channel, generated using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> Since this approach successfully identified novel inhibitors of the human KCNT1 channel,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> we aimed to replicate this using a compound library containing known drugs. Here, we describe KCNT1 inhibition as a novel property of four drugs and demonstrate their efficacy with <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> model systems. In both cellular and <italic>Drosophila</italic> models, we have used several common mutations found in patients with <italic>KCNT1</italic> epilepsy, involving different functional domains of the channel.

To generate human KCNT1 concatemers, plasmids termed donor and recipient were generated from the pcDNA6-KCNT1 construct used previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and empty pcDNA6 V5/His6 vector (Invitrogen) using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloning techniques. The insert of the donor construct comprised the KCNT1 coding sequence that lacked a start codon and preceded by bases encoding a GGGSGGGS linker. A second donor construct was generated by mutagenesis of this construct, replacing the linker sequence with “self-cleaving” T2A motif from the <italic>Thosea asigna</italic> virus (GSGEGRGSLLTCGDVEENPG),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> which exhibits efficient cleavage in CHO cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> The recipient construct was generated by deleting the stop codon and introducing a unique XhoI site. Sequences containing disease mutation Y796H were subcloned into these constructs from a plasmid used previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> All sequences generated by PCR were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Genewiz, Takeley, UK). Finally, the concatemeric construct was generated by subcloning the XhoI/AgeI fragment from the donor plasmid, containing the in-frame linker and complete subunit sequence into the same sites in the recipient plasmid. Recombination-deficient competent <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and 32°C incubation temperature were used for this step to reduce the frequency of deletions between identical sequences in the plasmid, which was confirmed by restriction analysis. For other experiments, constructs with WT, G288S, R398Q or R928C mutant forms of KCNT1 cDNA, tagged with YFP-6His in the pCMV-entry vectors, were created as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p id="P10">Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s Medium (ThermoFisher, UK) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 U/ml penicillin and 0.05 mg/ml streptomycin, and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere.

For excised inside-out recording of homomeric WT or mutant YFP-tagged KCNT1, HEK293T cells plated on glass cover slips were transfected using Attractene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and used 2-3 days later.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p id="P11">Whole cell recordings from transiently-transfected CHO cells were conducted at room temperature and analyzed as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> The pipette (intracellular) solution contained, in mM, 100 K-Gluconate, 30 KCl, 10 Na-Gluconate, 29 Glucose, 5 EGTA and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH and the bath (extracellular) solution contained, in mM, 140 NaCl, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 KCl, 29 Glucose, 10 HEPES and 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. For current-voltage and conductance-voltage analysis of the concatemeric constructs, cells were held at -80 mV and 400 ms pulses were applied to voltages between -100 and 80 mV. Conductance values (G) with each voltage pulse (V) were obtained by dividing the peak steady-state current by the driving force (command voltage minus the measured reversal potential).

After achieving inside-out configuration, the intracellular face of the membrane was constantly perfused with a solution containing, in mM, 35 NaCl, 110 KCl, 0.2 EGTA and 10 HEPES adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH. Drug stock solutions of 5-20 mM in DMSO were first diluted in ethanol (1:10) and then in electrophysiological solution. KCNT1 currents were recorded using two voltage protocols, depending on the number of active channels in the patch before drug application. Macroscopic currents (number of active channels &gt;15) were recorded in response to 100 ms voltage ramps between -120 and 120 mV applied every 2 s from a holding potential of -78 mV. The average current amplitudes between 0 and 40 mV were used for the analyses and constructing the concentration-response curves. With a lower number of active channels in the patch (3 – 15), current traces were recorded in response to 15 s voltage steps to -20, 0 and 20 mV from a holding potential of -78 mV. Currents recorded at each voltage and each drug concentration were averaged over the duration of the trace and normalized to the average amplitudes of the corresponding current traces in drug-free solution. The normalized data for all three voltage steps were then averaged for each drug concentration and used to build the concentration-response curves (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Fig. 3</xref>).

In rodents, different <italic>Kcnt1</italic> mRNA transcripts are generated from alternative transcription initiation sites, leading to variation in the amino terminus of the channel subunit and channels with altered activation kinetics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> We therefore reasoned that constraining the amino terminus of the second subunit in the concatemer may underlie this altered activity and the linker sequence was replaced by a T2A “self-cleaving” motif. Expression of this construct in CHO cells resulted in similar currents, but with activation kinetics more closely resembling WT channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The second subunit in this concatemer was then replaced with one harboring the Y796H mutation in the distal C-terminus and used for functional evaluation of drugs predicted to occupy the channel pore. Channels produced from this construct had activation half-maximal voltages intermediate of homomeric WT and Y796H KCNT1 channels. A summary of the activation kinetics of the monomeric and concatemeric channel currents is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Functional evaluation of drugs in inhibiting WT/Y796H KCNT1 channels</title><p id="P20">Using the WT/Y796H KCNT1 construct as a model for “heterozygous” <italic>KCNT1</italic> pathogenic variants, the drugs selected from the molecular docking were applied to transfected cells in patch clamp experiments. Four of the drugs, antrafenine, atorvastatin, nelfinavir mesylate and regorafenib inhibited WT/Y796H KCNT1 channels expressed in CHO cells when tested at 10 μM concentration. Concentration-inhibition analysis yielded mean ± SEM <italic>IC<sub>50</sub></italic> of 1.30 ± 0.2 μM (n=5) for antrafenine, 2.86 ± 0.30 μM (<italic>n</italic>=5) for nelfinavir mesylate, 7.54 ± 0.99 μM (n=6) for atorvastatin, and 10.30 ± 1.25 μM (<italic>n</italic>=6) for regorafenib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Candesartan cilexetil appeared less potent, and higher concentrations were not attempted as it appeared to require a range at least an order of magnitude higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). On the other hand, indinavir, dihydrotachysterol, liftegrast, and terconazole did not exhibit inhibition when tested at 10 μM concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>) and were not studied any further.</p><p id="P21">Similar to the inhibitors that we previously identified by virtual screening,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> these drugs were predicted to bind to the intracellular vestibule of the KCNT1 channel pore below the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Each are predicted to make hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with pore-lining amino acids, here provided as the equivalent amino acid and number in the human KCNT1 homolog. Antrafenine and atorvastatin are both predicted to make a hydrogen bonding interaction with the side chain of T314, which forms the intracellular-facing part of the selectivity filter, with atorvastatin making two additional hydrogen bonding interactions with the E347 side chain in the S6 segment. Nelfinavir and regorafenib are both predicted to hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of F312, with nelfinavir also interacting with the side chain of T314. Antrafenine contains two and regorafenib contains one terminal trifluoromethyl group. Similar to the predicted binding modes of BC12 and BC14,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> we found that these terminal groups occupy a cavity formed between adjacent S6 segments and the pore helix. Antrafenine spans the pore, with the two trifluoromethyl groups at the opposite ends of the molecule occupying the equivalent cavities formed by opposite subunits in the KCNT1 tetramer. Since carrying out this docking, structures of human KCNT1 in several states, including with an inhibitor bound were published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> With the exception of atorvastatin, there is good agreement in the docking scores of these drugs between the chicken and inhibitor-bound human KCNT1 structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), with close conservation of both sequence and structure in the pore domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Inhibition of single human KCNT1 channels by the four prioritized drugs</title><p id="P22">The four drugs antrafenine, nelfinavir mesylate, atorvastatin and regorafenib were further analyzed by investigating their effects on unitary WT and R928C, G288S and R398Q mutant KCNT1 channels expressed in HEK293T cells using the inside-out configuration of the patch clamp technique. The tight seal between the patch pipette and the cell was achieved in the control bath solution, after which the inside-out patch was excised and moved under the outlet of the gravity-fed perfusion system used to apply drugs to its intracellular face. Consistent with the prediction that they directly block the pore, antrafenine and nelfinavir were seen to inhibit over 60% of the activity of the WT human KCNT1 channel at concentrations of 50 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, B</xref>).

The outcomes from this approach are similar to those we obtained previously with a library of commercially available small molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> Since the four drugs have already been considered for therapeutic use, pharmacological and clinical data are available to inform whether they can be trailed for treating <italic>KCNT1</italic>-associated disorders. Using inside-out patch clamp recordings, antrafenine and nelfinavir were seen to inhibit 80 - 90% of the activity of the wild type and mutant human KCNT1 channels at 250 nM.

The four candidate drugs were fed to each of our three Drosophila models of KCNT1-epilepsy that contain three of the most common patient missense mutations, G288S, R398Q or R928C. Antrafenine and nelfinavir mesylate were found to significantly reduce the seizure phenotype in each <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant <italic>KCNT1</italic> line, while atorvastatin and regorafenib did not.

Atorvastatin (brand name Lipitor) is a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis, and is a statin used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia. Partial inhibition of hERG currents by atorvastatin at low micromolar concentrations have been reported and appear to affect hERG channel inactivation kinetics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> Regorafenib (brand name Stivarga) is an anticancer drug that targets receptor tyrosine kinases and is presently under clinical evaluation for treating brain tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> Antrafenine (brand name Stakane) has analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, but there is no record of its clinical availability or use since the mid-1980s.
