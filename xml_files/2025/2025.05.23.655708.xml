Murine infection with <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> results in the formation of granulomas around infected Kupffer cells in the liver and serves as a well-defined model of immune granuloma formation. The formation and resolution of granulomatous inflammation requires dynamic shifts in immune cell activation states, imposing significant metabolic demands. As mediators of energy homeostasis and cell signaling, lipids and lipid metabolism play a key role in regulating immune cell function during inflammation and the response to infection. However, the extent to which alterations in lipids are spatially linked to altered immune cell transcription has yet to be resolved. In this study, we performed a multimodal imaging analysis combining MALDI mass spectrometry, spatial and single cell transcriptomics, proteomics of flow-sorted macrophages and histopathology of <italic>L. donovani</italic> induced hepatic granulomas.

Surrounding a core of parasitized Kupffer cells other cell types accumulate, including CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and scant neutrophils under the influence of an evolving landscape of cytokine and chemokine expression. Within granulomas, the complex local cytokine environment in part dictates parasite survival or eliminationl<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, the latter leading over time to granuloma resolution (involution). The formation and resolution of granulomatous inflammation requires dynamic shifts in immune cell populations and functional states, imposing significant metabolic demands. Upon activation, immune cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to support increased energy utilization and biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. For example, inflammatory macrophages show increased glycolysis and decreases in TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, and increased lipid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.

Through an integrated analysis combining spatial transcriptomics, lipidomics, and proteomics, we report three major findings: First, LPCAT2 expression is upregulated in macrophages within granulomas and weakly correlates with parasite burden. Second, granulomas show distinct accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), the key substrates for LPCAT2, suggesting active phospholipid remodeling in these inflammatory microenvironments. Third, macrophages with high LPCAT2 expression display a pro-inflammatory phenotype characterized by their transcriptomic and proteomic signatures.</p><p id="P18">In our analysis, we define three main populations of monocytes and macrophages in the liver of infected mice.

In lung homeostasis, acyl chain remodeling of phosopholipids essential for pulmonary function occurs through LPCAT1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, and this pathway is enriched in lung disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. In liver homeostasis, LPCAT3 is important for lipid homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, and in our study was upregulated in infected mice in spots rich in hepatocytes. However, within immune granulomas LPCAT2 is highly expressed in both resident and recruited macrophages.

However, in the context of leishmaniasis, where LPCATs maintain a balance between the pro- (PAF-mediated) and anti-(prostaglandin-mediated) inflammatory activities, the outcome of LPCAT2 inhibition remains to be determined.</p><p id="P23">Our study has some limitations. One shortcoming is that whilst our spatial resolution is 55μm, spots have a centre-to-centre distance of 100μm resulting in voids where measurement does not occur. Similarly, some spots on the periphery of granulomas may include parenchymal cells. These issues are partly mitigated, however, by the sampling of large numbers of granulomas and their lack of a defined shape / compartmentalization. The marriage between single cell and spatial information is also largely probabilistic and not exact, but we have used orthogonal approaches to cross validate key findings. Finally, although we observed a weak but significant correlation between LPCAT2 expression and granuloma parasite load, it was not possible to definitively link intracellular parasitism with the changes observed. Although parasites were observed in some granulomas, thin tissue sections do not sample the entire granuloma volume and may underestimate parasite load. Given that parasites are largely found in embryonically derived Kupffer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> but we found that both ApoeHi_Kupffer cells and Lyz2Hi_MoMac regulate LPCAT2, it is likely that many of the signals governing macrophage activation state and LPCAT2 expression are cell-extrinsic and derived from other leucocytes in the granuloma microenvironment.</p><p id="P24">In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive map of the immunometabolic landscape within <italic>L. donovani-induced</italic> granulomas. The identification of LPCAT2 as a key player in the macrophage response during granulomatous inflammation brings forth new avenues for understanding and potentially modulating the immune response in leishmaniasis and possibly other granulomatous diseases.

Positive PASEF-DIA, nanoESI-MS and MS2 spectra were acquired using Compass HyStar software (version 6.2, Bruker). Instrument source settings were: capillary voltage, 1,500 V; dry gas, 3 l/minute; dry temperature; 180°C. Spectra were acquired between m/z 100-1,700. DIA windows were set to 25 Th width between m/z 400-1201 and a TIMS range of 1/K0 0.6-1.60 V.s/cm<sup>2</sup>. Collision energy was interpolated between 20 eV at 0.65 V.s/cm2 to 59 eV at 1.6V.s/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="P42">LC-MS data, in Bruker .d format, was processed using DIA-NN (1.8.2.27) software and searched against and in-silico predicted spectral library, derived from the mouse subset of UniProt appended with common proteomic contaminants. Search criteria were set to maintain a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. High-precision quant-UMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> was used for extraction of quantitative values within DIA-NN. Peptide-centric output in. tsv format, was pivoted to protein-centric summaries using KNIME 5.1.2 and data filtered to require protein q-values &lt; 0.01 and a minimum of two peptides per accepted protein. Calculation of log2 fold difference and differential abundance testing was performed using limma via FragPipe-Analyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Sample minimum imputation was applied and the Hochberg and Benjamini approach was used for multiple test correction.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Statistical assumptions</title><p id="P43">Data were analyzed with standard exploratory techniques as described under the sections <italic>Single-cell RNA data pre-processing, Spatial Data Analysis, FACS Sorted Proteomics</italic> and formal testing for statistical assumptions was not performed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Table</label><media xlink:href="EMS206031-supplement-Supplemental_Table.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d83aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS206031-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d83aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the help of Dr Karen Hogg and Dr Karen Hodgkinson at the University of York’s Bioscience Technology Facility I&amp;C lab and that of Dr. Angelo Lopez and Dr. Chloё Baldreki within the University of York’s Bioscience Technology Facility MAP-lab, for assistance with proteomic sample processing and LC-MS/MS data acquisition.
