As G protein signaling was originally believed to strictly occur at the plasma membrane, it has been assumed that US28’s constitutive Gα<sub>q/11</sub> signaling is mediated by a minor population at the plasma membrane. However, accumulating evidence shows that some GPCRs activate G proteins from intracellular organelles, such as endosomes. Importantly, endosomal rather than plasma membrane G protein signaling has been associated with transcriptional activity. Here, we demonstrate that the endosomal US28 population robustly activates Gα<sub>q/11</sub>, and thus, provides the major contribution of Gα<sub>q/11</sub> signaling. Surprisingly, US28 signaling at the plasma membrane rather than from endosomes primarily drives upregulation of gene expression involved in cell proliferation and inflammatory responses that are associated with glioblastoma and cancer. Our findings highlight the crucial role of receptor signaling location in cellular responses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Viral infections are estimated to be the direct cause of approximately 10-15% of human cancers worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and common primary brain tumor found in adults. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has been detected in more than 84% of glioblastomatumors and HCMV seropositivity correlates with glioblastoma progression as well as decreased life expectancy in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. HCMV encodes four chemokine receptor homologues: UL33, UL78, US27 and US28<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Among these, US28, is the best characterized. This receptor displays robust constitutive activation of Gα<sub>q/11</sub>, which leads to cell proliferation, angiogenesis, inflammation, and metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Notably, the constitutive activity of US28 increases cell proliferation of the host cell by stimulating the production and secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and by enhancing sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) signaling, which both contribute to the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. An important STAT3 target gene that is upregulated in glioblastoma cells by US28/Gα<sub>q/11</sub> activity is <italic>CCND1</italic> encoding cyclin D1, a protein involved in the G<sub>1</sub> to S phase transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">An interesting particularity of this receptor is its constitutive internalization via endocytic vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. This constitutive internalization is due in part to agonist-independent phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal of US28 by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), subsequent recruitment of β-arrestins to the phosphorylated US28, and clathrin-dependent internalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. It has been estimated that ~20 percent of the total receptor population is expressed at the plasma membrane, while the vast majority (~80 percent) is located intracellularly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Despite its robust agonist-independent activity, US28 binds several CC-type chemokines and CX3CL1 (fractalkine) with high affinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. This property, combined with its constant internalization, result in chemokine scavenging by US28, which has been proposed as a strategy that HCMV-infected cells use to subvert and escape the host’s immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Like other chemokine receptors, US28 belongs to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Following the canonical model of GPCR signaling, extracellular agonist binds to the receptor at the plasma membrane, which leads to intracellular G protein engagement and activation. G protein activation initiates downstream signaling events that ultimately modulate cellular behavior. However, this initial signaling phase is short-lived. Recruitment of β-arrestins to the phosphorylated receptor uncouples it from G proteins and induces its internalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. These actions by β-arrestins were believed to terminate GPCR signaling. Therefore, for many years, GPCRs were thought to signal via G proteins exclusively at the plasma membrane. In line with this plasma membrane centric view of G protein signaling, it has been assumed that the constitutive Gα<sub>q/11</sub> signaling by US28 was mediated solely by the minor population of receptors at plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. However, the emergence of molecular tools to interrogate signaling events with a subcellular resolution provided several lines of evidence that certain GPCRs can continue to activate G proteins from endosomes after they have been internalized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Importantly, G protein signaling from endosomes by a specific receptor can initiate functionally distinct responses as compared to G protein signaling at plasma membrane by the same receptor, a concept that is termed ‘spatial bias’. One of the best characterized cellular responses that is regulated by endosomal GPCR signaling is gene transcription. Interestingly, US28 was recently reported to recruit sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), an enzyme that directly interacts with activated Gα<sub>q/11</sub> proteins, to early endosomes in a Gα<sub>q</sub>-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Sphingosine-1-phosphate, produced by SK1 at endosomes, activates signaling pathways that influence gene transcription, thus connecting GPCR endosomal signaling to transcriptional regulation. This observation suggests the possibility that US28 activates Gα<sub>q/11</sub> proteins from this intracellular compartment and regulates gene transcription.</p><p id="P5">G protein signaling from endosomes has been reported for several Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors such as parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (PTH1R)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, thyroid stimulated hormone receptor (TSHR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, vasopressin type 2 receptor (V<sub>2</sub>R)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, dopamine D1 receptor (D1R)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, glucose-dependent insulinotropic receptor (GIPR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. For several of these receptors, inhibition of their internalization strongly diminishes agonist-mediated gene transcription. Using β<sub>2</sub>AR as a model, it has been demonstrated that cAMP-mediated transcriptional responses emanate from the endosome-localized receptor pool rather than receptor signaling at the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The current explanation for this spatial bias is that cAMP produced at the plasma membrane is contained locally. This is because phosphodiesterases hydrolyze cAMP within a narrow radius<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, and therefore, cAMP never reaches the nuclear region when generated at the plasma membrane. In contrast, endosomes are located in close proximity to the nucleus and production of cAMP from these compartments triggers nuclear entry of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), where it phosphorylates cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), a pivotal transcription factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Similarly to Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors, numerous GPCRs have been reported to activate Gα<sub>q/11</sub> from endosomes, notably angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT<sub>1</sub>R)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, B2 bradykinin receptor (B2R)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, oxytocin receptor (OTR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, thromboxane receptor (TPR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 (M3R)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, neurokinin 1 receptor (NK<sub>1</sub>R)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, and protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR<sub>2</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Whilst important cellular responses have been associated with endosomal Gα<sub>q/11</sub> protein signaling, its role in regulating certain downstream responses and gene transcription in endogenous cellular systems is unclear. Moreover, as opposed to cAMP, the mechanisms underlying spatial regulation of the second messengers downstream of Gα<sub>q/11</sub> activation (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol) have not been extensively studied. For many of the Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled receptors, diacylglycerol has not yet been detected at endosomal membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, which complicates our understanding of the underlying signal transduction process that leads to cellular responses.</p><p id="P6">To characterize the subcellular localization of constitutively active US28 receptors and how gene transcription is potentially regulated in a spatially biased manner, we combined miniG protein (mG), nanobody technologies, mutagenesis, enhanced bystander bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (EbBRET), confocal microscopy, RNA sequencing, and physiological assays. Together, our data suggest that US28-mediated Gα<sub>q/11</sub> signaling takes place at different endosomal subcellular compartments and that the location of this signaling plays a key role in directing oncomodulatory responses in glioblastoma cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>US28 primarily activates Gα<sub>q</sub> from endosomes</title><p id="P7">To define the subcellular location of active US28, we expressed mG proteins in human malignant glioblastoma astrocytoma tumor-derived U251 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. mG proteins are engineered GTPase domains of Gα subunits, which were initially developed for structural studies of active state GPCRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. mG proteins are localized in the cytosol, but are recruited to active GPCRs at the cell surface or endomembranes in a stable manner upon receptor stimulation. Several mG variants have been designed to capture the receptor coupling specificity of the four Gα subunit families (Gα<sub>s</sub>, Gα<sub>i/o,</sub> Gα<sub>q/11</sub>, Gα<sub>12/13</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. To determine the subcellular location of active US28, we here used the mGsq_71 variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, a mGs chimera with the specificity determinants of Gα<sub>q</sub>, referred hereafter as mGq for simplicity. For maximal sensitivity and robustness, we measured mGq recruitment to the plasma membrane and early endosomes using an EbBRET approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. The energy acceptor (green fluorescent protein from <italic>Renilla reniformis</italic>; rGFP) was anchored at the plasma membrane or early endosomes by fusing its carboxy-terminus to the polybasic sequence and prenylation CAAX box of KRas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> (rGFP-CAAX) or Rab5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> (rGFP-Rab5), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). The energy donor, a highly luminescent mutant form of <italic>Renilla reniformis</italic> luciferase known as RlucII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> and referred hereafter as Rluc, was fused at its carboxy-terminal to mGq. Recruitment of mGq to rGFP-CAAX or rGFP-Rab5 increases the proximity between energy donor and acceptor, enabling resonance energy transfer from Rluc to rGFP, resulting in a rise in EbBRET values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). Our data show that increasing US28 expression in U251 cells causes a small but significant increase of EbBRET values when rGFP-CAAX is used as energy acceptor compared to equivalent increasing expression of the inactive mutant US28-R129<sup>3.50</sup>A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The US28-R129<sup>3.50</sup>A mutant contains a mutated DRY motif which disrupts US28’s constitutive G protein activation and is considered an inactive US28 version. The modest activation at the plasma membrane is in line with the small population of wild-type US28 expressed at plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In contrast, the increase of EbBRET was much higher for similar amounts of US28 expressed when rGFP-Rab5 was used as energy acceptor, suggesting that early endosomes are rich in active US28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). As mG proteins are highly engineered and differ significantly from natural full-length Gα subunits, we also monitored the presence of active endogenous Gα<sub>q/11</sub> at early endosomes. To do this, we expressed increasing amount of US28 using a previously developed EbBRET-based effector membrane translocation assay (EMTA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. This uses the sub-domain of p63RhoGEF, which selectively interacts with GTP-bound Gα<sub>q/11</sub>, fused at its carboxy-terminus to Rluc used as energy donor and rGFP-Rab5 as energy acceptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Increasing amount of US28, but not US28-R129<sup>3.50</sup>A, induced a gradual recruitment of p63RhoGEF to Rab5 depicted by the progressive increase in EbBRET values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). These results suggest that US28 robustly activates Gα<sub>q/11</sub> at early endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To further characterize the subcellular localization of US28 activity, we visualized U251 cells transfected with either a red fluorescent protein (RFP) fused to a plasma membrane (Lck<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>) or early endosome (EEA1; early endosome antigen 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>) marker along with Halo-tagged mGq (Halo-mGq) labeled with a cell permeable fluorescent HaloTag ligand using confocal microscopy. In addition to these markers, the cells were co-transfected with either US28, US28-R129<sup>3.50</sup>A or vector alone (mock). In mock and US28-R129<sup>3.50</sup>A transfected cells, mGq is homogenously distributed in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,f</xref>). In contrast, in presence of US28, mGq forms clusters in periphery of the nucleus depicting regions rich in receptors that couple to Gα<sub>q/11</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,f</xref>). For cells expressing US28 and RFP-Lck, low levels of colocalization of mGq with Lck were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Although low (~50%), the colocalization in presence of US28 was significantly higher than in cells expressing US28-R129<sup>3.50</sup>A or the vector alone (~30%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). These data are therefore in line with our EbBRET data suggesting the presence of a minor population of active US28 receptors at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In contrast, in cells expressing RFP-EEA1, ~70% of EEA1 colocalized with mGq in presence of US28, which was significantly higher than RFP-EEA1-expressing cells transfected with US28-R129<sup>3.50</sup>A or vector alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that several mGq clusters did not colocalize with EEA1, which indicates that active US28 receptors may also be present in other types of endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). To investigate the nature of these other endosomes, we monitored US28-mediated EbBRET between Rluc-mGq and rGFP-fused Rab7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, Rab4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> and Rab11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, which are markers of late, fast recycling and slow recycling endosomes respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). In agreement with our confocal microscopy observations, gradual increases of EbBRET signals were detected with all three energy acceptors when cells were transfected with increasing amounts of US28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). These data suggest that although early endosomes constitute a major site of active US28 receptors, late and recycling endosomes are also populated with active receptors.</p><p id="P9">To further validate that US28 receptors found at endosomes and plasma membrane are active, we took advantage of two inhibitory nanobodies targeting different regions of US28. The first nanobody (VUN100bv) is a high affinity bivalent nanobody that binds to the extracellular amino-terminal domain and loops of US28, and reduces US28-mediated constitutive accumulation of inositol phosphate and downstream signaling events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. The second high affinity nanobody (VUN103) binds to the second and third intracellular loops of US28 and displaces G protein. Thus, VUN103 inhibits constitutive US28-mediated accumulation of inositol phosphate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. We used purified VUN100bv as an extracellular ligand while VUN103 was expressed intracellularly as an ‘intrabody’ using plasmid DNA encoding VUN103. In whole-cell experiments, VUN100bv selectively inhibits the activity of the US28 population at the plasma membrane, since VUN100bv cannot cross the plasma membrane to access the intracellular receptors. In contrast, as an intrabody, VUN103 can access and inhibit both intracellular and plasma membrane receptor populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). We first measured the effect of VUN100bv on the population of active US28 receptors at the plasma membrane and early endosomes using our EbBRET-based mGq biosensors used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a and b</xref>, respectively. As sown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref>, VUN100bv effectively blocks US28 activity at the plasma membrane, but not at early endosomes. These findings are in line with the inability of this nanobody to reach endosomal compartments. In contrast, VUN103 successfully blocked US28 activity at both the plasma membrane and early endosomes, in line with its intracellular location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k</xref>). To confirm that the inability of VUN100bv to reduce the endosomal population of active US28 receptors was linked to the extracellular location of this nanobody, we permeabilized our cells and used confocal microscopy to visualize the location of active receptors. Pretreatment with VUN100bv did not affect the recruitment of mGq to endosomes, unless cells were permeabilized with saponin, which caused significant VUN100bv-dependent inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1l,m</xref>). In contrast, in US28-expressing U251 cells, transfection of VUN103 significantly decreased the presence of mGq clusters and their colocalization with early endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1l,m</xref>). Altogether, our data indicate that despite a small population of active US28 receptors at the plasma membrane, the dominant active US28 receptor pool is located at endosomes.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Mutation of the US28 carboxy-terminal phosphorylation sites relocates active receptors from endosomes to plasma membrane</title><p id="P10">To determine whether US28 activity at the plasma membrane and/or from endosomes regulates gene expression, we sought to shift the main pool of US28 from the endosomes to the plasma membrane.

In this configuration, the constitutive recruitment of β-arrestins to the receptors generates a BRET signal. Our BRET saturation curves confirm that US28 constitutively interacts with β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) as BRET values are higher with US28-Rluc than with Rluc alone (background BRET). In contrast, the BRET values with US28-PDCT-Rluc are undistinguishable from the BRET values obtained with Rluc alone, reflecting a loss of constitutive interaction with β-arrestins for US28-PDCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). To verify that this loss of interaction with β-arrestins translates to increased receptor expression at the plasma membrane and a corresponding reduction of receptors at endosomes, we measured EbBRET between Rluc-fused receptors and rGFP-CAAX or rGFP-Rab5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). At similar total expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), our results show a significant increase of US28-PDCT expression at the plasma membrane and a decrease at the early endosomes as compared to US28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We also verified that the ability of US28-PDCT to constitutively activate Gα<sub>q/11</sub> was not changed by the loss of receptor interaction with β-arrestins. This was confirmed by first measuring the gradual dissociation of Gα<sub>q</sub> from Gγ<sub>1</sub>, as an index of Gα<sub>q/11</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). As the constitutive activation monitored is proportional to the number of receptors present, increasing expression of US28 or US28-PDCT resulted in progressive decrease of BRET between Rluc-fused Gα<sub>q</sub> and GFP10-fused Gγ<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). As no statistical difference was detected between US28 and US28-PDCT for the same amount of receptors transfected, our results suggest an equivalent ability of US28-PDCT and US28 to constitutively activate Gα<sub>q/11</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). To further demonstrate that the loss of β-arrestin binding to US28-PDCT does not increase the constitutive activation of Gα<sub>q/11</sub>, we monitored the recruitment of mGq fused to GFP10 directly to US28-Rluc and/or US28-PDCT-Rluc by BRET in parental and CRISPR/Cas9-engineered β-arrestin 1/2-deficient HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). At similar levels of receptor expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), no difference in mGq recruitment to US28 and US28-PDCT was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Furthermore, the absence of β-arrestins in cells expressing US28 or US28-PDCT did not increase mGq recruitment to these receptors, suggesting that the loss of interaction between β-arrestins and US28-PDCT does not increase the constitutive activity of this receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). We also verified that the total constitutive production of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-3-phosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) resulting from the hydrolyzation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) by phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) activated downstream of Gα<sub>q/11</sub> were similar for US28 and US28-PDCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Our results indicate that at equivalent total expression of US28-Rluc and US28-PDCT-Rluc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.3</xref>), no statistical difference was detected between US28- and US28-PDCT-mediated production of DAG and inositol monophosphate (IP<sub>1</sub> – a metabolite of IP<sub>3</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>), in line with the similar ability of US28 and US28-PDCT to constitutively activate Gα<sub>q/11</sub>.</p><p id="P12">To verify that the US28-PDCT rescue of expression at the plasma membrane translates to a higher number of active receptors at the plasma membrane, we used the same confocal microscopy approach as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>.
