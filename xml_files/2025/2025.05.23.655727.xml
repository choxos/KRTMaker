Animal models are crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying disease initiation and progression, and offer to evaluate potential therapeutic treatments of such diseases. However, generating viable animal models by precisely recreating such mutations is facing multiple challenges: targeting essential genes with the available genome editing toolkits causes unwanted insertion and deletions or coding sequence changes that are often lethal for the genome edited organism. This makes creating, identifying and breeding hypomorphic alleles nearly impossible. Further, stable genetic lines can only be maintained in a heterozygous state, i.e. due to Mendelian genetics, only a quarter of the offspring will be homozygous and may develop the (rare disease) phenotype.</p><p id="P5">An alternative and more direct approach is the manipulation of protein abundance which allows to mimic hypomorphic conditions in a controlled manner. This is especially of importance for studying rare human diseases such as congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). This rare group of complex metabolic disorders is caused by disrupted glycosylation, a critical post-translational modification process. CDG patients usually harbor hypomorphic mutations which reduce the enzyme activity and compared to non-viable null mutations cause less severe but often systemic symptoms. The most prevalent form of CDG is caused by mutations in the <italic>Phosphomannomutase 2</italic> (<italic>PMM2</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Ng et al., 2024</xref>) encoding the enzyme that converts Mannose-6-phosphate to Mannose-1-phosphate, the initial step for all ER-based glycosylation (<italic>N</italic>-glycosylation, <italic>C</italic>- and <italic>O-</italic> mannosylation, GPI anchor biosynthesis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>). Most of the reported PMM2-CDG patients have a clearly reduced PMM2 enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Pajusalu et al., 2024</xref>). Various cell line models and studies including patient derived fibroblasts that carry hypomorphic <italic>PMM2</italic> mutations have helped to acquire the basic understanding of PMM2 activity on the cellular level. Available organismal models that are based on genetic PMM2 mutations either show a subset of patient phenotypes or suffer from early lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Chan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cline et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Himmelreich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Parkinson et al., 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Thiel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Zhong &amp; Lai, 2025</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In contrast, controlled reduction of PMM2 protein abundance would affect all treated specimens and will result in reduced net enzyme activity comparable to the hypomorphic conditions seen in patients. Progressive diseases like PMM2-CDG are characterized by an early onset of phenotypes which is challenging to study in mammals due to the intrauterine development of the embryo. We thus turned to the teleost fish medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>), a well-suited model for studying human diseases and related gene functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Doering et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Gücüm et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Hammouda et al., 2021</xref>), as the early embryogenesis can be thoroughly examined due to the extra-uterine development and transparency of the embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Wittbrodt et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p id="P7">As an alternative to recreating patient-specific alleles, controlled reduction of the PMM2 protein abundance can recreate patient conditions. An efficient method for acute and inducible reduction of PMM2 activity at the organismal level, targeted protein degradation using degron systems would provide the most direct approach.</p><p id="P8">Degron systems allow fast degradation of proteins-of-interest via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in a highly specific, inducible and reversible manner. The targeted inactivation of proteins can be achieved by the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system, an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in which the plant F-box protein TIR1 (transport inhibitor response 1) dimerizes with AID-tagged proteins in the presence of the plant hormone auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>). This dimerization recruits the tagged proteins to the endogenous Skp1–Cul1–F-box (SCF) E3 ligase complex and results in ubiquitination and degradation of the tagged protein. A drawback of the canonical TIR1 protein is its basal activity in the absence of auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Natsume et al., 2016</xref>). Improved degron systems differ between TIR1 F-box variants employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Nishimura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Yesbolatova et al., 2020</xref>). Another limiting factor for these approaches is the requirement of tagging the protein-of-interest with AID. To gain flexibility and foster targeted line generation with a visible selection readout, we used a deGradFP approach in which GFP-tagged proteins are recognized by a highly GFP-specific nanobody (vhhGFP4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Caussinus &amp; Affolter, 2016</xref>) fused to a minimized mAID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Daniel et al., 2018</xref>). Successful degradation is thus visible due to the loss of fluorescence linked to target protein depletion upon induction.</p><p id="P9">Thus, generation of a stable Pmm2-GFP fusion line in medaka not only allows for acute interference with a visual readout, but additionally provides a systemic expression analysis of Pmm2 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P10">Here we combined a specificity-improved auxin-inducible degron system (TIR1(F74G)) with a mAID-nanobody targeting GFP-tagged protein approach for the use in medaka. We generated and functionally validated an endogenously tagged Pmm2-GFP medaka line. Furthermore, we used a visible readout to demonstrate the efficacy of the combinatorial degron system by interfering with Pmm2-GFP levels and biochemically confirmed the reduced net enzyme activity of Pmm2 following induction of the degron system. We established a flexible system to manipulate Pmm2 levels and activity in a specific and efficient manner, providing a valuable tool for further studies on the role of Pmm2 in development.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="P11">For the application of degron systems in GFP-tagged lines, it is essential that the fluorophore does not interfer with the funcionality of the fused protein and that both poly-peptides remain stably bound. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to trigger the homology directed repair (HDR) mechanism inserting the coding sequence of a flexible linker and <italic>GFP</italic> at the C-terminus of the endogenous <italic>pmm2</italic> locus, yielding a seamless Pmm2-GFP fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). To increase single integration efficiency and enhance HDR, the PCR-donor sequence was protected with biotin at the 5’ end of each primer during amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Gutierrez-Triana et al., 2018</xref>). Following injections at the 1-cell stage, GFP fluorescence was used as a proxy for successful protein targeting. Offspring descending from positively screened embryos were validated by genotyping and raised. In the validated stable line we established, Pmm2-GFP expression was following the endogenous expression and was found ubiquitously and continuously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Homozygous animals exhibited normal growth, development, and fertility, indicating that the GFP-tag did not interfere with Pmm2 function. A PMM2-enzyme assay performed on wild-type and Pmm2-GFP homozygous offspring revealed comparable enzyme activity, with a mean specific activity of 0.093 U/mg for wild-type and 0.095 U/mg for Pmm2-GFP (n total = 93 of three independent replicates, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Korner et al., 1998</xref>)). Single copy integration of <italic>GFP</italic> into the <italic>pmm2</italic> locus was confirmed by PCR-genotyping and Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Sequencing of the <italic>pmm2</italic> cDNA reverse transcribed from mRNA isolated from the stable line confirmed the correct sequence and splicing of the transcript, resulting in a single open reading frame and seamless fusion of <italic>pmm2</italic> and <italic>GFP</italic> coding sequences in mature mRNA. This properly fused mRNA was transcribed and spliced from a modified genomic locus with a partial duplication of the left homology flank (LH) (i.e., the entire coding sequence of exon 8 (ENSORLE00000306983) and parts of the leading intron). The right homology flank (RH) of the donor was seamlessly integrated via HDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Western blot analysis further confirmed the Pmm2-GFP fusion protein as the sole product from the tagged locus, without additional individual Pmm2 or GFP proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><sec id="S3"><title>The TIR1/mAID-GFP-nanobody degron system is effective but harbors high basal activity in medaka</title><p id="P12">The combination of F-box protein OsTIR1 with nanobodies for degradation of GFP-fusion proteins in an auxin inducible manner was previously developed in human cell culture lines and applied in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Daniel et al., 2018</xref>). Here we attempted to target the endogenously tagged Pmm2-GFP with the vhhGFP4 nanobody to recruit it to Tir1 in an auxin inducible manner, thereby facilitating ubiquitination by the SCF complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). As the tolerated concentration of chemical effectors differs between organisms, an auxin (1-Naphthaleneacetic acid; NAA) toxicity test was first performed on wild-type medaka embryos. Embryos were subjected to a range of different NAA - concentrations and phenotypes were assessed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Embryos at high NAA concentrations (≥ 5 mM) displayed a wide range of developmental defects including blood clotting, edema around the heart or overall embryonic misdevelopment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). NAA incubations up to 0.5 mM did not lead to any scorable phenotypes.</p><p id="P13">To validate the functionality of the degron system in Pmm2-GFP medaka fish, the <italic>TIR1</italic> and <italic>mAID-nanobody</italic> mRNAs of the degron components were co-injected with <italic>mCherry</italic> mRNA as injection tracer into homozygous <italic>pmm2-GFP</italic> embryos at the 1-cell stage. A western blot analysis performed at stage 23 confirmed robust reduction of Pmm2-GFP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). To analyze the kinetics of Pmm2-GFP degradation, the batch of injected embryos was separated and incubated with auxin or kept in embryo rearing medium (ERM) at 6 hours post fertlization (hpf). GFP fluorescence was assesed continuously for 20 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). In uninjected <italic>pmm2-GFP</italic> controls (n = 7), green fluorescence was continuously visible with a slight decrease over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C-D</xref>, green curve). In the group induced with 50 <italic>μ</italic>M NAA (n = 25), the GFP expression quickly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C-D</xref>, orange curve; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Degradation of GFP signals also occurred in the yolk of degron-injected and homozygous <italic>pmm2-GFP</italic> individuals which highlights the acute degradation even of maternally provided Pmm2-GFP. Surprisingly, the GFP fluorescence in the degron-system injected but non-induced control group (n = 8) dropped as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C-D</xref>, blue curve; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>), indicating leakiness of the employed TIR1/mAID system in medaka, i.e. degradation in the absence of auxin.</p><p id="P14">Although reduction increased by incubation with NAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>), this confirmed that the degron system even without NAA induction harbors a strong basal degradation activity. Due to the leakiness, the TIR1/mAID system was not suitable for use as an acute knockdown application.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Efficient inducible Pmm2-GFP depletion by the improved TIR1(F74G)/mAID-GFP-nanobody degron system</title><p id="P15">To overcome leakiness of the TIR1 and mAID/GFP-nanobody degron system, we exchanged the TIR1 F-Box protein with a recently reported variant (F74G), mitigating basal degradation of mAID-tagged proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Yesbolatova et al., 2020</xref>). The F74G mutation enables the TIR1 protein to bind the auxin analog 5-phenyl-indole-3-acetic acid (5-Ph-IAA) instead of the canonical NAA. Since 5-Ph-IAA can be used at very low concentrations, it minimizes potential toxic effects of this compound. A toxicity screen with varying concentrations of 5-Ph-IAA indeed demonstrated normal embryonic development in medaka fish embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To test the specificity and efficiency of TIR1(F74G) to bind the mAID-GFP-nanobody in the presence of 5-Ph-IAA, degron components (<italic>TIR1(F74G)</italic> and <italic>mAID-GFP-nanobody</italic>) were injected as mRNA into 1-cell stage embryos of the homozygous <italic>pmm2-GFP</italic> line along with the injection tracer <italic>mCherry</italic>. The injected embryos were split into treated (5 <italic>μ</italic>M 5-Ph-IAA; n total = 65) and untreated (n total = 61) groups.</p><p id="P17">Green (Pmm2-GFP) fluorescence was acquired by time-lapse imaging over 26 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). In the uninjected <italic>pmm2-GFP</italic> control groups (n total = 15), green fluorescence was continuously visible with a slight decrease over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-C</xref>, green curve; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). In the degron injected but non-induced groups, the GFP fluorescence followed the same trend as the uninjected control, indicating no obvious basal degradation of the TIR1(F74G)/mAID-vhhGFP4 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-C</xref>, purple curve; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). An immediate decrease in GFP fluorescence was observed in the groups induced with 5 <italic>μ</italic>M 5-Ph-IAA, reaching a plateau about 20 hours post induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Based on fitted curve analysis, Pmm2-GFP was degraded with a half-life of approximately 6.9 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). Compared to degron injected and non-induced Pmm2-GFP control embryos (n total = 85 of three independent replicates), a biochemical Pmm2 enzyme activity assay at stage 23 confirmed the reduction of net Pmm2 activity to below 50 % in degron injected and induced (5 <italic>μ</italic>M 5-Ph-IAA) embryos (n total = 85 of three independent replicates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The combined use of TIR1(F74G) and mAID-GFP-nanobody thus allowed acute knockdown of proteins endogenously tagged with GFP in a developing medaka embryo. In the case of Pmm2-GFP, this system reduced the net enzyme activity of Pmm2 to pathologic levels reported from PMM2-CDG patients.</p><p id="P19">Taken together, we show that a mRNA-based systemic degron-induced knockdown setup offers temporal control of protein abundance immediately upon induction, reducing zygotic as well as maternal Pmm2-GFP in medaka. The kinetics of the system revealed fast depletion of Pmm2-GFP with a strong ubiquitous protein degradation and 6.9 hours half-life after induction at non-toxic concentration of 5-Ph-IAA. Especially in the context of disease modeling that aims for early developmental stages or rapid protein turnover, the system is well suited to model the reduction, severe impairment or loss of protein function associated with disease progression. This consequently allows acute modulation of effector enzymes to mimic pathologic levels reported from patients.</p><p id="P20">For Pmm2-GFP, this opens the possibility to generate a hypo-glycosylation environment at early stages of development, challenging to reach with classic genetic methods which rely on <italic>pmm2</italic> mutant alleles. Homozygous animals often cannot be raised to maturity due to their severe pathology. Heterozygous breeds in contrast are usually not haploinsufficient and enzyme levels exceed the phenotypic threshold. Offspring of heterozygous mothers in turn do not allow to study the early onset of CDG-phenotypes, as Pmm2 is maternally contributed, mitigating the early embryonic phenotype.</p><p id="P21">Comparing previous reports of different TIR1/AID systems and its genetic variants highlight that there is not a single solution generally applicable across different model systems and that TIR1/AID is frequently reported to show basal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Schiksnis et al., 2020</xref>). The system was improved by mutating the phenylalanine in position 74 in the TIR1 protein, resulting in different efficiency depending on the organism used (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Oryzias latipes, Schizosaccharomyces pombe)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Goldner et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Hills-Muckey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Kiyomitsu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). In yeast, a phenylalanine to alanine change is reported to be more effective compared to other mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Ogawa et al., 2023</xref>). In cell culture systems, comparable levels of protein degradation were observed for both F74A and G variants. However, F74A showed higher activity with IAA, preferring the usage of F74G variant in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Yesbolatova et al., 2020</xref>). Further, there is a clear improvement in using the TIR1-variant sensitive to auxin analogs (5-Ad-IAA; 5-Ph-IAA) versus the native plant hormone when it comes to toxicity effects of the amounts required for the induction of protein knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Nishimura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Yesbolatova et al., 2020</xref>). In the end it is advisable to test reported alternatives like the TIR1(F74G)/mAID-GFP-nanobody system as it may vary in basal activity or effectivity in the used species or cell system.</p><p id="P22">For developmentally relevant time windows requiring acute protein degradation, the mRNA-based approach provides many advantages. It gives immediate access to any endogenously GFP tagged target protein and at the same time it overcomes the need for universal, ubiquitous promoters active during early embryogenesis. The degradation efficiency can immediately be adjusted (by the amount of injected mRNA) to the levels of expression of the targeted protein of interest, a requirement that is hard to meet in fixed and stable transgenic settings. The system presented thus offers a fast and immediate approach for highly efficient acute protein degradation of developmentally relevant proteins and provides an important complementation to genetic targeted inactivation, in particular in settings with a strong maternal contribution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S6"><title>Fish maintenance</title><p id="P23">Medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) stocks were maintained (fish husbandry, permit number 35–9185.64/BH Wittbrodt) and experiments (permit number 35–9185.81/G-271/20 Wittbrodt) were performed in accordance with local animal welfare standards (Tierschutzgesetz §11, Abs. 1, Nr. 1) and European Union animal welfare guidelines (Bert et al., 2016).
