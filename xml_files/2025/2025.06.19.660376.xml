Maybe the most crucial and distinctive feature of mycobacteria is their unusual cell envelope. Unlike other bacteria, mycobacteria possess a complex cell envelope with an additional, unique outer membrane, the so called mycomembrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). This extremely hydrophobic membrane is characterized by the presence of long-chain mycolic acids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Most intriguingly, the mycolic acids of the inner leaflet are covalently linked to the key polysaccharide arabinogalactan, which in turn is linked to the peptidoglycan, collectively forming an enormous macro polymer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. This core structure of the cell wall is also referred to as the mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan (mAGP) complex. The outer leaflet of the mycomembrane is composed of various other lipids, including lipoglycans and mycolic acids linked to trehalose <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The two most abundant lipoglycans lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and its precursor lipomannan (LM) are synthesized at the plasma membrane and transported to the outer membrane and the capsule, where they can be exposed to the cell surface or released as lipid-free glycans by enzymatic cleavage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. LM and LAM are not only important for mycobacterial pathogenesis inside the host <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, but have also been suggested to play critical roles in bacterial physiology by modulating cell envelope integrity and regulating cell division <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Altogether, the complex mycobacterial cell wall does not only supply mechanical resistance but also protects the bacteria from harmful agents, such as antibiotics and effector molecules of the immune system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. To overcome this barrier and to fight Mtb it is crucial to understand the physiology of the cell envelope and its proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The highly organized and dynamic cell envelope needs to be build, maintained and controlled, which requires the function of many different enzymes and accessory proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. One group of proteins that could play a role in this process are the lipoproteins, which are inserted into the membrane with their lipid anchor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. They can be characterized by their N-terminal secretion signal peptide with the lipobox motif. The three enzymes Lgt, LspA and Lnt replace this signal sequence with a three fatty acid lipid anchor at a universally conserved cysteine residue within the lipobox <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Based on signal peptide sequence pattern searches, the genome of Mtb harbors 99 genes that could potentially code for lipoproteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Some of the mycobacterial lipoproteins are well characterized. For example, RpfB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, LpqW <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and LprG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> have vital roles in cell envelope biogenesis, whereas LpqH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and the mce1 associated LprK lipoprotein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> have been shown to be important virulence factors. However, the function of the majority of lipoproteins remains poorly understood. Further exploration is crucial for identifying additional lipoproteins with key roles in the functioning of the mycobacterial cell envelope or the interaction with the environment, including the human host. Identifying and understanding these lipoproteins could pave the way for novel antibiotic targets and advancements in vaccine development.</p><p id="P4">Here, we studied the 79 putative lipoproteins that are conserved between <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and the closely related model organism <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic>. Using the CRISPR1-Cas9 (Sth1Cas9) gene editing system for mycobacteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, we introduced frame shift mutations in all conserved lipoprotein-coding genes, targeting one gene at the time. We found two mutants, <italic>lpqZ</italic> and <italic>fecB</italic> that showed increased susceptibility to all tested antibiotics, pointing towards critical roles in cell envelope biogenesis. Using co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) followed by mass spectrometry (MS), we identified interacting partners of these two lipoproteins, indicating that they are key players in LAM and arabinogalactan synthesis, thus explaining the observed phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Construction of lipoprotein CRISPR/Cas9 frameshift mutants</title><p id="P5">Currently, the Mycobrowser database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/">https://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/</ext-link>), which serves as a genomic and proteomic resource for mycobacteria, lists 87 lipoproteins. In addition, through signal peptide sequence pattern searches conducted by Sutcliffe and Harrington (2004), we have compiled a list of 103 putative lipoproteins specific to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, 79 of which are conserved in <italic>M. marinum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We targeted these conserved genes in <italic>M. marinum</italic>, because it is a BSL-2 pathogen with similar pathogenesis as <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in its natural host, poikilothermic vertebrates. Its close relationship to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is reflected in its average amino acid identity of over 85% between orthologues, making it a useful model organism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. We utilized the <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus</italic> CRISPR1-Cas9 (Sth1Cas9) gene editing system for mycobacteria, which has demonstrated high precision, no off-target effects, and strong efficiency - consistently yielding non-functional genes in all tested frameshift mutants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Targeting the genes with specific gRNAs one by one allowed us to individually select and verify clones with out-of-frame mutations using PCR and Sanger sequencing of the respective amplicon. Successful disruption of the ORF was achieved for 74 of the targeted genes. Three genes (<italic>lprD, lppL and fecB</italic>) showed a strong, visible growth defect on 7H10 agar plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Additionally, <italic>mmar_2122</italic> and <italic>mmar_1840</italic> mutants showed slightly smaller colonies and the <italic>lprG</italic> mutant had a different colony morphology than the wild-type (WT) <italic>M. marinum</italic> strain, similar to the previously reported mutant in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">After multiple unsuccessful attempts to generate out-of-frame mutations in the five targeted lipoprotein genes <italic>lpqB, lpqW, lppW, lppX</italic> and <italic>subI</italic>, we decided to continue our research using a verified library of 74 lipoprotein mutants.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Identification of key players in the cell envelope in a pooled antibiotic susceptibility assay</title><p id="P7">To identify lipoproteins involved in the mycobacterial cell envelope biogenesis and function, we screened our library of mutant strains by assessing their susceptibility to antibiotics that either target the cell envelope itself or depend on its permeability for activity. To accomplish this in a high-throughput manner, we employed a pooled library approach. Since our library contains only a limited set of verified mutants, we expect to have minimized bottle-neck issues and no bias towards big ORFs like in Tn-based methods. We exposed our library to a range of antibiotic concentrations, selecting the plates where bacterial growth was still evident, though at a noticeable reduction. After DNA extraction and amplification of the gRNA locus, next generation sequencing was used to quantify the presence of mutants in each individual pool using the integrated pCRISPRxSth1Cas9-L5 as unique barcodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). As a control for mutants with a general growth defect we also compared read counts from the calibrated input pool and compared them to the read counts from the mixture of bacterial mutants grown on 7H10 plates without antibiotics. To assess antibiotic susceptibility, the read counts from the non-antibiotic plates were compared to read counts of plates containing the respective antibiotics. As observed earlier, the <italic>lprD, lppL</italic> and <italic>fecB</italic> mutant showed a strong general growth defect on 7H10 plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), confirming the validity of the approach. Interestingly, while antibiotic treatment did not further impair the growth of <italic>lprD</italic> and <italic>lppL</italic> mutants, the <italic>fecB</italic> mutant exhibited increased susceptibility across all antibiotics tested. This observed cross-sensitivity aligns with previous findings in a <italic>fecB</italic> mutant of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Apart from <italic>fecB</italic>, also the <italic>rpfB</italic>, <italic>mmar_2122, mmar_1840, lprG</italic>, and <italic>lpqZ</italic> mutants were strongly depleted after exposure to the antibiotics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>lprQ, lprD, lprC, lprB, lpqI</italic> and <italic>lppL</italic> mutants were significantly more resistant to augmentin than the wild-type. We confirmed the observations of our pooled screen by testing individual strains on agar plates containing different antibiotic dilutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">RpfB, LprG and LpqI are of known function and have been associated with roles that are crucial for cell envelope integrity, such as the resuscitation from the dormant state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, triacylglyceride and lipoarabinomannan transport <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and peptidoglycan recycling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, respectively. However, such a functional link with cell envelope integrity was not known for <italic>lpqZ</italic> and <italic>fecB</italic>. To explore possible functions of these genes, we first employed structural similarity searches using Foldseek. We found that both LpqZ and FecB have homology to periplasmic substrate binding proteins (SBPs), which are often linked to ABC transporters. LpqZ shares 23.7% amino acid identity with ProX (<italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). ProX is part of the ProXVWZ operon, which is suggested to be responsible for osmoregulation in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. On the other hand, FecB shares 20% identity with FecB of E.coli and 20.8% sequence identity with SirA of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Both <italic>E.coli</italic> FecB and SirA are involved in iron acquisition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, however, in mycobacteria, the role of FecB is more controversial. While one study suggests that FecB has heme- and mycobactin binding properties <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, Xu et al. showed that FecB is not required for iron acquisition in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. In contrast to <italic>proX</italic>, <italic>fecB</italic> (<italic>E.coli</italic>) and <italic>sirA</italic>, both <italic>lpqZ</italic> and <italic>fecB</italic> are not part of a gene cluster/operon coding for an ABC transporter and are therefore considered orphan genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. This could mean that they have evolved novel functions, e.g. in the organization of the mycobacterial cell envelope. We therefore focused on LpqZ and FecB for further functional investigation.</p><p id="P9">Expression of <italic>lpqZ</italic> and <italic>fecB</italic> under the control of the HSP60 promotor successfully restored antibiotic susceptibility in the respective mutant strains to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Previously, a <italic>fecB</italic> mutant has been demonstrated to exhibit increased cell wall permeability, potentially accounting for its increased susceptibility to antibiotics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. To test this, we assessed the permeability of the <italic>fecB</italic> and <italic>lpqZ</italic> mutants to ethidium bromide (EtBr). Both mutants displayed only a slightly elevated permeability compared to the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). While this observation supports a role in cell envelope organization, the modest increase in EtBr uptake suggests that changes in general permeability alone are unlikely to fully account for the pronounced antibiotic susceptibility. This implies that LpqZ and FecB might play more specific roles in the correct assembly, localization, or functionality of particular cell envelope components.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>LpqZ and FecB are interacting with arabinosyltransferases AftA and AftB, respectively</title><p id="P10">To elucidate the function of LpqZ and FecB, we aimed to identify their binding partner proteins by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) from n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM)- solubilized membrane proteins, followed by mass spectrometry (MS). Comparative analysis of LFQ intensities revealed that LpqZ was found to be enriched over 5000-fold in the purified LpqZ-HA samples as compared to the wild-type control. Notably, the most enriched co-precipitated protein with LpqZ was AftA (MMAR_5354), which exhibited a 20,000-fold enrichment relative to the wild-type samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). AftA of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> encodes an arabinosyltransferase (Rv3792), which is essential for <italic>in-vitro</italic> growth and responsible for the priming step of arabinogalactan synthesis by transferring the first arabinosyl residue to the galactan chain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">The structure of AftA has been determined by cryo-EM and shown to form a homodimer with two cavities that converge at the active site <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. We confirmed the putative interaction of the two proteins by co-immunoprecipitation from membrane fractions of cell lysates expressing LpqZ-HA and AftA-FLAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). HA-purified LpqZ-HA successfully co-purified AftA-FLAG in both its monomeric and homodimeric forms, which confirms the observations by Gong <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. AlphaFold predictions further suggested that both monomeric and dimeric AftA can bind LpqZ in a complex, with overall a slightly better model confidence for the monomeric (ipTM=0.892) than for the dimeric (ipTM= 0.839) state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). AlphaFold predictions of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> orthologs of LpqZ (Rv1244) and AftA (Rv3792) showed similar confident scores for a dimer (ipTM=0.873) and a trimer (ipTM=0.881) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), whereas a negative control of AftA:FecB showed a nonsignificant ipTM score of 0.41 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p id="P12">The MS analysis of proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with FecB-HA resulted in a 4000-fold enrichment of FecB itself, closely followed by AftB (MMAR_5369) and MMAR_1667 with over 3000-fold enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). The arabinosyltransferase AftB is, just like AftA, essential for <italic>in-vitro</italic> growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and is thought to be responsible for the terminal β(1 → 2) linkage of arabinosyl to both arabinogalactan <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> and lipoarabinomannan <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. MMAR_1667 has a <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> orthologue Rv3035 with unknown function. AlphaFold predictions suggested with high confidence (ipTM=0.894) that FecB, AftB and MMAR_1667 form a trimeric complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> orthologs FecB (Rv3044), AftB (Rv3805c) and Rv3035 showed confident scores (ipTM=0.864) for a trimeric complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), whereas the negative control of AftB:LpqZ showed a low confidence ipTM score of 0.312 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). However, our attempts to co-purify AftB-FLAG from FecB-HA expressing cell lysates were unsuccessful. This could be due to steric hindrance of the C-terminal tags, which are predicted to be close to the protein interaction sites in the center of the trimeric complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>). This is supported by our observation that expression of FecB-HA was not able to complement the antibiotic susceptibility phenotype of the <italic>fecB</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>), contrasting our earlier positive observations with the untagged protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). To address this technical issue, we decided to verify these interactions by repeating the co-IP with streptavidin-tagged MMAR_1667, followed by MS analysis. Given that the C-terminus of MMAR_1667 is located farther from the predicted interaction site with its partner proteins, we anticipated minimal interference from the tag. In confirmation with our previous findings, MMAR_1667 was enriched over 500-fold in our pulldowns, closely followed by FecB and AftB with 130-fold and 67-fold enrichment, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Next, we aimed to investigate the mutant phenotype of <italic>mmar_1667</italic> and compare it to those of its interaction partners.

The expression of <italic>mmar_1667</italic> under the control of an HSP60 promoter was able to complement the observed phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>).

We cannot make frameshift mutants in these essential genes, but reducing the amount of the essential partner proteins using CRISPRi could lead to synergistic growth defects. To assess this, we silenced the expression of <italic>aftA</italic> or <italic>aftB</italic> in the respective <italic>lpqZ</italic> or <italic>fecB</italic> mutant backgrounds. We selected ATc concentrations that allowed residual growth, as higher levels resulted in complete growth arrest. Under these conditions, silencing <italic>aftA</italic> or <italic>aftB</italic> in the mutant backgrounds led to a slightly stronger growth reduction compared to silencing these arabinosyltransferases in the wild-type background, or silencing an unrelated essential lipoprotein gene (<italic>lpqW</italic>) in the mutant backgrounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a,b</xref>). The observed synergistic effects in growth reduction in the mutants therefore indicate a supportive function of the lipoproteins in arabinogalactan synthesis.</p><p id="P15">To directly assess alterations in arabinogalactan biosynthesis in the mutant strains, we extracted and hydrolyzed arabinogalactan from bacterial cell envelopes and analyzed the monosaccharide composition using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC). The relative abundance of arabinose and galactose in these hydrolysates serves as a proxy for arabinogalactan structure, with changes in the arabinose-to-galactose (ara:gal) ratio indicating possible disruptions in biosynthetic pathways. Both <italic>fecB</italic> and <italic>lpqZ</italic> mutants exhibited a reduced ara:gal ratio compared to wild-type <italic>M. marinum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). This reduction suggests that both lipoproteins are involved in the incorporation or regulation of arabinose residues during arabinogalactan assembly.</p><p id="P16">The process of arabinogalactan synthesis and the enzymes involved, remains poorly understood. Among the key enzymes, AftA has been studied more extensively than AftB. AftA catalyzes the addition of the first arabinosyl residue to the galactan chain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. In <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, the active site of AftA contains two conserved catalytic residues, D128 and R132, as experimentally demonstrated by Gong <italic>et al</italic>. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. These residues are accessible for a putative decaprenyl-phosphoryl-arabinose (DPA) donor via a channel that leads to a binding cavity. Using molecular docking, Gong <italic>et al</italic>. proposed a possible acceptor binding site within the cavity by modeling the interaction of a synthetic eight-residue galactofuranosyl ligand. To test if this galactan chain can still bind the putative acceptor binding site in the presence of LpqZ, we performed docking experiments, following the approach of Gong <italic>et al</italic>. The HADDOCK software <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> predicted similar complex formations of AftA and LpqZ as AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). The results showed that the ligand remained capable of binding the pocket in close proximity to the conserved AftA (<italic>M. marinum</italic>) residues D108 and R112 in the presence of LpqZ. This suggests that, rather than preventing the binding of the galactan chain, LpqZ might play a positive regulatory role. These findings are consistent with our previous observations that LpqZ is required for proper arabinogalactan synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>FecB and LpqZ, together with AftB and AftA, are involved in linkage of arabinan chains of LAM</title><p id="P17">Additionally to its role in arabinogalactan synthesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, AftB is also responsible for the terminal β(1 → 2) linkage of an arabinosyl residue to LAM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. To test if the mutation in <italic>fecB</italic> has an effect on the terminal linkage of LAM, we compared the effect of <italic>aftB</italic> gene silencing using CRISPRi in the <italic>M. marinum</italic> wild-type strain and the <italic>fecB</italic> mutant. Previously, Jankute <italic>et al</italic>. observed lower quantity of LAM and a shift towards higher molecular weight upon gene silencing of <italic>aftB</italic> in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> using MAb F30-5 antibody<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, which recognizes the terminal arabinan branches of LAM (ara-LAM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.

Remarkably, the <italic>fecB</italic> mutant exhibited an even greater shift than the <italic>aftB</italic> silenced wild-type strain. Additionally, both in the presence and absence of AftB, the shifted bands of the <italic>fecB</italic> mutant showed lower intensity than in the wild-type. This suggests that FecB, together with AftB, is indeed involved in the terminal linkage of arabinosyl to LAM. While the function of AftA has thus far only been linked to arabinogalactan synthesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, we investigated whether we could observe any effect on LAM. To explore this, we examined the effects of their depletion on ara-LAM, similarly to the experiments conducted for AftB and FecB. While silencing <italic>aftA</italic> alone in the wild-type strain did not produce a clear band shift, the additional deletion of <italic>lpqZ</italic> caused a distinct shift toward lower molecular weight. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). These findings suggest that AftA and LpqZ may also play a role in modulating the structure of LAM. The expression of functional <italic>lpqZ</italic> and <italic>fecB</italic> under the control of the HSP60 promoter fully complemented the observed phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To validate these findings, we extracted LAM from the cell envelope and assessed molecular weight changes and quantity in the mutants.

Furthermore, the <italic>fecB</italic> mutant produced significantly (p=0.0012) less LAM compared to the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). These phenotypes were fully restored in the genetically complemented strains.

To further delve into this, we were interested in the evolutionary conservation of these proteins. To compare the structural conservation of FecB and LpqZ with other SBPs that still function in concert with ABC transporters, the ConSurf server was used for analyzing evolutionary conservation of amino acids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. For each amino acid, the score of conservation was mapped to the predicted AlphaFold structures. Interestingly, and in line with our findings, LpqZ showed high conservation in regions that are predicted to interact with AftA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The number of conserved residues was especially high towards the probable galactan binding cavity and the probable active site of AftA. In contrast, other SBPs like the <italic>M.marinum</italic> homologue ProX (25.17% aa identity) and <italic>M.marinum</italic> ModA showed most conserved amino acids around the middle part of the structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>), which forms the substrate binding pocket <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.

For solubilization of membrane proteins, 0.25% n-dodecyl-ß-D-maltoside (DDM) was added and incubated for 1h head over head rotation at 4°C. After centrifugation at 100000xg for 30min at 4°C, the resulting soluble fractions were used for purification of HA-tagged proteins using a µMACS™ HA isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) and a magnet separator according to the manufacturer. For washing, 10% glycerol in PBS with 0.03% DDM was used and the first two elution steps were done using 2mg/ml HA peptide in washing buffer, whereas the last elution was done as described by the manufacturer. For strep-tag purification, membrane fractions were adjusted to 4.5mg/ml in 10% glycerol PBS and solubilized. Naturally biotinylated proteins were blocked with 0.5mg/ml avidin for 10min before centrifugation. The resulting soluble fractions were incubated with StrepTactin resin (IBA Lifesciences) under rotation at 4°C for 1h. Beads were washed five times with 10% glycerol in PBS and eluted three times with elution buffer (50mM TrisHCl pH8, 300mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10mM desthiobiotin). To check for purification efficiency, samples were taken after each step, boiled in SDS loading buffer for 10min at 98°C and examined by SDS page. For each purification sample, all three elutions were pooled together for SDS-page and mass spectrometry as described below.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p id="P41">For identification of protein interaction partners, elution samples from Strep-tagged or HA-tagged protein purification were analyzed by LC-MS/MS as described in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>.

A synthetic galactan ligand comprising eight galactofuranosyl residues was used.

This ensemble was used as input for HADDOCK, which uses restraints to guide the docking. In our case we used random restraints from surface accessible molecules. During the initial rigid-body energy minimization step, the number of generated structures was increased from the default 1,000 to 40,000, resulting in 20 docking models per ligand conformer. The top 200 structures, ranked by HADDOCK score, were subjected to a semi-flexible simulated annealing protocol in torsion angle space, allowing for gradual introduction of flexibility at the protein–ligand interface. The final flexible refinement step in explicit solvent was not performed. A total of 200 docking models were analyzed, and the final complex was selected based on two criteria: (1) the ability to form a hydrogen bond between the C5-linked hydroxyl group of the galactan chain and the catalytic residue AftA-D128, and (2) a favorable HADDOCK score.

This macropolymer can be referred to as the mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan (mAGP) complex.
