Given that neutrophils are known to display a prominent discordance between mRNA and protein abundance, we developed ultra-sensitive mini-bulk and single cell proteomic (SCP) workflows to study the heterogeneity of peripheral blood and tumour associated neutrophils (TAN) from patients with glioblastoma. Mini-bulk analysis enabled a deeper protein coverage of circulating immature, mature and TAN populations, defining signatures of maturity and demonstrating that TANs resemble mature circulating neutrophils. Analysis of the SCP data resulted in the detection of &gt;1,100 proteins from a single TAN providing a detailed characterization of neutrophil subsets in glioblastoma. Our approach shows evidence of pathogenic and anti-tumorigenic clusters and discovers cell states invisible to scRNAseq, opening new opportunities to selectively target pro-tumoural neutrophil states.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>single cell proteomics</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>tumour associated neutrophils</kwd><kwd>glioblastoma</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>label-free</kwd><kwd>Orbitrap astral</kwd><kwd>heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>functional states</kwd><kwd>low input proteomics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Glioblastoma (GBM) is a grade IV glioma, the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer in human adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The current standard of care for affected patients consists of treatment involving a combination of maximal surgical resection with radio- and chemotherapy. Despite treatment, prognosis is very poor with a 5-year patient survival rate of 4%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. With extensive neutrophil infiltration into GBM tumours reported, neutrophils have the potential to present themselves as potent therapeutic targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. To effectively target neutrophils in GBM we firstly need to understand the relative functional contribution of these different neutrophil populations within the tumour site.</p><p id="P3">Alongside their conventional antimicrobial roles, neutrophils have emerged as important regulators of cancer. Their function remains paradoxical however, with both pro- and anti-tumourigenic effects reported at multiple stages of disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Neutrophils are short lived rapidly turned over cells with the bone marrow producing more than 100 billion per day in homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. They display significant transcriptional and functional heterogeneity in circulation, primary and metastatic tumour sites. This complexity is further amplified by cancer associated perturbations in myelopoiesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Single cell transcriptional analysis has been transformational in defining the presence of these different neutrophil states, and more recently has been used to predict a terminal transcriptional state in the tumour niche<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, changes in rates of protein synthesis versus degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and the long-term storage of proteins within granules together mean that transcriptomes cannot always predict effector functions. This is particularly relevant in both mature and immature neutrophil populations where weak mRNA to protein correlation is observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Our objective, therefore, was to develop a more comprehensive proteomic platform to enable us to define neutrophil subsets by function using high resolution mass spectrometry (MS).</p><p id="P4">MS-based proteomics has proven to be a highly insightful tool to define neutrophil phenotypes in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, these bulk proteomic workflows required millions of cells for the analysis to be viable, limiting their use to peripheral blood neutrophils. Recent progress on sample processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, instrument sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and software tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, have facilitated the study of fewer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, as well as enabling the proteomic characterisation of single cells. A new generation of mass spectrometers has significantly increased sensitivity and empowered single cell proteomics (SCP) to identify &gt;5,000 proteins per single HeLa cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. This remarkable improvement has opened the possibility to study the functional heterogeneity of primary human cells composed of low protein content. It is important to note that neutrophils contain a much lower total protein mass, estimated to be less than 60pg per cell, compared to HeLa cells, estimated to contain 250pg of protein per cell.</p><p id="P5">Here we combine flow cytometry and MS-based proteomic workflows to study rare neutrophil populations, both from the peripheral blood and from glioblastoma (GBM) tumours. We perform a mini-bulk (500 cells) proteomic analysis of circulating mature CD10+, immature CD10- low density neutrophils (LDN) and normal density neutrophils (NDNs) as well as GBM tumour associated neutrophils (TAN), finding that TANs much more closely resemble mature CD10+ neutrophil populations, but with increased mitochondrial content. We performed ultra-sensitive SCP analysis of TANs to define functional neutrophil clusters within the GBM tumours. The power to identify &gt; 1,100 proteins per single neutrophil provides us the ability for the first time to define the presence of discrete neutrophil functional clusters which we assign as armed, engaged, vital NETs, exhausted, lytic NETs, immunosuppressive and angiogenic and vascular immature. The added value of SCP has enabled the characterization of functional states not previously captured by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), as a result of imperfect correlation between the tissue neutrophil transcriptome and proteome. Consequently, our work stratifies neutrophil heterogeneity by effector function and opens new avenues to engage anti-tumoural neutrophil responses for GBM disease whilst also providing a novel platform for the study of neutrophils in disease at the single cell resolution.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P6">To study rare neutrophil subsets in GBM, we developed mass spectrometry-based proteomics methods to work on low cell numbers. Similar to previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, we established a mini-bulk method (500 cells) and a SCP method, both optimized for human neutrophils. Mini-bulk was used to analyze both peripheral blood neutrophils as well as GBM TANs, while only TANs were analysed with SCP. Both blood and tissue neutrophils were sorted by flow cytometry directly into 384 well plates containing the master mix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1A-C</xref>). Plates were stored at minus -80°C, posteriorly processed on the cellenONE X1 and analysed on an Orbitrap Astral equipped with a FAIMS Pro Duo interface using a 50 sample per day (SPD) method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>). This workflow enabled deeper coverage from just 500 cells and the first single cell proteomic characterization of human neutrophils.</p><p id="P7">We compared the protein identification of our two optimized low cell number methods to the standard bulk workflows which required 2 million neutrophils per sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>). The data from all 3 proteomic methods were searched using Spectronaut 19 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">methods</xref>) with a human SwissProt database that included isoforms. Details on the parameters are expanded in the methods section. As expected, the bulk proteomic workflow enabled the most comprehensive coverage of the neutrophil proteomes, with &gt;5,700 protein groups (proteins) identified per sample. However, in the bulk workflow a total 1.5 μg of peptides were injected into the mass spectrometer. The mini-bulk analysis enabled the identification of &gt;3,000 proteins per sample from just 500 cells, with the equivalent of ~15ng injected into the mass spectrometer. Finally, our SCP workflow enabled the identification of &gt;1,100 proteins per single neutrophil after tissue dissociation and cell sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>) from an estimated ~30pg of peptides injected. The mini-bulk and SCP workflows achieved remarkable coverage considering the low input.</p><p id="P8">Leveraging the bulk data, we calculated the estimated copy numbers using the proteomic ruler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">methods</xref>) and studied proteins identified across all 3 workflows. The median estimated copy number of all proteins identified in bulk was ~5,500, thus 50% of proteins identified in bulk were present with fewer than 5,500 estimated copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D</xref>). Mini-bulk identified fewer low abundance proteins, with only 28% of the proteins identified in mini-bulk estimated to have &lt;5,500 copies based on the bulk data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D</xref>) and the median copy number of these proteins being ~17,000 copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E</xref>). In SCP only 20% of proteins identified were estimated to have &lt;5,500 estimated copies based on the bulk data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D&amp;E</xref>) and the median copy number being ~34,000 copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). In summary low abundance proteins were challenging to detect with low cell number workflows, however even SCP identified 20% of the proteins detected with &lt;5,500 copies in bulk.</p><p id="P9">We were interested to examine the proteomic coverage across all 3 methods of proteins that are vital to neutrophil function, focusing on neutrophil granules, metabolic proteins as well as proteins involved in immune signaling pathways. Our data showed that neutrophil granule proteins are highly abundant, with azurophilic granules (AG), specific granules (SG), ficolin granules (FG) and secretory vesicles (SV) all having a median copy number &gt;60,000 copies. In bulk we could detect 682 granules, of which 88% were also detected by mini-bulk and 80% by SCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1F</xref>), showing a remarkable capacity for SCP to characterize important neutrophil effector proteins. We next studied metabolic proteins which are vital to fuel neutrophil effector functions. The metabolic proteins were considerably less abundant than granule proteins but still displayed a median of &gt;15,000 copies. 78% of the proteins identified by bulk were present in the mini-bulk analysis with excellent coverage (75% of bulk proteins) also retained within the SCP data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). We next focused on important neutrophil effector function regulators, such as adhesion proteins, proteins required for calcium signaling responses, cytokine and chemokine receptors and pattern recognition receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). The adhesion proteins were highly abundant and showed good coverage, but low abundance chemokine receptors were difficult to detect even in bulk, and most were not detected with mini-bulk or SCP, showing the current limitations to identify important low abundance proteins.</p><sec id="S2"><title>Mini-bulk enables the analysis of mature and immature blood neutrophils and TANs</title><p id="P10">To define GBM neutrophil subsets by cell surface marker expression, we first undertook flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood from healthy control (HC) and GBM patients. GBM patients had a significantly elevated leukocyte count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2A</xref>) and altered proportions of lymphocytes and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2B</xref>). This was a consequence of a significantly higher number of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2C</xref>) and a lower lymphocyte count resulting in an increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in GBM peripheral blood compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2D</xref>). Expansion of a circulating low density neutrophil subset composed of a mixture of mature and immature cells has previously been reported in lung and breast cancer patients with distinct phenotypic properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. We detected the presence of an immature CD10 negative neutrophil subset in the blood of GBM patients which was significantly increased in the LDN fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2E, F, G</xref>). Furthermore, this immature subset had features of activation with high CD66b and reduced CD11b expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2H, I</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Given the idenitification of multiple GBM neutrophil subsets by our flow cytometry analysis, we decided to further characterize these populations using our mini-bulk method. We stratified the neutrophils by density and maturity using CD10, with CD10+ representing mature neutrophils and CD10- immature neutrophils. Blood low density neutrophils (LDN) CD10-, blood LDN CD10+, blood normal density neutrophils (NDN) CD10+ and CD45+CD66b+CD49d- TAN derived from 6 GBM patients and blood NDN CD10+ neutrophils from 6 healthy control donors were analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Across all 5 neutrophil populations it was possible to identify &gt;3,000 proteins per 500 cell sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) with a median of &gt;14,500 peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), showing the robustness of the method. Relative intensity based absolute quantification (riBAQ) was used to normalise and analyse the mini-bulk data (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">methods</xref>). An initial principal component analysis (PCA) of the riBAQ data displayed unexpected results. The neutrophil populations displayed no clear sepparation based on density, with LDN and NDN CD10+ groups showing limited separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). TANs also clustered within the CD10+ section and it was only the CD10- negative population that showed a clear segregation. Studying the top 25 proteins that influenced the PCA revealed ribosomal proteins and PCNA marking this separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We performed a direct comparison between CD10+ LDN and NDN and found there were no proteins significantly changed between the two populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>), with all granule subsets showing no difference between mature LDN and NDN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3B-E</xref>), suggesting density is not the primary axis of proteomic variation in neutrophils. We next compared NDN CD10+ to immature LDN CD10- and found 29% of proteins being significantly different between the two populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). A total of 526 proteins were significantly higher in abundance in the LDN CD10immature neutrophils. A gene ontology (GO) analysis of these proteins revealed they were enriched in translational, DNA and mitochondrial related GO terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). The immature neutrophils displayed &gt;350% increased abundance of ribosomal proteins compared to mature LDN and NDN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>), suggesting higher translational capacity. Mitochondrial metabolism proteins were also higher (&gt;70%) in immature cells compared to mature neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>), as were proliferation markers such as mKI67 and PCNA and DNA replication proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3F-L</xref>).</p><p id="P13">There were 355 proteins that were significantly more abundant in mature NDNs compared to immature LDNs. A GO analysis highlighted these were enriched in processes related to cell membrane, migration and inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J</xref>), suggesting the potential for superior migratory and effector capacity. A higher abundance of proteins reported to associate with increased neutrophil maturation status was observed, including core components of the NADPH oxidase, granule proteins MMP8, MMP9, S100A8, S100A9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K</xref>) and the cell surface markers CD11b, CD18, CD16 and SLC2A3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2L</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>TANs resemble mature circulating neutrophil populations</title><p id="P14">We were interested to understand whether tumour associated neutrophil populations had a unique proteomic signature. TANs displayed higher coefficient of variation (CV) when compared to the blood derived populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). In line with the PCA overview, which displayed no clear separation of TANs from CD10+ populations, a direct comparison of TANs to mature CD10+ NDN reflected only 8 proteins significantly changed in abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), suggesting limited differences compared to normal density mature neutrophils. Of the few proteins changed TANs displayed increased abundance of brain specific markers such as MBP and MAOB while L-selectin, the cell adhesion molecule important for trans-endothelial migration was higher in the NDN CD10+. We then performed a direct comparison of TANs to LDN CD10-, and found this revealed 553 proteins changed in abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Of these 553 proteins, proteins with higher abundance in TANs were enriched for GO terms relating to migration and adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>) and demonstrated increased abundance of maturity markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4A-H</xref>). Proteins decreased in abundance in TANs related to ribosomal and DNA replication proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E-G</xref>).

Although the transcriptome can be used to predict cellular state, it is the proteome that is the key driver of biological function especially in post-mitotic cells such as neutrophils. The bulk proteomes of immune cells including neutrophils have over the years been extensively studied mapping cellular protein signatures and function to understand disease mechanisms and identify biomarkers. However, bulk proteomics obscures the single cell resolution necessary to capture complex biological tissue cell-state heterogeneity. Important advances in single cell proteomics including the original isobaric labelling methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, nanodroplet sample processing techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, label free instrument optimisations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and even spatial solutions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> have enabled the quantification of thousands of proteins from a single cell. Despite these developments, the lack of amplification strategies for proteins has mostly limited SCP analysis to larger cells containing a higher protein content such as blastomeres, oocytes and HeLa cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Whilst a single HeLa cell is estimated to contain between 150-250 pg of protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, a single human neutrophil is estimated to contain between 30-60 pg of protein, posing a substantial challenge for SCP analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">To facilitate profiling of neutrophil proteomes with low protein input, we have developed a proteomics workflow optimised for low cell numbers, capable of measuring from 500 neutrophils down to a single FACS sorted human neutrophil dissociated from glioblastoma tumours.

This workflow has allowed us to generate the first human single cell tissue neutrophil proteomic resource.</p><p id="P24">Neutrophils are highly dynamic cells with the capacity to adapt to the tissue niche. There is compelling evidence to show that in addition to re-programming within the tumour microenvironment, newly formed neutrophils and their progenitors can also be perturbed in the bone marrow long before they reach the tumour site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. We find that GBM alters circulating neutrophil with an expansion of a low density immature neutrophil population with a distinct proteomic signature. Our mini-bulk proteomic survey of 500 blood CD10- LDN, CD10+ LDN, CD10+ NDN and CD45+CD66b+CD49d- TAN using ultra-sensitive mass spectrometry revealed proteomic similarities between CD10+ blood and tumour associated neutrophils, however it also highlighted clear differences between the CD10- LDN and TAN populations. This is of interest given the significant contribution of LDN to the circulating neutrophil pool and work detailing deterministic reprogramming of both immature and mature neutrophils by the tumour niche<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Single cell proteomic survey of neutrophils harvested from resected glioblastoma tumours at time of surgery subsequently identified the presence of an immature neutrophil cluster based on the abundance of specific maturity markers defined by mini-bulk as well as mitochondrial and ribosomal protein content. However, this accounted for only 8% of the tumour neutrophil populations and was associated with an intra-vascular signature of complement and coagulation proteins. We therefore propose that in human GBM CD10- immature neutrophils are retained within the vasculature. It remains an open question as to whether there is either active exclusion of immature neutrophils with anti-tumoural capacity by prevention of their vascular egress or whether there is rapid transition of these cells into a terminally differentiated pro-tumoural state.</p><p id="P25">Importantly, our study also reveals the concurrent existence of neutrophil states with the potential capacity to engage either pro- (immunosuppressive, lytic NETotic) or anti- (armed, engaged) tumoural responses. Our work also highlights the value and contribution of SCP, as multiple neutrophil states uncovered by this data would be invisible to RNAseq. Specifically, NETotic neutrophils were characterized by prominent reductions in the abundance of histones and granule proteins whilst degranulating neutrophils were characterized by a reduction in granule protein content with conserved histone abundance. As granule proteins are preserved within mature neutrophils long after their corresponding transcripts are no longer present<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, these functional clusters are only exposed when proteomic analysis is performed. SCP also enables characterization of less frequent populations, for example we were able to identify a cluster of neutrophils undergoing lytic NETosis not visible within the mini-bulk data.

Further developments in the field of single cell spatial proteomics will allow us to start to address these important questions. For example, can the peri-vascular niche play a critical role in compartmentalization of these different effector responses as previously reported for GBM macrophage interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.

After 30 min of incubation, an additional 500nL of 3 ng/μL trypsin were added which replaces one hydration step. After lysis and digestion, 2.5 μL of 0.1% trifluoro acetic acid (TFA, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #28903) with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (Avantor, #83673.230) were added to the respective wells for quenching and storage.

Analyte separation was performed at 50°C using a 25 cm x 75 μm C18 UHPLC packed emitter column (Ion Opticks Pty Ltd, # AUR3-25075C18-TS, Collingwood, Australia) connected to the mass spectrometer via an EASY-Spray™ ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ES081). Before separation, peptides were trapped on a 5mm PepMap™ Neo trap cartridge (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #174500) using a flow of 10 μL/min of 0.1% TFA. Loading was done using combined control of flow (10μL/min) and pressure (max. 800 bar). Loading volume was set to automatic. Samples were cooled to 7°C in the autosampler and covered with a silicone mat. 5 μL were injected per sample to ensure complete aspiration of the entire sample volume using 0.2μL/s draw speed and 2s draw delay with bottom detection on. For separation, 0.1% formic acid in LC-MS/MS grade water (Thermo Fisher Scientific, # 10188164) as solvent A and 0.08% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #10118464) as solvent B were used.
