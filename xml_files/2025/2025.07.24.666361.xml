promoters, mediated by its histone acetyl transferase, KAT2A. While its structure and function have been extensively investigated, how the stability of individual subunits of SAGA, including KAT2A, is regulated, remains unclear. Here, using a fluorescence-based KAT2A stability reporter, we systematically dissect the molecular dependencies controlling KAT2A protein abundance. We identify the non-enzymatic SAGA CORE module subunits—TADA1, TAF5L, and TAF6L— as necessary for KAT2A stability, with loss of these subunits disrupting the integrity of SAGA, leading to non-chromatin-bound KAT2A that is degraded by the proteasome, consequently leading to reduced H3K9 acetylation. Proteomic profiling reveals progressive loss of CORE and HAT components upon acute disruption of the SAGA CORE, indicating that an intact CORE is required for the stability of numerous components of SAGA. Finally, a focused CRISPR screen of ubiquitin-proteasome system genes identifies the E3 ligase UBR5, a known regulator of orphan protein degradation, and the deubiquitinase OTUD5, as regulators of KAT2A degradation when the SAGA CORE is perturbed. Together, these findings reveal a dependency of KAT2A protein stability on SAGA CORE integrity and define an orphan quality control mechanism targeting unassembled KAT2A, revealing a potential vulnerability in SAGA-driven malignancies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SAGA</kwd><kwd>KAT2A</kwd><kwd>histone acetyltransferase</kwd><kwd>collateral degradation</kwd><kwd>UBR5</kwd><kwd>proteasome</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Gene expression is controlled by large multi-protein complexes that interact with chromatin and transcription factors to facilitate or repress transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chen &amp; Dent, 2014</xref>). The biogenesis and maintenance of such multi-protein complexes is a highly regulated process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ahnert <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Natan <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>), with ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation assays demonstrating that assembly of large protein complexes is often co-translational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Natan <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bernardini &amp; Tora, 2024</xref>). For instance, components of COMPASS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Halbach <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>), TFIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bernardini <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>), and other co-activator complexes including ATAC and SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Yayli <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>) display paired interactions in the cytosol already at the stage of nascent protein, suggesting that components of those complexes are assembled cotranslationally. This mechanism is sought to extend the half-life of intrinsically unstable components, with the partner protein acting as a chaperone for aggregation-prone subunits. Numerous quality control mechanisms exist to maintain homeostasis in protein complex formation. These mechanisms are crucial to ensure that proteins fold correctly and are expressed in the right amounts, thereby preventing the formation of mislocalised, misfolded, or aggregated proteins which would have deleterious consequences for the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Padovani <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Pla-Prats &amp; Thomä, 2022</xref>). However, as protein complex assembly is not a stoichiometric process and complex partners have different abundancies in the cell, some subunits therefore remain uncomplexed, as there are insufficient binding partners to successfully form the full complex. These ‘orphan’ proteins may become bound by chaperones until such a time that a partner protein becomes available, but in the absence of their normal partners can also misfold. Misfolding can in turn expose hidden degrons or hydrophobic patches, which ordinarily are inaccessible in the assembled complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kong <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). These de-novo degrons then mediate protein degradation via specialised machinery of the orphan quality control system, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Yanagitani et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mark <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Interestingly, inherent features of these two mechanisms, i.e. dependency on co-translational assembly and dedicated orphan quality control, can be exploited using chemical or genetic perturbations. For example, chemical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hsu <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>) or genetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Leeb <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) perturbation of the PRC2 component EED leads to loss of its complex partners, EZH2 and SUZ12, in a phenomenon termed ‘collateral degradation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Similarly, PROTACs targeting HDAC1/2 result in the degradation of other proteins in the same complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Xiong <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>), such as LSD1 of CoREST, or components of the SIN3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Smalley <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>), while genetic depletion of HDAC1/2 in neuroblastoma cells leads to destabilisation of NuRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Such collateral degradation of partner proteins upon loss of a single complex component has recently emerged as a new therapeutic modality when targeting co-activator or co-repressor complexes that are deregulated in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Mabe <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>), as specific targeting of one subunit has the potential to result in collateral loss of multiple subunits, and consequent loss of complex activity.</p><p id="P4">The SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) is a large co-activator complex composed of 20 proteins organised into five distinct modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Herbst <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Two of these five modules, the DUB (Deubiquitinase) and HAT (Histone Acetyl transferase), have enzymatic activity, conferred respectively by the histone deubiquitinase USP22, which deubiquitinates Lysine 120 of Histone H2B, or the acetyltransferase KAT2A (also known as GCN5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dent, 2024</xref>), which predominately acetylates Histone H3K9 at promoters to facilitate transcriptional activation. The other three modules lack enzymatic activity and have various functions, from mediating interactions with transcription factors (TRRAP), associating with splicing and DNA repair factors (SPL), or serving as a structural scaffold for the other modules (CORE).</p><p id="P5">Due to their key role in transcriptional activation, acetyltransferases such as KAT2A are desirable therapeutic targets, particularly in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Mustachio <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">White <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>). Indeed, KAT2A has been identified as a specific vulnerability in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Tzelepis <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>), while numerous studies have reported an interplay between KAT2A and MYC-driven oncogenic transcriptional programmes across different cancer subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mustachio <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Farria <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Malone <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2025</xref>). Multiple independent genetic screens have also identified cancer vulnerabilities within non-enzymatic components of SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Durbin <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">de Almeida <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Barbosa <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chan <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>), underscoring their functional importance and showing that targeting these components also holds therapeutic potential.</p><p id="P6">Notably, inactivation of CORE and HAT components other than KAT2A often phenocopies loss of KAT2A itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chan <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Malone <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>), while several studies have reported a reduction in H3K9ac levels upon loss of both HAT and non-HAT SAGA components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Seruggia <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Fischer <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Malone <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Barbosa <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>), suggesting that KAT2A’s acetyltransferase activity is dependent on protein-protein interactions within SAGA. However, the contribution of individual SAGA subunits to the regulation of KAT2A protein function and stability still remains unclear.</p><p id="P7">Here, we used a fluorescence-based stability reporter to systematically measure KAT2A protein levels upon genetic perturbation of SAGA components. We found that specific components of the structural CORE module of SAGA are necessary for KAT2A protein stability, recruitment to promoters and acetylation of histones. Fractionation experiments revealed loss of complex integrity and disengagement of the HAT module upon SAGA CORE disruption, resulting in the accumulation of non-complexed KAT2A protein that is prone to proteasome-mediated degradation. Using pooled CRISPR screening we identified proteins that regulate KAT2A turnover upon perturbation of the SAGA CORE, including OTUD5 and UBR5, components of the orphan quality control system, implicating them as effectors of solitary KAT2A protein degradation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Arrayed CRISPR screening to monitor KAT2A stability upon knockout of SAGA components</title><p id="P8">To monitor KAT2A protein abundance upon genetic or chemical perturbations, we established a stability reporter by fusing the <italic>KAT2A</italic> coding sequence in-frame with BFP, followed by mCherry, with the two fluorophores separated by a P2A peptide linker. In this system BFP therefore reports on KAT2A abundance while mCherry serves as a normalisation control, in a setup amenable to pooled or arrayed CRISPR screening using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">de Almeida <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Schwartz <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hsia <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>). We expressed the KAT2A stability reporter in wild type HAP1 cells along with Cas9 and performed arrayed CRISPR screening using guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting the 20 components of the SAGA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>), along with positive and negative controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). Each gRNA also expressed GFP, allowing discrimination of transduced from non-transduced cells in a heterogenous cell population, in addition to guide RNA dropout over time by comparing the percentage of GFP positive cells for each guide at each time point of the experiment. As expected, due to their common essentiality, the GFP signal originating from gRNAs targeting the essential genes <italic>RAD21</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic> was rapidly lost, in addition to the <italic>SF3B3</italic> and <italic>SF3B5</italic> components of the SAGA splicing module (SPL) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S1A-C</xref>). Thus, wild type HAP1<sup>Cas9</sup> have high levels of Cas9 activity and allow efficient knockout of target genes and are therefore amenable to arrayed CRISPR screening.</p><p id="P9">To validate that the KAT2A stability reporter was responsive to changes in KAT2A protein abundance, we treated HAP1<sup>Cas9</sup> cells with GSK-699, a potent, recently developed KAT2A/KAT2B PROTAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bassi <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Malone <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>). Following 6 h treatment with the PROTAC, we observed a strong reduction in KAT2A-BFP signal but no change in mCherry fluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S1D-F</xref>), as expected as mCherry is translated as a separate polypeptide, with a &gt; 80 % reduction in KAT2A-BFP fluorescence for cells treated with the PROTAC compared to DMSO-treated controls (from 1.0 ± 0.07 (DMSO) to 0.19 ± 0.09 (GSK-699), mean + S.D.). Additionally, cells transduced with gRNAs targeting <italic>KAT2A</italic> itself had substantially reduced KAT2A-BFP and mCherry mean fluorescence, with a &gt; 50 % reduction in signal for both fluorophores compared to <italic>AAVS1</italic> transduced controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S1G, H</xref>). Thus, the KAT2A stability reporter construct faithfully reports on KAT2A protein levels upon chemical or genetic perturbation. To systematically investigate the role of SAGA components on KAT2A abundance, we gated GFP positive cells and measured the KAT2A-BFP/mCherry ratio for each gRNA in our collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) relative to negative control guides targeting either the AAVS1 safe harbour locus or non-targeting sequences. Targeting <italic>ATXN7, ATXN7L3, USP22</italic> and <italic>ENY2</italic>, components of the DUB module, did not significantly alter KAT2A levels, consistent with the observation that the DUB module is loosely bound to SAGA and hence dispensable for its structural integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Herbst et al, 2021</xref>). However, knockout of TADA2B and <italic>TADA3</italic>, components of the HAT module that are in close proximity to KAT2A within SAGA, resulted in a significant drop in KAT2A abundance, indicating that KAT2A protein levels are reduced upon loss of its partners in the HAT module. Targeting <italic>TRRAP</italic>, the largest subunit of SAGA, also resulted in reduced KAT2A abundance using the stability reporter assay. While not structurally close to the HAT module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Herbst <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>), it has been reported that TRRAP and KAT2A engage in a tertiary structure with MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">McMahon <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) which might become disrupted upon loss of <italic>TRRAP</italic>. However, closer inspection of the 2D FACS plots for cells transduced with guides against <italic>TRRAP</italic> showed that these cells had an increase in mCherry signal compared to control cells, rather than a decrease in KAT2A-BFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S1I</xref>), suggesting an artefact of the reporter leads to a reduced KAT2A-BFP/mCherry ratio when targeting <italic>TRRAP.</italic> Interestingly, upon targeting the non-enzymatic CORE module of SAGA, we identified three subunits, <italic>TADA1, TAF5L</italic> and <italic>TAF6L</italic>, whose knockout also resulted in significantly reduced levels of KAT2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). These results therefore suggest that selected CORE components of SAGA, in addition to components of the HAT module, play a role in regulating KAT2A protein abundance.</p><p id="P10">To validate these findings, we turned to high-throughput confocal microscopy and measured endogenous KAT2A levels by immunofluorescence in wild type HAP1<sup>Cas9</sup> cells, following knockout of SAGA subunits that reduced KAT2A abundance in the stability reporter screen. Guides against <italic>KAT2A</italic> itself or treatment with GSK-699 served as positive controls, with guides against <italic>AAVS1</italic> used as a negative control. As in the arrayed screen, each gRNA also expressed a GFP cassette. Thus, by thresholding the nuclei of GFP positive cells, we could specifically measure the nuclear KAT2A fluorescence of transduced cells for each guide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, E</xref>). Importantly, we observed that knockout of KAT2A yielded a drop in KAT2A fluorescence comparable to that induced by the PROTAC, demonstrating the sensitivity of the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, E</xref>). Knockout of TRRAP had no effect on endogenous KAT2A abundance, confirming that its effect on the stability reporter in the arrayed screen was an artefact of the reporter, while loss of <italic>USP22</italic> also did not reduce KAT2A levels. Consistent with our screen findings, knockout of the HAT subunits <italic>TADA2B</italic> and <italic>TADA3</italic>, as well as the CORE subunits <italic>TADA1, TAF5L</italic> and TAF6L resulted in a significant reduction in nuclear KAT2A protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, E</xref>), confirming that components of the HAT module, in addition to non-enzymatic structural components of SAGA regulate KAT2A protein abundance. Importantly, targeting of other CORE subunits such as <italic>SUPT20H, SUPT3H</italic>, or <italic>TAF10</italic>, did not significantly reduce KAT2A protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S1J</xref>), thereby demonstrating a specific effect upon targeting <italic>TADA1, TAF5L</italic>, and TAF6L. Altogether, these results demonstrate that KAT2A protein levels are reduced upon loss of its binding partners in the HAT module, but also upon knockout of selected components of the non-enzymatic CORE, which do not interact with KAT2A directly but instead play a structural role in the complex.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Components of the SAGA CORE regulate KAT2A abundance and HAT function</title><p id="P11">To mechanistically dissect KAT2A loss upon targeting the SAGA CORE, we focused on the three CORE components identified in the arrayed CRISPR screen and generated homozygous HAP1 knockout cell lines for <italic>TAF5L, TAF6L</italic> and <italic>TADA1</italic>, in addition to <italic>KAT2A</italic> to serve as a positive control. Clonal TAF5L, TAF6L and TADA1 KO cells showed a drastic reduction in endogenous nuclear KAT2A fluorescence, with a reduction in KAT2A fluorescence comparable to that of KAT2A KO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S2A, B</xref>), with a similar reduction in nuclear KAT2A protein levels observed across multiple independent knockout clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S2B</xref>), confirming our previous findings with knockout pools. Importantly, overexpression of murine full length <italic>Tada1, Taf5l</italic> or <italic>Taf6l</italic> cDNA in the corresponding KO clone restored <italic>KAT2A</italic> fluorescence to wild type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Thus, TAF5L, TAF6L, TADA1 are necessary to maintain <italic>KAT2A</italic> protein levels.</p><p id="P12">To address which specific domains within the SAGA CORE play a role in regulating KAT2A protein abundance, we turned to publicly available CryoEM data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Herbst <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) to try and identify candidate domains that might mediate protein-protein interactions within SAGA that regulate complex integrity, which might be necessary for maintaining KAT2A protein levels. Based on their position in the complex bridging the HAT and CORE modules, we hypothesised that the six WD40 repeats of TAF5L, the HEAT repeat of TAF6L as well as an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) at the C-terminus of the protein might be relevant for their function. Indeed, overexpression of cDNA constructs lacking TAF5L WD40 domains, TAF6L HEAT repeats, or the C-terminal IDR of TAF6L failed to rescue KAT2A levels, although a construct lacking the N-terminal domain of TAF5L rescued nuclear KAT2A fluorescence to the same extent as the full-length construct, and is therefore dispensable for regulating KAT2A protein abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S2C-H</xref>). Thus, specific domains involved in protein-protein interactions of SAGA CORE components are both necessary and sufficient to maintain KAT2A protein levels.</p><p id="P13">Having established that loss of <italic>TAF5L, TAF6L</italic>, or <italic>TADA1</italic> reduces <italic>KAT2A</italic> protein levels, we wished to address if their loss also resulted in global changes in H3K9 acetylation, the main histone mark deposited by KAT2A on chromatin. To quantitatively address this question, we turned to confocal microscopy and measured H3K9ac fluorescence relative to a DNA counterstain in HAP1 knockout pools following gRNA transduction, and thresholded GFP positive nuclei to identify transduced cells. Indeed, targeting <italic>TADA1, TAF5L</italic> or TAF6L led to a strong reduction in global H3K9ac levels compared to <italic>AAVS1-</italic>transduced controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, D</xref>), consistent with previous findings in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Seruggia <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Interestingly, the three SAGA CORE mutants displayed a global reduction in H3K9 acetylation comparable to that of KAT2A knockout cells (relative H3K9ac signal: <italic>sgKAT2A</italic>: 0.60 ± 0.24, <italic>sgTAF5L</italic>: 0.66 ± 0.24, sgTAF6L: 0.73 ± 0.23, <italic>sgTADA1</italic>: 0.67 ± 0.22, mean + S.D.). Thus, despite residual amounts of KAT2A protein in the nucleus in CORE KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S2B</xref>), KAT2A’s histone acetylation output is substantially reduced upon loss of <italic>TAF5L, TAF6L, or TADA1</italic>, with H3K9 acetylation reduced to the same extent as in cells lacking KAT2A when the SAGA CORE is perturbed.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Loss of TAF5L and TADA1 leads to HAT module disengagement from SAGA</title><p id="P14">As perturbing the SAGA CORE phenocopies loss of KAT2A at the level of global H3K9 acetylation, we hypothesised that recruitment of KAT2A to chromatin is abrogated in SAGA CORE mutants. To test this hypothesis, we therefore measured KAT2A chromatin occupancy by CUT&amp;RUN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Skene &amp; Henikoff, 2017</xref>).

Thus, not only is KAT2A protein abundancy reduced upon perturbing the SAGA CORE, but the residual protein cannot be recruited to its canonical binding sites on chromatin around promoters.</p><p id="P15">SAGA CORE perturbation has previously been reported to lead to impaired SAGA complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Fischer <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hisler <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>). However, how the HAT module interacts with the CORE and if an intact CORE is required for engagement of the HAT with SAGA is not well characterised. As we did not detect chromatin-bound KAT2A at promoters upon targeting the SAGA CORE, we therefore reasoned that TAF5L, TAF6L, and TADA1 might mediate important protein-protein interactions within the CORE that are necessary for engagement of the HAT module with the rest of SAGA. In such a situation, loss of these proteins would lead to separation of the HAT module and an increase in non-complexed KAT2A protein that can no longer bind to chromatin. To test this hypothesis, we turned to sucrose gradient fractionation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). High-molecular weight species, such as the intact SAGA complex, containing all or most of its components, have high density and thus migrate into the dense sucrose fractions. Disassembly intermediates or subcomplexes of intermediate molecular weight migrate into middle fractions, while solitary proteins or individual complex modules of low molecular weight remain near the top of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To investigate to what extent perturbation of the SAGA CORE affects engagement of the HAT module with SAGA, we therefore ultracentrifuged and fractionated sucrose gradients from wild type, TAF5L KO, and TADA1 KO cells, before western blotting against KAT2A, as well as TADA3, another HAT component. In wild type cells, KAT2A and TADA3 could be detected across the full range of fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D, E</xref>), indicating the presence of both complexed and non-complexed forms of the proteins. Indeed, in wild type cells both KAT2A and TADA3 were readily detectable in high molecular weight fractions (‘heavy fractions’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D, E</xref>, red boxes), consistent with their incorporation into fully assembled SAGA complexes, where the HAT module is engaged with the rest of the complex. Strikingly, in the absence of <italic>TAF5L and TADA1</italic> we observed a pronounced loss of KAT2A and TADA3 signal in heavy fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D, E</xref>, red boxes), consistent with loss of complex integrity and disengagement of the HAT from the rest of SAGA. We could also detect a concomitant accumulation of KAT2A in lighter fractions in CORE KO cells compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, arrows), with this enrichment suggesting a redistribution of KAT2A into low molecular weight species when the CORE is disrupted, either as free-floating protein or as a subcomplex with other HAT components. Thus, together these results demonstrate that TAF5L and TADA1 are not only required to maintain KAT2A protein levels, but are also important regulators of SAGA complex integrity that are necessary to maintain engagement of the HAT module with SAGA.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Progressive destabilisation of SAGA CORE and HAT upon depletion of TADA1</title><p id="P17">Constitutive knockout of <italic>TAF5L, TAF6L, TADA1</italic> leads to reduced KAT2A protein abundancy, but as the rate of protein rundown following gene knockout cannot be temporally controlled, in such a setup the kinetics of protein loss cannot be addressed. Therefore, to assess the kinetics of KAT2A protein depletion upon perturbing the SAGA CORE, we expressed a TADA1-FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> (dTAG) degron construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Nabet <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>) in TADA1 KO HAP1 cells, using a haemagglutinin (HA) tag used to monitor TADA1 protein levels, with overexpression of Tada1 restoring nuclear KAT2A levels to that of wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Immunostaining and confocal microscopy revealed that although TADA1 protein was rapidly degraded within 1 h of dTAG<sup>V</sup>-1 addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, B</xref>), KAT2A protein levels gradually reduced over time, reaching the level of TADA1 KO cells within 24 h of dTAG<sup>V</sup>-1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). Thus, acute degradation of TADA1 confirms that KAT2A protein abundance is reduced when the SAGA CORE is perturbed, but that the effect of TADA1 loss on KAT2A protein is not immediate, and that KAT2A instead becomes progressively less abundant over time.</p><p id="P18">Having observed that KAT2A protein levels are reduced following acute degradation of TADA1, we wished to address the consequences of SAGA CORE perturbation on other components of SAGA, as well as the effect globally on other protein complexes. We therefore used TMT-labelling to perform expression proteomics for 5 time points of interest in triplicate, following TADA1 degradation for either 1, 6, 24, or 48 h, and compared protein abundancies relative to control cells treated with DMSO. More than 7200 proteins were successfully identified in our dataset, including 15 of the 20 components of SAGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S3A</xref>). Consistent with our immunofluorescence data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, B</xref>), TADA1 was significantly depleted after 1 h of dTAG<sup>V</sup>-1 treatment and remained the most strongly depleted protein at all time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S3B-E</xref>). In the absence of unique KAT2A peptides, we annotated common KAT2A/KAT2B peptides to estimate KAT2A abundance and observed progressive depletion over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>), with the most prominent depletion after 48 h dTAG<sup>V</sup>-1 treatment. In addition, the abundancies of several other SAGA components also progressively decreased over time, most prominently the CORE components TAF5L and TAF12, as well as TRRAP, with TAF6L and the HAT component TADA3 also significantly depleted after 48 h dTAG<sup>V</sup>-1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S3D, E</xref>). To verify the specificity of this effect, we assessed the abundance of components from other protein complexes that share subunits with SAGA, finding minimal changes in the levels of ATAC and TFIID subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S3B-E</xref>). Thus, the reduction in protein abundancies of SAGA components is driven specifically by the acute depletion of TADA1.</p><p id="P19">Interestingly, several of the downregulated components are known to directly interact with or are in close structural proximity to TADA1 within SAGA. Indeed, TAF12 interacts with TADA1 via its histone fold domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Xu et al, 2018</xref>), in a process that occurs co-translationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Yayli et al, 2023</xref>). Similarly, TRRAP has been suggested to form interactions with TADA1 via a cleft bridging TRRAP and the CORE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Herbst <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>), with TAF5L and TAF6L also in close proximity to TADA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Herbst <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). As cotranslational assembly is a prominent mechanism by which large multi-protein complexes assemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Duncan &amp; Mata, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Natan <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bernardini &amp; Tora, 2024</xref>), loss of direct interactors or neighbouring proteins can lead to destabilisation of other complex members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Consistent with this finding, we observed loss of both TAF12 and TAF5L at early time points after TADA1 depletion, indicating that these components are particularly sensitive to the loss of TADA1-mediated protein-protein interactions, and that acute degradation of TADA1 might lead to collateral degradation of TAF12 due to the loss of its normal cotranslational assembly pathway. Although KAT2A is not known to directly interact with TADA1, its abundancy and engagement with SAGA depends on an intact structural CORE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), which becomes increasingly destabilised over time due to loss not only of TADA1, but the additional CORE subunits TAF12, TAF5L, and TAF6L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). These results are therefore consistent with a cumulative disruption of the CORE-HAT interface following TADA1 depletion, which leads to HAT module disengagement and an increase in non-complexed KAT2A that becomes progressively destabilised in the absence of its normal binding partners. Altogether, these results indicate that acute perturbation of the SAGA CORE via depletion of TADA1 results in collateral degradation of selected SAGA components, particularly for proteins in the CORE and HAT modules that are structurally proximal to or direct interactors of TADA1.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Non-complexed KAT2A is degraded in a process mediated by UBR5 and OTUD5</title><p id="P20">Perturbation of the SAGA CORE reduces KAT2A protein abundance while also resulting in disengagement of the HAT from the complex and the accumulation of low molecular weight KAT2A species. We therefore hypothesised that in CORE KO cells where complex integrity is perturbed, regions of KAT2A that in the intact SAGA complex are buried or bound by interaction partners might become exposed, resulting in the formation of degrons that target KAT2A to the proteasome and lead to its degradation. To assess if reduced KAT2A protein abundance in CORE KO mutants is indeed proteasome-sensitive, we therefore treated TAF5L KO HAP1 cells with inhibitors of key steps of the proteasome-mediated protein degradation machinery, including neddylation (MLN-4924), E1-enzyme activation (TAK-243), and the proteasome itself (MG-132), and measured endogenous KAT2A levels by immunofluorescence. Treatment with all three inhibitors restored KAT2A protein to wild type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A, B</xref>), with similar results in TAF6L and TADA1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S4A</xref>), indicating a general proteasome-sensitivity of KAT2A when the SAGA CORE is perturbed. Crucially, in the absence of inhibitors, KAT2A mRNA levels remained unchanged or even increased in CORE KO cells compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S4B, C</xref>), demonstrating that loss of KAT2A protein is not due to reduced transcription. Thus, loss of KAT2A protein in the absence of <italic>TAF5L, TAF6L</italic>, or <italic>TADA1</italic> is the result of proteasome-mediated degradation.</p><p id="P21">Having determined that the loss of KAT2A protein is proteasome-sensitive, we wished to understand the molecular mechanism of KAT2A degradation in CORE KO mutants and identify which of the effectors of the Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), including the more than 600 E3 ligases in the human genome, targets KAT2A for degradation. To do so, we again made of use of the KAT2A stability reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Treatment of TAF5L KO or TAF6L KO cells expressing the stability reporter with inhibitors of the proteasome machinery also rescued KAT2A-BFP protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S4D</xref>), thus allowing screening for effectors of KAT2A degradation. To identify specific effectors regulating KAT2A protein stability, we therefore performed a FACS-based pooled CRISPR screen in TAF5L KO HAP1<sup>Cas9</sup> cells, with a library targeting 1301 Ubiquitin-associated human genes, with 6 gRNAs per gene (Kagiou <italic>et al</italic>, 2024) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). By sorting cells expressing high levels of KAT2A BFP (KAT2A-BFP<sup>high</sup>) after library transduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S4E</xref>) and performing next-generation sequencing (NGS), we could identify genes whose knockout promotes KAT2A stabilisation to nominate candidate regulators of KAT2A degradation when the SAGA CORE is perturbed.</p><p id="P22">Interestingly, knockout of USP22, which confers the enzymatic activity of the SAGA DUB module and could therefore in principle auto-deubiquitinate KAT2A, did not alter KAT2A abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>), ruling out the possibility of interactions between the HAT and DUB modules regulating KAT2A stability.

To better assess the relative rescue of KAT2A protein levels in CORE KO cells, wild type HAP1<sup>Cas9</sup> cells were transduced with the same guides, with cells treated with GSK-699 or MG-132 serving as normalisation controls to determine the dynamic range of the assay.

Loss of neddylation components was however as effective as proteasome inhibition in wild type cells, with a mild but significant increase in nuclear KAT2A signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S4F, G</xref>), indicative of a reduced contribution of neddylation-dependent E3 ligases to KAT2A protein degradation when the SAGA CORE is perturbed.

Similar results were also observed in TADA1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S4H-I</xref>), indicating a general increase in the sensitivity of KAT2A to proteasome-mediated degradation when the CORE is perturbed. Such findings are consistent with an increased abundance of low molecular weight KAT2A species in CORE KO mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, E</xref>), where a greater proportion of KAT2A likely exists outside of the intact SAGA complex. Loss of binding interactions with other SAGA components upon SAGA CORE disruption might therefore render KAT2A more susceptible to collateral protein degradation when complex integrity is disrupted, and thus more responsive to stabilisation upon proteasome inhibition compared to wild type cells, where the HAT module remains engaged with SAGA.</p><p id="P24">Most strikingly, knockout of both <italic>UBR5</italic> and <italic>OTUD5</italic> rescued nuclear KAT2A protein levels to the same extent as proteasome inhibition in both TAF5L KO and TADA1 KO cells.

Disruption of the SAGA CORE leads to disengagement of the HAT from SAGA, potentially via disruption of co-translational or early post-translational assembly, and leads to the accumulation of solitary, unassembled KAT2A protein that is not recruited to chromatin and is instead targeted for proteasomal degradation. This degradation is mediated, at least in part, by orphan quality control factors such as the E3 ligase UBR5, in concert with the deubiquitinase OTUD5, which is known to regulate UBR5 stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Thus, the stability and activity of KAT2A is tightly coupled to the structural organisation of the SAGA complex, and perturbing its assembly triggers a quality control response that selectively eliminates unassembled KAT2A, with functional consequences for histone acetylation and gene regulation. More broadly, our study highlights a general vulnerability in multi-subunit co-activator complexes that could be exploited therapeutically to target chromatin-modifying enzymes in cancer. By targeting structural complex components that themselves lack enzymatic activity, it is possible to disrupt complex function through two distinct yet complementary mechanisms as: 1) loss of complex integrity impairs recruitment of enzymatic subunits to chromatin, leading to reduced catalytic output due to loss of interactions between the fully assembled complex and its substrate and 2) leads to increased incidence of orphan complex subunits that can become collaterally degraded in the absence of the intact complex, further reducing complex functionality.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">Our study identifies a mechanism by which the structural integrity of the SAGA co-activator complex regulates the stability and function of one of its catalytic subunits, KAT2A. We demonstrate that a subset of non-enzymatic components of the SAGA CORE module, namely TADA1, TAF5L, and TAF6L, are required to maintain KAT2A protein abundance and activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Loss of these structural subunits leads to disengagement of the HAT module, mislocalisation of KAT2A from chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), and its subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) with concurrent, collateral degradation of other elements of the CORE and HAT modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). These findings reveal that SAGA-dependent gene regulation relies not only on the enzymatic activities of its HAT and DUB modules but also on a finely tuned assembly architecture that protects vulnerable catalytic components from orphan degradation.</p><p id="P27">Our work builds on the emerging paradigm that many multi-subunit protein complexes are assembled co-translationally and are dependent on precise stoichiometric balances to prevent the accumulation of orphan proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Natan <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bernardini &amp; Tora, 2024</xref>). By perturbing specific SAGA CORE components, we effectively uncouple KAT2A from its native assembly pathway, rendering it susceptible to proteasomal clearance. The gradual depletion of KAT2A following acute degradation of TADA1 suggests that CORE components may serve a chaperone-like function during or shortly after KAT2A translation, ensuring its successful incorporation into the SAGA complex. This process extends to other subunits that are directly interacting with TADA1, such as its co-translational assembly partner TAF12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Yayli et al, 2023</xref>), or other subunits in close proximity to TADA1 in the CORE and HAT modules, including TAF5L, TAF6L, and TADA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Herbst <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Altogether these results show progressive disruption of SAGA complex integrity and HAT module engagement upon CORE perturbation, ultimately leading to an increased abundance of non-complexed KAT2A that becomes a substrate for collateral protein degradation.</p><p id="P28">Importantly, we identify UBR5 and OTUD5, previously linked to orphan protein quality control and homeostatic turnover of key transcription factors such as MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Schukur <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mark <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>), as critical effectors of collateral KAT2A degradation. These findings suggest that once SAGA disassembles, exposed degrons or misfolded regions within KAT2A are recognised by the orphan surveillance machinery, tagging the protein for proteasomal degradation. Notably, inhibition of key proteasomal regulators or genetic disruption of UBR5 and OTUD5 restores KAT2A protein levels, underscoring the specificity of this degradation pathway.</p><p id="P29">This work has broader implications for therapeutic strategies targeting multi-protein complexes in cancer. While much attention has focused on inhibiting enzymatic activities within multisubunit protein complexes such as SAGA, our data provides further evidence that destabilising critical structural subunits may offer an alternative approach, as targeting non-enzymatic scaffolding proteins could lead to secondary degradation of catalytic components, amplifying the therapeutic impact. Such a strategy could be particularly attractive in cancers dependent on SAGA-mediated acetylation programs, as KAT2A has been identified as a cancer vulnerability in multiple contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Tzelepis <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Malone <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>).

For seeding, cells were washed once with PBS and incubated with Accutase® Cell Detachment Solution (Thermo Fisher, 423201) for 3-5 min at room temperature, quenched with complete medium, and filtered once through a 35 μm nylon mesh before counting. On the day of transduction, cells were transduced with 100 μl of crude viral supernatant (50 μl of crude supernatant diluted 1:1 with complete medium), with one guide RNA transduced per well (in triplicate). Both the parental cell line and reporter expressing cells were transduced with each guide RNA in the arrayed collection. 3, 5, and 7 days after transduction, half of the cells in each well were analysed by flow cytometry. The remaining half were passaged, with fresh complete medium added to a final volume of 200 μl per well. For flow cytometry, the medium was removed from each well, cells washed twice with 100 μl PBS, and incubated with 100 μl Accutase for 5 – 10 min at room temperature. Cells were resuspended in the plate and 50 μl of the cell suspension transferred to a V-bottomed 96-well plate (Thermo Fisher, 277143) containing 50 μl of FACS buffer (PBS containing 2 % FCS, 2 mM EDTA pH 8.0 (Thermo Fisher, AM9260G)). BFP, GFP and mCherry fluorescence was measured for each well using an LSR Fortessa instrument (BD Biosciences) with attached HTS Loader. Flow cytometry data was analysed using FlowJo V10.10.0. To calculate the gRNA dropout for each gene, the fraction of GFP positive cells was determined for each guide at each time point. The data was normalised independently for each guide relative to the fraction of GFP positive cells 3 days after transduction. To calculate KAT2A-BFP protein abundance 5 days after lentiviral transduction, cells were first gated for GFP positive cells (to select only transduced cells) and then mCherry positive cells (to select only cells expressing the reporter). To account for different transduction efficiencies between different GFP expressing gRNAs, BFP and mCherry mean intensity values were normalised by background subtraction of the respective values for reporter negative cells transduced with the same gRNA. Relative KAT2A abundance was calculated as the ratio of background subtracted BFP to mCherry mean fluorescence intensity for each gRNA. Wild type HAP1<sup>Cas9</sup> cells expressing the KAT2A stability reporter were gated in the following way: 1) FSC-A vs SSC-A to gate cells, 2) FSC-A vs FSC-H and SSC-H vs SSC-W to gate single cells, FSC-A vs GFP-A to gate GFP positive cells, and then KAT2A-BFP-A vs mCherry-A to measure the KAT2A-BFP/mCherry ratio.

Next, samples were washed twice with 100 μl UA and then twice with 100 μl 50 mM TEAB. Samples were then digested in 40 μl 50 mM TEAB, pH 8.5, at a protein to enzyme ratio of 50:1. The spin columns were sealed and incubated at 37 °C overnight. On the next day, samples were spun down (14,000 rcf, 20 minutes) and the columns were washed once with 40 μL 50 mM TEAB and once with 50 μL 0.5M NaCl. The combined filtrate was acidified with 30% TFA until a pH below 3 was achieved. Samples were then subjected to C18 cleanup with Pierce™ Peptide Desalting spin columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (ThermoFisher Scientific; Catalog number 89851, 89852).</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Peptide quantification</title><p id="P48">Desalted peptides were reconstituted in LC-grade water, and peptide concentrations were determined using the Pierce™ Quantitative Fluorometric Peptide Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Ref: 23290) according to manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a SpectraMax® i3x Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices).</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>TMT labelling</title><p id="P49">Peptides were subsequently buffered to a final concentration of 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.5. Labelling was performed at a peptide concentration of ≥ 1 μg/μL using TMT reagent prepared in anhydrous acetonitrile at 16.7 μg/μL, applied at a TMT-to-peptide mass ratio of approximately 2:1 to 3:1. The final acetonitrile concentration during the labelling reaction was 35% (v/v). Samples were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle agitation (~600 rpm). Labelling reactions were subsequently quenched by the addition of 5% hydroxylamine solution in HEPES buffer to achieve a final hydroxylamine concentration of 0.2–0.4%, followed by incubation for 15 minutes at room temperature. Labelled peptides were pooled, dried by vacuum centrifugation, and reconstituted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for subsequent processing. Labelling efficiency was routinely assessed following final analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Offline fractionation of TMT pool</title><p id="P50">Pooled TMT labelled sample was concentrated and desalted by using a Pierce Peptide Desalting Spin Columns (Catalog Number 89851 and 89852) according to manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications: Peptide elution was done in 2 steps: 40% ACN, 100mM TEAB and 70% ACN, 100 mM TEAB solution. Eluates were pooled and brought to dryness in a speedvac vacuum concentrator. Dry peptides were resuspended in 30ul 10mM ammonium formate (pH 10) and fractionated by reverse-phase chromatography at basic pH by using a Gemini-NX C18 (150□×□2 mm, 3 μm, 110 A,) column (Phenomenex, Torrance, USA) on an Ultimate 3000 RSLC micro system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a fraction collector. Peptides were separated at a flow rate of 50 μl/min in 10 mM ammonia formate buffer (pH 10.0) and eluted over a 70 min nonlinear gradient from 0 to 100% solvent B (90% acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium formate, pH 10.0). Thirty-six concatenated fractions were collected in a time-based manner (at 30 s intervals) between minute 11.5 and 57. Fractions were immediately acidified by adding 5 μl 30% TFA. After fractionation organics were removed in a vacuum concentrator and sample were stored at -20C until MS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>LC-ESI-MS/MS data acquisition</title><p id="P51">For MS analysis fractions were reconstituted in 150 μl 0.1% TFA and 5 μl was injected onto the machine. For proteomic data acquisition, a nanoflow LC−ESI-MS/MS setup comprised of a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system coupled to a Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (both ThermoFisher Scientific Inc.) was used in positive ionisation mode. MS data acquisition was performed in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. For proteome analyses, peptides were delivered to a trap column (Acclaim™ PepMap™ 100 C18, 3 μm, 5 × 0.3 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flowrate of 5 μL/min in HPLC grade water with 0.1% (v/v) TFA. After 10 min of loading, peptides were transferred to an analytical column (ReproSil Pur C18-AQ, 3 μm, Dr. Maisch, 500 mm × 75 μm, self-packed) and separated using a stepped gradient from minute 11 at 8% solvent B (0.4% (v/v) FA in 90% ACN) to minute 61 at 28% solvent B and minute 81 at 40% solvent B at 300 nL/min flow rate. The nano-LC solvent A was 0.4% (v/v) FA HPLC-grade water. MS1 spectra were recorded at a resolution of 60,000 using an automatic gain control target value of 4 × 10^%E;5 and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. The cycle time was set to 2 seconds. Only precursors with charge state 2 to 6 which fall in a mass range between 360 to 1300 Da were selected and dynamic exclusion of 30 s was enabled. Peptide fragmentation was performed using higher energy collision dissociation (HCD) and a normalised collision energy of 35%. The precursor isolation window width was set to 1.3 m/z. MS2 spectra were acquired at a resolution of 30,000 with an automatic gain control target value of 5 × 10^4 and a maximum injection time of 54 ms. Using synchronous precursor selection, the top 10 fragment ions of the MS2 scans were isolated and subjected to HCD fragmentation in the linear ion trap using 55% normalized collision energy. MS3 spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 50,000 over a scan range of 100 to 1000 Th, using an AGC target of 1e5 and a maximum injection time of 120 ms. The reagent tag type in the filer IsobaricTagExclusion was set to TMTpro.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="P52">For all DDA measurements, MaxQuant (version 2.6.7.0) with its built-in search engine Andromeda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cox <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Tyanova <italic>et al</italic>, 2016a</xref>) was used for peptide identification and quantification. MS2 spectra were searched against all Swiss-Prot canonical protein sequences obtained from UniProt (UP000005640, downloaded: 19 March 2025), supplemented with common contaminants (built-in option in MaxQuant). Trypsin/P was specified as the proteolytic enzyme. Precursor tolerance was set to 4.5 ppm, and fragment ion tolerance to 20 ppm. The minimal peptide length was defined as seven amino acids, and the “match-between-run” function was disabled. Quantification was performed on the MS3 level. "18plex" (TMTpro) was selected as isobaric labels and the reporter mass tolerance was set to 0.003 Da. For proteome analyses, carbamidomethylated cysteine was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine and N-terminal protein acetylation as variable modifications. The FDR was set to 100%. This search results were then used as input files for Oktoberfest (v.0.8.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Picciani <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>). We performed Prosit rescoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gessulat <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>) and quantification via the picked-group-FDR approach (v.0.8.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">The <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). The Prosit models Prosit_2020_irt_TMT for retention time prediction and Prosit_2020_intensity_TMT for intensity prediction were employed. The output files were filtered at 1% FDR. Perseus was used for data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Tyanova <italic>et al</italic>, 2016b</xref>). Briefly, "common contaminants", "reversed", and "only identified by site" were filtered out, the intensities for each TMT channel were log2-transformed, and median-centric normalised. Samples were then categorically annotated to group replicates together and the "Hawaii plot" function with default values was performed. The obtained matrix was exported for further analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Materials availability</title><p id="P53">All reagents generated in this study are available upon request to the lead contact with a completed materials transfer agreement.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Key Resources Table</label><media xlink:href="EMS207602-supplement-Key_Resources_Table.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d2aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Suppl.
