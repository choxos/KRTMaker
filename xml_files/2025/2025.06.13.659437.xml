We combined TurboID-based proximity proteomics with a secondary BRET screen to identify eight novel K-Ras G-domain interactors. We focused on APLP2 and SPRY2 for further characterisation. APLP2 binds K-Ras indirectly via C-Raf, while SPRY2 exhibits properties of a novel effector. Co-immunoprecipitation and BRET assays revealed that the SPRY2 C-terminal fragment (residues 161–315) binds oncogenic RasG12V more strongly than the full-length protein. Both forms localise to the plasma membrane, but this localisation and binding to K-Ras is disrupted by inhibitors of K-Ras membrane anchorage or activity. Mutations at the predicted interface of K-Ras and SPRY2’s C-terminal region affect the interaction. Both full-length SPRY2 and its C-terminal fragment promote differentiation of C2C12 muscle cells, a process requiring MAPK pathway inhibition. Finally, SPRY2 also forms homo- comparators in a triplex were each of the K-Rasor hetero-oligomers with SPRY4. We propose that active K-Ras recruits SPRY2 dimers to the membrane, where they bind Ras and block effector access.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Ras signalling plays a critical role in cell proliferation and differentiation and contributes to a wide range of cellular functions and phenotypes important for health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Simanshu <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). The Ras protein operates like a molecular switch at the inside of the plasma membrane where it links growth factor receptor inputs to effector outputs. Ras effectors bind to Ras in a nucleotide-dependent manner, and their concentration at the plasma membrane leads to functional interactions that influence cell signalling networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Smith, 2023</xref>). For instance, Raf family members are canonical Ras effectors that initiate the MAP kinase cascade, which is classically associated with cell proliferation.</p><p id="P3">The Ras family consists of four isoforms, H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4A and K-Ras4B (hereafter referred to as K-Ras), that are structurally highly related and share a common set of regulators and effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hobbs <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). While their G-domain is 80-90 % identical, the C-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) distinguishes them. The HVR of all Ras proteins becomes farnesylated thus anchoring Ras to cellular membranes. However, isoform-specific functional differences have been observed and in recent years this is thought to at least be partly due to isoform-specific differences in subcellular localisation and occupation of a mosaic of different cell surface signalling nanoclusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abankwa &amp; Gorfe, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Pavic <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The mechanistic links between nanoscale spatial organisation and Ras isoform functional specificity remains poorly understood because of the challenges in characterising the protein and lipid compositions of ephemeral signalling domains. One strategy for understanding the cellular context that Ras proteins operate in has been to employ proteomic analysis of the Ras interactome. Up to 210 proteins were detected as potential direct or indirect Ras interactors capable of being co-immunoprecipitated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Goldfinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Several groups have since utilised BirA proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID), able to detect not only direct interactors but also proteins in proximity to Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Roux <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). BirA fused to the Ras N-terminus catalyses the conjugation of biotin to proteins in ~ 10 nm vicinity that can then be identified via streptavidin enrichment and proteomic analysis. Ras proximal proteome studies to date have typically relied on full length wild type and constitutively active Ras mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Adhikari &amp; Counter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Beganton <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cheng <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kovalski <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). One of the challenges with this approach is the promiscuity of biotinylation since the proximal proteome of the full cellular itinerary of Ras from initial expression to all its destinations is labelled. Combination with a secondary orthogonal screen has been an effective way for prioritising hits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Adhikari &amp; Counter, 2018</xref>). Another refinement has been TurboID that employs a mutated BirA optimised to significantly reduce the biotinylation timeline from 18-24 hours to 10 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Branon <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In this study we aim to identify novel proteins that regulate K-Ras membrane organisation and function in dependence of its activation state.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>TurboID identifies the proximal proteome associated with the G-domain and mutationally activated K-Ras</title><p id="P6">We employed TurboID to identify proteins that operate in close proximity to K-Ras. Experiments were conducted to first identify the K-Ras proximal proteome and then to identify the dependence of this proximity on the K-Ras activation state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) was used to allow for ratiometric proteomic comparison of streptavidin enrichment between each set of comparators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Ong <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). SILAC uses heavy isotope variants of arginine (R) or lysine (K) that allows peptides isolated from samples grown with these isotopes to be distinguished in the mass spectrometer. The available combinations of arginine and lysine isotopes mean that three experimental conditions (triplexes) can be compared in each mass spectrometry run. In all comparator triplexes, a TurboID + biotin control was included to allow pan-experiment comparison of all conditions. For proximity analysis, the other two comparators in a triplex were each of the K-Ras variants +/- biotin, whereas for activation dependence the comparators consisted of treatment with or without K-RasG12C-inhibitor (<bold>G12Ci</bold>), + biotin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S1 and S2</xref>).</p><p id="P7">For K-Ras proximity, we compared three full-length K-Ras variants comprising wild type and the G12C and G12V activated mutants of K-Ras that are commonly found in cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Prior <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). We also included the K-Ras fragment tK, which comprises residues 175-188 of the HVR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Prior <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). While it is targeted to the plasma membrane, it lacks the G-domain (residues 1-165) that is necessary for most, if not all, currently known Ras interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Prior <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Three biological replicates of each experiment were conducted, and the total number of proteins seen in each condition for the proximal proteome experiment was 545 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Data S1</xref>). Shortlisting was based on observing an average of ≥ 2-fold enrichment over the control without biotin across the replicates together with also not being proximal to the cytoplasmic TurboID control (≥ 2-fold + biotin vs – biotin TurboID). Thus, 190 proteins were identified across all K-Ras variants, with 39 proteins observed just with the full-length variants but not tK suggesting their proximity depends on the G-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P8">For activation-dependence of K-Ras proximity, we tested three different selective G12Ci with K-RasG12C and K-Ras wild type conditions. Direct covalent inhibition of mutant K-Ras is an improvement over previous strategies of comparing wild type with constitutively active K-Ras mutants. The proximity of 132 proteins to K-RasG12C was sensitive to G12Ci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Data S1</xref>) and comprised canonical Ras effectors such as Raf and PI3-kinase family members. Raf1 (C-Raf), B-Raf and SPRY2 showed a prominent G12Ci-sensitivity of their K-RasG12C proximity labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S1 and S2</xref>). This might be expected for the former two, given that Raf proteins are well-established Ras effectors. Yet for SPRY2 the G12Ci-sensitive proximity suggests a potentially novel, activation state-dependent interaction.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Profiling for Ras-membrane organisation modulators by BRET</title><p id="P9">To functionally profile proteomic hit proteins as impacting on K-Ras membrane organisation, we performed bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) experiments following knock-down of the hit genes using siRNA.</p><p id="P10">Our primary BRET-screen employed our well-established K-RasG12V-membrane organisation BRET-biosensor, consisting of the BRET-pair RLuc8-K-RasG12V and GFP2-K-RasG12V expressed in HEK293-EBNA cells (<bold>hereafter HEK</bold>). An analogous FRET-biosensor reported on the loss of K-Ras-nanoclustering, -membrane anchorage and -lipidation with a drop in the FRET-signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Parkkola <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). In agreement with this, we previously demonstrated that the K-RasG12V BRET-biosensor responds to an inhibition of Ras trafficking chaperones and Ras lipidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Duval <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kaya <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Manoharan <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Okutachi <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Validation of this assay in the screening setting revealed that ablation of FNTA, the gene encoding for the common α-subunit of farnesyl- and geranylgeranyl-transferases led to the strongest drop of the BRET-signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). A clear effect was also observed after knockdown of trafficking chaperones (PDE6D, CALM1), while nanocluster modulators (LGALS3, TP53BP2) had a less pronounced effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). This latter observation contrasts to our previous FRET-measurements, which displayed a much larger dynamic range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Manoharan <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Posada <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Siddiqui <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Siddiqui <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Based on these validation data, we set a 10 %-change in the BRET-signal as a threshold for high confidence BRET-hits of this primary BRET-screen. A selection of 29 hits from the putative G-domain binder hit list and a meta-analysis of four other K-Ras-proximal proteome studies were then screened (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>). The meta-analysis identified 1,366 proteins proximal to at least one isoform of Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Adhikari &amp; Counter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Beganton <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cheng <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kovalski <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). However, only 12 K-Ras proximal proteins were common to all four other studies and included Raf isoforms and the Ras inactivator NF1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Data S1</xref>). From those proteins that were common to three or four of these studies, we selected a subset of 21 for further investigations.</p><p id="P13">While 4 of 8 (50 %) of the G-domain binder list were confirmed as BRET hits, only 4 of 21 (~ 20 %) from the meta-analysis list qualified as such, suggesting that our differential TurboID-screening approach is advantageous to identify putative K-RasG12V membrane organisation modulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>). All of the BRET-screen hits reduced K-RasG12V membrane organisation BRET after their siRNA-mediated depletion, except for EFNB2, which increased it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To functionally profile hits further in secondary BRET-screens, we employed two additional biosensors. Using the RLuc8-K-RasG12V and C-Raf-RBD-GFP2 biosensor, we could detect perturbations of Ras effector binding. This included also loss of Ras nanoclustering, which we previously showed reduces the recruitment efficiency of effectors from the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Guzman <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Steffen <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>). The third BRET-assay served to assess relative K-Ras selectivity by detecting H-Ras membrane organisation using RLuc8-H-RasG12V and GFP2-H-RasG12V as biosensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Based on this characterisation, we decided to focus on two genes from the BRET-screen hits, APLP2 and SPRY2. APLP2 is not known for any function in concert with K-Ras. SPRY2 belongs to the family of four SPRY-or sprouty-proteins, which are frequently observed hits in Ras proximal proteome screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Adhikari &amp; Counter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Beganton <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cheng <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kovalski <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). To confirm our BRET-screen results for these proteins, we used the more sensitive fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)-Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach. FLIM-FRET data supported a highly significant reduction of K-RasG12V membrane-FRET upon knockdown of either APLP2 or SPRY2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Given that it is unknown how these proteins bind to Ras and impact on its membrane organisation, we continued their investigation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>APLP2 interacts with C-Raf and oncogenic K-Ras</title><p id="P16">APLP2 (Amyloid precursor-like protein 2) is a member of the evolutionary conserved amyloid-precursor-like (APP) protein family. APLP2 is a ubiquitously expressed trans-membrane glycoprotein that becomes proteolytically activated by secretases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Pandey <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). APLP2 is aberrantly expressed in different types of cancers, with over-expression as well as proteolytic cleavage positively correlating with cell growth and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Pandey <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). In the genetically engineered KRAS-G12D-driven KPC-mouse model for spontaneous pancreatic cancer, deletion of APLP2 significantly prolonged survival and reduced metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Poelaert <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Given this genetic interaction of K-Ras and APLP2, we wanted to validate the biochemical interaction of these two proteins.</p><p id="P17">Using co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we characterised the engagement of APLP2 with Ras and Raf proteins. Endogenous APLP2 was ~15-fold more co-immunoprecipitated with GFP2-tagged C-Raf than with GFP2-tagged K-RasG12V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). This was in line with the BRET-profiling data, showing that depletion of APLP2 affects both the K-RasG12V/K-RasG12V- and K-RasG12V/ C-Raf-RBD-BRET signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To understand if the K-Ras interaction was sensitive to the D38A-mutation, which abrogates interactions with all major effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Akasaka <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>), we performed GFP-Trap pull-down experiments of C-terminally SNAP-tagged full length APLP2 with GFP2-K-Ras constructs from HEK cell lysates. All signal obtained with GFP2-CTK, which encodes only the membrane anchoring HVR sequence (residues 166-188) of K-Ras, was considered background.</p><p id="P19">While both endogenous C-Raf and B-Raf co-immunoprecipitated more with K-RasG12V than K-RasG12V-D38A, APLP2-SNAP co-immunoprecipitated to about the same extent with both K-Ras mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C,D</xref>). This is in line with APLP2 primarily engaging with C-Raf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). BRET-screening data suggested a specific effect of APLP2 on K-RasG12V-but not on H-RasG12V-membrane organisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). In line with this GFP2-K-RasG12V co-immunoprecipitated &gt;2-fold more APLP2-SNAP than GFP2-H-RasG12V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E,F</xref>).</p><p id="P20">In conclusion, both BRET-validation and co-immunoprecipitation data suggest that APLP2 may only indirectly engage with active K-RasG12V via Raf-proteins, and less with H-RasG12V. APLP2 may thus stabilise Ras/ Raf-complexation at the plasma membrane and (Raf-dependent) K-Ras nanoclustering, consistent with our previous model for active nanocluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Blazevits <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Siddiqui <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Steffen <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>SPRY2 interacts with oncogenic K-Ras predominantly through its C-terminal region</title><p id="P21">SPRY2 is ubiquitously expressed and the evolutionary most conserved member of the four human or mouse SPRY proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Guy <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Puranik <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>). SPRY proteins are characterised by their C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD), which contains several palmitoylation sites that are important for their localisation to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lim <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Locatelli <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). The N-terminus of SPRYs is more diverse and features a c-Cbl-tyrosine kinase-binding (Cbl-TKB) motif followed by a serine-rich motif (SRM). At the plasma membrane SPRY2 is phosphorylated on a conserved Tyr-55 in the Cbl-TKB motif, which is associated with ubiquitin mediated regulation of SPRY stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Guy <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Drosophila SPRY was identified as an antagonist of the Ras-MAPK pathway during fly trachea development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hacohen <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>).

Using co-immunoprecipitation and cellular BRET-interaction studies, we verified our BRET-screening data, which suggested an interaction preference for K-Ras but no impact of SPRY2-depletion on effector engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Indeed, GFP-Trap pull-down confirmed that endogenous SPRY2 from HEK cell lysates binds ~ 2.5-fold more to GFP2-K-RasG12V than GFP2-C-Raf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). To identify which part of SPRY2 interacts with K-RasG12V, we studied the interactions of SNAP-tagged N-terminal SRM-comprising (N-SPRY, residues 1-160) and C-terminal CRD-comprising fragments (C-SPRY2, residues 161-315) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).

This was confirmed by BRET-interaction data between mNeonGreen (mNG)-tagged SPRY2-fragments and nanoLuc (nL)-tagged K-RasG12V. The BRET-signal was 1.6-fold reduced with N-SPRY2, while that of C-SPRY2 was 1.6-fold increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>).

Also, C-SPRY2 localised in this way, while N-SPRY2 was predominantly in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). This distribution pattern of the constructs can be explained by the fact that the C-terminal CRD of SPRY2 contains 26 cysteine residues, some of which are known to be palmitoylated. Palmitoylation is important for targeting SPRY2 to the plasma membrane, and mutation of two cysteine residues, C265 and C268, re-distributes SPRY2 to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Locatelli <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Thus, the C-terminal half of SPRY2 is sufficient to translocate it to the plasma membrane, where it can engage with RasG12V.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>SPRY2 recruitment to the plasma membrane is sensitive to lipidation and K-RasG12C inhibitors</title><p id="P26">We next wanted to understand if SPRY2 plasma membrane localisation depends on prenylated and active K-Ras.

We then used BRET between K-RasG12V and SPRY2-fragments to quantify the impact of the lipidation inhibitors on their colocalisation-dependent interaction. If both proteins interact at the membrane, high BRET is expected, also due to the up-concentration at the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Parkkola <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). However, if one or both cannot localise to the membrane due to blocked lipidation the BRET-signal would be lowered.

While the N-SPRY2 fragment localised predominantly to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>), its BRET with K-RasG12V was still sensitive to mevastatin, suggesting that membrane localised K-Ras can still engage with N-SPRY2. Consistent with N-SPRY2 being devoid of the C-terminal palmitoylation sites, 2-BP did not affect the BRET, while the combination of mevastatin and 2-BP reduced the BRET to the same extent as mevastatin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). C-SPRY2 showed the highest BRET with K-RasG12V, which was significantly reduced after mevastatin treatment and even more after 2-BP treatment, while the combination of both inhibitors could not further reduce the BRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Our TurboID analysis indicated that SPRY2 interacts with K-RasG12C in a G12Ci-sensitive manner, just as much as well-established effectors C-Raf (Raf1) and B-Raf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).

These observations were somewhat explained when examining the AF3-prediction of the mutant complex, which showed an increase in the number of &lt; 3Å contacts to 25, as compared to 13 in the wt complex.

In our proposed model homo- and hetero-di-/oligomers of SPRY2 bind to the effector binding region of active Ras, which blocks access of effectors that prefer the same lipid domains. Thus, Ras activity is essentially clamped down by SPRY-proteins. In this context we suggest that an amphipathic helix at the C-terminus of SPRY2 is positioned to insert into the membrane and mediates the lipid selectivity.
