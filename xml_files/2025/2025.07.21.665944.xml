These genetic elements drive horizontal gene transfer and play a fundamental role in bacterial ecology and evolution. Theory suggests that plasmids might evolve faster than chromosomes, as the mutation rate per gene should proportionally increase with plasmid copy number. However, the segregation of plasmid copies to daughter cells is random, introducing an additional layer of genetic drift, known as segregational drift, that might delay plasmid evolution. The interplay between plasmid mutational supply and segregational drift determines the evolutionary rate of plasmid-encoded genes, yet the relative contribution of these opposite forces in plasmid evolution remains unclear. Here, we took a classical population genetics framework to devise a mathematical approximation that predicts the fate of plasmid mutations in bacterial populations. We then validate these predictions by integrating computational, experimental, and bioinformatic approaches. Our findings show that plasmid mutation rates scale logarithmically with copy number: while increasing copy number elevates the mutation rate, the effect diminishes at higher copy numbers, where additional copies yield only marginal increases. Nonetheless, the supply of new mutations consistently surpasses the impact of segregational drift across all copy number levels. These results underscore plasmids as powerful platforms for bacterial evolvability and help explain their remarkable prevalence across microbial phylogeny.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Since the origins of life, all species depend on genomic flexibility to adapt to the ever-changing environment. Life is contingent on permanent change. Bacteria readily acquire genomic changes through mutation and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Mutation is inherent to DNA replication: no polymerase can copy DNA without mistakes. And it is from those mistakes that life evolved on Earth. However, excessive mutations cause organisms to lose their identity as gene function collapses and their fitness declines(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Loewe and Hill 2010</xref>). It is thus not surprising that life balances evolvability with genome stability and has evolved mechanisms to keep mutations in check(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Darmon and Leach 2014</xref>). But what if bacteria could benefit from specialized genetic platforms in which specific genes could evolve faster? Theoretically, this would be achieved by locally increasing the supply of mutations, either by directly increasing the rate at which mutations are produced (i.e., decreasing replication fidelity) or by increasing the target size of mutations (i.e., the number of DNA molecules that can acquire mutations)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Sano et al. 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Plasmids —autonomously replicating DNA molecules that coexist with bacterial chromosomes— are ideal candidates to fulfil that role(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Rodríguez-Beltrán et al. 2021</xref>). Plasmids are key agents of HGT and play a fundamental role in bacterial ecology and evolution, where they contribute to disseminating relevant traits such as antibiotic resistance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Wiedenbeck and Cohan 2011</xref>). Several factors highlight plasmids as potential drivers of bacterial evolution. Plasmid genes might evolve faster than chromosomal genes because they are not essential to their host (with notable exceptions, e.g., refs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Anda et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Manzano-Marín et al. 2019</xref>) and are less connected to cellular metabolic and physiological networks(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cooper et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cohen et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Tazzyman and Bonhoeffer 2015</xref>). This relieves plasmid-encoded genes of the functionality constraints typically associated with the evolution of chromosomal genes. Second, plasmids might be more prone to recombination than chromosomes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Niaudet et al. 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Rodríguez-Beltrán et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Zhang et al. 2019</xref>). Recombination provides bacterial plasmids with extraordinary modularity, shuffling genes and combining beneficial alleles in the same backbone(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cooper 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Barlow et al. 2008</xref>). And third, plasmid-encoded genes experience an increase in gene dosage that typically translates into higher expression. This magnifies the selective impact of mutations with slight beneficial effects(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Million-Weaver et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Couce et al. 2015</xref>; San <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Millan et al. 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Critically, most plasmids are stably present at more than one copy per cell (median= 3.02, IQR= 10.29 copies per chromosome; data from ref.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Ramiro-Martínez et al. 2025</xref>)), providing an effective polyploid genetic platform(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Rodríguez-Beltrán et al. 2021</xref>). This raises complex evolutionary implications that are far from understood. On one hand, classical evolutionary theory predicts that the rate of new mutations should increase with gene copy number because each additional copy has an independent chance of acquiring a mutation. Therefore, due to their stable polyploid nature, any given gene should acquire mutations faster when encoded on a plasmid. Supporting this view, experimental evolution showed that <italic>de novo</italic> mutations conferring antibiotic resistance occur more frequently when the target gene is encoded on a plasmid(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Martinez and Baquero 1990</xref>; San <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Millan et al. 2016</xref>). Moreover, numerical simulations and experimental approaches demonstrate that mutation rates per gene increase with plasmid copy number (PCN) as long as the mutations are dominant(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Rodríguez-Beltrán et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Santer and Uecker 2020a</xref>). This indicates that plasmids can enhance the rate of (beneficial) mutations, thereby increasing the evolvability of the genes they carry(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Couce et al. 2015</xref>; San <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Millan et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Rodríguez-Beltrán et al. 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P5">On the other hand, novel plasmid mutations experience complex allele dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Rodriguez-Beltran et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Rodríguez-Beltrán et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Santer et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Rossine et al. 2025</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). New plasmid mutations only appear in a single plasmid molecule. This mutated plasmid copy will co-exist intracellularly under heteroplasmy (also known as heterozygosity) with other non-mutated plasmid molecules until they eventually segregate into different cell lineages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Novick 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Rodriguez-Beltran et al. 2018</xref>). Since plasmid segregation is random, daughter cells inherit an allelic set that may differ from the one in the mother cell (for example, only wild-type copies). The fixation time of plasmid mutations is thus delayed by an additional layer of genetic drift termed segregational drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Ilhan et al. 2019</xref>). Recent studies suggest that segregational drift hinders the evolution of plasmid-encoded beneficial alleles, as they are more prone to being lost from populations than chromosomal ones(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Garoña et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Garoña et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Dewan and Uecker 2025</xref>; Pisera and Liu 2025).</p><p id="P6">Therefore, the evolutionary rate of plasmid-encoded genes depends on the interplay between two opposing forces: increased mutational supply and segregational drift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>).

Specifically, we developed a plasmid-centered population genetics model that shifts the focus from bacterial hosts to plasmids as independent evolutionary entities. In this approach, the key parameter N, representing population size in traditional population genetics, corresponds to the PCN. Thus, each bacterial reproduction event along the ancestral lineage is treated as a separate plasmid generation with a fixed population size set equal to the PCN.</p><p id="P8">We model plasmid inheritance using a discrete-generation approach related to the Wright-Fisher model(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Durrett 2008</xref>), where plasmids act as individuals that replicate and segregate randomly across generations. More formally, our model falls within the broader Cannings class of population genetics models, which allows for variable offspring distributions while maintaining a fixed population size. During each cellular reproduction event, a random subset of plasmids is inherited, and the remaining copies are replenished by replication, preserving a constant copy number. This setup captures the random segregational dynamics of plasmids and allows us to trace the ancestry of plasmids across time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Assuming that a low-probability neutral mutation can occur at each plasmid replication event, the count of distinct mutations in a sample correlates with the length of the genealogy tree. Consequently, the model suggests that nonlinear effects influence the genealogy of plasmid samples, and at certain scales, these genealogies align with the Kingman Coalescent universality class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>, see methods). Under these conditions, the probability of two plasmids sharing a common ancestor decreases with PCN, and the total branch length of the genealogy grows logarithmically with copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). As a result, the effective mutation rate (µ<sub>eff</sub>), defined as the average number of distinct mutations per generation per plasmid, is expected to scale with the logarithm of PCN: <italic>µ</italic><sub><italic>eff</italic></sub> =<italic>μ</italic> (<italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>+ <italic>c</italic><sub>2</sub> ln(<italic>PCN</italic>)), where <italic>μ</italic> denotes the underlying mutation rate (in mutations per generation and base pair) and <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>and <italic>c</italic><sub>2</sub> are constants. This relationship suggests that increasing PCN raises the mutational supply, yet the rate of increase diminishes at higher PCNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Simulating multilevel evolution in multicopy plasmids</title><p id="P9">To evaluate the predictions of the population genetics model, we implemented a computational framework based on object-oriented programming principles (see methods). The model simulates bacterial populations as collections of individual cells, each containing plasmids modelled as independent entities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). This structure allows for the simulation of multi-level evolutionary processes, capturing key mechanisms — including random plasmid replication, segregation, and mutation— across multiple generations under controlled <italic>in-silico</italic> conditions.</p><p id="P10">In the model, each cell in the population contains a defined number of plasmid copies that replicate during cell growth until the target PCN is reached. Plasmid copies are randomly distributed to daughter cells during cell division, and a single bacterial cell is randomly selected at each generation to seed the next population, creating a bottleneck that drives genetic drift. Mutations occur with a non-zero probability in each plasmid copy during replication. Each mutation is recorded as an attribute of the corresponding plasmid object and includes details such as the generation of occurrence, allowing precise tracking of mutations over time within the simulation framework (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 2-5</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We performed 1,000 independent simulations for a range of PCN, each elapsing 1,400 bacterial generations. At the end of the simulation, plasmids were sampled from the final bacterial population to reconstruct their evolutionary relationships. We then built a lineage tree by tracing the ancestry of each plasmid based on its generational history. Plasmids that share a common lineage (i.e., descend from the same ancestral plasmid in earlier generations) are grouped together, with branches representing points where lineages diverged due to random segregation events during cell division (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Finally, we quantified the total length of the lineage tree, defined as the cumulative distance from the root to the tips across all plasmid lineages. Consistent with the theoretical predictions, as PCN increases and we sample more plasmids per cell, the total branch length also increases, reflecting more coalescing events and longer genealogical paths. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>, this increase slows at higher PCN levels, consistent with a logarithmic increase in tree length as the copy number rises, even though the total tree length continues to grow. Consequently, our computational model aligns with the theoretical prediction, and the number of mutations observed increases with PCN but at a diminishing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>A mutation accumulation experiment validates computational and theoretical predictions</title><p id="P13">To experimentally test our theoretical and computational predictions, we used a mutation accumulation (MA) approach. MA experiments typically consist of serially passaging multiple replicate clonal lines by repeated streaking on rich agar plates to generate new colonies initiated by a single cell. This severe bottleneck minimizes natural selection, allowing genomes to accumulate nearly any mutation regardless of its selective effect, except those that are lethal or highly deleterious(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Barrick and Lenski 2013</xref>). After a number of passages, mutations across entire genomes are identified by sequencing, allowing for direct estimation of mutation rates by simply counting the number of genetic changes accumulated over a defined number of generations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Halligan and Keightley 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Barrick and Lenski 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To conduct the MA experiment, we used a hypermutator derivative (Δ<italic>mutS</italic>) of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> EPI300 strain carrying a plasmid with a tunable PCN. This plasmid, dubbed pTA44, can initiate replication from two distinct origins: <italic>ori2</italic> from the F plasmid and <italic>oriV</italic> from the RK2 plasmid(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aakvik et al. 2009</xref>). Replication from <italic>ori2</italic> is constitutive and leads to approximately one copy per cell. Replication from <italic>oriV</italic> depends on the presence of the replication initiation protein TrfA, whose expression is chromosomal in the EPI300 strain and controlled by the arabinose-inducible P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). Therefore, the PCN of the pTA44 plasmid shows a wide dynamic range spanning from ~1 copy per cell in the absence of arabinose to nearly 70 copies at high arabinose concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). Since bacterial growth was relatively robust to changes in PCN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>), we selected three arabinose concentrations (0%, 0.0005%, and 0.05%) for subsequent experiments. These yielded, on average, 1, 10, and 60 plasmid copies per cell, corresponding to low, medium, and high PCN regimes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We serially propagated 12 independent lineages for each PCN regimen by daily restreaking a randomly selected colony onto fresh LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate arabinose concentration over 30 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). During each serial passage, bacterial populations expanded from a single cell to 10<sup>8</sup> cells, corresponding to ~24 bacterial generations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). This corresponds to approximately 670 generations per lineage and a total of ~6,500 generations for each PCN regimen (<bold>Supplementary dataset 1</bold>). The number of generations was generally conserved across all lines throughout the experiment, suggesting that selection played a minimal role under our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>, Spearman’s rank correlation test between number of generations and days, p = 0.81, rho = 0.014). Similarly, PCN was stable across arabinose concentrations, except in one line of the medium copy regimen (p5B3), which was excluded due to a <italic>trfA</italic> missense mutation causing a sharp decline in PCN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 11–12</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We sequenced the genomes of all evolved lineages and the ancestor and identified all mutations (single-nucleotide polymorphisms —SNPs—, and small indels). A key feature of plasmid segregation and replication dynamics is that multiple plasmid alleles can coexist within the same cell, leading to plasmid-mediated heteroplasmy or heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Novick 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Rodriguez-Beltran et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Garoña et al. 2021</xref>). Therefore, plasmid-encoded alleles can be polymorphic even in otherwise clonal lineages. To account for this possibility, we kept mutations with an allelic frequency of at least 5%, as done previously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Garoña et al. 2021</xref>). Following this approach, we identified 284 plasmidic and 7,620 chromosomal mutations (<bold>Supplementary dataset 1</bold>).</p><p id="P17">We calculated the spontaneous mutation rate for both plasmids and chromosomes by dividing the number of mutations by the length of each replicon and the number of generations elapsed for each line.

In contrast, plasmid mutation rates were significantly higher in the medium and high PCN regimes than in the low PCN (Pairwise comparisons using Wilcoxon rank sum exact test, p &lt; 10<sup>-4</sup> between low and medium, and low and high copy number regimes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). There were no significant differences between the medium and high PCN regimes, despite a ~5-fold difference in PCN (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p = 0.27). Strikingly, at the low PCN regime, where plasmids and chromosomes were present at comparable copy numbers (~1 copy per cell), plasmid mutation rates were approximately five times higher than those of the chromosome.</p><p id="P18">We then analyzed the mutation rates of each evolved line individually. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref> shows that plasmid mutation rates increased with PCN and were positively correlated (Spearman’s rank correlation, rho = 0.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup>). However, the rate of increase diminished progressively as PCN rose. We observed a growing divergence between the observed mutation rate and the expected rate if mutations accumulated linearly with PCN, using the chromosomal mutation rate as a baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>).

While some of these mutations may be too infrequent to be detected, others may increase in frequency through genetic drift or selection and become detectable in the sequencing reads.

Agent-based simulations supported these predictions, showing that plasmid genealogical tree lengths scale logarithmically with PCN. While different model formulations may affect the absolute number of mutations, the logarithmic relationship between PCN and mutation accumulation remains consistent.

Mutation rates markedly increased as PCN rose from ~1 to 10 copies but seem to plateau beyond this point, even at 60 copies. These results were best explained by a logarithmic regression, which captured the decelerating relationship between PCN and mutation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Finally, we analyzed extensive sequencing data as independent fluctuation assays and showed that plasmids with higher PCNs tend to accumulate more detectable mutations per base pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).

Population genetics offers an intuitive explanation: during severe bottlenecks and over many bacterial generations, most plasmid mutations are lost due to segregational drift, reducing their contribution to final plasmid diversity. However, over shorter time scales, the increase in mutational supply surpasses segregational drift, leading to a rise in the mutation rate associated with plasmids.</p><p id="P29">Consequently, under our study conditions, most of the plasmid mutations we detected likely arose shortly before sampling. This has broader implications for evolutionary analyses, as the rapid and recent accumulation of mutations in HCP can potentially complicate efforts to infer accurate evolutionary trajectories from endpoint data.</p><p id="P30">A crucial element of our theoretical, computational, and experimental (but not bioinformatic) analyses is using a single-cell bottleneck and the lack of selective forces. This maximizes segregational drift and minimizes the effective population size of plasmid lineages. Theory predicts that under less stringent bottlenecks, the effective mutation rate should be higher due to reduced effect of drift, suggesting that our estimates likely represent a lower bound. Future work applying similar approaches across a range of bottleneck sizes will help estimate effective mutation rates for plasmids in diverse ecological settings.</p><p id="P31">Beyond plasmids, our findings likely extend to any genetic element present in multiple copies and subject to random segregation during cell division, such as plastid and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).

Plasmid nucleotide FASTA files were sketched with Mash(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ondov et al. 2016</xref>) (k = 21, sketch = 10,000) to obtain an all-against-all pair-wise distance matrix; a k-nearest-neighbour graph was then built by connecting each plasmid to its three closest neighbours when the Mash distance was ≤ 0.1, and the resulting network was partitioned with the Fast-Greedy community-detection algorithm implemented in igraph(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Csardi and Nepusz 2006</xref>), assigning every plasmid to a unique cluster.</p><p id="P52">We treated each plasmid as a replicate within groups categorized by clusters, replicon types, and PTUs as if they were replicates in a classical Luria–Delbrück fluctuation assay. The realized number of mutations (N<sub>mut</sub>) per plasmid group and 95% CIs were calculated using the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), applying the <italic>newton.LD</italic> and <italic>confint.LD</italic> functions of the rSalvador package v1.9 for R(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Zheng 2017</xref>). The p<sub>0</sub> method was also used as a control to include the samples without mutations, with the <italic>LD.p0.est</italic> function. µ<sub>eff</sub> for both chromosomes and plasmids was then calculated by dividing µ by the total length of the replicon in base pairs. This led to the estimation of µ<sub>eff</sub> for 723 genomes and 1,598 plasmids.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS207448-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d8aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Álvaro San Millán, Javier DelaFuente, Alfonso Santos-López, and João Gama for their helpful suggestions.

The left panel illustrates the segregation of plasmids with a single copy, where a mutant plasmid (red) is inherited during cell division. The right panel shows the dynamics of multicopy plasmids, where segregation occurs randomly upon division and mutant plasmids are either inherited or lost during cell division due to segregational drift. <bold>b)</bold> The illustration conceptually shows the trade-off between the probability of a new mutation arising (red line) and the probability of that mutation being inherited (green line) in subsequent generations. The mutational supply scales with PCN. In contrast, the chance that any given mutation is retained across generations decreases with PCN, as mutant plasmid copies are more likely to be lost due to segregational drift.

Branch length is defined as the cumulative distance from the root to the tips of the tree. Simulation results show that while total branch length increases with PCN, the rate of increase slows at higher PCN values. <bold>d)</bold> Number of mutations per generation per plasmid as a function of PCN.

The copy number of five biological replicates was calculated by qPCR. The average PCN of 9 technical replicates was 1.31 copies for 0% of arabinose, 9.32 for 0.0005%, 40.07 for 0.005%, 57.70 for 0.05%, and 67.65 for 0.5%. <bold>c)</bold> Experimental setup. We conducted a MA experiment at different arabinose concentrations. Each day, one random colony of each line was transferred to a new Petri dish with the appropriate arabinose concentration. This cycle was repeated for 30 days. <bold>d</bold>) Boxplots show plasmid mutation rates (mutations per generation and locus) at different arabinose concentrations, which correlate with plasmid copy number. Each point represents an independent replicate. Boxes indicate the median and interquartile range; whiskers extend to 1.5× IQR. Chromosomal mutation rates (grey) are shown for reference.

First, cultures were grown to extract the genomic DNA. This growth time is sufficient to accumulate mutations within the culture population. Once the DNA was extracted and sequenced, we used the available reads in the NCBI database to search for these mutations. Reads are mapped against their respective assemblies to detect mutations within the “population” of reads, with a minimum allele frequency (AF) of 5% and a maximum of 50%. <bold>b)</bold> Schematic representation of how mutation density was estimated using sequencing data. For each plasmid cluster, the total number of detected mutations was used to determine the realized number of mutations per cluster (N<sub>mut</sub>) using a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm. Mutation density was then calculated by normalizing the number of realized mutations by the within-cluster median plasmid length. <bold>c)</bold> Distribution of PCN in E. coli plasmids (n = 1,598).
