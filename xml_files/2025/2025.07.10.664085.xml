When we analysed the genome sequences of two clinical <italic>E. faecium</italic> strains isolated in Birmingham, UK, we found two pRUM-like plasmids, pHHEf1 and pHHEf2. They were approximately 25 kb in size and shared the same 10 kb backbone, but contained starkly different accessory regions that were bounded by and interspersed with the IS<italic>26</italic> family insertion sequence IS<italic>1216</italic>. pHHEf1 contained a complete set of vancomycin resistance genes, while pHHEf2 contained aminoglycoside and erythromycin resistance genes along with an integrated small plasmid, pCOLA. It appeared that IS<italic>1216</italic> had driven the diversification of these accessory regions. We sought to characterise the role of IS<italic>1216</italic> in the broader evolution of pRUM-like plasmids by performing comparative analyses on 152 complete plasmid sequences from five continents. Extensive IS<italic>1216</italic>-mediated variation included backbone deletions, acquisition and loss of 10 different antibiotic resistance genes, and the formation of cointegrates with plasmids of at least 10 different replicon types. Cointegration events have introduced accessory segments with diverse functions, including horizontal transfer determinants and genes for bacteriocin T8. The derivations of these acquired segments highlight the impact of IS<italic>1216</italic> in driving gene exchange between <italic>Enterococcus</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> species. We traced the emergence of the pRUM-like lineage to a putative ancestor found in a vancomycin-sensitive ST17 <italic>E. faecium</italic> isolated in 1997. The ancestral plasmid, pCANE, includes the entire pRUM backbone with an additional 44.9 kb in place of the pRUM accessory region. The 44.9 kb segment includes putative conjugation determinants, suggesting that the emergence of the pRUM-like lineage coincided with a loss of transfer functions. We propose an IS<italic>1216</italic> driven model for the evolution of pRUM-like plasmids, which appear to have arisen in <italic>E. faecium</italic> ST17 and contributed to the international success of CC17 as an opportunistic pathogen.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>IS<italic>1216</italic></kwd><kwd>plasmid</kwd><kwd>pRUM</kwd><kwd><italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic></kwd><kwd>multidrug resistance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2"><italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> is a commensal resident of the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> Some <italic>E. faecium</italic> strains can cause opportunistic extra-intestinal infections that range from urinary tract infections to bacteraemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> These infections are particularly prominent in nosocomial settings, with intensive care units (ICUs) sites of significant concern. <italic>E. faecium</italic> was recognised as a nosocomial pathogen by the 1980s, but its rising prominence in the late 1990s coincided with the acquisition of vancomycin resistance by pathogenic strains.

The pRE25-derived sequence in pE4566_3 is separated by an IS<italic>1216</italic>-bounded segment that contains the <italic>tet</italic>(L) and <italic>tet</italic>(M) tetracycline resistance genes. The tetracycline resistance segment is comprised of sequences with two distinct derivations – the <italic>tet</italic>(L) gene is part of a segment derived from the <italic>E. faecalis</italic> plasmid pAMα1 (GenBank accession AF503772),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> while the <italic>tet</italic>(M) gene is in a partial Tn<italic>6085</italic>-like element, relatives of which have been associated with the dissemination of <italic>tet</italic>(M) in <italic>E. faecium</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> The structure of this segment suggests that IS<italic>1216</italic> captured these tetracycline resistance genes together after the Tn<italic>6085</italic>-like element inserted in a pAMα1-like plasmid.</p><p id="P20">Three pRUM-like plasmids in this collection were found in isolates of ST5 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).

In addition to pCOLA, pWC79 contains another small plasmid, pDRY, which features an internal 8 bp TSD and was also acquired in a copy-in cointegration event.

However, although the accessory region is bounded by directly oriented copies of IS<italic>1216</italic>, the flanking plasmid backbone does not feature a TSD. This suggests that the acquisition of the accessory region was associated with an IS<italic>1216</italic>-mediated deletion event that removed part of the original backbone sequence along with one or both copies of the TSD. A plasmid ancestral to the pRUM-like lineage would therefore be expected to lack the IS<italic>1216</italic>-bounded accessory region, and to feature a larger backbone sequence, part of which is identical or near-identical to the pRUM-like backbone.</p><p id="P22"><italic>E. faecium</italic> E1162 is a vancomycin-sensitive ST17 strain that was isolated from a bloodstream infection in France in 1997.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> When the E1162 genome was screened for plasmid replicons, a pRUM-like <italic>rep</italic> gene was found in a circular 57,031 bp plasmid. This plasmid, pCANE, contained the entire 10.2 kb pRUM-like backbone, which was 99.85% identical (10259/10274 bp) to that of pRUM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Screening with ISFinder revealed that the pRUM-like backbone segment in pCANE was interrupted by a single copy of IS<italic>Efa4</italic>, which was found downstream of the <italic>axe</italic>-<italic>txe</italic> genes. pCANE contained an additional 44,866 bp region that was located in precisely the same position as the pRUM-like accessory region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). No sequence identical or near-identical to this 44.9 kb segment was found in GenBank (last search 06/06/2025). The closest GenBank matches were to other <italic>E. faecium</italic> plasmids, which were 98.56% identical (CP027503 and CP027514; 94% coverage). Two identical copies of a novel IS<italic>110</italic> family element, here named IS<italic>Efa20</italic>, were the only IS found in the 44.9 kb segment. Notably, IS<italic>1216</italic> was not present in pCANE. Additional content in pCANE outside the pRUM-like backbone was not associated with transposase genes or any recognisable MGE, and might therefore represent the proposed ancestral backbone sequence. We found 32 open reading frames in the 44.9 kb segment, many of which were putative transfer determinants. These included genes for pilus/fimbrae formation (pilin, isopeptide and sortases), DNA processing and transfer (a relaxase, coupling protein and ATPase) and establishment in recipient cells (anti-restriction and ssDNA-binding).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">Here we have characterised structural variation associated with diversification in the pRUM-like lineage of MDR plasmids, found primarily in <italic>E. faecium</italic>. pRUM-like plasmids have been associated with antibiotic resistance in the species for over two decades, but this is the first study to investigate their diverse accessory content from a topological perspective, and to trace the evolution of the lineage to a putative ancestor. We have outlined the crucial role of the IS<italic>26</italic> family element IS<italic>1216</italic> in the emergence and evolution of this lineage, mediating the loss of an ancestral transfer region, as well as the acquisition and continuing modulation of accessory segments. This has provided insights into the emergence of an important MDR platform, and more widely into the role of plasmid lineages in the success of bacterial clones that harbour them.</p><p id="P24">pRUM-like plasmids are comprised of an approximately 10 kb backbone and an IS<italic>1216</italic>-bounded accessory region that ranged from 809 bp (a single IS<italic>1216</italic>) to 285 kb in the collection of 152 plasmids examined here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The pRUM-like backbone has been interrupted by the insertion of multiple IS, and the copies of IS<italic>1216</italic> at the boundaries of the accessory region have deleted adjacent backbone segments on multiple occasions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, the essentiality of some backbone genes to replication and stable maintenance has constrained the locations and extents of insertion and deletion events. Apart from the <italic>vanB</italic> determinants that have been acquired once through insertion of Tn<italic>1549</italic> in a backbone position, all other functional accessory genes have been acquired in the IS<italic>1216</italic>-bounded accessory region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The accessory region and its associated IS<italic>1216</italic> are therefore critical for the extensive diversification of the pRUM-like lineage.</p><p id="P25">We conclude that pCANE, carried by an ST17 <italic>E. faecium</italic> clinical isolate from 1997, is an ancestor of pRUM-like plasmids. pCANE does not contain the pRUM-like IS<italic>1216</italic>-bounded accessory region, but instead contains a unique 44.9 kb backbone segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This segment includes putative transfer determinants, which suggests that the ancestors of pRUM-like plasmids were conjugative. The evolution of pRUM-like plasmids from a pCANE-like structure can be explained by events mediated by IS<italic>1216</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). First, a copy-in event would have introduced an IS<italic>1216</italic> TU to the pCANE backbone, generating a PCT structure flanked by an 8 bp TSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). With the available data, it is not possible to determine the precise backbone location of this insertion, or whether one of the TSD copies remains in the sequence of pRUM. The loss of the 44.9 kb backbone segment, and one or both copies of the 8 bp TSD, likely occurred in one or more IS<italic>1216</italic>-mediated deletion events to generate a pRUM-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Further deletion events have continued to degrade the original backbone, as evidenced by the collection examined here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P26">The loss of putative transfer determinants following the acquisition of an accessory region suggests that the emergence of the pRUM-like plasmid lineage involved an evolutionary trade-off, exchanging conjugative transfer ability for increased plasticity and access to a diverse pool of IS<italic>1216</italic>-associated genes. It is interesting to consider the consequences of this trade-off for the success of the pRUM-like lineage and its primary host, CC17 <italic>E. faecium</italic>. It is conceivable that the carriage of a stable and largely immobile MDR platform was an important contributor to the widespread success of CC17. In sweeping waves of selective pressure, as might be experienced in the human gut under courses of antibiotics, the pRUM-like plasmid-bearing CC17 would have an advantage over competing clones, while its MDR platform would be unlikely to transfer to those competitors. The absence of a transfer region in pRUM-like plasmids might provide another advantage to the host by reducing the risk of bacteriophage predation in the gut. Conjugative pili serve as extracellular targets for some bacteriophage, with plasmid carriage sensitising their hosts to infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> This risk would have been ameliorated by the loss of the pCANE genes that appear to determine a conjugative pilus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Despite these host advantages, horizontal mobility remains an important element in plasmid success, and re-establishing a degree of transfer capacity would be selfishly advantageous for the pRUM-like lineage. We have identified multiple cointegration events that have introduced putative conjugation or mobilisation determinants, and hypothesise that these acquisitions represent possible avenues for horizontal dissemination. These observations are similar to those made in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, where it has been demonstrated that the integration of small plasmids carrying <italic>oriT</italic> mimics is a common mobilisation strategy for larger non-conjugative plasmids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> Supporting the role of cointegrates in HGT, there is experimental evidence documenting the IS<italic>1216</italic>-mediated formation of a cointegrate comprised of pRUM-like and conjugative pHTß-like plasmids, facilitating transfer of the pRUM-like plasmid from <italic>E. faecium</italic> to <italic>E. faecalis</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup></p><p id="P27">Beyond the pRUM-like lineage, our findings highlight the important role of IS<italic>1216</italic> in the shuttling of genetic material between <italic>Enterococcus</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> species.

Statement</title></caption><p>Experimental work has shown that the insertion sequence IS<italic>1216</italic>, found in <italic>Enterococcus</italic>, shares the cointegrate formation properties of the well-characterised IS<italic>26</italic> of Gram-negative bacteria, which is a major contributor to the movement and accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes in important human pathogens. It seems likely that IS<italic>1216</italic> plays a similar role in the emergence and spread of multidrug resistance in <italic>Enterococcus</italic>. However, the actions of IS<italic>1216</italic> in the genus have not been the subject of focused comparative studies. Here, we provide genomic evidence for the crucial role of IS<italic>1216</italic> in the evolution of the pRUM-like multidrug resistance plasmid lineage that has been found in <italic>E. faecium</italic> isolated globally. We have traced the evolution of the pRUM-like lineage to a cryptic ancestral plasmid found in a vancomycin-sensitive human clinical strain isolated in the 1990s.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Birmingham pRUM-like plasmids pHHEf1 and pHHEf2.</title><p>Scaled circular maps of plasmids pHHEf1 and pHHEf2 above a linear alignment of the two.
