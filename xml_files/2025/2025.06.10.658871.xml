Mounting evidence suggests that, in addition to recognizing phosphorylated tyrosine (pTyr) residues through specific phosphobinding modules, many protein kinases selectively recognize pTyr directly adjacent to the tyrosine residue they phosphorylate and catalyze the formation of twin pTyr-pTyr sites. Here, we demonstrate the importance of this phosphopriming-driven twin pTyr signaling in promoting cell cycle progression through the cell cycle-inhibitory protein p27<sup>Kip1</sup>. We identify, structurally resolve, and tune two distinct molecular determinants driving the selective recognition of pTyr directly N- and C-terminal to the target phospho-acceptor tyrosine site. We further show structural and biochemical conservation in this recognition, and identify cancer-associated alterations to these determinants that are unable to recognize phosphoprimed substrates. Finally, using an <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model of leukemia we show that Bcr-Abl mutants unable to recognize phosphoprimed substrates paradoxically result in enhanced tumor development and progression. These data indicate that Bcr-Abl, like other proto-oncogenes such as Ras or Myc, engages both pro- and anti-oncogenic programs − but in the case of Bcr-Abl, this is accomplished through a mechanism involving traditional and phosphoprimed substrate recognition.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cells respond to internal and external cues by conditionally activating signaling pathways and downstream molecular programs. The conditional activation of these pathways most commonly occurs through the post-translational modifications of proteins which are subsequently specifically recognized by downstream signaling components, ensuring precise and temporally controlled signal transduction. In phosphorylation-based signaling systems, for instance, upon becoming active, protein tyrosine kinases act as “writers” by phosphorylating tyrosine residues in their protein substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> to generate phosphorylated tyrosine (henceforth referred to as pTyr). These pTyr sites are subsequently recognized and bound by phospho-binding domains (“readers”), such as SH2 (Src Homology 2) and PTB (pTyr-binding) domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, or by protein tyrosine phosphatases that remove phosphorylation, reverting them back to tyrosine sites (“erasers”)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The discovery of specific protein domains capable of independently “writing”, “reading” or “erasing” these post-translational modifications has provided a basis to consider signaling systems as highly modular<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Despite this modularity, it is becoming increasingly clear that, far from being independent steps, many of these processes co-occur and are tightly interrelated. Initial evidence for this interrelation emerged from the observation that “reader” and “writer” protein domains often co-occur within the same protein, for instance in protein tyrosine kinases containing SH2 domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Harboring “reader” domains enables protein kinases to recruit previously phosphorylated tyrosine substrates (a process often referred to as “priming” phosphorylation) and phosphorylate them at additional sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In contrast to pTyr signaling utilizing independent “reader” and “writer” domains with spatially separated pTyr sites to propagate downstream signaling events, we and others have more recently discovered that “priming” phosphorylation events can also occur at positions directly adjacent to each other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Notably, recognition of pTyr-Tyr (pYY) or Tyr-pTyr (YpY) sites and their subsequent phosphorylation to form twin pTyr-pTyr (pYpY) sites can only be possible if the protein kinase domain itself can recognize pTyr residues. In other words, the recognition of pTyr by the kinase domain is an indispensable prerequisite for “priming” signaling and, in doing so, some protein kinase domains effectively function as both “readers” and “writers”. Given this, two fundamental biological questions remain unresolved: how does pTyr recognition take place at a structural and molecular level, and wWhat effects do perturbations in these systems have in normal and aberrant cell signaling, such as in cancer?</p><p id="P5">Here, we show that a large subset of protein tyrosine kinases is capable of selectively recognizing pTyr directly adjacent to the tyrosine residue they phosphorylate. Initially focusing on the well-studied non-receptor tyrosine kinases Abl and Src, that are both aberrantly activated in cancer, our data shows that while Abl selectively recognizes pTyr directly N-terminal to its target tyrosine, Src conversely recognizes pTyr directly C-terminal to the target tyrosine. Using Abl and Src as exemplars, we identify the two distinct molecular and structural determinants driving the selective recognition of pTyr directly N-terminal and C-terminal to their target phospho-acceptor tyrosine site. By combining biochemical screening of other non-receptor and receptor tyrosine kinases and solving the crystal structure of the insulin receptor kinase (IRK), we expand our understanding of how tyrosine kinases recognize pTyr.</p><p id="P6">Finally, to evaluate its cellular relevance, we disrupt twin pTyr signaling in two different ways. First, we perturb the shared Abl and Src substrate p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and show that phosphorylation of twin tyrosine (YY) sites positively promotes cell cycle progression. Second, by using structure-based mutants in an <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model of leukemia, we show that Bcr-Abl variants with disrupted pTyr recognition led to more aggressive cancer progression, revealing a new anti-oncogenic signaling arm downstream of the pro-oncogenic Bcr-Abl kinase. While other pro-oncogenes like Ras or Myc are known to engage anti-oncogenic programs through collateral signaling pathways, our data suggest that Bcr-Abl can directly engage anti-oncogenic programs through its twin pTyr signaling arm.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The Non-Receptor Tyrosine Kinases Abl and Src Conditionally Phosphorylate Twin Tyrosine Substrates by Selectively Recognizing pTyr</title><p id="P7">Recent results from our lab and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> have revealed, using position-specific peptide libraries (PSPL, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1A</xref>), that a surprising number of tyrosine kinases tolerate, or even prefer, a previously phosphorylated amino acid in one of the sites proximal to the tyrosine phosphoacceptor residue. These tyrosine kinases can thereby catalyze the creation of pYpY sites in their substrates.</p><p id="P8">Analysis of the human proteome (UP000005640)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> revealed 28,637 twin YY sites, of which 1,746 have been annotated as being phosphorylated on at least one of the two residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Proteins containing these YpY and pYY sites were primarily cytosolic and were enriched in the Gene Ontology (GO) terms “protein binding”, “transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway”, “kinase activity”, “protein autophosphorylation”, “protein-containing complex”, “protein autophosphorylation”, and “intracellular signal transduction” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) relative to the total proteome.</p><p id="P9">The four possible phosphorylation states of a tandem tyrosine motif (YY, pYY, YpY, pYpY) suggest a potentially broader regulatory set of mechanisms for tyrosine kinase signaling. First, the two individual sites might operate redundantly, with either phosphorylation being sufficient to enable a biological consequence (i.e., an “OR” gate). Second, they might operate to amplify signaling, with double phosphorylation resulting in a stronger consequence than either single phosphorylation alone (i.e., like an “AND” gate). Finally, the sites might operate combinatorially, with up to four totally independent consequences for the four possible phosphorylation states. Each of these possibilities allows the potential convergence of tyrosine kinase signaling pathways on YY-containing motifs in a substrate. To examine this, we focused on the first two oncogenic non-receptor tyrosine kinases ever identified, Src<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and Abl<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, as examples of well-studied and clinically relevant model tyrosine kinases to study these functions.</p><p id="P10">Multiple independent experiments using the isolated kinase domains demonstrate that Abl strongly selects for pY in the P-1 position relative to the phospho-acceptor tyrosine site in its optimal substrate motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S1B</xref>), whereas, conversely, Src selects for pY in the P+1 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S1C</xref>). These mirroring pY motif preferences suggest that both tyrosine kinases could phosphorylate a subset of their substrates in a phosphopriming-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D-F</xref>), such that each kinase, in phosphorylating an unphosphorylated substrate, could produce a phosphoprimed substrate optimized for phosphorylation by the other kinase.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Tyrosine Residues p27<sup>Y88</sup> and p27<sup>Y89</sup> Both Mediate Cell Cycle Progression in a Non-redundant Manner</title><p id="P11">Among all substrates of Abl and Src annotated in the resource PhosphositePlus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, we identified a single instance of consecutive tyrosine residues known to be phosphorylated by both of these kinases − Y88 and Y89 on the cell cycle inhibitor p27<sup>Kip1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). To determine whether these two tandem phosphosites can both be present simultaneously in a single p27 molecule, we performed targeted mass spectrometry in lysates from cycling hTert-RPE1 cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2A</xref> show the resulting mass spectrum, consistent with the expected mass-to-charge ratio for a twin-phosphorylated peptide, indicating that p27 protein in these freely cycling cells exists in the doubly phosphorylated form.</p><p id="P12">Phosphorylation of p27 has been shown to inactivate p27 as a CDK inhibitor, and to enhance its subsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, resulting in cell progression from G1 into S-phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. The Y88 and Y89 phosphorylation sites on p27 have been previously reported to have some level of redundancy in this regard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Given the existence of the doubly phosphorylated form, and motif specificities compatible with sequential phosphorylation in either order, we wondered whether both p27<sup>Y88</sup> and p27<sup>Y89</sup> sites, as well as both Abl and Src, are necessary to optimally regulate the cell-cycle inhibitory functions of p27, compatible with phosphopriming at these residues.</p><p id="P13">Previous studies relied on overexpression of p27 mutants to analyse the functions of the Y88 and Y89 residues. Since overexpressing cell cycle inhibitors can perturb cell cycle progression, we wanted to examine the impact of Y88 and Y89 mutation on endogenous p27 levels and cell cycle dynamics in order to preserve stoichiometry between enzyme-substrate reactions. We therefore used hTert-RPE1 mRuby-PCNA cells, an established non-transformed, diploid cellular model system where endogenous PCNA has been labelled with mRuby, enabling the study and quantification of cell cycle progression and phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. To track p27 dynamics and cell cycle progression in real-time, we generated an hTert-RPE1 mRuby-PCNA cell line where we labelled endogenous p27 at the C-terminus with eGFP, using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S2B</xref>). We have previously shown that p27-GFP replicates p27 dynamics in HeLa cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and, here we confirmed that addition of eGFP to endogenous p27 in hTert-RPE1 mRuby-PCNA cells did not affect cell growth, p27 localisation or the ability of p27 to bind CDK complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S2C-F</xref>). CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was then used to mutate the endogenous <italic>CDKN1B</italic> locus (encoding p27, tagged with GFP) to generate nonphosphorylatable phenylalanine (F) mutations at the Y88 or Y89 sites. Cell cycle progression of p27<sup>WT</sup> or p27<sup>mut</sup> cells was then analyzed by fixed and live-cell imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2E</xref>). Unlike what was previously observed in NB4 leukaemia cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, neither of the p27 mutants showed overt differences in either their ability to bind to Cdk2 and Cdk4, or in their nuclear localization relative to p27<sup>WT</sup>, suggesting that loss of tyrosine phosphorylation at either of these sites does not affect subcellular localisation of endogenous p27 in these epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figures S2E-F</xref>). Compared to p27<sup>WT</sup>-GFP cells, both the Y89 mutant and, to a lesser degree, the Y88 mutant demonstrated a significant increase in nuclear p27 intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2G</xref>) coupled with an increase in the fraction of cells entering quiescence (scored as phospho-Rb negative cells) under otherwise optimal (10% FBS) growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Live cell imaging and quantification of p27-GFP levels in individual asynchronously cycling cells were synchronized <italic>in silico</italic> relative to each cell’s mitotic exit, allowing comparison of p27<sup>WT</sup> and p27<sup>mut</sup> cells with respect to p27-GFP nuclear fluorescence intensity and associated cell cycle progression.

Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator.</p><p id="P72">The procedure for retroviral transduction of bone marrow cells and transplantation into lethally irradiated recipient mice was adapted from Pear <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. On day 5, the supernatant from cultured bone marrow cells was collected, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 250 × g for 4 minutes at room temperature. Pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of retroviral supernatant of choice and 3 mL of IMDM-based culture media (10% FBS, 5% WEHI-conditioned media, 6 ng/mL IL-3, 10 ng/mL IL-6, 100 ng/mL SCF) containing 4 μg/mL polybrene. This mixture was returned to the original 6-well plate containing any remaining adherent cells. Plates were centrifuged at 300 × g for 45 minutes at 37 °C and then returned to a tissue culture incubator at the same temperature. On day 6, the infection process was repeated as above. On day 7, transplant-recipient mice were gamma-irradiated with 7 Gy. Transduced bone marrow cells were collected by transferring the culture media from each well and detaching adherent cells by incubating with 1 mL PBS containing 5 mM EDTA. Detached cells were combined with non-adherent cells from the same sample. The suspension was centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 minutes, and retroviral supernatants were discarded into a container containing 50% bleach. Cells were washed twice with PBS, counted, and resuspended in PBS before analysing GFP expression by flow cytometry. Six hours after mice were gamma-irradiated, an equal number of 250,000 cells was injected into each recipient mouse via the tail vein in 100 μL of PBS.</p></sec><sec id="S36"><title>Histopathologic analyses</title><p id="P73">Spleens from Bcr-Abl<sup>WT</sup>, Bcr-Abl<sup>R328A</sup> and Bcr-Abl<sup>R328M</sup> endpoint mice were collected, weighed, and processed for histological examination. Samples were fixed, embedded, sectioned, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) to assess disease progression and tissue morphology, and with an anti-Ki-67 antibody (ab16667, 1:1000 dilution) for immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate Bcr-Abl−driven cellular proliferation. Slides were scanned using the Aperio slide scanner (Leica Biosystems) and Ki-67−stained IHC images were segmented into uniform tiles of 105 μm<sup>2</sup> using Halo software (v3.3, Indica Labs). Analysis focused on the spleen region, and a trained HALO tissue classifier was used to exclude background and areas with incomplete staining. Stain vectors for haematoxylin and DAB were determined via the colour deconvolution algorithm in QuPath (v 0.5.0). The modified CytoNuclear algorithm (v2.0.9) in Halo was then applied to identify Ki-67−positive cells and calculate the immunopositive rate, defined as the proportion of positively stained cells relative to the total cell count within each tile. To ensure accuracy, all spleen samples were independently assessed in a blinded manner by two immunologists.</p></sec><sec id="S37"><title>Staining of HSCs and progenitor cells</title><p id="P74">Bone marrow (BM) cells were harvested and red blood cells lysed as described above.
