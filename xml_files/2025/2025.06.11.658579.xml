To address this challenge, we developed ARTIC HELP (Homebrew Enzymes for Library Preparation), a practical, open-source adaptation of the widely adopted ARTIC nanopore sequencing protocol for viral genomic surveillance. We describe generic, cost-effective alternatives to all enzyme mixes used in tiling multiplex RT-PCR amplification of the virus genome, and the nanopore native barcoding workflow, including end-prep (EP), barcode ligation (BL), and adapter ligation (AL), making it broadly applicable to any laboratory. Through systematic evaluation, we identified a wild-type M-MLV reverse transcriptase and two types of proofreading DNA polymerases as effective alternatives when standard reagents are unavailable due to high cost or limited supply: B-family Pfu-based polymerases with a fused Sso7d DNA-binding domain, and blends combining A-family (Taq-based) and B-family (Pfu-based) polymerases. Validation on clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2 and Norovirus GII confirmed that the HELP workflow achieves genome coverage comparable to the ARTIC LoCost protocol. For SARS-CoV-2 samples (Ct ≤28), the wild-type M-MLV RT combined with selected Pfu or A+B polymerases, along with optimised HELP mixes (EP, BL, AL), achieved genome coverage of 84.0–99.6%. For Norovirus GII (Ct ≤32), the HELP workflow using one of the Pfu polymerases achieved genome coverage of &gt;85% for six out of eight genotypes tested. Notably, several of the other polymerases tested showed reduced performance at higher Ct values. However, they still achieved strong coverage at Ct &lt;24, supporting their use as emergency alternatives in rapid outbreak-response sequencing when viral input is high and RNA quality is sufficient. Our approach, ARTIC HELP, provides a framework which can be implemented to address supply chain disruptions, while maintaining robust genomic sequencing capabilities. A cost analysis highlights the well-known significant global disparities in reagent pricing, driven not by protocol differences but by import fees and supply barriers. Thus, our findings highlight the need for fairer global pricing models and support for local sourcing strategies like HELP, to promote equity in genomic research and ensure preparedness for future public health challenges.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">When the West African Ebola outbreak hit in 2014, sequencing a virus in real time, let alone in on-site settings, was effectively unprecedented in outbreak settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). That crisis marked a turning point, driving the development of genomics-informed approaches to global pathogen surveillance systems that have since reshaped public health responses to emerging infectious disease threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The COVID-19 pandemic reinforced this shift, catalysing a wave of investment in global sequencing infrastructure and prompting the World Health Organization to launch a 10-year strategy (2022–2032) to expand genomic surveillance capacity worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). These efforts laid the foundation for integrating genomics into routine public health practice, supporting timely detection and response to infectious disease outbreaks.</p><p id="P4">One of the most influential efforts that emerged in response to this shift was the ARTIC Network, the first coordinated initiative to deliver end-to-end, on-site deployable protocols for portable genomic surveillance (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://artic.network/">https://artic.network/</ext-link> ; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://community.artic.network/t/a-beginners-guide-to-artic/531">https://community.artic.network/t/a-beginners-guide-to-artic/531</ext-link>). Launched during the Ebola outbreak and aligned with the rise of Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing, ARTIC has since developed tools for rapid viral genome sequencing and analysis, enabling real-time response in real-world outbreak settings. The network has played a pivotal role in responses to Zika, SARS-CoV-2, and more recently, Monkeypox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Drawing on experience from Ebola and Zika, the ARTIC team rapidly designed and released a whole-genome sequencing protocol for SARS-CoV-2 at the onset of the pandemic. The ARTIC primers, based on an amplicon tiling scheme, became the backbone of SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance, contributing to over 18 million genome sequences across platforms and enabling timely variant detection and public health response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). To support broader adoption and higher-throughput use, the ARTIC LoCost workflow was introduced, reducing reagent volumes and lowering costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). This cost-effective protocol has been widely implemented in laboratories worldwide. More recently, adaptations of the ARTIC workflow have also been applied to wastewater surveillance and other viral targets, demonstrating its flexibility and ongoing relevance in public health genomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Yet the pandemic also exposed the limitations of even widely adopted protocols, revealing structural weaknesses in global diagnostic and genomic surveillance systems, particularly their reliance on protocols that depend on specific reagents without validated alternatives. This lack of flexibility made laboratory operations highly vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, leading to shortages and delays in essential reagents, enhanced by transportation restrictions and increased competition for resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), making even widely used protocols such as ARTIC difficult to sustain. To remain effective in future outbreaks, genomic workflows must be not only technically robust but also adaptable to resource constraints and resilient in the face of supply chain instability. While several high-level strategies have been proposed to improve resilience in health-related supply chains, such as supply diversification, local sourcing, and improved logistics, these efforts primarily focus on procurement and distribution systems, rather than the design of laboratory workflows themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Our work addresses this under-served layer by filling a precise, practical gap: the need for validated, protocol-level flexibility in genomic surveillance workflows.</p><p id="P6">In response to these challenges, we developed and validated the ARTIC HELP workflow (Homebrew Enzymes for Library Preparation) as a flexible alternative to the ARTIC LoCost protocol. We designed HELP to include open-source substitutes for all key enzymatic steps in the native barcoding workflow (ONT), including end-repair, barcode ligation, and adapter ligation, making the workflow broadly applicable to any laboratory using nanopore sequencing. Rather than aiming to replace commercial enzyme mixes entirely, we focused on providing practical alternatives that use enzymes and buffers commonly found in standard molecular biology laboratories. We validated the HELP workflow on clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2 and Norovirus GII, confirming its performance under real-world conditions. By offering reliable substitutes for critical reagents, we aim to strengthen the resilience and continuity of pathogen genomic surveillance during public health crises.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Virus culture</title><p id="P7">Live SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2/human/Liverpool/REMRQ001/2020) was cultured in Vero-E6 (ATCC) cells grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Pan Biotech) supplemented with 1% Glutamine (Gibco), 10% foetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Thermo Scientific), at 37 °C with 5% CO2.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Viral RNA extraction</title><p id="P8">SARS-CoV-2 control panel RNA was generated using the isolate SARS-CoV-2/human/Liverpool/REMRQ001/2020.

In Stage 1, we systematically replaced reagents at each step of the ARTIC LoCost sequencing protocol across six workflows (wf), each targeting one of the five experimental steps: RT, PCR, and the library preparation steps (EP, BL, and AL). This approach aimed to identify viable reagent alternatives. In Stage 2, we determined the optimal replacements within a single library workflow, ensuring the new components worked seamlessly together. Sequencing performance in Stages 1 and 2 was tested across four SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations from the lab-grown isolate (SARS-CoV-2/human/Liverpool/REMRQ001/2020), corresponding to Ct values 21.2, 24.6, 27.9, and 31.4, equating to 2.2x10^4, 2.01x10^3, 1.83x10^2, and 1.65x10^1 RNA copies/reaction, respectively. Finally, Stage 3 validated the best replacements using clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2 and Norovirus GII (with Ct-values &lt;33), confirming their effectiveness in real-world applications.

In wf-2, LunaScript RT was replaced with M-MLV RT, while the remaining steps utilised reagents from the LoCost protocol. In wf-3, Q5 DNA Polymerase was replaced with one of six alternatives: Platinum, PrimeSTAR, KAPA, EcoDry, Phusion, or KOD. By gel electrophoresis, we assessed the amplification efficiency from wf-1, wf-2 and wf-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Extended data: Figure S1</xref>) and found that while all polymerases generated expected products, amplification efficiency varied. KOD polymerase was particularly inefficient and excluded from further experiments. We also noted that EcoDry, PrimeSTAR, and KAPA produced longer (~1,000 bp) chimeric products in samples with lower Ct values, a known artifact in PCR amplifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Replacing LunaScript with M-MLV RT combined with Q5 polymerase (wf-2) delivered comparable performance to the ARTIC LoCost protocol, except at the highest Ct value (31.4), where M-MLV showed reduced genome coverage (91.3%) and 10 amplicon dropouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In contrast, the LoCost workflow (LunaScript) maintained 97.1% coverage with only three dropouts, highlighting the importance of RT enzyme selection. Nonetheless, M-MLV RT demonstrated viability as an effective alternative, achieving comparable genome coverage and sequencing depth under most conditions.</p><p id="P20">In wf-3, where polymerases were compared, Platinum and EcoDry demonstrated the most consistent performance, closely matching the LoCost workflow with minimal dropout rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Extended data: Table S4</xref>). Specifically, Platinum was the most comparable, achieving high genome coverage (97.3% to 99.6%) with only three amplicon dropouts. In contrast, under the conditions used, PrimeSTAR and Phusion were less reliable, with lower coverage (76.2% and 74.1%, respectively) at the highest Ct 31.4. We noted that the amplicons which failed to amplify efficiently varied between polymerases, with Platinum consistently exhibiting dropout of amplicon 90 and EcoDry primarily at amplicon 82 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Amplicons such as 21, 22, 51, 60, and 66 frequently appeared as problematic areas across multiple conditions (including M-MLV RT with Q5 polymerase), particularly with high Ct samples. The results of wf-3 clearly demonstrated that Platinum and EcoDry polymerases can reliably substitute for Q5 polymerase in the LoCost workflow, maintaining high and stable genome coverage (96-99%) across all Ct values.</p><p id="P21">In wf-4, we replaced the commercial end-prep enzyme mix with generic HELP-EP mixes (A, B, and C), combining T4 PNK, T4 DNA Polymerase, Klenow, and Taq DNA Polymerase in a single reaction for amplicon end repair (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Extended data: Table S1</xref>). HELP EP-A used the highest enzyme concentrations: 0.2 U/μl T4 PNK, 0.01 U/μl Klenow, 0.02 U/μl T4 Pol, and 0.04 U/μl Taq Pol. While HELP EP-B included 2-fold reductions in all enzymes except Klenow, which remained constant. HELP EP-C mirrored EP-A in enzyme concentration, but excluded Klenow to test whether T4 DNA Polymerase alone could support efficient end-preparation. Buffer components, 1X T4 DNA Ligase Reaction Buffer (1 mM ATP), 5% PEG-8000, and 0.5 mM dNTPs, were consistent across all HELP-EP mixes. As with wf1-3, all other steps of the sequencing workflow were maintained as per the LoCost protocol and the sequencing performance of each HELP-EP mix was compared using a dilution series of RNA extracted from the lab-grown SARS-CoV-2 isolate. HELP EP-C, excluding Klenow, was the most comparable to the LoCost protocol, achieving consistent genome coverage &gt;95% across all Ct values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Extended data: Table S4</xref>).

Each HELP mix contained a consistent concentration of T4 DNA Ligase (1000 U/reaction) but differed in ligation enhancer supplements, including one or combinations of PEG-8000, 1,2-PrD, and HCC. HELP BL-D, which included both 10% PEG-8000 and 1 mM HCC, performed identically to the LoCost, achieving high genome coverage (&gt;97%) across all Ct values. HELP BL-A (10% PEG-8000) and HELP BL-E (10% PEG-8000 with 2X Ligase buffer) also performed well, achieving genome coverage &gt;95%. In contrast, HELP BL-B (15% PEG-8000) and HELP BL-C (10% PEG-8000 with 12% 1,2-PrD) had high genome coverage (&gt;99%) at lower Ct values, but dropped to 93.8% at Ct 31.4. In contrast to the generic enzyme mixes, under the conditions used, Mighty Mix consistently showed the lowest performance across all metrics, with genome coverage dropping from 99.6% at Ct 24.6 to 97% at Ct 21.2 and 27.9, and further declining to 87.6% with 14 amplicon dropouts at Ct 31.4.</p><p id="P23">In wf-6, we evaluated alternatives to the NEBNext Quick Ligation Module for adapter ligation in the ARTIC LoCost protocol by testing the HELP AL-A mix and Thermo Rapid DNA Ligation Kit (RLK, Thermo). The HELP AL-A mix was prepared with a final concentration of 2X T4 DNA Ligase Reaction Buffer, enhanced with 10% PEG-8000 and a high concentration of T4 DNA Ligase (4000 U/reaction). Both mixes showed performance comparable to the ARTIC LoCost workflow and proved to be reliable options for sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Extended data: Table S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Stage 2. Comparative Analysis of HELP Workflows Relative to the ARTIC LoCost Workflow</title><p id="P24">We next evaluated the performance of the generic replacements identified in Stage 1, within a single-library workflow, selecting only those that performed well in the initial screen. M-MLV served as a generic RT replacement, and for the PCR step, we selected Platinum and EcoDry polymerases due to their highest efficiency under the conditions used. For end prep, we selected HELP EP-A and EP-C mixes, which differed only by the inclusion of the Klenow enzyme in the EP-A. For barcode ligation, we selected HELP BL-A (10% PEG-8000) as the simplest recipe and BL-D (10% PEG-8000 and 1mM HCC) as the best performing mix. In the adaptor ligation step, we tested AL-A and AL-B which varied only by the amount of ligase per reaction, 4000U and 2000U, respectively. Stage 2 comprised two groups: Group I used Platinum polymerase and Group II using EcoDry polymerase, each with five workflows as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>. All combinations of the HELP workflows yielded results comparable to the ARTIC LoCost approach, although their performance varied across different sequencing quality control metrics, particularly as viral load in samples reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Extended data: Table S4</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Among the Platinum HELP workflows, HELP-Id and HELP-Ie showed the most consistent performance across all Ct values, making them the closest alternative to the LoCost. The remaining Platinum HELP workflows (Ia, Ib, and Ic) had similar percentages of mapped reads and genome coverage but exhibited more variability in mean depth. Specific dropouts were consistent at amplicon 33 and 90 across all Ct values for all Platinum workflows. Among the EcoDry HELP workflows, HELP-IId and IIe demonstrated relatively stable performance, making them good alternatives, though some dropouts were seen at higher Ct values. The remaining EcoDry HELP workflows (IIa, IIb, and IIc) showed more variability in mean depth and genome coverage, particularly at higher Ct values. Consistent dropouts were observed at amplicon 51 and 82 across all Ct values for all EcoDry workflows.</p><p id="P26">The results from the Stage 2 further confirmed the impact of polymerase choice and HELP mix combinations on sequencing yield. In general, HELP workflows using Platinum polymerase in all tested combinations consistently achieved genome coverage &gt;95%, with minimal dropouts. In comparison, HELP workflows with EcoDry polymerase exhibited genome coverage ranging from &gt;91%, depending on the HELP mix combination used.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Stage 3. Validation of the HELP-workflow using clinical samples positive for SARS-CoV-2</title><p id="P27">To explore the utility of the best performing HELP workflows, HELP-Ie (Platinum) and HELP-IIe (EcoDry) workflows were compared to ARTIC LoCost with 19 SARS-CoV-2 (Delta variant) RNA clinical samples (Ct 20–33). Sample characteristics and comprehensive sequencing metrics are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Extended data Table S5</xref>. For low Ct samples (≤24), LoCost and HELP-Ie outperformed HELP-IIe in genome coverage (98.1–99.6% vs. 95.6–98.2%) and fewer dropouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). At moderate Ct values (&gt;24 to ≤28), HELP-Ie matched LoCost (95.5–98.9%), while HELP-IIe showed reduced performance (84.0–94.9%). At high Ct values (&gt;28), HELP-Ie excelled (82.9–97.3%), LoCost showed moderate coverage (86.0–89.8%), and HELP-IIe performed worst (55.7–84.1%).</p><p id="P28">We also examined the amplicon dropout patterns using clinical samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9B</xref>). Across all Ct values, specific amplicons (e.g., 21, 22, 66, 90) frequently showed dropouts across all workflows, particularly at higher Ct values. Additionally, each workflow exhibited a unique pattern of amplicon dropouts, suggesting that it may be possible to improve performance by rebalancing primer concentrations for the poorly performing amplicons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Amplicons 33 and 90 were determined to be unique to the Platinum polymerase, whereas for the LoCost workflow with Q5 polymerase, amplicons 22, 66, and 90 were the most sensitive sites. The EcoDry exhibited specific amplicon dropouts, such as 31, 51, and 82.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Stage 3. Validation of the HELP-workflow using clinical samples positive for Norovirus GII</title><p id="P29">To confirm the potential applicability of the HELP workflow to viruses beyond SARS-CoV-2, we sequenced 12 Norovirus genogroup II-positive stool samples comprising eight different genotypes (Ct values 15.6–32.8) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Extended data: Table S6</xref>). Ten samples were unique, and two were included as technical replicates to complete a 12-barcode pool for optimal sequencing yield and barcode performance. We compared HELP-Ie (Platinum) and HELP-IIIe (Q5) workflows (substituting EcoDry with Q5) against the LoCost workflow. Q5, a benchmark polymerase for high-multiplex tiling PCR, was included to test its integration with the complete HELP workflow, spanning EP, BL, and AL steps. The results demonstrated that genome coverage and amplicon dropouts were predominantly influenced by genotype specificity rather than workflow or Ct values, highlighting areas for potential primer design improvement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>). Among the genotypes GII4P31, GII17P17, GII4P4 (recombinant), and GII4P16 exhibited no amplicon dropouts across all workflows, achieving genome coverage between 95.1% and 96.6% (excluding 5’ and 3’ ends as the primer scheme does not cover these regions). GII4P4 (Ct 24.9) and GII3P12 (Ct 15.6) showed moderate genome coverage (77.3–86.1%) with specific amplicon dropouts. GII6P7 (Ct 21.5) and GII7P7 (Ct 24.4) exhibited the lowest coverage (59.6–65.8% and 20.8–31.0%, respectively) with multiple consistent dropouts. These results demonstrated that the HELP workflow is robust and adaptable for sequencing Norovirus genogroup II, confirming its applicability beyond SARS-CoV-2. Coverage limitations observed for certain genotypes reflect primer scheme constraints rather than workflow performance, underscoring the need for further refinement of the norovirus-gii/800/v1.1.0 scheme.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Comparison between the cost of the HELP and LoCost workflows</title><p id="P30">We compared reagent costs for HELP and LoCost protocols across six countries (UK, India, Mali, Indonesia, the Philippines, Burkina Faso), including only the enzymatic steps of the workflow: RT, PCR, and library preparation (EP, BL, AL). Quotes were generated in each country, including additional taxes and delivery charges, to determine the cost of purchasing the reagents required for both protocols to the respective national or academic laboratories. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, total costs for the LoCost workflow ranged from £30 in the UK to £57.70 in Indonesia. For the HELP workflow (using Platinum or EcoDry polymerase), total costs varied from £12.70 to £33.00. These costs exclude RNA extraction, SPRI clean-up, and ONT sequencing kit and flow cell. Despite this, notable price discrepancies were observed between countries. Across countries where complete data were available, the HELP workflow reduced reagent costs by approximately 48% to 60% compared to LoCost, for example, 58% in the UK and 60% in India.</p><p id="P31">We also compared total workflow costs (including ONT reagents, extraction, and clean-up) using UK pricing across library sizes of 24, 48, and 96 samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Extended data: Table S7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P32">The ARTIC HELP protocol described here provides a viable alternative to the ARTIC LoCost and other amplicon-based native barcoding workflows (ONT), demonstrating comparable performance across a range of conditions. By validating alternative reagents and enzymes already available in many molecular biology labs, HELP addresses supply chain issues exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic and helps maintain genomic surveillance during future disruptions. While the ARTIC LoCost protocol has proven its versatility and effectiveness in advancing genomic surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), the development of the ARTIC HELP workflow further enhances these capabilities.</p><p id="P33">Incorporating alternative enzymes and home-brew reagents into molecular diagnostics and sequencing workflows offers a practical solution for maintaining viral sequencing capabilities during reagent shortages and public health emergencies. Matute et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) and Page et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>) demonstrated reliable home-brew RNA extraction and RT-LAMP diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection without dependence on commercial kits. Similarly, Ou et al. showed that nanopore sequencing using home-brew components can match the performance of standard commercial mixes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). In line with these findings, our study validated the effectiveness of HELP mixes with clinical SARS-CoV-2 and Norovirus GII samples, achieving high genome coverage. The integration of HELP alternatives into the LoCost protocol were implemented through practical single-step substitutions (stage 1) or combined workflows (stages 2 and 3). For a combined workflow most similar to the LoCost in terms of performance and consistency, HELP-e with Platinum polymerase is recommended, particularly for its balance across metrics and lower dropout rates. This workflow is available on protocol.io <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.protocols.io/view/artic-help-protocol-for-amplicon-based-viral-genom-gzsibx6cf">https://protocols.io/view/artic-help-protocol-for-amplicon-based-viral-genom-gzsibx6cf</ext-link>.</p><p id="P34">Focusing on single-step substitutions, we noted a number of key findings related to the performance of the HELP mixes. The HELP EP-C mix, which excludes the Klenow fragment, performed comparably to the ARTIC LoCost workflow, aligning with previous findings by Carøe et al. that simplified single-tube enzyme combinations can improve efficiency and accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). While not directly tested in our study, recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) demonstrated that even T4 Polymerase may be dispensable in end-prep reactions. In that study, a homebrew solution containing only T4 PNK and Taq Polymerase effectively replaced commercial end-repair modules, likely due to the proofreading activity of high-fidelity polymerases, which generate blunt-ended PCR products. The inclusion of PEG in HELP EP mixes to enhance enzyme activity also reflects strategies reported by Neiman et al., who used PEG and T4 Ligase buffer in a single reaction to achieve efficient library preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). For barcode ligation, HELP BL-A containing 10 % PEG showed the highest efficiency, consistent with reports that this concentration improves ligation, while higher levels such as 15 %, tested in BL-B, inhibited performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). HELP BL-C, which contained 1,2-PrD, demonstrated moderate efficiency but was less effective than HCC and PEG, which is in line with studies reporting 14-fold improvements with 1,2-PrD, and even greater gains, up to 50- and 100-fold, with HCC and PEG respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). The highest performance was observed with HELP BL-D, which combined 10 % PEG and 1 mM HCC, suggesting a synergistic effect. Overall, the omission of Klenow in EP-C, the use of a simplified barcode ligation mix in BL-A, and a reduced ligase concentration in adaptor ligation mix AL-B were sufficient for effective performance in the combined HELP-e workflow. These findings reinforce the modularity and adaptability of the HELP mixes, allowing laboratories to customize workflows according to reagent availability and specific sequencing needs.</p><p id="P35">We found that the selection of the appropriate reverse transcriptase is particularly crucial at higher Ct values for optimal PCR efficiency. LunaScript, an engineered M-MLV RT variant, offers enhanced thermostability and reduced RNase H activity, leading to more efficient cDNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). In contrast, wild-type M-MLV RT, with its higher RNase H activity, can affect cDNA quality and yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). While we showed that a wild-type M-MLV RT can serve as an alternative in the LoCost protocol when other options are unavailable, high-performance engineered reverse transcriptases, such as SuperScript IV, are recommended for better results, particularly in high Ct samples (&gt;28).</p><p id="P36">Having multiple polymerase options provides additional flexibility to adapt to supply chain disruptions. High-multiplex PCR, such as the SARS-CoV-2 tiling scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), uses around 50 primer pairs per pool to simultaneously amplify multiple regions of the genome, making polymerase selection critical for consistent results. This approach was originally optimised for Q5, a Pyrococcus-like (Pfu) B-family polymerase fused to the processivity-enhancing SSo7d domain, which provides high fidelity and strong template binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). In our study, all enzymes tested included proofreading activity, yet performance varied markedly depending on structural features and formulation. B-family Pfu-based polymerases with a SSo7d DNA-binding domain (e.g., Platinum, Phusion) performed well at low Ct values, but only Platinum sustained efficiency under low-input conditions, suggesting that even among similar polymerases, proprietary stabilisers and buffers influence template binding. Blended polymerases combining A-family (Taq-based) and B-family (Pfu-based) enzymes without an Sso7d DNA-binding domain (e.g., EcoDry, KAPA) showed variable performance. EcoDry consistently outperformed KAPA, potentially due to its lyophilised format and proprietary buffer composition. Notably, several polymerases that underperformed at higher Ct values still achieved strong coverage at Ct &lt; 24, supporting their use as emergency alternatives for rapid outbreak-response sequencing when viral input is high and RNA quality is sufficient. These findings underscore that successful high-multiplex PCR depends not only on polymerase family or proofreading ability, but also on the presence of engineered DNA-binding domains and optimised buffer formulation, which together shape processivity, fidelity, and performance across varying template inputs.</p><p id="P37">We observed that amplicon dropout patterns in SARS-CoV-2 genome amplification varied by polymerase, even though most primers had well-matched melting (Tm) and annealing (Ta) temperature values, suggesting that Tm alone does not explain poor amplification. For example, amplicons 33 and 90 dropped out with Platinum, 51 and 82 with EcoDry, and 66 and 90 with Q5, all despite good predicted performance. It is likely that other factors, such as primer competition and differences in buffer composition, may have contributed to these dropouts. It is also notable that EcoDry recommends a higher annealing temperature (68°C), which may have affected its performance under the 63°C and 65°C conditions used in the ARTIC protocol with optimized primer concentrations and Tm. In contrast, Platinum and Q5 have broader Ta compatibility, making them more adaptable to these settings. Our findings align with previous studies of Lambisia et al., showing that rebalancing primer concentrations can help recover underperforming regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). While we did not test this directly, optimising primer pools per polymerase could improve consistency and should be considered.</p><p id="P38">We demonstrated that the HELP workflow is applicable to viruses beyond SARS-CoV-2 by sequencing Norovirus genogroup II. Our study also represents the first application of the norovirus-gii/800/v1.1.0 scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), assessing its performance with both the LoCost and HELP workflows. Genome coverage varied across the eight Norovirus GII genotypes, likely due to primer mismatches driven by the high genetic diversity of GII noroviruses, rather than Ct values or workflows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Still, we achieved genome coverage of &gt;95% for four GII norovirus genotypes (GII3P12, GII4P4-recombinant, GII4P16, GII17P17), and &gt;85% for two others (GII4P4, GII4P31). The lowest coverage was observed for GII6P7 (65.8%) and GII7P7 (31%), highlighting the need for improved primer design for these genotypes. There were also notable variations in mean depth for the same amplicon region across workflows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10B</xref>). Since primers were used in equal molar concentrations, our findings likely highlight the need for primer balancing for any given enzyme, to address these discrepancies and improve yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). To enhance amplification and coverage, targeted optimisations, such as adjusting concentrations of specific primers in pools, are recommended.</p><p id="P39">Our cost analysis highlights the well-established inequity in global access to molecular reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). In some places, the same reagents cost nearly twice as much, with these cost increases arising not due to technical differences in the supplied products, but largely to customs fees, high import taxes, and shipping costs. This creates real challenges for labs in lower-resource settings, where budgets are limited and every extra cost makes it harder to carry out essential genomic work. The lack of transparency around the additional local added costs, how and when they are implemented, presents an additional barrier to the accurate budgeting of laboratory functions and grant proposals. These findings highlight the urgent need for more fair and transparent pricing, and support the value of locally sourced solutions like the ARTIC HELP protocol to make genomic research more accessible and affordable everywhere.</p><sec id="S19"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="P40">Our study, while comprehensive, has limitations primarily due to the limited number of generic enzymes explored, the variability in polymerase performance and primer design. However we have provided a generic workflow template to identify other discrepancies in genome coverage and amplicon dropouts that challenge uniform amplification, particularly at high Ct values. Further optimization, including primer balancing and tailored reaction conditions for each polymerase, may be necessary to enhance the reliability and robustness of the sequencing workflow. Our results suggest that the norovirus-gii/800/v1.1.0 scheme requires improvements, particularly by designing additional primers that are more specific to GII6P7 and GII7P7 genotypes. Although the current norovirus scheme is still under development, our findings provide insights for further optimisation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P41">We developed ARTIC HELP, a practical workflow using alternative enzymes and home-brew buffers that works as well as the standard ARTIC LoCost protocol for sequencing viral genomes from clinical samples.
