A clear understanding of pathogenic mechanisms at the sites of tissue damage is lacking, and there is a significant unmet need for more targeted treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. We have previously detailed transcriptional changes detectable in blood immune cells in JDM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. We identified that blood CD14+ monocytes from patients with active disease have severe mitochondrial dysfunction. Further we showed that alterations in mitochondrial biology and morphology in monocytes led to accumulation of oxidized mitochondrial DNA (oxmtDNA), which was able to trigger IFN-signalling pathways. Interestingly, while the well-characterised IFN-driven signature detectable at diagnosis was reduced on treatment, we observed that mitochondrial abnormalities detected in peripheral blood monocytes persisted despite treatment.</p><p id="P6">Our previous studies on JDM muscle tissue obtained prior to treatment showed that pro-inflammatory, CD68+ tissue macrophages are frequently detectable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and that CD68+ cell infiltration correlates with weakness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Macrophage infiltration may be throughout the endomysium, or in peri-vascular clusters, where they are frequently co-localized with infiltrating T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Abnormal macrophage polarisation has been implicated in perpetuating inflammation and tissue damage in myopathies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. A recent study in a myositis animal model suggests a self-perpetuating loop between mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">To start to define at tissue level the complex interactions between immune and muscle cells in JDM-affected muscle tissue, we employed spatial transcriptomics. This method enables in-situ gene expression analysis while preserving critical tissue architecture, allowing precise localization of cell types and their potential involvement in the pathogenic processes associated with myositis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. We employed the Nanostring GeoMx® Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) to interrogate the transcriptome of muscle tissue sections from JDM patients and age-matched healthy controls. GeoMx facilitates the staining, selection and sequencing of specific spatial niches within the tissue known as Regions of Interest (ROIs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. We opted to focus initially on CD68+-enriched areas in the analysis of inflammatory infiltrate.</p><p id="P8">We confirm that JDM muscle tissue exhibits significant upregulation of interferon (IFN) pathways and dysregulation of mitochondrial pathways, particularly affecting the electron transport chain. By comparing tissue areas, we show that muscle weakness correlates with increased IFN signalling in both muscle-and CD68+-cell-derived transcriptome. Importantly mitochondrial abnormalities were clearly demonstrated even in muscle with only moderate clinical weakness, and these were detected in both muscle fibres as well as in the CD68+ infiltrate. We replicated our findings in another cohort, analysing bulk RNAseq data, and validated the lack of correlation between IFN-driven changes and mitochondrial abnormality at protein level in a larger cohort. We believe that our study is the first to provide spatial transcriptional insights into JDM pathogenesis, and will facilitate significant steps towards the delineation of the contributions of immune and muscle cells, to JDM pathology. Our results suggest that mitochondrial abnormalities, that we previously defined in blood cells, are also present in both muscle and infiltrating monocyte/macrophages in JDM even before significant clinical weakness is apparent.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>METHODS: all methods are provided in supplementary information</title></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S8"><title>Patients and controls</title><p id="P9">Clinical and demographic features of the 3 JDM patients and controls analysed by transcriptome profiling are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Of note, two of the patients were significantly weak at time of biopsy as assessed by the CMAS and MMT8 while the third was less weak but had more severe skin disease activity. Two JDM patients tested positive for TIF1γ, while the third patient was negative for MSA. For histological analysis, a total of 19 cases were included: the 3 transcriptome-profiled patients, along with an additional 16 JDM cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary, Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Selection of regions of interest (ROIs) for analysis of areas with or without leukocyte infiltration in JDM muscle biopsies</title><p id="P10">To determine the dominant pathways which are altered in the muscle of patients with JDM compared to healthy muscle and to test whether mitochondrial pathways are altered in muscle tissue early in JDM, we used spatial transcriptome analysis. Imaging of quadriceps muscle biopsy sections from all 6 cases was performed on the Nanostring GeoMx® scanning platform. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to enable selection of ROIs for sequencing using a nuclear marker and morphology markers laminin, CD45, and CD68, for identification of muscle fibres, leukocytes, and macrophages respectively. For focused transcriptome analysis of infiltrating macrophages, segmentation was used, as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> shows control muscle tissue, where no significant immune cell infiltration or inflammation is observed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> shows JDM muscle ROI without immune cells, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> reveals an area with substantial inflammatory infiltration (CD45+), which was not observed in the control samples. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> shows an area with infiltrating CD68+ cells within JDM muscle with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref> further illustrating the ‘segmented’ view of CD68+ cells, allowing for transcriptomic profiling of this specific cell type. Thus, we selected three different ROI types for sequencing analysis: muscle fibre, muscle with immune cell infiltration, and CD68-enriched, generating a total of 28 ROIs. The breakdown of the ROIs selected is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>.</p><p id="P11">Histological analysis of the muscle biopsy sections is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>.

None of the 28 ROIs or control probes were flagged as unsuitable for analysis. Further quality control and normalization techniques were applied to address technical variation across data generated from ROIs. Relative log expression (RLE) plots were used to visualize effects of normalization: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref> shows unnormalized data, with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref> displaying log counts per million (logCPM) normalized data. This normalization method, integrated into the voom function of the limma-voom pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, effectively centred the median expression levels of all ROIs around zero. This indicates successful removal of unwanted technical variation, enhancing comparability across samples.</p><p id="P13">We employed principal component analysis (PCA) to assess variance within the dataset, between patients, and between types of ROIs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C-D</xref>). Initial PCA analysis by patient revealed that all data from JDM patients (22 ROIs) clustered into two clusters, with clear separation of JDM patients from control samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>). When data were labelled by ROI type, the two distinct clusters of data from JDM biopsies were clarified by cell type. As expected CD68+-selected ROIs (JDM samples only) formed a separate cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref> blue symbols). Interestingly, JDM muscle only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref> red symbols) and JDM muscle plus-immune ROIs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref> yellow symbols) clustered together (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>). Note that segmentation was not performed on CD45+ cells. Again, control muscle ROIs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref> pink symbols) clustered away from all JDM data.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Differential gene expression analysis confirms a high interferon-driven signature and demonstrates abnormal mitochondrial gene signature in JDM muscle compared to control muscle</title><p id="P14">To investigate differences in the gene expression profiles of JDM muscle compared to control muscle, the data from muscle-only ROIs were initially used in the limma-voom differential gene expression (DGE) analysis pipeline. The analysis revealed 448 genes which were significantly differentially expressed in JDM muscle (|Log2FC| ≥ 0.58 and adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05), of which 336 genes were identified as upregulated and 112 as downregulated in JDM muscle compared to control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Pathway enrichment using Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) on significant differentially expressed genes (DEG) was used to identify dysregulated pathways in JDM muscle. The GO Cellular Component (CC) gene sets were initially used to identify differentially expressed pathways. The GO CC annotations detail the subcellular structures and complexes involved, making this appropriate for highlighting mitochondrial functional pathways. Conversely, the GO Biological Process (BP) gene sets were then used to capture dynamic biological activities and signalling processes, such as immune response mechanisms, which are central to JDM. The first ORA (GO CC) indicated 101 significantly differentially expressed pathways in JDM muscle compared to controls (adjusted p value ≤ 0.05) while the second, (GO BP), gave 310 significant pathways.</p><p id="P15">To simplify interpretation of these numerous, often overlapping pathways, aPEAR cluster network analysis was performed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, resulting in the construction of plots that visually organize and group related pathways into coherent clusters, for each of the two GO gene sets that were used. The GO CC network highlighted several clusters of mitochondria-related pathways, including clusters such as the “respiratory chain complex”, the “mitochondrial proton-transporting ATP synthase complex”, and the “mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, pathways related to ER to Golgi protein transport were also differentially expressed in JDM muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The GO BP network highlighted clusters of interferon and immune related pathways, with the most prominent clusters being “interferon-mediated signalling pathway”, “pattern recognition receptor signalling pathway”, and “T cell mediated immunity”. In addition, several clusters related to muscle development and function were noted, including “muscle cell development” and “regulation of muscle contraction” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We were intrigued that a cluster of pathways annotated as “T cell immunity’ were enriched in JDM muscle-only regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Scrutiny of pathways that generated this annotation revealed 22 pathways ascribed to T cells and 85 others labelled as antigen processing, regulation of immunity, MHC, or other immune cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S3</xref>). Across these pathways the top DE genes were HLA (MHC) genes or those involved in MHC processing such as <italic>TAP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S4</xref>). It is well-established that both muscle and endothelium in adult and juvenile IIM express high levels of HLA class I and II proteins which can be independent of inflammatory infiltrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, we ascribe this result to expression of HLA genes (driven by IFN) in muscle fibres or endothelium.</p><p id="P17">To determine whether differentially expressed pathways were upregulated or downregulated in JDM against controls, gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the fGSEA method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. This analysis provides complementary insights by considering the entire ranked gene list, identifying pathways with subtle but coordinated expression changes. Using fGSEA, 79 and 269 significant pathways (adjusted p value ≤ 0.05) were identified with the GO CC and GO BP gene sets, respectively, many of which overlapped with the ORA results. Full lists of the significant pathways identified via fGSEA and their associated fold changes and clusters can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S5</xref> (GO CC) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S6</xref> (GO BP).</p><p id="P18">Clustering of the 79 pathways (GO CC) using aPEAR validated the previous results, with the generated network plots reinforcing involvement of ER to Golgi transport pathways (upregulated) and mitochondrial-related pathways (downregulated, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S5</xref>). In contrast, clustering of the 269 GO BP pathways highlighted the significant upregulation of interferon signalling pathways, which fall under the cluster of “regulation of response to external stimulus” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S6</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref> shows the 15 most downregulated and 15 most upregulated pathways from both GO CC and GO BP analyses, visualised by comparing normalised enrichment scores.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Interferon-driven signature is elevated across tissue cell types analysed in JDM patients</title><p id="P19">We next used our previously validated 15-gene IFN-stimulated gene signature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> to visualize variations in the expression patterns of IFN-stimulated genes across the different ROIs, from patients and controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. All 15 of these genes are associated with both Type I and Type II interferon signalling as annotated in the Interferome database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Heatmap visualization of normalized, scaled expression levels across ROIs revealed distinct patterns of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression between patients, with unsupervised clustering of ROIs primarily by patient. One JDM patient (JDM3) exhibited lower ISG expression compared to the other two JDM patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Analysis of IFN score values by ROI confirmed that all 3 patients had significantly higher IFN scores than controls, but that the IFN score of JDM3 was significantly lower than scores of JDM1 or JDM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Mitochondrial dysfunction is consistent across all JDM patients</title><p id="P21">To further analyse mitochondrial involvement within JDM muscle tissue, the 448 DEG identified in JDM muscle ROIs compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) were further examined based on their associated GO terms. Of these 448 genes, 75 were annotated with the GO term “mitochondrion”. This list was carefully curated, removing known ISGs, including 5 which were part of our IFN score, and other genes which are not specific to mitochondrial function, or only interact with mitochondria under specific conditions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Unsupervised clustering of the 41 remaining genes revealed clusters by ROI type (and therefore cell type), rather than by patient, suggesting that mitochondrial gene expression patterns are shaped by cell type and disease state, but were largely consistent across patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Among the JDM patient data, CD68+ macrophage regions exhibited significantly distinct mitochondrial scores compared to both JDM muscle (p &lt; 0.0001) and control muscle ROIs (p &lt; 0.0001) indicating cell-specific variation in mitochondrial gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), unlike the uniformity across cell types seen in interferon dysregulation in JDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). No statistically significant difference was observed between the muscle and muscle+immune-cell JDM mitochondrial scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, p = 0.1438). Analysis of the 41-gene score across patients confirmed that each patient had a highly significant altered mitochondrial score compared to controls, but there were no significant differences in mitochondrial scores between patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Together these results suggested that while the degree of IFN-driven pathology varied between cases, the mitochondrial abnormality was observed consistently across these 3 cases.</p><p id="P22">To validate these findings in an independent cohort, fGSEA analysis was performed using a publicly available RNAseq dataset, comparing four JDM with five control muscle biopsies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. As these data were bulk RNAseq, analysis was performed at the whole-biopsy level but not for specific regions or cell types within each biopsy. Analysis confirmed upregulation of IFN-driven and immune activation pathways, and downregulation of mitochondrial pathways (including oxidative phosphorylation, respiratory electron transport chain, ATP synthesis coupled electron transport), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>. This dataset also enabled transcriptome-wide quantification, including mitochondrial-encoded gene transcripts not captured by the GeoMx whole transcriptome atlas. Twenty of the 37 mitochondrial-encoded genes were significantly (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05, |Log2FC| ≥ 0.58) downregulated in JDM muscle compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>), and this was consistent across all cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>). Furthermore, 10 of the 41 mitochondrial score genes were significantly and consistently downregulated in JDM in the replication cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4SD, 4SE</xref>), while 13 genes of the 15-gene IFN score were significantly upregulated in this cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4SF</xref>). Again, we observed clear patient heterogeneity in levels of IFN-driven gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 4SG</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Relationship between IFN-driven and mitochondrial abnormalities in JDM Muscle</title><p id="P23">Given our intriguing finding of lack of correlation between IFN and mitochondrial pathological gene expression, we investigated this at protein level using conventional immunohistochemistry and chemical stains in a larger cohort (n=19), including 16 further UK-JDCBS JDM cases and the index 3 JDM cases, all treatment-naïve. Sections were stained and scored for IFN-driven MxA protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-D</xref>) and mitochondrial abnormality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E-J</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). JDM cases exhibited a range of mitochondrial deficiency severity (6 severe, 10 mild, 3 none) and IFN-driven MxA protein expression. However, there was no correlation between these two features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5K</xref>, p=0.657). In contrast, level of MxA protein upregulation on muscle fibres correlated with clinical weakness measured by MMT8 (p=0.0369) and CMAS (p=0.0084), replicating our previous findings in 103 cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P24">The histological feature of perifascicular atrophy (PFA) is well-recognised in dermatomyositis and has been shown to correlate with COX deficiency and mitochondrial abnormalities in JDM and adult DM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We tested whether PFA within the ROIs analysed by GeoMx was associated with mitochondrial abnormality. All 3 JDM cases demonstrated evidence of PFA. Of the 22 ROIs, 18 contained the edge of a fascicle allowing analysis for PFA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>). PFA was present in 55% (10/18) of these ROI including regions from all 3 cases. In this small sample, no correlation was observed between PFA and mitochondrial abnormality, assessed in the 8 muscle/muscle+immune ROIs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>). However, this result may relate to small sample size, the fact that GeoMx does not measure expression of mitochondrial-encoded genes, or that each ROI covers areas with PFA and others without, while GeoMx generates a bulk-like average 41-gene mitochondrial score for the whole ROI.</p><p id="P25">To define other biological pathways associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, two complementary approaches were performed. First, for each pathway cluster shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A-B</xref>, the most commonly-shared genes within each cluster were used to generate cluster-specific expression scores. In the second approach, fGSEA was run using MSigDB Hallmark gene sets, and scores calculated from the leading-edge genes of each pathway (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Across both methods, lower mitochondrial gene expression was consistently associated with reduced activity in metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis and genes involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) response as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-B</xref>). In addition, decreased expression of peroxisome-related genes, and downregulation of sarcomere organisation, were observed to be correlated with more severe mitochondrial abnormalities.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Transcriptomic differences between distinct regions of affected muscle and between patients</title><p id="P26">Since we observed differences in IFN-driven signature between cases, we tested for other transcriptomic differences across patients, comparing patient JDM3 with JDM1 and JDM2. Initially, muscle and muscle-immune ROIs were combined to increase statistical power. Analysis comparing JDM3 vs. JDM1+JDM2 revealed 176 DEGs between groups (100 upregulated, 76 downregulated genes in patients JDM1+JDM2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A</xref>). Pathway analysis indicated 208 enriched GO BP pathways; cluster network analysis highlighted interferon and immune-related pathway clusters, including “positive regulation of type I interferon production” (confirming our 15-gene IFN-score result, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), “antigen processing and presentation via MHC Class I via ER pathways”, and “antibacterial humoral response” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6B</xref>). In this comparison between patients, mitochondrial pathways were not differentially expressed, confirming earlier results suggesting consistent mitochondrial abnormalities in all cases. Separate DGE analysis performed between the CD68+ cell ROIs of patient JDM3 against those of patients JDM1+JDM2 revealed 63 DEGs, (43 upregulated, 20 downregulated in JDM1+JDM2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7A</xref>). Within this analysis, 148 GO BP pathways were significantly enriched, with the most prominent cluster being “negative regulation of viral genome replication” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>), indicating that expression of ISGs in muscle-infiltrating CD68+ cells also differed between the JDM patients. We also conducted DGE analysis for each ROI type comparing JDM1+JDM3 vs JDM2, and JDM2+JDM3 vs JDM1. Those comparisons did not reveal meaningful differences, yielding between 0 to 4 DEGs only (data not shown)</p><p id="P27">Finally, we explored transcriptional patterns in muscle-immune ROI (which had dense infiltrates of CD45+ immune cells, including CD3+/CD68+/CD20+ cells), compared to muscle-fibre only regions. Initial DGE analysis using the limma-voom pipeline suggested no significant DEGs between these ROI groups, based on the same fold change and adjusted p-value criteria (data not shown). However, fGSEA analysis revealed 28 significant pathways in the GO CC gene set and 317 significant pathways in the GO BP gene set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A, 7B</xref> respectively). These pathway-level findings suggested that immune-infiltrated muscle regions exhibited further downregulation of mitochondrial and metabolic pathways, alongside increased expression of immune-related and leukocyte activation pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). While not captured at the significant DEG level, these transcriptional differences are consistent with the expected biological impact of immune infiltration. These significant pathways are found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Tables S8</xref> (GO CC) and S9 (GO BP).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">Our previous work and that of others studying affected muscle in JDM, a key target tissue of pathology, has demonstrated upregulated expression of IFN-driven gene and protein expression. In muscle fibres this includes overexpression of class I MHC protein (also known as HLA class I)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, and myxovirus-resistance protein A (MxA1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Expression of IFN-driven proteins is variable between cases, but typically correlates with degree of weakness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Many studies have confirmed a strong IFN-driven transcriptional signature in both muscle and blood of both adult and paediatric patients with IIM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Therapies which target IFN or IFN-signalling are increasingly being tested in myositis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">Our previous gene expression analysis of peripheral blood lineage-sorted immune cells from patients with JDM revealed not only this known IFN-driven signature, but also a signature of mitochondrial dysfunction, most marked in blood monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> which was confirmed at the functional level and found to persist, and was not restored to normal by treatment, despite clear reduction in expression of ISGs on treatment. Furthermore, we showed that mitochondrial DNA was abnormally released in patient monocytes and could drive production of IFN and downstream ISGs, an effect that was mediated via C-GAS-STING and TLR9 pathways.</p><p id="P30">To date the majority of transcriptional studies published using muscle tissue of patients with IIM have used bulk RNA sequencing. In these datasets it is challenging to understand or define the role of different cells, or to identify how specific tissue micro-niches contribute to pathology. In this study, we have for the first time used spatial transcriptomic methods to analyse muscle tissue from children with JDM obtained at diagnosis prior to starting treatment compared to age-matched healthy muscle. Thus, our data are not confounded by effects of medication. We used Nanostring GeoMx® DSP to generate transcriptional data of three specific region types within the muscle. This allowed comparison of regions within the disease tissue including those where infiltrating immune cells are scarce, or not detected, in regions of dense clusters of inflammatory cells, and in regions where CD68+ infiltrating macrophages were predominant. Our data confirm successful use of this platform for analysis using historical cryopreserved muscle tissue.</p><p id="P31">Initial analysis of JDM compared to control tissue confirmed high expression of IFN-stimulated genes in all regions analysed. Furthermore, strong upregulation of pathways related to protein transport through the ER and Golgi, and ER stress, was observed, aligning well with our previous studies in human muscle and a transgenic mouse myositis model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. We also demonstrate that, as previously observed in blood monocytes, in the JDM tissue itself, muscle fibres have a highly dysregulated mitochondrial signature. Dysregulated pathways included those related to mitochondrial function, respiratory chain, and mitochondrial proton transport: their expression was downregulated in muscle. In addition, the signal for mitochondrial and respiratory chain related genes was distinct in CD68-enriched regions. By analysing RNAseq data from a second JDM cohort, we validated our results for these nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and additionally showed downregulation of mitochondrial-encoded genes. We investigated the relationship of the signatures to clinical activity as assessed by muscle weakness. We observed a correlation between IFN signature and weakness, whereby one patient who was minimally weak (MMT8 score 78) had lower expression of IFN-induced signature, than the two patients who were significantly weak (MMT8 scores 44 and 42). Interestingly this was different for mitochondrial signature detected in tissue, which was independent of the IFN signature. The downregulation of mitochondrial pathways was consistently observed for the index three patients, regardless of muscle strength, and across the three patients this result showed minimal variance for the 41-gene mitochondrial score we defined. We extended these findings in 19 cases at protein level, and replicated the observation of no correlation between level of IFN-driven protein expression with mitochondrial abnormality. A recent study suggested that IFNg itself leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in both a mouse model and patients with adult IIM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In contrast, our previous work in JDM monocytes suggested that circulating oxidised mitochondrial DNA itself may activate IFN pathways. The current study suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction can be equally prominent in patients with either low or high IFN score at both RNA and protein level, implying that IFN-independent drivers of mitochondrial dysfunction exist. If so, blocking of IFN by new therapeutic agents may not adequately control all aspects of disease pathology. Supporting this, recent evidence in IBM and PM suggests that mitochondrial-encoded gene mutations lead to inflammation and immune-cell infiltration, activating the cGAS/STING pathway, in the absence of IFN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. In a model of Parkinsons disease (PD) and PD patients, mitochondrial DNA damage triggers neuron pathology, which is, remarkably, exacerbated in the IFN-deficient mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Collectively these findings suggest that intersection between mitochondrial biology and interferon is bidirectional and complex, and that pathologies driven by altered mitochondrial DNA and function can act independently of IFN. Our demonstration that mitochondrial dysfunction correlates with altered function of the peroxisome, an organelle key to metabolic pathways which communicates with mitochondria may reveal further potential novel treatment targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P32">Our analysis of JDM muscle compared to healthy muscle also revealed other dysregulated pathways associated with disease, including ER to Golgi transport, sarcomere and T cell activation. We attribute this to the highly upregulated HLA class I and II DEG which are known to be upregulated in muscle fibres themselves in JDM.</p><p id="P33">Direct comparison of muscle-only to muscle+immune regions revealed pronounced downregulation of mitochondrial and metabolic pathways, alongside increased expression of immune-related pathways, in immune-infiltrated regions. This indicates that relative mitochondrial abnormalities differ between cell types in inflamed tissue, and concurs with evidence that the mitochondrial transcriptome differs across tissue types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. To precisely dissect specific tissue niches and cell interactions in JDM, future single-cell spatial analyses will provide more precise understanding of cell-specific contributions and define cell-cell interactions in JDM muscle tissue. Single cell spatial analysis of JDM muscle is underway to allow us to distinguish these issues.</p><p id="P34">This study has several limitations. The initial sample size (n=3 in each group) was small which limited our ability to detect gene expression differences with a small effect size, which may still be important to pathology: therefore, our findings should be interpreted with caution, especially when comparing 2 patients to one other. Despite this, key significant differences between patients and controls were replicated in a second cohort and our findings were validated at protein level in a larger cohort. Our previous analysis of 103 JDM muscle biopsies showed significant histological heterogeneity across cases which varied in part by MSA status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The current study was not powered to analyse for association between specific MSA status and transcriptional differences. A larger cohort will therefore be essential to capture the full variance in patient phenotype, MSA status, clinical severity and pathology, to provide a robust understanding of JDM-associated gene expression changes. Furthermore analysis of tissue-infiltrating CD68+ macrophages lacked a control comparison group due to the absence of CD68+ cells in normal muscle tissue limiting our ability to identify the unique transcriptomic signature of infiltrating macrophages against healthy macrophages.</p><p id="P35">This study represents the first application of spatial transcriptomics to JDM patient muscle biopsies using the GeoMx® technology, unveiling critical insights into mitochondrial and immune dysregulation at the tissue level. Importantly, we have defined parallel gene expression patterns in both the muscle and macrophage-rich regions of JDM muscle, as previously identified in blood monocytes. Together these data suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction is present across tissues and, that within the muscle itself this signal is readily detectable in both CD68+ infiltrating cells and muscle fibres. Our results also indicate that this mitochondrial dysfunction is uncoupled from the characteristic IFN-driven signature. Given that almost 50% of patients with JDM are not well-controlled on standard first-line treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, which are currently focused on the suppression of immune pathways, our demonstration that mitochondrial dysfunction is present in muscle of the majority of cases of JDM in this study has important implications. First, adjunctive therapies which target the mitochondrial pathology could be tested in combination with current treatments. Secondly, this signature may be readily tested and used to drive treatment choices in the future. Future work to define whether the mitochondrial signature in tissue correlates with that in blood will be important for design of stratification tools in trials of novel agents targeting the mitochondrial abnormality.</p><p id="P36">Our findings advance the understanding of JDM pathogenesis and lay the groundwork for future research into the use of therapies which specifically target mitochondrial dysfunction and immune-mediated damage.</p><sec id="S17"><title>Patient and public involvement and engagement</title><p id="P37">Patients and carers were involved at every stage of this research, including study conception, design, delivery, and analysis, through our partnership stakeholder group, the JDCBS PPIE group.
