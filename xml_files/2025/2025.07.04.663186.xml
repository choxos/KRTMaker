The intracellular functions of myosin motors involve adaptor proteins, which regulate cargo attachment and intracellular motor recruitment. To define the MYO1F interactome, we performed an in situ proximity labelling-based proteomic analysis in human myeloid U937 cells. We identified a distinct SH3-domain-dependent adaptor module comprising <underline>C</underline>D2AP, <underline>A</underline>SAP1, <underline>S</underline>H3BP2, and <underline>S</underline>H3KBP1 (CASS complex), which localizes with MYO1F in podosomes and phagocytic cups. Structural modelling and mutagenesis confirmed multivalent proline-rich motif interactions of the CASS complex with the MYO1F SH3 domain. Further deletions revealed a second group of membrane-associated adaptor proteins that bind to the MYO1F pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Immunofluorescence in macrophages and microglia confirmed the conserved localization of MYO1F and its adaptors at actin-rich podosomes and phagocytic cups. Functional assays demonstrated that MYO1F recruitment to the phagocytic cup requires motor activity and intact PH and SH3 domains. This study provides the first comparative interactome of MYO1F and its paralogue MYO1E and supports a role for MYO1F in podosomes and during phagocytosis in both peripheral and brain-resident myeloid cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Within eukaryotic cells, myosin motor proteins move cargo over short distances along actin tracks, regulate plasma membrane dynamics through the actin cortex and provide flexible tethering of organelles, vesicles and protein complexes to the actin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.

Another study shows that MYO1F mediates intercellular adhesion, which allows intestinal macrophage differentiation to a M1-phenotype.

Comparative analysis of these in vivo proximity maps highlights a functional overlap between these two myosins.

This work underscores the diverse interaction network of MYO1F, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms that enable this multifunctional motor protein to participate in a number of cellular processes. Notably, our findings also give insight into potential roles for MYO1F in neurodegeneration, as mutations in two of its adaptor proteins, CD2AP and SH3KBP1, have been implicated in late-onset AD.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Identification of the MYO1F interactome using in situ proximity labelling</title><p id="P8">To shed further light on the various proposed functions of MYO1F in myeloid cells and to capture potential MYO1F binding partners involved in these processes, we used in situ proximity labelling in living cells under steady state conditions. MYO1F is specifically expressed in myeloid cells such as THP-1, U937 and microglia while MYO1E is expressed in a wider variety of cell types and tissues including retinal epithelial cells (RPE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). For our <italic>in situ</italic> proximity labelling experiments, we generated U937 cell lines stably expressing the MYO1F tail domain (aa 692-1098), which includes the PH-domain in TH1 and the C-terminal SH3-domain, tagged at the N-terminus with the promiscuous biotin ligase, BirA R118G (BirA*) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We verified expression of the BirA*-MYO1F tail by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). After labelling with biotin for 24 hours, biotinylated proteins were collected by streptavidin pull-down and enriched proteins identified by mass spectrometry. Results from 6 independent experiments for BirA*-MYO1F tail and 3 each for both mutants, BirA*-MYO1F tail ΔPH or BirA*-MYO1F tail ΔSH3 were analysed against 6 BirA* - only U937 control pulldowns using label-free quantification (LFQ) intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Using a difference ≥ 4 of MYO1F over control we identified 47 significantly enriched proximal proteins shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1C</xref> as a heat map of the relative abundance of each protein interaction with MYO1F. These include the only known binding partner of MYO1F, SH3BP2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, and more than 40 novel MYO1F-associated proteins which might bind either directly or as part of larger MYO1F-asociated protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To dissect the domain-specific interaction profiles of MYO1F, we compared the interactomes of the full-length MYO1F tail with its SH3- and PH-domain mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-F</xref>). This analysis revealed a core group of adaptor proteins whose interaction with MYO1F was dependent on the SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C and E</xref>). These include SH3BP2 (also called 3BP2), SH3KBP1(also called CIN85), CD2AP (also called CMS), and ASAP1. These proteins, characterized by proline-rich regions or SH3 domains themselves, form a distinct protein module we termed the CASS complex (CD2AP-ASAP1-SH3BP2-SH3KBP1). The MYO1F interactome contains three further proteins that bind to the SH3 domain, the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, Formin-binding protein 1 (FNBP1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, and FYN-binding protein (FYB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C and E</xref>). These proteins share common pathways and functions related to the actin cytoskeleton and immune cell signalling, and FYB and WASP have been identified as part of a molecular complex during phagocytosis in macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Interestingly, mutation of the PH domain in the TH1 region did not affect binding of the CASS complex, but reduced binding to proteins with membrane-associating functions, such as for example utrophin (UTRN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> a cytoskeletal linker protein that anchors the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, ADD3 (Adducin gamma)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> a cytoskeletal protein that promotes spectrin-actin assembly at the plasma membrane, ITGA6 (Integrin alpha-6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> and PECAM1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> an endothelial cell adhesion molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C and F</xref>).

RPE cell lines stably expressing BirA*-MYO1E tail (aa 692-1108), and mutant constructs lacking either the SH3 domain (ΔSH3) or with point mutations in the PH domain (ΔPH), were generated and validated for expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). Biotinylated proteins were enriched via streptavidin pulldown following overnight biotin labelling and analysed by mass spectrometry. Data from 3 independent experiments for each construct were compared against 6 BirA*-only control pulldowns.</p><p id="P12">Proteins with a 4.5-fold increase over control were considered significantly enriched. As shown in the heatmap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, a distinct set of MYO1E-associated proteins was identified, some of which overlapped with the MYO1F interactome. Volcano plot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) revealed 45 high-confidence MYO1E-interacting proteins, including known actin-binding and membrane-associated proteins such as ITGA5 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, FERMT2 (also known as kindlin-2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, and CDC42EP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Disruption of the SH3 domain significantly altered the interactome, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, indicating that this domain is critical for specific protein interactions.

Proteins significantly enriched in the MYO1E interactome were associated with actin cytoskeleton organisation, membrane ruffling, and cell-substrate junction assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). This supports the notion that MYO1E plays a role in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal remodelling in epithelial cells, consistent with its known role in podosome function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">Comparison of the interactomes of MYO1E in RPE cells with MYO1F in both U937 and RPE cells revealed overlapping and distinct protein networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). A total of 10 proteins were shared among all three datasets, whereas 30 proteins were unique to MYO1F in U937 cells and 18 were specific to MYO1E in RPE cells and 19 for MYO1F in RPE cells. Interestingly, whereas only 3 proteins were shared between MYO1F in U937 and MYO1E in RPE cells this number was 49 when the proximity ligation experiments were performed for both myosins in RPE cells suggesting cell type -specific binding partners for MYO1F. These findings highlight both the conserved and divergent roles of long-tailed class I myosins across different cell types and suggest that MYO1E and MYO1F may perform overlapping yet distinct functions through differential binding partner selection.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Validation of the CASS complex as a MYO1F-associated adaptor protein complex</title><p id="P15">To validate MYO1F-binding partners identified by proximity labelling, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays with GFP-tagged MYO1F and candidate adaptor proteins in RPE cells. Among the most enriched hits in the MYO1F interactome were components of the CASS complex: CD2AP, ASAP1, SH3BP2 and SH3KBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).

In contrast, deletion of the SH3 domain (MYO1FΔSH3) abolished binding of CD2AP, SH3KBP1, SH3BP2 as well as ASAP1 indicating that these interactions are dependent on the SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, right panels).</p><p id="P17">To further dissect the architecture of the CASS complex, we performed siRNA knockdowns of SH3KBP1 and ASAP1 before pulling down GFP-MYO1F. Knockdown of SH3KBP1 had no effect on the binding of SH3BP2 to MYO1F indicating direct interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, knockdown of SH3KBP1 markedly reduced interaction of CD2AP with MYO1F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>), indicating mostly indirect binding of CD2AP via SH3KBP1 to MYO1F. Conversely, knockdown of ASAP1 did not reduce SH3KBP1 co-precipitation with MYO1F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>) and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>), suggesting that both SH3KBP1 and ASAP1 can bind directly to MYO1F.</p><p id="P18">These results confirm the physical association of MYO1F with a multi-protein complex comprising CD2AP, ASAP1, SH3BP2 and SH3KBP1.

The SH3 domain of MYO1F enables multivalent binding to proline-rich regions found in all members of the CASS complex.

The SH3 domain of MYO1F comprises 58 amino acids and adopts a canonical fold characterized by five antiparallel β-strands forming a compact β-barrel structure and a short 3<sub>10</sub> helix. SH3 domains typically recognize proline-rich motifs with the consensus XPxXP, where X is a hydrophobic residue and x any amino acid. These motifs engage hydrophobic grooves within the SH3 domain via conserved proline residues, and binding specificity is often enhanced by a third, negatively charged pocket that interacts with flanking positively charged residues. Co-immunoprecipitation from transiently transfected RPE cells revealed that deletion of the terminal 20 amino acids markedly reduced MYO1F binding to SH3KBP1 and ASAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). This region includes N1093 and Y1094, which are predicted by AlphaFold3 to contribute to the interaction with the proline-rich region of SH3BP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D and F</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To further explore the SH3-domain–ligand interface, we used AlphaFold3 to model the interaction between the MYO1F SH3 domain (aa 1042–1098) and full-length SH3BP2 (aa 1–651). Alphafold3 modelling predicts a high-confidence interaction (iPTM=0.87), shown as a red boxed area on the predicted aligned error (PAE) plot, between the MYO1F SH3 domain and a short proline-rich motif in SH3BP2 (PPVPANK; aa 350–356) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). The ipTM score provides an estimate of the predicted accuracy of the relative positioning between interacting protein domains, with values above 0.8 indicating high-confidence, high-accuracy predictions, whereas scores between 0.6 and 0.8 represent lower-confidence models that may be either correct or incorrect. The SH3BP2 proline-rich motif fits into a hydrophobic groove on the MYO1F SH3 domain, with multiple predicted hydrogen bonds stabilizing the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D and F</xref>). Structural modelling revealed that prolines P350 and P351 in SH3BP2 bind to residues Y1094 and N1093 (not in the hydrophobic groove) in the MYO1F SH3 domain, forming one hydrophobic groove, while P353 interacts with W1078 in a second hydrophobic pocket. In addition, the terminal lysine (K356) of the motif docks into a negatively charged specificity pocket formed by D1056, D1058, and E1059 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D and F</xref>).</p><p id="P21">To validate this predicted binding interface in cells, we generated myc-tagged SH3BP2 constructs with either a point mutation in the predicted core lysine (K356A) or a deletion of the entire PPVPANK motif (ΔPPVPANK). These constructs were co-expressed with GFP-MYO1F in RPE cells, and GFP-based pull-downs were performed. Western blotting revealed that both the K356A substitution and the PPVPANK deletion significantly reduced the interaction with MYO1F, confirming the functional importance of this motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Interestingly, deleting the PPVPANK motif does not fully abolish the interaction with MYO1F, suggesting that the additional proline-rich sequences present within SH3BP2 may allow interaction with the SH3 domain.</p><p id="P22">Taken together, these findings provide structural and biochemical evidence that the MYO1F SH3 domain recognizes the PPVPANK motif in SH3BP2 through canonical SH3 domain interactions, involving two hydrophobic grooves and a specificity pocket. The PPVPANK motif is thus the principal determinant for high-affinity SH3-domain-mediated binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Identification of multiple proline-rich motifs in ASAP1 that mediate binding to the MYO1F SH3 domain</title><p id="P23">To further dissect the molecular interface between MYO1F and ASAP1, we used AlphaFold3 to model the interaction between the MYO1F SH3 domain and the C-terminal half of ASAP1 (residues 589–1129). Structural predictions revealed several proline-rich motifs (PRMs) in ASAP1 that could potentially interact with the MYO1F SH3 domain, with distinct confidence scores indicated by ipTM values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). In the D/ELPPKP domain several PPKP motifs between residues 937-993 (region A in constructs 1 and 2) have been identified, which give a lower-confidence ipTM score of 0.66 and 0.69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Consistent with the lower ipTM score, co-immunoprecipitation assays using GFP-MYO1F and myc-tagged ASAP1 truncation constructs without these motifs showed only slight reduction in MYO1F binding (construct 3, residue 589-937), suggesting that these predicted motifs are not essential for the observed interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P24">To map the minimal region of ASAP1 required for MYO1F interaction, further C-terminal truncations in combination with AlphaFold-prediction were generated between residues 589–937 and assessed for MYO1F binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). While deletion of the class II motif (PKLPQK) at position (895-900), does not completely abolish ASAP1-MYO1F interaction (see construct 5 and 6), deletion of residues 784–820 (construct 7) abrogated MYO1F binding, suggesting that a PRM within this region mediates binding. AlphaFold3 predicted a class II PPLPPR motif (residues 791-796, motif C) in this segment with an ipTM of 0.87. Supporting this prediction, deletion of this region abolished binding, while its inclusion in construct 5 and 6 retained MYO1F interaction. Construct 4 appears to be an anomaly, as binding to MYO1F is abolished despite retaining the putative binding site in motif C. This observation may suggest that intramolecular folding or structural context also influence motif accessibility or binding affinity.</p><p id="P25">In summary, AlphaFold3 predictions together with experimental truncation mapping highlight that the MYO1F SH3 domain has the potential to interact with multiple PRMs in the C-terminal region of ASAP1. These results suggest that MYO1F exhibits binding plasticity across several partially redundant PRMs potentially allowing motor multimerization.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Subcellular localisation of MYO1F and its adaptor proteins in THP-1 macrophages</title><p id="P26">We next examined the subcellular localisation of endogenous MYO1F and its validated direct binding partners, ASAP1, SH3KBP1, and SH3BP2, in myeloid cells using high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated THP-1 macrophages.

Following the addition of Alexa647-labelled BSA-coated beads to stimulate phagocytosis, we assessed the accumulation of each protein at the actin-rich phagocytic cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>). In this assay we included the analysis of utrophin (UTRN), another putative MYO1F adaptor protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). UTRN is a very large protein, and so we used a shorter form, only containing the actin binding calponin homology domains (CH1-CH2). Quantifying the recruitment of the putative binding partners we observed that the UTRN CH1-CH2 domain (0.4±0.44), CD2AP (0.32±0.41) and SH3BP2 (0.49±0.45) accumulated almost equally at the phagocytic cup, while SH3KBP1 showed lower enrichment (0.14 ± 0.34) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>).

Full-length MYO1F-GFP displayed robust enrichment at the phagocytic cup (0.89 ± 0.79) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9A</xref> and 9B) consistent with a role in linking membrane dynamics to cortical actin during particle engulfment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. In contrast, mutation of the pleckstrin homology domain (ΔPH) or deletion of the SH3 domain (ΔSH3) led to significantly reduced accumulation (0.02 ± 0.20 and 0.16 ± 0.29, respectively).

We determined the interactome for both myosins using cell types in which they are endogenously expressed at high levels; RPE cells for MYO1E and both RPE and U937 cells for MYO1F. Using a combination of co-immunoprecipitation, mutagenesis, structural modelling and cell biological assays we characterised the functional CASS complex of CD2AP, ASAP1, SH3KBP1 and SH3BP2 that interacts with the C-terminal SH3-domain of MYO1F. In addition, we identified a number of membrane-localized proteins that depend on the intact MYO1F PH domain for binding, including NUMB, ADD3, PECAM1, GOLGA8R and GPR124.</p><p id="P39">Together, our proximity labelling and domain deletion strategies reveal two distinct functional modules within the MYO1F interactome: (1) a SH3-domain-dependent adaptor protein complex (CASS), involved in cytoskeletal organization and adaptor scaffolding, and (2) a PH-domain-associated set of membrane-associated proteins. These modules likely enable MYO1F to form a dynamic link between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton during processes such as podosome formation and phagocytosis.</p><p id="P40">Comparison of the interactomes revealed limited overlap between MYO1F in U937 and MYO1E in RPE cells reflecting their divergent tissue distributions and distinct functions. MYO1F expression is largely restricted to immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, as confirmed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), while MYO1E is broadly expressed across a variety of tissues including kidney, lung, intestine and immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In neutrophils, where both proteins are present at differing levels, MYO1E and MYO1F exhibit non-redundant roles. MYO1E deficiency caused increased rolling velocity, decreased adhesion, aberrant crawling, and strongly reduced transmigration through the capillary wall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. The highly expressed MYO1F is important for neutrophil migration as cells from the MYO1F KO mouse show stronger adhesion to integrin ligands consequently reducing cell motility under static conditions in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Finally, in mast cells MYO1F appears to regulate cortical actin filament dynamics affecting cell adhesion, migration and degranulation, a process that involves the adaptor protein SH3BP2, which we identified via in situ proximity labelling and verified using mutagenesis guided by AlphaFold-based structural predictions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. The display of these functional differences between MYO1E and F, when they are expressed in the same cell type, is supported by the only partially overlapping interactome. The limited sequence conservation in the tail region of only 55% identity does allow for distinct adaptor protein binding.</p><p id="P41">It has previously been demonstrated that the TH2 domain of MYO1E is essential for its podosomal localization, that the TH1 domain promotes its membrane enrichment and ventral localization, and that deletion of the SH3 domain does not impair its recruitment to podosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. While it was shown that the SH3 domain is dispensable for MYO1E, corresponding data for MYO1F were not presented. In contrast, our study reveals that the SH3 domain of MYO1F is essential for binding multiple podosome-resident adaptor proteins, including ASAP1, SH3KBP1, and SH3BP2. These interactions suggest that the SH3 domain of MYO1F is not crucial for recruitment but important for its functional engagement at podosomes and phagocytic structures. Notably, these binding partners are not shared with MYO1E, highlighting a mechanistic divergence from MYO1E and distinct recruitment strategies among long-tailed myosins of class I.</p><p id="P42">To date most functional studies on MYO1F have focused on peripheral immune cells, however emerging evidence indicates that MYO1F is also expressed in brain-resident microglia, the principal innate immune cells of the central nervous system. Although the precise molecular functions of MYO1F in microglia remain to be elucidated, our immunofluorescence studies in both primary mouse microglia and human iPSC-derived microglia reveal that MYO1F localises to ventral actin-rich structures resembling podosomes. These specialised adhesion sites are known to regulate cell-substrate interactions, matrix degradation, and mechanotransduction. The recruitment of MYO1F to these domains suggests that it may contribute to microglial adhesion, migration, and possibly cytokine secretion during neuroimmune responses.</p><p id="P43">There is gathering evidence for the dysregulation of peripheral and innate immune systems in neurodegenerative pathologies, including a skewed susceptibility of myeloid and microglial cells to inflammatory activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Given the selective upregulation of MYO1F in activated microglia in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, MYO1F may represent a novel therapeutic target, which warrants further investigations. Importantly, myosin motors are considered druggable proteins, exemplified by the development of small-molecule modulators for several myosin classes. Finally, the SH3KBP1-CD2AP complex binding to MYO1F has also been linked to neurodegeneration, particularly AD. CD2AP is an adaptor protein involved in actin, and membrane trafficking and genetic variants have been associated with increased risk for late-onset AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. SH3KBP1 (also known as CIN85) is a scaffold protein also involved in endocytosis and receptor tyrosine kinase trafficking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. While less studied than CD2AP in neurodegeneration, emerging data implicate SH3KBP1 in neuroinflammatory pathways. The selective expression and disease-associated regulation of MYO1F thus highlights its potential as a pharmacological target for regulating microglial activation and attenuating neuroinflammation in conditions such as AD or FTD/ALS.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Antibodies</title><p id="P44">The following antibodies were used: MYO1F (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-376534), MYO1E (Atlas Antibodies, HPA023886), actin (Sigma, A2066), IBA1 (Wako, 019-19741), P2Y12 (Biolegend), GFP (Invitrogen, A11122), myc (Millipore, 05-724), SH3KBP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-166862), ASAP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-374410), EF2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-166415), rabbit anti BSA (MPBiological 8651111).

After protein transfer on to nitrocellulose (Protran, Amersham), the membrane was blocked with 5% milk in PBS-T (0.05% Tween-20 in PBS), incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, washed with PBS-T and incubated with the corresponding HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1h at RT. After washing, bound antibody was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and exposed to X-ray film (Fujifilm) or imaged using a G:BOX imaging system (Syngene).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>BioID purification and sample processing</title><p id="P57">RPE cells (3x150mm dishes at 50% confluency) or U937 cells (approximately 4x10<sup>7</sup> cells) were supplemented with 50µM biotin in growth media and incubated for 24h. Cells were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche cOmplete Mini, EDTA-free)), sonicated, centrifuged, and the supernatants mixed with high capacity streptavidin beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 3h at 4°C. Beads were washed with RIPA buffer, TBS and 50mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8 before incubation with 10mM DTT for 30min at 56°C. The solution was spiked with 10µl 550mM Iodoacetamide (Sigma BioUltra) for 20min at room temperature and the beads washed in ammonium bicarbonate before digestion overnight with 0.5µg Trypsin Gold (Promega) at 37°C. An additional 0.5µg trypsin was added the following day and incubated for a further 2h. After centrifugation the supernatants were collected and the beads washed twice with 150µl HPLC-grade H<sub>2</sub>O (Sigma, CHROMASOLV) and all supernatants combined. These were spiked with 1µl Trifluoroacetic acid and dried to a pellet in a vacuum centrifuge.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Mass spectroscopy (MS) acquisition and data analysis</title><p id="P58">Samples were resuspended in MS solvent (3% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA) for analysis on a Q Exactive Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an RSLC3000nano UPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were resolved using a 50 cm C18 PepMap EASYspray column with a gradient rising from 97% solvent A (0.1% formic acid), 3% solvent B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) to 40% solvent B over 40 min. Data were acquired in a top 10 data-dependent acquisition fashion with MS spectra acquired between m/z 400 and 1,500 at 70,000 fwhm. MSMS spectra were acquired at 17,500 fwhm and excluded from further fragmentation for 30 s. Raw files were processed as a single batch using the MaxQuant proteomics software package version 2.4.13.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Spectra were searched against a reviewed Uniprot homo sapiens database (downloaded 24/10/23). Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification, and methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation were selected as variable modifications. Both peptide and protein false discovery rates (FDRs) were set to 0.01, the minimum peptide length was set at 8 amino acids, and up to two missed cleavages were tolerated.</p><p id="P59">Bioinformatics analysis was performed in the Perseus package bundled with MaxQuant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>.

LFQ intensities were filtered for reverse, potential contaminant, identified by site and transformed by log<sub>2</sub>(x). Proteins were filtered based on minimum of 3 valid values and missing values imputed with a width of 0.3 and downshift of 2.0. The false discovery rate was set at 0.01 and the S0 value at 2.0.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Phagocytosis assay and image Acquisition</title><p id="P61">RAW cells (approximately 400,000 cells) were nucleofected with the Lonza Nucleofector system (SF Cell Line, Lonza). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 90 × g 5min and resuspended in 20 µL of Nucleofector solution supplemented with 0.4 µg of plasmid DNA. Following nucleofection, cells were incubated for 5 minutes at room temepraturebefore being transferred to pre-warmed complete culture medium and seeded onto ethanol-sterilized glass coverslips for overnight culture.</p><p id="P62">BSA-coated polysterene beads (6-8µm, Spherotech BP-60-5) were washed three times with 1x PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 µg/mL Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-BSA antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A7816). After 24h, the beads were washed three times with 1xPBS and resuspended in pre-warmed culture media. To initiate phagocytosis, the cell media was replaced with the prepared bead solution (10x excess over number of cells seeded) and incubated at 37°C, 5%CO<sub>2</sub> for 15min before fixing in 4% PFA and 3x washing with 1x PBS.</p><p id="P63">The cells were imaged on a spinning-disc confocal microscope (Revolution; Andor) on DMi8 (Leica) housing, equipped with a spinning-disk unit (CSU-X1; Yokogawa) using a 60x Objective 1.3NA (Leica) and 405, 488 and 561nm lasers. Image stacks were acquired as averages of 2 at a z-interval of 0.2µm with an iXon Ultra 888 EmCCD camera (Andor) set to 250 Gain and 50ms exposure.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Image Analysis</title><p id="P64">ImageJ was used to calculate maximum Z projections of the image stacks. To quantify the accumulation of protein intensity at the phagocytic cup, masks for the three channels (bead, actin and the protein of interest) were created via the OTSU algorithm. For the actin mask the threshold was set at 2* the calculated Otsu threshold. To segment the area of the actin which forms the phagocytic cup, the bead mask and the actin mask were multiplied to select only actin structures that did contain a fluorescent bead (see Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The accumulation of the protein of interest was then quantified as the ratio of average protein intensity inside the actin ring (I<sub>inside</sub>) divided by the average protein intensity in the protein mask without the actin ring (I<sub>outside</sub>) minus one. <disp-formula id="FD1"><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>
