Some pathogenic variants of GCN2 are amenable to pharmacological reactivation by low concentrations of ATP-pocket binding inhibitors. Kinase inhibition at modestly elevated concentrations limits the clinical utility of these drugs against PVOD. We therefore performed an <italic>in cellulo</italic> chemical screen for GCN2 activators and identified three structurally distinct compounds with low micromolar stimulatory activities. Unlike previously described GCN2 activators, one of these molecules activated GCN2 independently of GCN1. Modelling supported by structure activity screens suggested it binds within the ATP-pocket of GCN2, but unlike existing ligands does not protrude inward into the allosteric pocket or outward into the solvent. This overcomes a key requirement of other GCN2 activators.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) mediates the response to a variety of stresses by regulating translation, metabolism and cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). In yeast, GCN2 is the sole eIF2α kinase and triggers the General Control Response to the accumulation of uncharged tRNA and to ribosome stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Gene duplication gave rise to a family of eIF2α kinases in multicellular organisms linking eIF2α phosphorylation to a variety of other stresses. HRI (EIF2AK1) is activated by haem deficiency, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), PKR (EIF2AK2) responds to cytosolic double stranded RNA during viral infections, while PERK (EIF2AK3) is activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Mutations affecting these kinases have been linked to the development of disease and so their manipulation by small molecules is being pursued as a means to develop therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The eIF2 complex recruits initiator methionyl-tRNA to ribosomes commencing protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). This requires eIF2 to bind GTP, which is subsequently hydrolysed. Bound GTP is replenished by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), but phosphorylated p-eIF2α binds avidly to eIF2B inhibiting its GEF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). When levels of eIF2-GTP-tRNA-Met subsequently fall, most translation is disfavoured, but some transcripts are translated more efficiently owing to the presence of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) within their 5’ untranslated regions (5’UTRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). ATF4 and CHOP are transcription factors upregulated in this manner during stress to induce genes of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Eventually, PPP1R15A (also called GADD34), itself an ISR target, dephosphorylates p-eIF2α to restore the basal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).</p><p id="P4">GCN2 is comprised of five domains—RWD, pseudokinase, kinase, HisRS-like, and C-terminal—and exists constitutively as a homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Its kinase activity is stimulated when the RWD domain interacts with colliding ribosomes via the cofactor GCN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) or when the HisRS domain interacts with deacylated tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Direct interaction between GCN2 and the ribosome P-stalk can also mediate GCN2 activation during ribosome stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Mutations of <italic>EIF2AK4</italic>, which encodes GCN2, cause the aggressive subtypes of familial pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary capillary haemangiomatosis (PCH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Some pathogenic alleles generate hypomorphic variants of GCN2 that we and others have shown can be activated by small molecule inhibitors that bind to the GCN2 ATP pocket, e.g. neratinib and GCN2iB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Type-1 inhibitors bind the ATP pocket of the kinase in its active conformation (DFG-Asp-in, αC-helix-in), while type 2 inhibitors bind the inactive conformation (DFG-out, αC-helix-out) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Type 1.5 inhibitors, by contrast, bind an intermediate conformation (DFG-Asp-in, αC-helix-out). Several type 1 and 1.5 kinase inhibitors can activate GCN2 at low concentrations while inhibiting at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). GCN2iB is a relatively selective type 1.5 inhibitor of GCN2 that activates the kinase at submicromolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). It is hypothesised that drug-induced stabilisation of one GCN2 protomer within a dimer is propagated to the second protomer to cause its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Several inhibitors of other kinases that are in clinical use or development as anticancer agents activate GCN2 in a GCN1-dependent manner, which may contribute to their therapeutic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>).

We therefore performed a cell-based chemical screen for GCN2-dependent activators of the ISR, followed by <italic>in vitro</italic> validation using orthogonal approaches.

Activation of the ISR could be detected as bioluminescence in response to ISR activators histidinol, tunicamycin and latrunculin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). A high-throughput screen of the BioAscent library of 123,222 drug-like compounds performed by the ALBORADA Drug Discovery Institute, yielded two separate pools of potential ISR inhibitors and activators. Using this knowledge, we assembled a subset of 6,600 compounds from the BioAscent library enriched for potential ISR activators and screened these in 348-well format at 10μM for 16 hours. To increase sensitivity, screens were performed with test compound alone or combined with the half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of histidinol. This yielded 153 compounds that activated the reporter at least three standard deviations above baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The pipeline used to filter hit compounds is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>. Counter screens were performed against constitutively expressed Nanoluc, to exclude trivial activators of luminescent proteins, leaving 134 hits. Cytotoxicity assays excluded immediately toxic compounds leaving 130. Hits were then re-screened using a second CHO ATF4::Luc2 reporter cell line, shortlisting 89 lead compounds. GCN2-deficient ATF4::NanoLuc CHO reporter cells were generated by introducing the reporter into <italic>Eif2ak4-/-</italic>CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Thirty compounds were selected based on GCN2 dependency, where stimulation was lost in GCN2 null cells. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) verified compound purity and quality leaving 16 lead compounds of high confidence from the original library stocks.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Orthogonal secondary screen</title><p id="P9">The ISR can be activated in isolation or in combination with other stress signalling pathways, for example as part of the unfolded protein response (UPR) to ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). To distinguish between inducers of ER stress and selective activators of the ISR, we used dual reporter CHO cells that express a fluorescent ISR reporter (CHOP::GFP) and a reporter of IRE1 activity (XBP1::Turquoise) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Histidinol served as a positive control for ISR activation via GCN2, while tunicamycin was used to induced ER stress and activate the UPR. <italic>Eif2ak4</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> CHO cells were used to assess GCN2 dependence, while <italic>Ppp1r15a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> cells, which are impaired in the dephosphorylation of eIF2α, were used to amplify the effects of ISR activation. Histidinol selectively activated the CHOP::GFP ISR reporter in wildtype and <italic>Ppp1r15a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> cells, but not in GCN2 deleted cells, validating this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). As expected, the ISR was exaggerated in the <italic>Ppp1r15a</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> cells owing to their defective dephosphorylation of eIF2α. Tunicamycin activated both the CHOP::GFP and XBP1::Turquoise reporter in all three genotypes.</p><p id="P10">The 16 lead compounds were next examined both in the presence and absence of a submaximal concentration of histidinol. Using this orthogonal approach, three compounds were found to be GCN2 selective activators of the ISR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B&amp;C</xref>). Those which induced ER stress or showed minimal GCN2 dependence are not shown. Reporter activation was measured by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) after 18 hours of treatment with 30μM compound 18, 20μM compound 20, and 7.5μM compound 21. The three GCN2 selective activators included compound 18, <italic>N-(4-{[(furan-2-yl)methyl]sulfamoyl}phenyl)-3-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-thieno[2</italic>,<italic>3-c]pyrazole-5-carboxamide</italic>, containing a furan and two phenyl rings; compound 20, <italic>4’-methyl-N~2~-2-pyrimidinyl-4</italic>,<italic>5’-bi-1</italic>,<italic>3-thiazole-2</italic>,<italic>2’-diamine</italic>, containing two aminothiazoles; and compound 21, <italic>5-(4-bromophenyl)-2-(methylsulfonyl)pyrimidine</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Larger quantities of compound 18 were then purchased from TimTec, USA (compound ST51216373); compound 20 was synthesised by ChemBridge, USA (compound 5935953); and compound 21 was purchased from Specs, Netherlands (compound AC-907/25005415). After validating their effects using the assays described above, we next confirmed activation of the ISR by these compounds at the transcriptional level. CHO cells were treated with 30μM of compound 18 or 10μM of compound 20 or 21 for 4 hours and expression of the ISR target genes <italic>Chop</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r15a</italic> was measured using qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). All three induced ISR gene expression, with compound 20 eliciting the strongest response.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cell line differences in GCN2 activator potencies</title><p id="P12">Neratinib is an ATP-competitive pan-HER kinase inhibitor used clinically in the treatment of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to neratinib is dependent on GCN2, with GCN2 activation observed at submicromolar concentrations but inhibition at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). We reproduced this biphasic activation of the ISR reporter in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells and hamster CHO cells, recording EC<sub>50</sub> values for activation of 269nM (95% CI 218-322nM) and 690nM (95% CI 634-772nM) respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Disruption of the <italic>EIF2AK4</italic> gene by CRISPR/Cas9 (<italic>EIF2AK4</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>) in HeLa cells abrogated ISR activation confirming the effect to be mediated by GCN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, middle panel).</p><p id="P13">In CHO cells, compound 18 was the least potent with an EC<sub>50</sub> of greater than 30μM in CHO cells without obvious inhibition up to 100μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Notably, compound 18 failed to activate the ISR measurably in either HeLa cells or human embryonic kidney 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Compound 20 activated the ISR in CHO cells in a biphasic manner with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 4.8μM (95% CI 4.0-5.6μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). It was active in 293T cells though with a lower potency, EC<sub>50</sub> of 17μM, but was inactive in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Compound 21 also showed biphasic activation of the ISR in CHO cells with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 5.0μM (95% CI 3.9-6.5μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Supporting a role for GCN2 in mediating the compounds’ effects, GCN2iB substantially reduced ISR reporter expression by each, though this effect was only partial at concentrations of compound 20 above 10μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). This might indicate GCN2-independent effects or an ability to partially outcompete GCN2iB for binding at higher concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Compound 20 activates GCN2 in a GCN1-independent manner</title><p id="P15">GCN1 mediates the interaction between stalled ribosomes and GCN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Histidinol is a competitive inhibitor of the histidyl-tRNA synthetase that depletes the cell of charged histidyl-tRNA, thus causing ribosome stalling and activation of the ISR in a GCN1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Using GCN1 deficient human 293T cells transiently expressing the ATF4::NanoLuc reporter, we confirmed that activation of the ISR by histidinol requires GCN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Low concentrations of GCN2iB (5-70nM) had minimal effect on ISR reporter activation, while neratinib robustly triggered the ISR. The stimulatory effects of neratinib were significantly attenuated in GCN1 deficient cells consistent with the observation that GCN1 knockout renders astrocytoma cells resistant to neratinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). By contrast, activation of the ISR by compound 20, chosen for having the largest effect size in 293T cells, did not require GCN1 to activate the ISR reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Indeed, loss of GCN1 modestly increased ISR activation at the highest concentration of compound 20 suggesting a mode of action independent of ribosome stalling. To gain confidence in this observation, we inactivated the <italic>Gcn1</italic> gene in CHO cells by CRISPR/Cas9. Neratinib-induced activation of the ATF4::NanoLuc ISR reporter was lost in GCN1 deficient CHO cells; however, ISR activation by compound 20 was completely insensitive to loss of GCN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P16">No systematic assessment of GCN1 dependence has previously been performed for GCN2 activating drugs. We therefore proceeded to test a panel of ten additional kinase inhibitors that had been reported to activate GCN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Our panel included examples of multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dovitinib, sunitinib), RAF inhibitors (LY3009120, dabrafenib), inhibitors of the Wee1 kinase involved in G2 cell cycle checkpoint (WEE1-IN-4, AZD1775, Debio 0123), an inhibitor of the Heat Shock Factor 1 pathway (NXP800), and EGFR inhibitors (erlotinib and gefinitinib) (9, 11, 26, 31, 40-42). In all cases, a marked reduction in GCN2 activation by the drugs was observed in GCN1 deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Most of these molecules failed to activate the ISR in the absence of GCN1 (sunitinib, NXP800, dovitinib, AZD1775, dabrafenib, gefinitinib, LY3009120), while for three drugs weak activation of the ISR was seen at higher concentrations (WEE1-IN-4, Debio 0123, erlotinib). None showed the dramatic GCN1 independence observed for compound 20 in unstressed cells.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>ATP-competitive interaction with the GCN2 kinase domain</title><p id="P17">Existing activators of GCN2 have been shown to interact with the ATP binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). We therefore used a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based assay to examine the interaction of the three lead compounds with the kinase domain of GCN2 in cells. Briefly, the N-terminal portion of human GCN2 kinase domain fused to NanoLuc luciferase was expressed in either CHO or 293T cells. These were then treated with an ATP-binding pocked tracer. In this system, energy transfer is proportional to tracer binding to the NanoLuc-tagged kinase domain, and so interactions of other molecules that displace the tracer reduce the BRET ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). In both CHO and 293T cells, GCN2iB efficiently suppressed the BRET ratio thus validating the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). All three lead compounds significantly reduced the BRET ratio, though unlike GCN2iB, compounds 18 and 20 were noticeably more effective in CHO than in 293T cells. Although compound 21 suppressed BRET in both cell types, its effect was less dramatic in CHO cells compared to compounds 18 and 20.</p><p id="P18">To examine further the interaction of compounds 18 and 20 with GCN2’s kinase domain, we generated in bacteria a recombinant protein comprising Glutathione S-transferases (GST) fused to the kinase domain of human GCN2 (residues 585 to 1005 of NCBI reference Sequence NP_001013725.2). GST was chosen both to facilitate protein purification, and to enhance dimerisation of the kinase domain in order to cause autophosphorylation and constitutive activation. When incubated <italic>in vitro</italic> with increasing concentrations of ATP and a fixed quantity of His6-tagged bacterially expressed eIF2α N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), GST-GCN2 kinase domain phosphorylated its substrate on serine 51, as detected by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Neratinib dose-dependently inhibited eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>, lanes 1-5). The lack of activation by neratinib likely reflected the requirement for autoinhibitory domains of GCN2 to observe this effect. Therefore, in this system inhibition of eIF2α kinase activity was used as a surrogate for target engagement. Compounds 18 and 20 also inhibited eIF2α phosphorylation, while compound 21 appeared inactive in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). High concentrations of ATP were unable to completely overcome the inhibition by compounds 18 or 20, suggesting a mode of action, at least partially, non-competitive in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E&amp;F</xref>).</p><p id="P19">To test the ability of compound 20 to activate full-length GCN2, we next generated full-length human GCN2 (uniprot ID: Q9P2K8) through baculoviral expression using an N-terminal twin StrepII tag.

Lower concentrations of ATP (10μM for GCN2, 0.1μM for PERK, 0.15μM for HRI, 0.1μM for PKR) were used to accentuate antagonism at the ATP site. Under these conditions, in contrast to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref> where 100μM ATP was used, activation of GCN2 is not observed with any of the compounds tested. At low ATP, full length, purified GCN2 was efficiently inhibited by GCN2iB with an IC<sub>50</sub> on 1.55nM. None of the screen hits reached 50% inhibition at the highest concentration tested (3μM) though compound 20 and to a lesser extend 18, appear to cause weak inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). No inhibition was observed with the test compounds again purified PERK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). The PERK inhibitor GSK2606414 served as a positive control with an expected IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.66nM.

Published crystals structures of the GCN2 kinase domain (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">methods</xref>) show the ATP binding pocket comprises a large solvent exposed region and a buried hydrophobic region that extends beyond the gatekeeper residue (Met802) and towards the ⍰C-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Compound 18 was predicted to occupy a similar pocket to that of the ligand in the PDB 6N3N crystal structure demonstrating a Type 1.5 binding configuration, characterised by the DFG loop being “in” and the ⍰C-helix being in the “out” conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The furan motif of compound 18 is predicted to be buried in the allosteric pocket around αC-helix, between gatekeeper Met802 and Leu640 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). The compound’s sulfone was predicted to interact with Phe867 of the conserved DFG-motif. In neratinib, a triad of hydrogen bonding was predicted between the 8-position of the isoquinoline core (Ar-H bond), the amine linker (H bond) and the 2-position of the fluorobenzene ring (Ar-H Bond) with Asp866, similar to the predicted interaction between the amide linkage of compound 18 and Asp866 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Both neratinib and compound 18 were also predicted to protrude into the solvent exposed space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B-E</xref>). However, the interaction of neratinib with Cys805 of the hinge region through the nitrile of isoquinoline core was not present in compound 18.</p><p id="P22">Due to the metabolic liabilities of furans in medicinal chemistry programs, we sought to explore the importance of this motif for binding and activity using available structural analogues. Replacement of the sulfonamide furan motif with some benzene derivatives including phenolic (BCC0106222), 2-bromobenzene (BCC0113320), 3-acetylbezene (BCC0104214), preserved ISR activation while others (BCC0073242 and BCC0043997) resulted in a loss of activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Incorporation of heterocyclic ring systems (BCC0073142, Z56783036) or modification of solvent exposed region (Z88478561, Z226209130, Z11741677) were similarly not tolerated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). However, modifying the furan motif to benzene derivative 2-bromobenzene (BCC0113320) and heterocyclic ring (BCC0077119) preserved GCN2-specific ISR activation.</p><p id="P23">Unlike compound 18 and neratinib, compound 20 was not predicted to protrude into the allosteric pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F&amp;G</xref>). Analogues extending further towards the ⍰C-helix and protruding into the solvent exposed region were inactive (e.g., Z134826202 and Z118606822), suggesting that the small size of compound 20 may be advantageous, fitting into the ATP-binding pocket of GCN2 and facilitating stronger activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Hydrogen bond interaction was predicted between the NH<sub>2</sub> of the compound 20 aminothiazole with the carbonyl of the hinge region Cys805. Additional interaction was predicted between the linker NH of compound 20 and backbone carbonyl of Asp866 in the DFG-motif. Such 2-aminopyrimidine rings are present in many kinase ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Rather than this interacting with hinge region residues, this moiety in compound 20 was predicted to form a pi-cation interaction with Lys619 and a hydrogen bond with DFG Asp866, as has been reported for other ligands of kinase ATP pockets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Replacement of this pyrimidine ring with 2-pyridine analogues (BCC0084738, BCC0079350 and BCC0083923) was well tolerated, likely due to the conserved hydrogen bonding interaction between the pyridine nitrogen and Asp866. Removal of a nitrogen from the ring system, such as BCC0057014, BCC0089519, BCC0084744, and BCC0084833 all resulted in a loss of activity, possibly due to their lack of interaction with Asp866 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Due to toxicity issues surrounding 3-aminothiazoles, modifications were made to replace the terminal thiazole ring system with phenyl derivatives (BCC0080152, BCC0075509, BCC0084830, BCC0057431 and BCC0080200). However, these resulted in a decrease in activity towards GCN2, suggesting that there might be a steric component contributing to activity. Replacing the thiazole with a minimally steric affecting thiophene (BCC0079876) also led to activity loss, possibly due to the twisting of central thiazole ring that impaired hydrogen bonding between pyrimidine nitrogen and Asp866. We were therefore unable to improve upon compound 20’s activity but gained valuable SAR information for future development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">The ISR plays a critical role for maintaining homeostasis under diverse stress conditions and its disruption results in a variety of disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The observation that some pathogenic variants of GCN2 are amenable to pharmacological activation led us to seek novel GCN2 activators. Our chemical screen identified three chemically distinct GCN2 activating molecules, one of which is, to our knowledge, the first to show independence from GCN1 for its activity. This may prove useful as a tool compound for the study of GCN2 in cells and using purified components since it overcomes at least one hurdle to kinase activation.</p><p id="P25">Compounds 18 and 20 demonstrate weak inhibition of the related kinase PKR. Previous structural analyses have shown the kinase domains of PKR and GCN2 to be highly conserved, particularly at the ATP-binding pocket, which likely contributes to this effect. Indeed, a previous publication reported that other small molecule inhibitors of GCN2, including a series based on a triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidine scaffold, demonstrated cross-inhibition of PKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Furthermore, the PKR inhibitor C16 has been shown to activate GCN2 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Intriguingly, viral infections or synthetic dsRNA known to activate PKR, have also been shown to trigger GCN2 in some circumstances, though if this relates to structural similarities of their kinase domains has not been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>).</p><p id="P26">A remarkable finding in the current study was the lack of dependence on GCN1 for compound 20 to activate GCN2 in cells. During amino acid starvation, ribosome-associated GCN1 facilitates binding of uncharged tRNAs to GCN2, thus facilitating GCN2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). GCN1 also functions as a disome detector, enabling GCN2 activation in response to ribosome collisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). In genetic screens identifying modifiers of GCN2 activation by a small molecule, such as the dual HER2/EGFR inhibitor neratinib and the WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775, GCN1 has repeatedly been found to be necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). We were able to confirm this GCN1 dependence for neratinib in the present study. It was therefore surprising that GCN2 activation by compound 20 did not appear to require GCN1 in human or hamster cells. While GCN1 is essential for the activation of GCN2 by amino acid starvation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that GCN2 activation by the ribosome P-stalk or by deacylated tRNAs does not absolutely require GCN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Yet we found compound 20 able to activate purified full-length human GCN2 to a far higher level than was possible with purified tRNAs. Our modelling suggests that unlike neratinib, compound 20 can fit within the ATP-pocket without needing to protrude into the solvent, nor extending deeply into the hydrophobic region beyond the gatekeeper Met802 residue towards the ⍰C-helix. Indeed, analogues extending in these directions were inactive, perhaps suggesting value to this molecule’s small size. This may prove useful as a tool compound for studies in which GCN1 is unavailable or non-functional.</p><p id="P27">There are limitations to our study. So far, our experiments have been limited to cultured cells, purified proteins, and <italic>in silico</italic> modelling. We have yet to test our compounds in an animal model. Although our pipeline excluded molecules showing toxicity, it is likely that prolonged activation of the ISR will have toxic consequences via targets including CHOP and PPP1R15A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Our most promising molecule, compound 20, contains a 2-aminothiazole. Although known to be a versatile scaffold, appearing in several clinically useful drugs including anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anticancer agents, 2-aminothiazole is sometimes considered a toxicophore owing to toxic consequences following its metabolism, and as a pan-assay interference compound (PAINS), owing to frequent false positives in high-throughput drug screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). Our use of orthogonal approaches to support its activity as a GCN2 activator, mitigate against it being a non-specific hit. Nevertheless, if this compound were to be developed further, attempts to ‘design out’ this feature by, for example, replacing the sulphur for an oxygen (thiazole to oxazole switch) could be attempted. Indeed, computational modelling reveals an adjacent NH which should form a stronger H-bond to oxygen of an oxazole, which may result in an improved potency to GCN2. Another potential limitation of our study is the use of existing analogues in SAR studies, the so-called ‘analogue by catalogue’ approach. Although less systematic than chemically synthesising further series <italic>de novo</italic>, it was cost effective and generated useful information on the tolerability of modifications of our lead scaffolds. Finally, our compounds were identified in a screen of CHO cells and appear to be more effective in these cells that in HeLa and 293T models. The absence of detectable activity in HeLa cells does not appear to be a species effect, since some activity was observed in human 293T cells and when using recombinant human GCN2 protein. It is likely therefore to reflect cell-type effects, since cancer cell lines are known to demonstrate dramatic differences in drug efficiency, even when using different strains of the same cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). This should be considered carefully when using these compounds as tools or for further drug development.</p><p id="P28">In summary, we performed a chemical screen for novel activators of GCN2.

IC<sub>50</sub> values were determined in GraphPad Prism 8.0, using a 4-parameter model: log(inhibitor) vs. response – variable slope.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>In silico modelling</title><p id="P40">Five reported crystal structures for human GCN2 were considered (PDB 63N3, 6N3O, 6N3L, 7QWK, and 7QQ6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Of these, 6N3N and 6N3L share ~100% sequence homology. While 6N3N has unresolved amino acids residues, these are remote from the ATP binding site and should not impact the binding of the ligands. A visual inspection of 6N3O, 6N3N, and 6N3L highlighted that the activation loop in 6N3L is cut short and does not extend beyond the ⍰C-helix, affecting the orientation of the DFG loop and its residues (Asp866, Phe867, Gly868). As such, 6N3L was not considered for further analysis. PDB sequences 7QWK and 7QQ6 share ~75% sequence homology, with 7QWK containing unresolved residues remote from the ATP binding site. As observed with PDB 6N3L, the activation loop containing the DFG residues is cut short in both cases and does not extend beyond the ⍰C-helix. Inspection of the binding mode of crystallised ligands of 7QQ6 and 7QWK demonstrate that these bind in a Type I binding pocket, compared to Type II binding as observed in 6N3O.</p><p id="P41">Prior to docking, the protein structure (PDB ID: 6N3N) was put through the Protein Preparation Protocol of Maestro. This protocol added hydrogens, removed co-crystallised water molecules, optimised the receptor’s hydrogen bond network, enumerated bond orders, and performed a restrained minimisation to alleviate backbone clashes with the receptor backbone. The protein was prepared at pH7.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). SiteMap module was used on the prepared protein, with all settings set to default (SiteMap, Schrödinger Release 2024-4, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.schrodinger.com/">http://www.schrodinger.com/</ext-link>). Grid generation was performed using the Glide Docking Protocol in Masestro (Glide, Schrödinger Release 2024-4, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.schrodinger.com/">http://www.schrodinger.com/</ext-link>). This was centred around Met802 and Lys619. High throughput virtual screening (HTVS) setting was used for docking.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figure 1</label><caption><title>Compound activity across eIF2α kinases using <italic>LanthaScreen in vitro kinase activity assay</italic></title><p id="P42">Left panels: dose-dependent inhibition of GCN2, PERK, HRI or PKR with positive control drug GCN2iB or GSK2606414.
