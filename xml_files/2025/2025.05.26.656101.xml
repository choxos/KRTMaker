They continue to be important therapeutic targets for multiple disorders including autoimmune diseases, acute and chronic inflammation, and allergy-related conditions. Recent structural coverage has provided important insights into their activation and signaling, however, confounding observations in the literature related to ligand efficacy and functional responses, especially in different model systems, present a major challenge for drug discovery efforts. Here, we systematically and comprehensively profile a broad set of natural and synthetic ligands at C3aR and C5aR1 and discover a previously unanticipated level of functional specialization in terms of species-specific pharmacology and receptor activation. Taking a lead from this, we determine seventeen cryo-EM structures of different ligand-receptor-G-protein complexes and uncover distinct orientation of agonists between the human and mouse receptors despite an overlapping positioning in the orthosteric binding pocket. Combined with extensive mutagenesis and functional assays, these structural snapshots allow us to decode and validate a convergent molecular mechanism involving a “Five-Point-Switch” in these receptors that orchestrates the recognition and efficacy of diverse agonists. We also identify species-specific differences at the level of phosphorylation patterns encoded in the carboxyl-terminus of these receptors and directly visualize their impact on βarr binding and activation using cryo-EM structures. Interestingly, we observe that βarrs engage with the mouse C5aR1 using a variation of previously discovered P-X-P-P phosphorylation motif via a “Sliding-Mechanism” and also exhibit distinct oligomeric state for the human vs. mouse receptors. Taken together, this study elucidates functional specialization at the complement anaphylatoxin receptors and underlying molecular mechanisms, offering a previously lacking framework with direct and immediate implications for the development of novel therapeutics.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>GPCRs</kwd><kwd>cellular signaling</kwd><kwd>biased agonism</kwd><kwd>complement cascade</kwd><kwd>anaphylatoxins</kwd><kwd>drug discovery</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The complement system is an integral part of the innate immune response mechanism that is critical for protecting the host against pathogenic infections including bacteria, viruses and fungi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. It involves the activation of a multi-step cascade resulting in the generation of a series of peptides in blood plasma with specialized functions coordinating to neutralize pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Complement proteins mediate and contribute towards the process of opsonization, formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), and recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection triggering inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The terminal products of complement cascade include complement anaphylatoxins, namely C3a, C4a, and C5a, which are produced by the proteolytic cleavage of C3, C4, and C5 complement proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Of these, C3a and C5a exert their cellular and physiological functions such as chemotaxis, degranulation and cytokine production via distinct complement anaphylatoxin receptors namely C3aR, C5aR1, and C5aR2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. These are integral membrane proteins that are classified as the members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, although C5aR2 lacks functional G-protein-coupling upon activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. These receptors are expressed at the surface of a variety of immune cells including mast cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, and their downstream signaling via heterotrimeric G-proteins and β-arrestins (βarrs) is crucial for the physiological responses exerted by the anaphylatoxins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. C3aR and C5aR1 continue to be important therapeutic targets for acute anaphylaxis, sepsis and lung injury, autoimmune disorders such as vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis, as well as chronic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and neurodegenerative disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Physiologically, C3a and C5a are rapidly proteolyzed by carboxypeptidases to remove the terminal arginine residue leading to the generation of C3a<sup>-d-Arg</sup> and C5a<sup>-d-Arg</sup>, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Such a mechanism is generally believed to help dampen the inflammatory response exerted by C3a and C5a, as C3a<sup>-d-Arg</sup>/C5a<sup>-d-Arg</sup> are typically believed to lose their ability to bind and activate their cognate receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. However, a few reports have suggested that a complete loss of receptor-binding and activation abilities of C3a<sup>-d-Arg</sup>/C5a<sup>-d-Arg</sup>, as originally conceived, may not be accurate and requires systematic exploration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. More recently, a naturally-occurring peptide derived from VGF, the large neuropeptide expressed in peripheral and central nervous system, known as TLQP21 has been identified as the second natural agonist of C3aR with a functional contribution in lipolysis, neurodegeneration, and metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. In particular, TLQP21-induced, β-adrenergic receptor-mediated lipolysis in adipocytes, and increased resting energy expenditure in mouse model, has uncovered untapped therapeutic potential of C3aR in metabolic conditions including obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Moreover, TLQP21-mediated activation of microglial BV2 cells promotes the clearance of extracellular amyloid-β fibrils. Additionally, the peptide modulates microglial function through C3aR signaling pathways, reducing neuropathology in mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. However, an incomplete understanding of species-specific functional responses encoded by the TLQP21-C3aR axis poses a key challenge in therapeutic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Although peptides derived and modified from the carboxyl-terminus of C3a and C5a are known to behave as partial agonists at these receptors with potential therapeutic opportunities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, a systematic study to decipher the intricate details of receptor subtype selectivity, species-specificity, and signaling-bias is still lacking. For example, EP67, a peptide derived from the carboxyl-terminus of human C5a, has shown promising indications not only as a vaccine adjuvant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> but also to overcome the burden of pathogenic infections, especially in the context of anti-microbial resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> and biofilm formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Still however, there are contradictory reports in the literature about its pharmacology and primary receptor that it engages to elicit the functional responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Finally, a handful of small molecule ligands have been described for C3aR, including the well-characterized C3aR antagonists SB290157 and JR14a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. However, emerging evidence from multiple studies has hinted at their agonistic properties and species-specific pharmacology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, which remains primarily unexplored at the molecular and structural levels, although JR14a-bound C3aR structures have been reported recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Taken together, C3aR and C5aR1 constitute a pair of closely related receptors with a rich tapestry of ligands and unparalleled opportunity to explore the molecular basis of diverse ligand recognition, species-specific pharmacology, and signaling-bias.</p><p id="P6">In this backdrop, here we present a comprehensive profiling of a diverse set of ligands at C3aR and C5aR1 to uncover previously unknown species-specific pharmacology of the natural and synthetic agonists as well as naturally-encoded signaling-bias. We discover that contrary to the generally believed notion, C5a<sup>-d-Arg</sup> maintains G-protein-coupling while displays an attenuated βarr recruitment, which is further reflected in differential responses in terms of cytokine release and neutrophil migration in primary cells and mouse model as presented in the accompanying manuscript. Using cryo-EM structures of distinct agonist-receptor-transducer combinations, we rationalize the agonistic efficacy of diverse ligands including those previously portrayed as antagonists and discover a key switch in the orthosteric binding pocket that is engaged to impart robust agonism. Finally, we also uncover distinct modalities of βarr oligomerization and phosphorylation motif engagement for the human vs. mouse receptors, which further expands the framework of species-specific pharmacology to species-specific transducer-coupling. This study provides the most comprehensive analysis of the complement anaphylatoxin receptor pharmacology and molecular mechanisms to date, with direct implications for novel drug discovery targeting these receptors.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Species-specific pharmacology and signaling-bias at C3aR and C5aR1</title><p id="P7">We first set out to comprehensively profile a broad set of ligands at C3aR and C5aR1 including the natural agonists C3a and C5a, C3a<sup>-d-Arg</sup> and C5a<sup>-d-Arg</sup>, and TLQP21, synthetic peptide agonist EP54 and EP67, and small molecule ligands SB290157 and JR14a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-D</xref>). We tested all possible combinations in terms of ligands of human and mouse origin on human and mouse C3aR and C5aR1 in transducer-coupling assays namely cAMP inhibition, G-protein dissociation and βarr1/2 recruitment using GloSensor and NanoBiT assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-T</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A-N, and S3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. We observed that human and mouse C3a exhibited a modest but significant difference in potency at the human C3aR, with human C3a being more potent, although both were full agonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A-B</xref>). On the other hand, both human and mouse C3a were equally potent and efficacious at the mouse C3aR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A-B</xref>). In contrast, human and mouse C5a displayed similar potency and efficacy at the human and mouse C5aR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G-H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Both C3a and C5a undergo proteolytic cleavage under physiological conditions resulting in the removal of terminal arginine and generation of C3a<sup>-d-Arg</sup> and C5a<sup>-d-Arg</sup>, respectively, and this is generally believed as a mechanism to dampen the inflammatory response to limit prolonged inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we observed near-complete loss of transducer-coupling for human C3a<sup>-d-Arg</sup> on the human and mouse C3aR, however, mouse C3a<sup>-d-Arg</sup> behaved as a weak partial agonist on the mouse C3aR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I-J</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed that both human and mouse C5a<sup>-d-Arg</sup> maintained equal potency and efficacy on C5aR1 in G-protein coupling and activation but displayed dramatically attenuated responses in βarr recruitment assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1K-L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1E-H</xref>). In fact, a previous study has suggested that C5a<sup>-d-Arg</sup> is nearly as potent and efficacious as C5a in activating the rat basophil leukemia (RBL) and human polymorphonuclear cells as assessed using an in-vitro label-free biosensor assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Moreover, the attenuated βarr recruitment by C5a<sup>-d-Arg</sup> is also reflected in compromised receptor endocytosis compared to C5a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1G-H</xref>), and a differential response in terms of neutrophil migration <italic>in-vitro</italic> and <italic>in-vivo</italic> as presented in the accompanying manuscript. Taken together, these data establish the C5a<sup>-d-Arg</sup> as a naturally-encoded, G-protein-biased agonist at C5aR1, in contrast to the prevalent perception in the literature that it loses the ability to bind and activate C5aR1.</p><p id="P9">In addition to C3a as the natural agonist, C3aR also recognizes another naturally-encoded peptide known as TLQP21, which is derived from VGF, a member of the extended granin family with primary expression in the central and peripheral nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. Interestingly, TLQP21 is reported to promote energy expenditure, and modulate inflammatory pain and gastric contractility in mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>, and also inhibit feeding in hamsters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>, and therefore, the TLQP21-C3aR axis has been gaining traction as a new therapeutic target in obesity and metabolic disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Previous studies have established the selectivity of TLQP21 for C3aR over C5aR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>, and our functional profiling data presented here revealed that both human and mouse TLQP21 are significantly more potent on the mouse C3aR compared to the human C3aR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1M-N</xref>). More interestingly, both human and mouse TLQP21 display a very low level of βarr recruitment on the human C3aR while they are nearly as effective as C3a on the mouse C3aR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1M-N</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1I-J</xref>). These findings underscore the species-specific pharmacology exhibited by TLQP21 and naturally-encoded signaling-bias at C3aR, making it an interesting system for structural analysis.</p><p id="P10">In addition to the natural-derived peptide agonists of C3aR and C5aR1, several synthetic peptides derived and modified based on the carboxyl-terminus of C3a and C5a have also been explored in terms of their agonism and signaling-bias and receptor selectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. Of these, EP54, a decapeptide designed based on the carboxyl-terminal sequence of human C5a, and EP67, an improved version of EP54, have also been characterized as an effective vaccine adjuvant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, to facilitate immune response during pathogenic infections such as drug-resistant strains of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. However, there are confounding reports in the literature at the level of specific complement anaphylatoxin receptor that it engages to elicit the functional responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. Therefore, we first profiled EP54 and EP67 on the human and mouse C3aR and C5aR1 in the transducer-coupling assays. We observed that EP67 was almost as potent and efficacious as C3a on the human C3aR in G-protein and βarr assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1O</xref>). On the other hand, it displayed a weaker potency but nearly full efficacy in G-protein assays at mouse C3aR while displayed a weak partial agonism in βarr recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1P</xref>).

This observation potentially underscores the importance of engaging the receptor N-terminus for imparting high-affinity and full agonism at C5aR1, while being relatively less crucial for C3aR. On the other hand, EP54 exhibited weaker potency but nearly-full efficacy at C3aR and C5aR1 in G-protein and βarr assays although it was slightly less efficacious at mouse C3aR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A-I</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Finally, a series of small molecule ligands portrayed as antagonists have been developed and characterized at C3aR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.

Therefore, we used mouse C3aR activated by human and mouse TLQP21 to investigate their agonism and compare them with the mC3a-mC3aR structure. The binding of TLQP21 primarily involves the orthosteric pocket of the receptor, occupying a buried surface area of ~1700Å<sup>2</sup>, and the N-terminal segment adopts a helical conformation similar to C3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Strikingly, human and mouse TLQP21 are also positioned on mC3aR in an orientation that shows a cross-angle of ~80° compared to human C3a on the human C3aR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Carboxyl-terminal residues adopt a hook-like structure, analogous to C3a, and occupy a similar position in the orthosteric binding pocket in line with a conserved mechanism of agonism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S17A, K</xref>). As predicted, the overall structural features of C3aR in complex with TLQP21 are similar to that of C3a-bound receptor representing a prototypical active conformation with outward movement of TM6 and 7, and the rearrangement of key structural motifs. Structure-guided mutagenesis of C3aR combined with transducer-coupling assays further validate the key contribution of the interacting residues as visualized in the structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S20A-D</xref>).</p><p id="P18">In order to confirm the preference of TLQP21 for the mouse C3aR over human C3aR in the native biological context, we measured the effect of TLQP21 stimulation on LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine release from primary human and mouse microglia.

Although we do not have the structure of TLQP21 in complex with human C3aR, it is plausible that the divergent positioning of TLQP21 on human vs. mouse C3aR, similar to that observed for C3a, drives this species-specific pharmacology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, this hypothesis remains to be tested experimentally in future studies, which may also help facilitate the design of new TLQP21 analogs with improved efficacy at the human receptor.</p><p id="P19">Finally, the analysis of SB290157-bound human C3aR and JR14a-bound human and mouse C3aR structures provides the molecular basis for small molecule agonism at C3aR. These ligands occupy a largely similar orthosteric binding pocket on the receptor, thereby engaging the critical interactions as identified earlier for other agonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). However, unlike peptide agonists, JR14a does not engage Arg<sup>5.42</sup> in either human or mouse C3aR, whereas SB290157 is able to interact with this residue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S18D-I</xref>). In addition, the overall structure features of C3aR in complex with these ligands are nearly identical to that of C3a-bound receptor representing a prototypical active conformation with outward movement of TM6 and 7, and the rearrangement of structural motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>).

As noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, SB290157 displayed striking selectivity for the human C3aR while JR14a is able to recognize both human and mouse receptors. Although the overall structures of SB290157- and JR14a-bound C3aR are very similar, the spatial positioning of the carboxylate group in SB290157 is marginally deeper in the orthosteric pocket compared to that of JR14a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S20H</xref>). Moreover, while the overall interaction network of JR14a with human and the mouse receptor is largely conserved within the orthosteric binding pocket, some notable differences are also observed. Specifically, His<sup>7.36</sup> engages in a π-π interaction with one of the 4-chlorotoluene rings in the JR14a-bound mouse C3aR structure, which is missing in the human counterpart (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S20I</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the lack of 4-chlorotoluene rings in SB290157 drives its preference for the human C3aR over mouse C3aR although further studies are required to probe this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Structural insights into subtype selectivity of EP67</title><p id="P20">As we have determined the structures of EP67 in complex with both human and mouse C3aR and C5aR1, it allows us to systematically explore the molecular details of receptor subtype selectivity and efficacy. As mentioned earlier, EP67 is a decapeptide derived and modified from the distal carboxyl-terminus of human C5a, however, there are confounding reports in the literature about its cross-reactivity and selectivity toward C3aR and C5aR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Our systematic analysis of cellular responses demonstrates that it is capable of activating both C3aR and C5aR1, with a clearly higher potency and efficacy for human C3aR compared to human C5aR1. On the other hand, its efficacy and potency appeared to be relatively weaker for mouse C3aR compared to human C3aR. The structural snapshots determined here reveal that the distal carboxyl terminus of EP67 adopts a hook-like conformation, occupying a similar orthosteric pocket of the receptors, and has a significantly conserved set of interactions as that of C3a and C5a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5J-L</xref>). Interestingly, the carboxyl-terminal segment of EP67 aligns well on human and mouse C3aR, however, its N-terminal segment diverges around a proline kink (P7) making an angle of ~65° between the two receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5J</xref>). This may explain the differences in the efficacy and potency of EP67 observed for the human vs. mouse C3aR although future studies are required to test this hypothesis.</p><p id="P21">On the other hand, comparison of EP67 on human and mouse C5aR1 does not reflect a significant divergence in their positioning on the orthosteric binding pocket (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S21A</xref>). A direct comparison of the network of interactions between EP67 and C3a/C5a in C3aR and C5aR1, respectively, underscores a relatively broader gap for C5aR1 compared to C3aR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5L</xref>). This is in line with the involvement of the C5aR1 N-terminus in the interaction with C5a that is not observed for C3a-C3aR structures. Therefore, it is likely that the missing interactions in the case of EP67 spanning the N-terminus, and also the ECL2, drive the weaker potency and efficacy of EP67 on C5aR1. As expected, the distal stretch of EP67 makes similar contacts in the orthosteric binding pocket as C3a, including critical interactions of the terminal arginine with Arg<sup>5.42</sup>, Tyr<sup>6.51</sup>, Asp<sup>7.35</sup> through hydrogen bond, cation-π interaction, and ionic interaction, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S18A and S21B-C</xref>). Finally, there is a notable difference between EP67-bound C3aR vs. C5aR1 at the level of positioning of the cytoplasmic end of TM7 and Helix8, wherein the TM7 is relatively more outward shifted in C5aR1 and Helix8 is oriented at an angle of 70° compared to C3aR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5M</xref>). In contrast, superimposition of C3a-C3aR and C5a-C5aR1 does not reflect an analogous structural difference between the two receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5M</xref>).

Recent studies have identified a P-X-P-P type phosphorylation motif in GPCRs, where P represents a pSer/pThr, as a broadly conserved mechanism for engaging βarrs leading to their inter-domain rotation and activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>.

This observation broadens the previously identified repertoire of P-X-P-P signature in GPCRs that plays a decisive role in βarr interaction and activation. Interestingly, a closer analysis of the mC5aR1pp positioning on βarrs reveals that the proline residue present in the first P-X-P-P motif as “X” results in a bending of the phosphorylated peptide, thereby rendering it out-of-place to slide into the binding groove on βarrs, and instead, propels the P-X-P-P variant, which is a part of the extended second P-X-P-P motif, to occupy the binding interface.</p><p id="P24">Another key difference observed between mC5aR1pp-βarr2 vs. hC5aR1pp-βarr2 is at the level of their oligomeric state in the corresponding structures.

Given recent preclinical studies demonstrating promising outcomes for EP67 therapy in community-acquired methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (CA-MRSA) mouse models, our study now provides a template to further optimize the efficacy and selectivity of this ligand with potential for an improved therapeutic window<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Our study also unequivocally establishes the agonistic nature of SB290157 and JR14a, which were originally and still widely reported as antagonists, and demonstrates a structural explanation for their ability to activate the receptor.</p><p id="P27">A key finding in our study is the discovery that C5a<sup>-d-Arg</sup> acts as a G-protein-biased agonist at C5aR1 unlike C3a<sup>-d-Arg</sup>, which nearly completely loses the ability to activate C3aR. This is particularly important to redefine the paradigm of a naturally-encoded mechanism to dampen the inflammatory response drive by C5a to avoid bystander inflammation. For example, a likely scenario is that the C5a<sup>-d-Arg</sup>-induced G-protein response continues to recruit neutrophils and macrophages to help clear pathogenic infections, while the reduction of inflammatory cytokines avoids excessive inflammation. At the molecular level, our study also provides further support that the N-terminus of C5aR1 but not C3aR is critical for anaphylatoxin interaction, and this helps rationalize pharmacology data regarding the relatively better potency and efficacy of peptide agonists at C3aR. Along the same line, it also underscores the challenges associated with small molecule agonists of C5aR1 while the same for C3aR has been rather more straightforward to design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">Finally, the observation on distinct oligomeric state of βarr2 for the human vs. mouse C5aR1, and the engagement via an alternative P-X-P-P motif, further underscores previously unappreciated fine-tuning in the receptor-transducer system. In particular, the preferential engagement of βarrs to a specific phosphorylation motif depending on the adjacent sequence context, even when more than one options may be available, could be an added mechanism to encode conformational and functional diversity. Still, the conserved nature of engagement of the alternate P-X-P-P motif in mC5aR1pp with the K-R-K lock in βarrs reiterates that a certain level of intermolecular interactions must be satisfied for stable βarr binding and activation. As mentioned earlier, the proline residue present at position “X” in the first P-X-P-P of mC5aR1pp renders it ineffective to engage with the K-R-K lock due to a bending of the phosphopeptide, and hence, the adjacent P-X-P-P slides in place. Interestingly, several other human GPCRs also harbor a similar scenario with either a single or multiple P-X-P-P motif with a proline residue at the “X” position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7G</xref>), and therefore, it is possible that they also recapitulate a similar mechanism to engage βarrs as observed here for the mC5aR1pp. Based on these observations, we propose a “Sliding Mechanism” to guide βarrs on GPCRs wherein βarrs scan the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminus (or ICL3), and they stall once a P-X-P-P signature (or, a variant thereof) is encountered to effectively engage the K-R-K lock, leading to βarr activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7H</xref>). However, further studies are essential to probe this hypothesis at molecular level and decipher the intricate details.</p><p id="P29">In summary, we elucidate multiple layers of previously unappreciated functional specialization encoded in the complement anaphylatoxin receptor system using an integrative experimental approach, and we anticipate that these molecular insights will help overcome the existing hurdles to guide novel therapeutic design targeting these receptors.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>General reagents and chemicals</title><p id="P30">Most of the general reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise specified.
