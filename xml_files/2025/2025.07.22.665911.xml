(iMACs) undergo metabolic reprogramming that exacerbates β-cell dysfunction. Stress-induced cleavage of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) generates tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs), whose role in this context is not fully understood. We identify elevated levels of 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> and 5’tRF<sup>Gly(GCC)</sup> in β-cells and iMACs from db/db mice and in islets from type 2 diabetic patients. Notably, 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> is also induced under prediabetic conditions and inversely correlates with insulin secretion. Lipotoxic stress triggers their production via Angiogenin-mediated cleavage. Blocking 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> in islets protects against β-cell apoptosis and restores insulin secretion under palmitate stress. Using a β-cell/macrophage co-culture system, we show that β-cell contact shapes a unique macrophage phenotype (iMAC-like) that shifts upon palmitate exposure—recapitulating in vivo observations. Inhibiting 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> in iMAC-like cells prevents this activation switch, reduces β-cell stress, and improves insulin secretion. Mechanistically, 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> interacts with RNA-binding proteins to regulate transcriptional and post-transcriptional pathways linked to immune activation, extracellular matrex remodeling, neurogenesis, and oxidative stress. Our study identifies 5’tRFs as key mediators of islet microenvironment remodeling in diabetes, offering new insights into intercellular stress signaling in metabolic disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Obesity, characterized by excessive caloric intake and increased adiposity, represents a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D) development. Pancreatic β-cells play a pivotal role in maintaining glucose homeostasis by secreting insulin in response to rising blood glucose levels. However, inappropriate nutritional conditions trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress, which collectively drive β-cell dysfunction and, eventually, apoptosis. Simultaneously, the energy imbalance established during obesity activates innate immune responses as an adaptive mechanism to cope with the increased nutrient load. Indeed, expansion of islet macrophages (Mφs) was observed in T2D patients and in rodent models of obesity and T2D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Under physiological conditions, islet resident Mφs (iMACs) exhibit a unique transcriptional profile characterized by the expression of pro-inflammatory markers, such as IL-1β, that sustain proper β-cell function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. However, high fat diet (HFD) induces iMAC expansion accompanied by profound transcriptional remodeling: while certain genes associated with the pro-inflammatory profile are upregulated, others are notably downregulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In addition to these changes, β-cell death was recently reported to activate a reparative and anti-inflammatory state in Mφs, marked by the secretion of Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF1), which enhances β-cell function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. These findings underscore the dynamic and multifaceted role of Mφs in islet health and T2D pathogenesis.</p><p id="P3">Despite significant progress in understanding islet physiopathology, the molecular mechanisms that regulate β-cell stress responses and the metabolic reprogramming of islet-resident macrophages (iMACs) during obesity remain poorly defined. In particular, the signals mediating the crosstalk between β-cells and iMACs are still largely unknown.</p><p id="P4">Recent genome-wide association studies and high-throughput sequencing approaches have pointed to a potentially crucial role of transfer RNA (tRNA) dynamics in maintaining pancreatic β-cell homeostasis. Traditionally known for their role in protein synthesis, tRNAs are now recognized as being tightly regulated by both nutritional and environmental cues. Post-transcriptional modifications and enzymatic cleavage of tRNAs have been linked to cellular stress responses and the development of various diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">tRNA cleavage gives rise to tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs), a novel class of small non-coding RNAs that can influence numerous cellular functions, including gene expression, mRNA translation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Notably, loss-of-function mutations in the tRNA-modifying enzyme TRMT10A have been associated with a syndrome marked by microcephaly and early-onset diabetes. Impaired TRMT10A function leads to altered tRF biogenesis, contributing to β-cell oxidative stress and apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Moreover, we have previously shown that tRFs are dynamically regulated during β-cell maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and in the pancreatic islets of rodent models predisposed to diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Despite these insights, the functional role and mechanisms of action of tRFs in β-cells remain unclear. In addition, their regulation and function in iMACs and in the intercellular communication between iMACs and β-cells during obesity has not been investigated so far.</p><p id="P8">This study provides evidence that obesity and diabetes induce a specific modulation of tRFs in both β-cells and iMACs. Indeed, 5’tRFs derived from tRNA<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> and tRNA<sup>Gly(GCC)</sup> were found to be induced in both cell types, an effect recapitulated <italic>in vitro</italic> by exposure to saturated fatty acids. Blockade of 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> in islet cells or specifically in macrophages had protective effects against lipotoxicity. The analysis of the 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> interactome revealed an association with RNA-binding proteins involved in mRNA processing, splicing and translation. In agreement with this finding, blockade of this tRNA fragment induced transcriptional and translational changes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Obesity and type 2 diabetes induce changes in 5’tRFs in β-cells and iMACs</title><p id="P9">To investigate whether tRNA cleavage and consequently the pool of tRFs is affected by obesity and diabetes, we isolated the pancreatic islets of 8-week-old overweight and hyperglycemic db/db mice and of age-matched lean and normoglycemic wild type controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1.a-b</xref>). Db/db mice display hyperphagia due to a mutation in the leptin receptor gene, and develop obesity and diabetes. It was previously shown that at 8 weeks of age, in the initial phases of the disease, islet macrophages (iMAC) of db/db mice expand and undergo transcriptional remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Since both iMACs and β-cells are highly sensitive to nutritional stress and to the diabetogenic microenvironment, we purified the two cell populations by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1.c</xref>). Although the effect was not statistically significant, the number of isolated iMACs tended to increase in db/db mouse islets compared to those of wild type mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1.d</xref>). Characterization of the tRF profile of FACS sorted cells led to the identification of 152 tRFs displaying significant changes in β-cells and 21 in iMACs of db/db mice compared to wild type controls (FC&gt;2, FDR p&lt;0.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b and d</xref>). After removal of redundant sequences with differences of 1-2 nucleotides at the cleavage site, we identified a group of tRFs derived from 17 cytosolic tRNA isoacceptors in β-cells and 11 in iMACs being modulated in db/db mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1.c and e</xref>). Three tRFs derived from the 5’end of tRNA<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup>, tRNA<sup>Gly(GCC)</sup> and tRNA<sup>Asp(CTC)</sup> were induced in both cell types. The upregulation of 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> and 5’tRF<sup>Gly(GCC)</sup> was validated by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1.f1-4</xref>), while qPCR for 5’tRF<sup>Asp(CTC)</sup> was not conclusive due to the presence of multiple melting curves. Interestingly, we previously demonstrated that 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> is repressed during islet cell maturation and may regulate newborn β-cell function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">To analyze the modulation of tRFs in the islets of human living donors, we collected RNA from islets isolated by laser capture microdissection (LCM) from n=12 normal glucose tolerant (NGT), n=13 impaired glucose tolerant (IGT) and n=11 T2D diagnosed patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1.g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Small RNA sequencing and tRF profiling identified 8 tRFs significantly changed in the IGT group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1.h</xref>) and 13 tRFs modulated in the T2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1.i</xref>) compared to the NGT controls (FC&gt;1.5, p&lt;0.05). We found that the 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> was significantly upregulated in both IGT and T2D groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1.h-i</xref>), while 5tRF<sup>Gly(GCC)</sup> was increased only in T2D islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1.i</xref>). Notably, these tRFs present 100% of sequence homology between mouse and human. Our findings suggest that tRF modulation in islet cells occurs during T2D development and is conserved between species.</p><p id="P11">Association studies revealed that islet 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> levels were negatively associated to basal and total insulin secretion rates and glucose sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1.j-k</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Notably, this association was mainly driven by the IGT group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1.e</xref>). In contrast, no correlations were found with basal or mean glucose levels during the OGTT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). These findings suggest that islet 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> levels may directly impair in vivo insulin secretory capacity and reflect early decline of β-cell function, independently of both glucose control and glucose tolerance status.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> and tRF<sup>Gly(GCC)</sup> are induced by exposure to saturated free fatty acids</title><p id="P12">We next investigated whether <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure to fatty acids—mimicking the lipotoxic stress associated with obesity-linked diabetes— recapitulates the induction of the tRFs observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. The unsaturated fatty acid oleate did not modulate the tRF levels in MIN6 β-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2.a</xref>). We observed a significant increase of 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> induced by the saturated free fatty acids stearate and palmitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2.a</xref>). Interestingly, palmitate elicited a greater rise of 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> and induced also the 5’tRF<sup>Gly(GCC)</sup> levels compared to the less lipotoxic stearate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2.a</xref>). This effect appeared to be time dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2.a</xref>). Palmitate-dependent tRF induction was confirmed in primary islets derived from wild type mice and from human cadaveric donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2.b-c</xref>). qPCR analysis of FACS-sorted β-cells and iMACs confirmed the induction of the tRFs in both cell types upon 48h treatment with palmitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2.d-e</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In mouse and human islet cells, 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> fragments are 29-30nt long (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>) and are generated by a cleavage adjacent or in the anticodon loop, consistent with a classification as tRNA halves. Angiogenin was previously identified as the major enzyme responsible of tRNA cleavage at the level of the anticodon loop and of the biogenesis of tRF-halves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. 5’tRF<sup>Gly(GCC)</sup> fragments identified in our datasets are 26-30nt long (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). The biogenesis of these 5’tRFs have been also associated with Angiogenin expression, although other RNAses may participate to the trimming of the cleavage site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. We have previously showed that silencing of Angiogenin gene (<italic>ANG</italic>) in islets from newborn rats decreases the levels of 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)12</sup>. To assess whether this enzyme is responsible for the generation of 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> and 5’tRF<sup>Gly(GCC)</sup> under obesity and diabetes conditions, we first measured the expression of Angiogenin in our experimental models.</p><p id="P14">We observed that <italic>ANG</italic> mRNA is increased in β-cells of db/db mice compared to wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2.f</xref>) and is induced in MIN6 and dispersed mouse islet cells upon palmitate exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2.b and 2.g</xref>). To further confirm the role of Angiogenin in 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> and 5’tRF<sup>Gly(GCC)</sup> biogenesis, we decreased the level of the enzyme using a siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2.h</xref>). We found that transient knockdown of Angiogenin attenuates the induction of 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> but not of 5’tRF<sup>Gly(GCC)</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2.i-j</xref>). These findings validate our previous observations in newborn β-cells and suggest that additional enzymes may be involved in palmitate-dependent tRNA cleavage.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Blockade of 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> attenuates lipotoxic damage in β-cells</title><p id="P15">Next, we investigated the impact of a global reduction of 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> in islet cells on β-cell homeostasis. For this purpose, we used an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-based approach to target and inhibit 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> (<italic>α-</italic>Glu) under basal and palmitate conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3.a</xref>). Transfection of <italic>α-</italic>Glu ASO resulted in &gt;90% reduction of 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> in mouse islet cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3.b</xref>) and 70-90% reduction in MIN6-β-cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S.2c</xref>). Notably, <italic>α-</italic>Glu ASO did not affect full length tRNA<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> levels or its aminoacylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2.d-e</xref>). We observed that the inhibition of 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> in mouse islet cells prevents palmitate-induced β-cell apoptosis measured by Caspase 3 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3.c-d</xref>). Next, we assessed the consequence of 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> blockade on insulin secretion in MIN6-β-cells. Upon palmitate treatment, insulin release in response to glucose, expressedas the percentage of the insulin content, was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3.e</xref>). This effect was ameliorated by the inhibition of 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup>. As expected, prolonged palmitate treatment led also to an important decrease in insulin content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3.f</xref>). Consequently the amount of insulin released was strongly diminished when normalized for total protein content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3.g</xref>). This effect was not prevented by <italic>α-</italic>Glu transfection.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Blockade of 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> in macrophages ameliorates β-cell homeostasis upon palmitate exposure</title><p id="P16">In addition to endogenous processes disrupting β-cell homeostasis, the proliferation and activation of iMACs is expected to play a critical role in the development of diabetes under obesity conditions. We asked whether the modulation of 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> specifically in macrophages contributes to these pathogenic mechanisms. To this end, we aimed to target and inhibit 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> in iMACs and assess the resulting effects on both Mφ phenotype and β-cell homeostasis. However, manipulating primary iMACs poses significant challenges, as these cells, once isolated by FACS, rapidly lose their phenotype and are not viable when cultured alone. To overcome these limitations and since the activation state of iMACs is mainly determined by the crosstalk with surrounding endocrine cells, we established an <italic>in vitro</italic> model to explore these interactions under controlled conditions. To this end, bone marrow- derived cells from wild type mice were differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> into naïve (M0) Mφs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3.a</xref>). M0 Mφs were further differentiated by culturing them in direct contact with MIN6 β-cells to induce an iMAC-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). After 3 days of co-culture, the cells were separated by FACS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3.b</xref>). The iMAC-like phenotype was evaluated by the expression of gene markers for Mφ polarization. Compared to M0 Mφs, iMAC-like cells showed an upregulation of the pro-inflammatory marker <italic>IL-1β</italic> and, at the same time, an induction of the anti-inflammatory markers <italic>Mrc1</italic> and <italic>Ym1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4.b</xref>). This mixed phenotype with high <italic>IL-1β</italic> expression recapitulates previous observations on the activation state of iMACs <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. We next evaluated the impact of PA treatment and of the modulation of 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> on iMAC-like cells. To this purpose, M0 Mφs were transfected with either Ctr or αGlu ASO prior co-culture and then treated with BSA or PA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4.c</xref>). In FACS-sorted iMAC-like cells trasfected with Ctr oligonucleotide PA raised 5’tRF<sup>Glu(CTC)</sup> levels, while αGlu transfection led to a decrease of the tRF in both BSA and PA conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4.d</xref>).
