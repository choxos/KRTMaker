One of the major challenges to understanding the role of condensates is the lack of technologies to map condensate-scale protein architecture at subcompartmental or nanoscale resolution. To address this, we introduce HCR-Proxy, a proximity labelling technique that couples Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR)-based signal amplification with <italic>in situ</italic> proximity biotinylation (Proxy), enabling proteomic profiling of RNA-proximal proteomes at subcompartmental resolution. We benchmarked HCR-Proxy using nascent pre-rRNA targets to investigate the distinct proteomic signatures of the nucleolar subcompartments and to uncover a spatial logic of protein partitioning shaped by RNA sequence. Our results demonstrate HCR-Proxy's ability to provide spatially-resolved maps of RNA interactomes within the nucleolus, offering new insights into the molecular organisation and compartmentalisation of condensates. This subcompartment-specific nucleolar proteome profiling enabled integration with deep learning frameworks, which effectively confirmed a sequence-encoded basis for protein partitioning across nested condensate subcompartments, characterised by antagonistic gradients in charge, length, and RNA-binding domains. HCR-Proxy thus provides a scalable platform for spatially resolved RNA interactome discovery, bridging transcript localisation with proteomic context in native cellular environments.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2"><fig id="F5" position="anchor"><label>Graphical abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS206145-f005"/></fig>

RNA molecules often serve as a nucleation seed, providing an architectural blueprint for the recruitment of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and ultimately condensate’s formation. Many condensates are heterogeneous entities, displaying various degrees of internal subcompartmentalization. Nucleoli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, Cajal bodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, paraspeckles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and nuclear speckles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> are amongst the best known examples of macro-assemblies with information workflow organized in nested-like structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Therefore, characterising molecular assemblies on subcompartment-wide scale is of vital importance for understanding the flux of biomolecules governed by the spatial organisation and most importantly its contribution to the cell's homeostasis.</p><p id="P4">High-resolution microscopy using immunofluorescence is widely employed to study condensate composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, while RNA-protein interaction mapping has relied on affinity-based approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, and newer RNA-targeted degradation methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Although these techniques identify direct interactors, they lack spatial context information crucial for compartment-level analysis. Proximity labelling (PL) overcomes this caveat by utilising an engineered biotinylating enzymes (e.g., APEX2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, HRP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, TurboID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>), colocalising with the molecule of interest. Upon addition of a biotin substrate enzymes catalyse short-lived reactive species which are covalently deposited on biomolecules located in enzymes’ close proximity. Subsequently, biotinylated molecules are enriched by streptavidin pulldown and identified by mass spectrometry or nucleic acid sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Despite a broad repertoire of <italic>in vivo</italic> PL methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, such approaches require genetic manipulations of the cells and exhibit low signal-to-noise ratio and experimental reproducibility. To overcome these limitations, <italic>in situ</italic> PL approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> have been developed that use labelled antisense oligos to biotinylate targeted RNA neighbourhoods without genetic editing. Despite bypassing the need for genetic manipulations, challenges remain in labelling specificity, spatial resolution and inefficient biotinylation, thereby preventing the characterisation of proximal interactome at subcompartmental scale. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop a biotinylation method with enhanced labelling and spatial resolution capacity to map spatially-confined RNA interactomes at the subcompartmental resolution.</p><p id="P5">To address this need, we have developed HCR-Proxy, an improved proximity labelling approach to identify site-specific RNA proteomes with subcompartment spatial resolution. HCR-Proxy is a hybrid method composed of a signal amplification (HCR) and an <italic>in situ</italic> biotinylation step (Proxy). Unlike current <italic>in situ</italic> PL methods, where biotinylation efficiency depends on the number of labelled probes recognised by the PL enzymes, HCR-Proxy uses metastable hairpins to amplify the biotinylation signal. This results in probe-independent RNA labelling that is suitable for studying proximal proteomes of challenging RNA molecules with limited sequence space for antisense probe design. To improve the resolution of the labelling, we concomitantly applied automated STED microscopy and profilled various molecular crowding conditions to technically refine the method. We benchmarked HCR-Proxy against different nuclear RNA targets of different abundances and demonstrated its flexibility and superior biotinylation efficiency. As a proof of concept, we applied HCR-Proxy to target specific nucleolar biogenesis-driven rRNA transcripts, demonstrating the method's ability to specifically enrich distinct RNA-proximal proteomes within a nested condensate. Furthermore, the integration of deep learning models showed that basic protein features such as sequence length, composition and net charge can classify proteins located in different RNA-scaffolded neighbourhoods. Overall, this demonstrates that HCR-Proxy is a powerful tool with unprecedented spatial resolution for deciphering higher-order interactomes within spatially restricted RNA compartments. Thereby HCR-Proxy expands the toolbox for spatial proteomics by unifying RNA programmability with enzymatic labelling and biophysical modulation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>HCR-Proxy: Modular approach for targeted <italic>in situ</italic> proximity labelling through amplified RNA recognition</title><p id="P6">Several RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation techniques have been developed for visualisation of subcellular localization of individual RNA transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Among them, the <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation chain reaction, or HCR, offers an unparalleled specificity, sensitivity and high signal-to-noise ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Unlike traditional <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation approaches, where signal intensity depends on the number of directly labelled probes hybridised to the target, HCR approach requires programmable oligonucleotide probes to hybridise in pairs to adjacent regions of the selected RNA. Specifically, bound probe pairs trigger the signal amplification by the self-assembling chain reaction of fluorophore-labelled hairpins. To date, this method has been applied for fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (FISH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Building on the strengths of HCR-FISH, we sought to extend the advantages of HCR signal amplification for a proximity labelling approach to precisely identify biomolecules interacting with or in close proximity to a specific RNA target. Therefore, we developed HCR-Proxy, a hybrid <italic>in situ</italic> proximity labelling workflow composed of signal amplification (<bold>HCR</bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> and biotinylation step (<bold>Proxy</bold>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P8">First, we developed metastable digoxigenin-labelled hairpins (DIG hairpins) that specifically bind only the fully assembled initiator sequence to trigger the growth of a tethered digoxigenin amplification polymer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). All non-specifically bound probes and hairpins stay kinetically trapped and therefore do not trigger amplification. The amplified number of DIG molecules at the target RNA serves as a binding pad for a recombinant PL enzyme, triggering proximity-labelling of adjacent biomolecules <italic>in situ</italic> while the unbound enzyme is washed off. To preserve biomolecular interactions we chemically fix cells with cell permeable and reversible cross-linker DSP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, an amine-group specific alternative to paraformaldehyde, which can distort interactions and thus change the condensate’s composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Upon permeabilisation, cells are transferred into tubes, where subsequent HCR-Proxy steps (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>) are streamlined, making the protocol more user-friendly and cost-efficient. Finally, biotinylated proteins are enriched by magnetic streptavidin beads under denaturing conditions followed by identification with mass spectrometry (HCR-Proxy MS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To validate the HCR-Proxy methodology we targeted <italic>Malat1</italic> (Table S1), a hallmark non-coding RNA of nuclear speckles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). As expected, the HCR-FISH signal colocalised with the well-known nuclear speckle marker, SC35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. To assess the method's biotinylation efficiency, we further performed proximity labelling and stained for fluorescently-labelled target RNA and surrounding biotinylated biomolecules. Pearson correlation analysis revealed strong spatial colocalisation with a high degree of signal overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). To evaluate specificity of the method, we also conducted control experiments by omitting either the hairpin amplifiers or probe pairs. Both conditions resulted in the absence of FISH and streptavidin signals, demonstrating the requirement for complementarity effect between probes and amplifiers to achieve biotinylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This demonstrates that HCR-Proxy can accurately proximity label RNA in its native cellular environment.</p><p id="P10">To evaluate the enhanced biotinylation efficiency achieved by signal amplification, we designed two sets of probes targeting the intronic region of <italic>Efl1</italic> mRNA (Table S1), localised to two nuclear puncta. First, we aimed to identify the PL enzyme that would provide the strongest and most specific biotinylation on lowly abundant RNA sites. To achieve this, we purified recombinant enzymes APEX2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and TurboID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, fused to an optimised binder selective for digoxigenin (DIG binding domain)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). We observed an approximately 5.5-fold higher biotinylation efficiency with APEX2-DIG, yielding high biotinylation signal-to-noise ratio while maintaining specific colocalisation with the target RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). These results demonstrate that HCR-Proxy methodology can be used in conjunction with a versatile range PL enzyme and indicates that HCR-Proxy efficiently biotinylates even proximity of lowly-abundant nascent RNAs using only two sets of probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Enhancing spatial specificity through biophysical tuning of labelling conditions</title><p id="P11">Next, we implemented automated content-aware STED super-resolution microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> to measure the biotinylation diameter <italic>in situ</italic> and to screen for conditions to improve sensitivity and resolution of proximity labelling reaction. Fully automated STED image acquisition platform with data-adaptive imaging, similar to implementation reported in this preprint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref> for details), provided an efficient capture of high-resolution biotinylation signal distributions, minimizing operator-induced variability and enhancing data reliability and reproducibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Super resolution imaging revealed that biotinylation staining extended beyond the boundaries of <italic>Efl1</italic> RNA localisation, spreading within a micrometre range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), consistent with previous reports of other PL approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, rather than intensity peak overlapping with the RNA FISH signal, we detected a reduced biotinylation signal in the condensate core compared to its periphery, resulting in a "halo labelling effect" and reduced labelling specificity of cellular microenvironments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To overcome the challenge of nonspecific biotinylation, we next aimed to spatially constrain biotin radicals by utilising inert crowding agents that either increase the buffer viscosity (PEG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, various sugars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>) or alternatively elevate the local protein concentration (BSA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>). To assess whether these crowding agents reduce the diffusion of activated biotin radicals, we performed fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), which measures molecular diffusion dynamics based on intensity fluctuations as molecules diffuse through a defined volume of light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Fixed and permeabilised cells as per HCR-Proxy protocol were stained with DAPI and different solutions of crowding agents were applied. PBS served as a reference labelling solution. To approximate biotin radicals behaviour, we used Alexa647 fluorophore and recorded the mobility of molecules within nuclei, cytoplasm and extracellular compartment. Fitting autocorrelation functions with a 3D diffusion model, we obtained the diffusion times (i.e. average time for molecules to diffuse through the focal volume) for each condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), which revealed a significant effect of crowding agents on diffusion time in all three compartments. As expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, diffusion was slower within nuclei compared to other two compartments, regardless of labelling solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). These findings show that molecular crowding plays a crucial role in modulating diffusion dynamics and as such biotinylation signal. The strongest effect was observed with a combination of BSA and trehalose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), leading to a significant decrease in diffusion rate. These results demonstrate that controlled modulation of diffusion dynamics can be achieved through tailored crowding conditions, providing a useful strategy for enhancing labelling specificity in PL experiments.</p><p id="P13">To further validate our findings, we performed an HCR-Proxy experiment using the same combination of labelling solutions. Using our automated STED screening platform, we assessed the effect of molecular crowding agents on biotinylation specificity by comparing the radius of RNA FISH and biotinylation signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). The most efficient biotin radical’s confinement was observed with a synergistic combination of BSA and trehalose at their lower concentrations. In addition to reducing labelling radius, crowding agents also abolished the “halo labelling effect”. We propose that the decrease in radical mobility not only spatially constrained radicals to the site of their production but also prevented the inactivation of PL enzyme.</p><p id="P14">Next, we investigated whether crowding agents could compensate for extension of labelling time without compromising specificity, thereby increasing biotinylation sensitivity and consequently higher downstream yield. To determine optimal labelling time, we performed HCR-Proxy FISH experiment at 5 different time points and measured the biotinylation radius surrounding the targeted RNA. We were able to extend the standard 1 min labelling time of HCR-Proxy PL to 3 or 5 minutes without any noticeable spread in biotinylation radius. However, exceeding the labelling time to 15 or 30 minutes led to a significant increase in biotinylation radius and reappearance of the “halo labelling effect” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). These results indicate that fine-tuning the biotinylation efficiency by a combination of crowding agents and labelling time extension enhances the biotinylation yield without compromising specificity, thereby limiting the <italic>in situ</italic> proximity labelling reaction to individual microenvironments of biomolecular condensates.</p><p id="P15">Upon technically refining labelling and crowding conditions, we next aimed to benchmark HCR-Proxy to characterise the proximal proteomes of individual RNA microenvironments. For this we performed HCR-Proxy LC-MS (liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry) in mESCs with probes targeting precursor ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) and ncRNAs <italic>Malat1</italic>, <italic>Norad</italic>, along with intronic <italic>Efl1</italic> sequence (Table S1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). This allowed us to quantify levels of 1130 proteins with varying abundances across different HCR-Proxy targets. Consistent with the distinct cellular localisation of the targets, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection Analysis for dimensionality reduction (UMAP) showed a clear separation of samples between nuclear and nucleolar targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>). We considered proteins as <italic>bona fide</italic> nucleolar proteins if they were significantly enriched over remaining nuclear targets (Student's t test-based log2 fold-change &gt; 1, FDR-adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>), thereby obtaining 602 nucleolar proteins, including numerous well-established pre-rRNA interactors (Tables S2, S3).

In agreement with the nucleolar localisation of all three pre-rRNA targets, HCR-Proxy MS identified distinct subnucleolar proximal proteomes (Table S4). When comparing the HCR-Proxy interactomes for nascent pre-rRNA regions upstream (UP) and downstream of A’ processing site (DOWN), we detected prominent components for rRNA transcription and established FC markers enriched in the UP region. The later enrichment includes numerous transcription factors responsible for forming Pol I pre-initiation complex like UBTF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, TAF15, TAF9, TAF7 and TAF5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, alongside with POLR1C component of the RNA Pol I complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and RPA1 protein that is involved in rRNA transcription regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>.

Both interactors exhibited strong colocalisation with RNA FISH signal, with distinct high-intensity peaks overlapping the UP bait region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>).

To achieve optimal performance and interpretability, we benchmarked three deep learning frameworks under stratified three-fold cross-validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) in classifying the A′-upstream or A′-downstream region-specific interactome. The first model we implemented is a convolutional neural network (Sequence-CNN) trained directly on full-length amino acid sequences, designed to recognize local patterns and sequence motifs predictive of the target classification. The second model (ESM2-MLP) leverages embeddings derived from the transformer-based protein language model ESM-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, aiming to capture global context and higher-order interactions among amino acids across the entire sequence. Finally, the third model (Feature-LogReg) relies on 320 diverse manually curated features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), with sequence-derived properties calculated using localCIDER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> and NARDINI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, and annotated characteristics obtained from UniProt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. A greedy-forward-selection distilled this large feature set to identify the 14 most predictive descriptors of compartment identity, used in the final model.</p><p id="P20">Surprisingly, the Feature-LogReg classifier attained an average AUROC of 0.86, outperforming the protein language model based ESM2-MLP classifier (AUROC = 0.79) and the Sequence-CNN (AUROC = 0.82) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Coefficient analysis revealed that HCR-Proxy-enriched proteins in the A′-upstream interactome (associated with FC) are characterised by greater protein length and elevated acidic residue count. In contrast, HCR-Proxy-enriched proteins in the A′-downstream interactome (associated with DFC) exhibit a higher fraction of basic residues and a pronounced enrichment of RNA-recognition motifs, consistent with the presumed role of DFC proteins in mediating pre-rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Machine-learning–driven feature selection revealed an antagonistic pattern of net charge, RNA-binding modules, and protein length between the FC and DFC proteomes. To validate these predictions, we first calculated isoelectric points (pI) for all HCR-Proxy targets along with all remaining GO-annotated nuclear proteins. Consistent with the feature model’s identification of increased acidity, the FC cohort exhibited a significantly lower median pI than both the DFC and GC groups, and versus the nuclear reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Per-residue analysis confirmed that Asp (D) frequencies were markedly elevated in FC proteins, whereas Lys (K) dominated the DFC and GC proteomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3B</xref>). These sequence-derived features of HCR-Proxy interactomes are strongly supported by experimental dissection of protein sequences of canonical nucleolar proteins harbouring D/E tracts and K-blocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. For instance, the prominence of blocky acidic residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B, C</xref>) among FC-enriched proteins echoes their identification of acidic D/E tracts as a determinant of FC localisation and lower local pH. Similarly, the authors identified the characteristic K-blocks regions within DFC scaffolds, which we validated to be enriched (Welch's t-test, p &lt; 0.001) in HCR-Proxy A’ downstream interactome (associated with DFC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Next, we analysed the protein domains characteristics for nucleolar subcompartments. Annotation of RNA-recognition motifs showed a marked increase in RRM domain content from FC to DFC and GC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D</xref>), which aligns with the presumed role of DFC/GC proteins in mediating pre-rRNA processing and RNA binding domains being excluded from FC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Finally, we compared protein lengths and found that DFC and GC proteins were on average roughly half as long as FC or other nuclear proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>), indicating that DFC proteins tend to be shorter, basic, with higher RNA-binding capacity and rich in lysine-rich blocks important for RNA interaction and processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">In conclusion, only the rich, compartment-specific proteomic data enabled by HCR-Proxy allowed us to deconvolve the molecular code underlying nucleolar organisation.

While considerable progress has been made in cataloguing the global composition of various condensates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, the spatial architecture of condensate patterning or proteomic mapping within nested condensates - such as the nucleolus - have been constrained by limitations in both resolution and sensitivity of RNA-centric proteomics approaches.</p><p id="P25">To address this challenge, we developed HCR-Proxy, a proximity labelling method that leverages hybridisation chain reaction (HCR) for both signal amplification and spatial confinement of biotinylation, thereby enabling nanoscale characterisation of RNA-proximal proteomes <italic>in situ</italic>. By designing DIG-labelled HCR hairpins as localised docking platforms for recombinant DIG-binding enzymes, HCR-Proxy introduces a modular and plug-and-play architecture: any recombinant enzyme fused to a DIG-binding domain (such as APEX2 or TurboID in this work) can be readily recruited to the RNA target site. This modularity allows broad adaptability across different labelling chemistries and also circumvents the constraints of conventional genetically encoded PL systems, allowing for seamless application in primary cells and complex systems where genome editing may not be feasible.</p><p id="P26">One of further innovations in our workflow is the confinement of labelling reactions to nanometre-scale environments through diffusion tuning by employing macromolecular crowding agents. When combined with automated content-aware 3D STED imaging to identify optimal buffer viscosity, this approach enabled unbiased, high-resolution mapping of labelling radii and supported the development of HCR-Proxy as a biophysically tuneable system for high-specificity labelling within nanoscale RNA-defined niches. Despite the diffusion confinement of labelling reactions, efficiency of biotinylation with HCR-Proxy does not require a high number of hybridisation probes, but is rather the result of signal amplification achieved by DIG-labelled hairpins at the site of the targeted RNA. This enabled us to use as little as two probe sets to achieve biotinylation of proximal proteomes, even for intronic RNA targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Using this framework, we demonstrate that HCR-Proxy can resolve sub-nucleolar microenvironments within a single condensate. As a hallmark multilayered condensate we used nucleolus and targeted distinct regions of pre-rRNA nascent transcript, each representing one of the three nucleolar sublayers. This enables molecular dissection of spatial proteome sublayers within a single condensate, revealing not only known markers but also uncovering novel nucleolar proteins with subnucleolar precision. In this way, we expanded the repertoire of identified proteins for each subcompartment and integrated deep learning classifiers trained on amino acid sequences, biophysical features and domain architectures to provide a functional link between sequence-encoded features and localisation to distinct rRNA-defined subdomains. Consistent with recent findings that subcellular localisation is governed by distributed “protein codes”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, our findings also reinforce the biophysical model of pH gradients within the nucleolus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, where acidic IDRs containing D/E tracts scaffold the FC, creating a microenvironment distinct from the lysine-rich, RRM-rich proteins of the DFC and GC. Next, our deep learning analysis also revealed that simple, interpretable features such as protein length, net charge, and domain content can outperform transformer-derived embeddings in classifying subnucleolar localisation. This suggests that phase behaviour and spatial partitioning are deeply encoded in primary protein sequence and this predictive logic extends prior findings from engineered systems to endogenous interactomes.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="web-obkly"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P28">Low-passage, wildtype mouse pluripotent stem cells IDG3.2 PSCs (129S8/B6 background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>) and endogenously tagged Polr1a-gfp mESCs were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, 5 % CO2, feeder-free, on cell culture dishes (TPP) coated with 0.1% Gelatin (Millipore, cat# ES-006-B).
