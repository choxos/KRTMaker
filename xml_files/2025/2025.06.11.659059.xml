While there has been tremendous progress in extrusion or light-based bioprinting in microgravity conditions, printing of aligned tissues, such as those featuring anisotropic organization of cells and extracellular matrices (e.g., muscle, tendon, cardiac, etc.), remains a challenge. Furthermore, current photoresin formulations do not allow long-term cell encapsulation and are difficult to perform in microgravity. In this study, we demonstrate a new gravity-independent filamented light (G-FLight) biofabrication system with in-built refrigeration and heating units, which can create viable muscle constructs within seconds. We developed new photoresin formulations based on gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) for encapsulation of primary cells (murine myoblasts) and storage in printing cuvettes for at least a week at 4°C or -80°C. The tissues printed in microgravity based on the new formulations exhibited higher cell viability, number of proliferating cells and after maturation higher numbers of myotubes and fusion index compared to control formulations (i.e., GelMA dissolved in phosphate buffered saline). The microgravity-printed tissues also featured similar myotube density and fusion index to those printed using the same resins on-ground. The G-Flight printing concept, together with the new resins enabling refrigeration or cryopreservation with encapsulated cells, offers a promising solution for biofabrication in space.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Biofabrication</kwd><kwd>filamented light (FLight)</kwd><kwd>microgravity</kwd><kwd>cryopreservation</kwd><kwd>aligned tissue</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The “space race” during the 1950-70s ushered in a bold and ambitious era of scientific innovation and technological breakthroughs, ultimately pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible in space travel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> Despite a reduction crewed space missions thereafter, the spark for interplanetary exploration has persisted amongst the masses, and with the recent development of re-usable rockets and advanced computing systems which reduce costs and improve the efficiency of spacecrafts, such an exploration is becoming a tangible possibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> Sending humans into space, however, would require sustaining lives by understanding the pathophysiological changes to tissues in space (e.g., due the lack of gravity) and developing solutions to repair and regenerate human tissues damaged due to accidents, ageing and disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> Towards these applications, the field of biofabrication has an important role to play.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup></p><p id="P3">Biofabrication tools have enabled both in-vitro and in-situ fabrication of engineered tissues and grafts which mimic the natural cellular and extracellular matrix environment of natural tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> These tissues have been studied in space-like environments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> including simulated microgravity (e.g., in random positioning machines),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> short-term microgravity (e.g., in parabolic flights),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> or prolonged microgravity (e.g., aboard the International Space Station (ISS)).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> While simulated microgravity approaches deploying continuous alteration of gravity vectors allows cost effectiveness and small form factor for prolonged experiments, current versions are more suitable for holding bioreactors and cell culture vessels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> Testing a biofabrication approach in simulated microgravity would necessitate the development of a customized system for holding the bioprinter and will not recapitulate the actual printing environment and resin handling conditions.

Testing two different storage temperatures could allow the assessment of suitability for both short-term space missions (i.e., those lasting less than 2 weeks) which could suffice from a storage at 4°C or long-term missions (i.e., those lasting several months), which would necessitate cryopreservation (-80°C) conditions.</p><p id="P7">In this work, we developed new photoresin formulations – CoolResin and CryoResin – which allowed storage with encapsulated cells at 4°C or -80°C, respectively.

To address these constraints, we excluded sensitive optical components such as a digital micromirror device and complex beam-shaping optics (e.g., telescopic lenses), which we had used in our prior work,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> and instead developed a compact and robust light engine featuring 3D printed physical masks for light shaping (illustration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, animation of the light-path in Video S1). This system incorporated a 405 nm laser beam which was initially shaped from an elliptical profile (1×5 mm) into a rectangular profile (3×5 mm) using an anamorphic prism pair, and later into a square profile (10×10 mm) with a 20° divergence angle via a top-hat diffusor. A plano-convex lens was then positioned thereafter to collimate the light along a 30×30 mm profile, which was passed through custom-made photomasks to shape the light prior to projection onto a cuvette containing the photoresins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P10">An illustration of the assembly of the G-FLight printer with all its auxiliary components (including the light engine inside an enclosure) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, while the actual assembled printer and the key components are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>. All the components were mounted on a 30×45 cm<sup>2</sup> optical breadboard. The printer housed a refrigeration unit which stored the bioresins (i.e., cells encapsulated within the photoresins) between 4-6°C throughout the duration of the parabolic flight, and a heating unit for heating the resins to 37°C prior to printing. In the G-FLight printer, the print parameters (exposure duration and intensity) could be set using the graphical user interface (see <bold>Video S2</bold>). Prior to printing, appropriate masks could be retrieved from the mask holder and the photoresin-laden cuvettes retrieved from the heating or refrigeration unit and placed inside the printing enclosure.

The specific compositions of the resins are detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>. All formulations contained 5% w/v GelMA in PBS with lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP) as the photoinitiator at 0.1% w/v.

Here, the CoolResin and ControlResin formulations were stored 4°C by simply transferring the sterile resin-filled cuvettes (with capped lids) in a refrigerator. For CryoResin formulations, the capped cuvettes with the resins were placed in a controlled-rate freezing unit (Mr. Frosty™) containing isopropyl alcohol (IPA), which was in-turn placed within a dry ice container, to ensure cooling at 1°C/min until -80°C. Note that the ControlResin and CoolResin formulations were not evaluated for storage at -80°C as the constructs demonstrated very poor fidelity and low cell viability (&lt; 10%) after printing (pilot results not shown). The photorheological tests confirmed a rapid polymerization of GelMA for different formulations upon exposure to 405 nm light. To isolate the effects of resin additives from inherent physical crosslinking behavior of GelMA, these measurements were conducted at 25°C on non-gelled (liquid state) formulations. Comparative analysis of the crosslinking onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) indicated faster crosslinking kinetics in the CryoResin formulations compared to the CoolResin and ControlResin, which could be attributed to inhibition of any photoinitiator degradation during cryogenic storage. Despite differences in polymerization onset, the final storage moduli after complete crosslinking were comparable, yielding values in the range 2.7-3.4 kPa.</p><p id="P14">Subsequently, we assessed the effect of photoexposure duration on hydrogel stiffness. Considering ranges used in muscle tissue engineering,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> we classified crosslinked hydrogels exhibiting an elastic modulus of 3-5 kPa as "soft" gels and 12–16 kPa as "stiff" gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Here, for the same light engine producing output at 34 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, we screened a range of exposure times (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2</xref>). Notably, the resins being printed at 37°C took longer to polymerize and to achieve crosslinking ranges similar to those printed at 4°C, which can be attributable to the changes in molecular structure and reactive group availability in the GelMA formulations under cold or heated conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> Notably, considering the printing window during the microgravity phase would be within 22 s, only the CryoResin formulations at 37°C (termed as CryoResin_37C henceforth) were suitable as they required a 15 s exposure duration. The resulting gels from CryoResin_37C exhibited stiffness values within the soft stiffness range. However, none of the other formulations (when heated to 37°C) reached the desired stiffness in either the soft or stiff regimes within the available 22-second printing window. Consequently, these formulations were excluded from subsequent cell-based experiments. From these tests, we obtained optimal exposure times as 4, 4.5, 2.5, and 15 s for ControlResin_4C, CoolResin_4C, CryoResin_4C, and CryoResin_37C, respectively, to cater to the soft stiffness regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). For the stiff regime, prolonged exposure times of 6, 6.5, and 4 s were used for ControlResin_4C, CoolResin_4C, and CryoResin_4C, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).The optimized light exposure durations were subsequently applied to evaluate the achievable printing resolution using the G-FLight system. For this, a spoke-wheel photomask (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>) was used, and the minimum achievable feature sizes were determined for the different formulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S3</xref>). In the soft stiffness regime, differences in the minimum achievable feature sizes were observed across formulations, with average resolutions of 147 ± 5.4 µm, 174.5 ± 13.22 µm, 136.6 ± 7.97 µm, and 174.1 ± 6.86 µm for ControlResin_4C, CoolResin_4C, CryoResin_4C, and CryoResin_37C, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Notably, constructs within the higher stiffness regime for each formulation exhibited a smaller minimum attainable feature size than those within the lower stiffness regime, while no significant differences in resolution were found amongst the formulations (minimum feature size ∼ 120 ± 5 µm). The inability to achieve smaller feature sizes with lower exposure duration is attributable to the spreading of light dose within the resin due to optical blurring and free radical diffusion, which necessitates the use of higher optical doses for smaller features. This is a known constraint with laser-based printing techniques such as tomographic printing, where the optical doses need to be digitally tuned to account for the different feature sizes in an object.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup></p><p id="P15">Prior to characterizing the microarchitecture of the resin formulations and the characteristics of cells therein, we conducted pilot tests to screen the formulations for their ability to maintain shape fidelity during long-term culture.

The viability for the CoolResin and CryoResin formulations on Day 7 was significantly higher than the ControlResin formulations. Owing to the recovery of viable cells on Day 7 for the optimized resin formulations, the initial double-positive population likely represents cells in a stressed but viable state.

Notably, uniaxial cell alignment along the microfilament direction was present in all the groups fabricated at 4°C. This alignment was missing in the CryoResin_37C formulation, which could be attributed to the non-specific crosslinking within these formulations which reduce the porosity and limit the cell guidance cues from the microfilaments. Quantification of proliferating cells (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) revealed that CoolResin_4C and CryoResin_4C supported the highest levels of proliferation, with 36.1 ± 1 % and 42.8 ± 5.2 % Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells, respectively. In contrast, ControlResin_4C and CryoResin_37C showed markedly lower proliferation, with only 18 ± 11.3% and 17.6 ± 6 % Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells, respectively. The significantly lower amounts of cells in the ControlResin_4C group can be attributed to the absence of components for hypothermic preservation or cryopreservation, which caused reduced cell viability and overall cell count. The corresponding lower amounts of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells in the CryoResin_37C can be attributed to the low porosity of the matrix, which can limit cell proliferation and impede alignment. Owing to the high number of proliferating (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) cells, the total observed cell densities (including both Ki67<sup>+</sup> and Ki67<sup>-</sup> cells) were significantly higher in the CoolResin_4C and CryoResin_4C constructs, reaching 23.3 ± 3.2×10<sup>3</sup> and 29.2 ± 9.9×10<sup>3</sup> cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively, compared to 3.5 ± 5.9×10<sup>3</sup> and 6.9 ± 3×10<sup>3</sup> cells/mm<sup>3</sup> in the ControlResin_4C and CryoResin_37C formulations, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).

The heat was generated by wrapping a mini flask warmer (Thermup Go, Lionel Care) which was set to 41°C, which allowed maintenance of 37°C inside the heating unit to liquefy the resins prior to printing (only for the formulations which were printed in a heated state). The other printer components, including the mask holder, masks, printing enclosure and the cover of the printer were also custom 3D printed using PETG and mounted onto the optical breadboard.</p><p id="P35">As for the optical and electrical components, a supplementary figure has been provided detailing the components and their connections (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S7</xref>). The laser module (LDM-405, LaserTack GmbH) was purchased as a collimated source with anamorphic pairs mounted at the output to generate a square beam profile (4×4 mm<sup>2</sup>) at 300 mW. A top hat diffusor (ED1-S20-MD, Thorlabs) was placed along the laser light path to homogenize the beam (i.e., remove the gaussian intensity distribution) at the output of the laser. A plano convex lens (f = 75 mm, Thorlabs) was then used to collimate the light beam which was subsequently shaped using the masks inserted into the printing chamber. The optical components were covered by an aluminium enclosure to prevent light leakage as per the safety norms dictated by NoveSpace. Additional laser indication lights were connected to the laser controller to turn ON when the laser was activated. In addition, a reed switch was mounted onto the printing closure (where the masks and cuvettes were inserted) and was interlocked with the laser controller. A magnet was attached to the lid of the printing enclosure, which, upon closing, activated the laser. The laser controller received its analog signals through a Raspberry Pi 4.0 which in-turn received user input for the light intensity and the print duration through a graphical user interface displayed on a touch screen. All the components were powered by a single DC power supply unit (12 V, 50 W, LRS 50-12, Mean Well) which was connected to the mains supply. The components running on 12V (Laser module and refrigeration unit) were directly connected to the power supply (with appropriate fuses), while the components requiring 5V supply (Raspberry Pi and heating unit) were interfaced with a 12V-5V converter (LM2596, Purecrea, Bastelgarage) between the component and the power supply.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><label>5.2</label><title>Photoresin constitution</title><p id="P36">Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) with a high degree of functionalization (DoF) was synthesized following our established protocol.
