Alongside well-characterized nascent adhesions, focal adhesions (FAs), fibrillar adhesions (FBs) and hemidesmosomes, a new class of IACs, reticular adhesions (RAs), have been identified. RAs, initially described as flat clathrin lattices formed by integrin αVβ5, lack association with actin and are devoid of FAs markers. The physiological role of RAs in normal and tumor cells is still incompletely understood and requires further investigation. Previously, we analysed IACs of two melanoma cell lines, MDA-MB-435S and RPMI-7951, grown under long term culture conditions, and demonstrated that both cell lines preferentially use integrin αVβ5 for adhesion. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of RAs in these two melanoma cell lines that differ in their ability to form FBs. To determine RAs composition, we treated cells with actin polymerisation inhibitor cytochalasin D (CytoD) which disrupts FAs, allowing isolation of RAs, which were analysed by MS-based proteomics, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Known RA-associated proteins, including the AP-2 adaptor complex, disabled homolog 2 (DAB2) and Numb were identified in both lines, along with talin2. Notably, we also detected the presence of KN motif and ankyrin repeat domains protein (KANK2) in RA isolates. Proximity ligation analysis following CytoD-induced actin disruption confirmed the proximity of KANK2 and talin2 in RAs. We then investigated the effect of talin2 or KANK2 knockdown on RAs composition. While both talin2 and KANK2 are located in RAs, neither is essential for RA formation. Talin2 knockdown led to a reduction in RA components abundance in both cell lines. In MDA-MB-435S cell line, KANK2 produced a similar effect, mirroring the functional interaction of talin2 and KANK2 in FAs. However, in RPMI-7951 cells, KANK2 knockdown had no significant effect on RA components abundance. This discrepancy likely reflects the preferential localization of KANK2 in FBs and underscores the differing roles of talin2 and KANK2 in αVβ5-mediated FAs across the two cell lines. These findings underscore the complexity of adhesion signalling and highlight the importance of adhesion crosstalk in regulating cellular function.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Most cells in multicellular organisms require attachment to their surroundings through cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesions. In cell-matrix adhesions, integrins, a family of transmembrane receptors, have long been recognized as the central scaffolds around which these complexes are built. Through binding to the ECM and clustering, integrins form multimolecular adhesion complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chastney et al., 2021</xref>). The composition of integrin adhesion complexes (IACs) varies depending on the type of adhesions they form. Focal adhesions (FAs) mature from nascent adhesions and facilitate force transduction through tight links to contractile actomyosin fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Yamaguchi and Knaut, 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Mishra and Manavathi, 2021</xref>). Formed by many integrin heterodimers, FAs are located primarily at the cell edge. Fibrillar adhesions (FBs), formed by integrin α5β1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Conway and Jacquemet, 2019</xref>), are located in the cell center of the migrating cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Katz et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Pankov et al., 2000</xref>). FBs arise through translocation of fibronectin-bound α5β1 integrins from the periphery to the center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Pankov et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Clark et al., 2005</xref>) in a tension-dependent manner and have a role in fibronectin fibrillogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Zamir et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). Integrins are also components of adhesion structures that lack strong actomyosin connections, are enriched in endocytic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lock et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Zuidema et al., 2018</xref>), yet still function as signalling platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Leyton-Puig et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alfonzo-Mendez et al., 2022</xref>). These structures, formed as a result of frustrated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Baschieri et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bruna-Gauchoux and Montagnac, 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Baschieri et al., 2020</xref>), and are referred to as reticular adhesions (RAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lock et al., 2018</xref>), flat clathrin lattices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Baschieri et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">De Deyne et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Zuidema et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Leyton-Puig et al., 2017</xref>), or clathrin plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Moulay et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bucher et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lampe et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Saffarian et al., 2009</xref>). RAs are mediated exclusively by integrin αVβ5 but lack most IAC components, except talin2 and tensin3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lock et al., 2018</xref>). Recent studies have shown that RAs are larger than flat clathrin lattices and contain them in an interspersed manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hakanpaa et al., 2023</xref>). Unlike FAs, RAs persist throughout cell division to enable effective mitosis and also transmit spatial memory from pre-mitotic to post-mitotic daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zuidema et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lock et al., 2018</xref>). Since RAs form through arrested endocytosis, their core components include proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, such as adaptor protein 2 (AP2), disabled protein 2 (Dab2), NUMB Endocytic Adaptor Protein (NUMB), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Pathway Substrate 15 (EPS15), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Pathway Substrate 15 Like 1 (EPS15L1), intersectin (ITSN), and Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor Adaptor Protein 1 (LDLRAP1 or ARH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lock et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Baschieri et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Zuidema et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lock et al., 2019</xref>). None of these proteins are present exclusively in RAs, and therefore cannot be used as markers. Lukas et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lukas et al., 2024</xref>) have recently identified stonin1 as a protein exclusively present at RAs. However, they emphasized that stonin1 is not ubiquitously expressed.</p><p id="P3">Talins are key cytoplasmic mechanosensitive proteins that mediate binding of integrins to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Klapholz and Brown, 2017</xref>). There are two different isoforms of talin: talin1 and talin2. Talin1 forms the core of FAs, increasing the affinity of integrin for ligands (integrin activation) and recruiting a range of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">del Rio et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Goult et al., 2021</xref>). Abrogation of talin1 expression leads to FA disruption, while talin2 has been shown to influence FA dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Loncaric et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Stojanović et al., 2025</xref>). Talin2 is mainly found at large FAs and FBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Praekelt et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Atherton et al., 2022</xref>) but also in RAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lock et al., 2018</xref>). Talins directly bind to actin and coordinate microtubule (MT) recruitment to adhesion sites via interaction with KANK proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bouchet et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Goult et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Klapholz and Brown, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Sun et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Loncaric et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P4">KANK2, a member of the KANK (kidney ankyrin repeat-containing) family proteins that bind the talin rod through a KN motif, is mainly found in mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Along with KANK1, KANK2 localizes to the rims of mature integrin-containing FAs and adjacent regions called cortical microtubule stabilizing complexes (CMSCs). The CMSC, recruited via KANK2-talin1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Sun et al., 2016</xref>) or talin2-KANK2 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Loncaric et al., 2023</xref>) stabilizes MTs near mature FAs and regulates actin-microtubule crosstalk. In some cells, behind the lamella, KANK2 binding to talin promotes integrin activation, and at the same time diminishes F-actin binding to talin. Consequently, this leads to the translocation of β1 integrins into FBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). FBs contain talin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Praekelt et al., 2012</xref>) and KANK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Atherton et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Stojanović et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p id="P5">RAs have been observed in various cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lukas et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lock et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Paradzik et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Zuidema et al., 2018</xref>); however, information on their molecular composition has mostly come from U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lock et al., 2018</xref>), keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Zuidema et al., 2018</xref>), and C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lukas et al., 2024</xref>). Here, a comprehensive analysis of RAs in two melanoma cell lines MDA-MB-435S and RPMI-7951, which differ in their ability to form FBs in long-term culture, is presented. In RAs of both cell lines, previously known RA proteins, including talin2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lock et al., 2018</xref>), were identified, as was KANK2. Although these two proteins were located in RAs, they were not essential for RA formation. Talin2 knockdown reduced the abundance of RA components in both cell lines. In the MDA-MB-435S cell line, KANK2 which functionally interacts with talin2 in FAs, produced a similar effect. However, KANK2 knockdown in RPMI-7951 cells did not affect the abundance of RA components. This difference between the MDA-MB-435S and RPMI-7951 cell lines is likely due to the preferential localization of KANK2 in FBs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell Cultures</title><p id="P6">The human melanoma cell lines MDA-MB-435S and RPMI-7951 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

In MDA-MB-435S cells, there was a significant reduction in the amount of several RA components such as AP2A1, AP2A2, EPS1L15, and ITSN2. KANK2 knockdown in MDA-MB-435S cells also led to a decrease in the level of several RA components such as CTLC proteins, AP2A1, AP2B1, and ITSN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>).

These results are in line with observed changes in FAs of MDA-MB-435S after either talin2 or KANK2 knockdown and RPMI-7951 cells after talin2 knockdown. Thus, FAs become less dynamic and their size increases but not their number, indicating the retention of FA proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Loncaric et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Stojanović et al., 2025</xref>), which leads to a reduction in RAs.</p><p id="P32">KANK2 knockdown did not have the same effect as talin2 knockdown in RPMI-7951 cells.

Additionally, KANK2 is shown to be a novel component of RAs. Given that we have extensively studied the role and localization of talin2 and KANK2 in FAs and FBs of these two cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Loncaric et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Stojanović et al., 2025</xref>), we further analysed how the knockdown of each protein affects RAs. Our results demonstrate that talin2 and KANK2 are not essential for the formation of RAs; however, their knockdown influences RA component abundance, and primarily mirrors the roles of talin2 and KANK2 in αVβ5 FAs.

Here RAs were analysed in both cell lines and it was demonstrated that clathrin and endocytic adaptor proteins are enriched in RA isolates as previously reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lock et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zuidema et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Zuidema et al., 2018</xref>). In the analysis of RA proteins, the same logic as Lock and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lock et al., 2018</xref>) was followed; i.e. the proteins we considered to be potential RA proteins were those maintained or enriched in the sample during RA isolation. In doing so, the presence of most of the previously identified proteins was confirmed in the melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lock et al., 2018</xref>). Stonin1, which has been identified as a specific adaptor for the endocytosis of NG2 and as an important factor for FA dynamics and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Feutlinske et al., 2015</xref>), and recently shown to be as a marker for RAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lukas et al., 2024</xref>), was only detected in RA isolates of MDA-MB-435S, with a low number of spectra. In RPMI-7951 RA isolates, stonin1 was not detected, nor was it detected in RPMI-7951 IAC isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Stojanović et al., 2025</xref>). This could be a consequence of the protein not being expressed in abundance in the melanoma cells. Therefore, in subsequent analyses of RA levels, endocytic adaptors such as AP2 as markers of RAs were used as markers.</p><p id="P35">Previous research identified integrin αVβ5 as the main receptor in RAs; however, it is still not clear whether β3 and β1 can also contribute to their formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Zuidema et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lock et al., 2018</xref>). MS analysis of isolated IACs after disruption of actin cytoskeleton using CytoD confirmed that αVβ5 integrin preferentially forms RAs in the two melanoma cell lines. Although a small number of spectra were found for several other integrin subunits, primarily β1, the α subunits did not overlap between the two cell lines. In RPMI-7951 cells, but not in MDA-MB-435S cells, MS analysis identified integrin α5, which is in line with our own results that these cells form FBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Stojanović et al., 2025</xref>) and can be found in RAs isolates because FBs are less dependent on actin cytoskeleton.</p><p id="P36">Talin2 was found to be not needed for RA maintenance, which indicates that talin2 is not an activator of integrins in RA. Potential activators of integrin β5 in RA include the proteins Dab2, Numb, and ARH, which have been shown to interact directly with integrin β5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Calderwood et al., 2003</xref>), and whose binding affinity for integrin β5 is several times higher than that of talin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zuidema et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P37">The key finding here is that KANK2 is a component of RAs in both melanoma cell lines. Not only was KANK2 enriched in samples of isolated RAs from both cell lines, those that form FBs and those that do not, but PLA analysis after integrin α5 knockdown (to deplete FBs) and CytoD treatment (to deplete FAs) also revealed close proximity between talin2 and KANK2. Therefore, given that talin2 and KANK2 were found in three different types of adhesions, this suggested that they may play a role in the interconversion. The fate of FAs and RAs has been suggested to be mainly connected via their shared use of αVβ5 integrins. Manipulations that inhibited one of these structures appeared to favour the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lock et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lukas et al., 2024</xref>) presumably by enlarging the available αVβ5 integrin pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lukas et al., 2024</xref>). Our results support these data. Namely, in MDA-MB-435S cell line talin2 from integrin αVβ5 FAs and KANK2 from CMSC have been implicated in maintaining actin-MT crosstalk. Therefore, knockdown of either of these proteins alters integrin αVβ5 FAs dynamics, resulting in enlarged αVβ5 FAs along with reduced cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Loncaric et al., 2023</xref>). The enlarged αVβ5 FAs suggest increased levels of FA proteins. Therefore, it was not surprising that knockdown of either talin2 or KANK2 led to reduced abundance of RA components. In RPMI-7951 cells, which form three talin2 and KANK2 positive adhesions (FAs, FBs and RAs), talin2 knockdown also increased FA size (suggestive of increased levels of FA proteins) and reduced cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Stojanović et al., 2025</xref>) and again, a reduction in RAs levels was observed. However, in the RPMI-7951 cell line, KANK2 knockdown did not affect integrin αVβ5 FAs. Therefore, the unaltered αVβ5 FAs, likely explains why the abundance of RA components after KANK2 knockdown remain unchanged.</p><p id="P38">In MDA-MB-435S cells (which lack FBs), talin2 knockdown did not affect KANK2 levels, although the characteristic RA proteins were reduced. In RPMI-7951 cells, the very low number of KANK2-specific spectra made it impossible to determine whether KANK2 levels change; however, a clear decrease in specific RA proteins was observed. Thus, within RAs, talin2 depletion does not reduce KANK2 levels. Still, it remains unclear whether these two proteins directly interact within RAs and what functional role they might play. Conversely, in both melanoma cell lines, KANK2 knockdown reduced talin2 levels, regardless of the overall effect on RA-specific proteins. This finding suggests the talin2 dependence of KANK2 levels. Moreover, it is in line with the previously mentioned observation that RA formation is independent of both talin2, already observed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lock et al., 2018</xref>), and apparently, KANK2 (our own data).</p><p id="P39">Until recently, it was not clear how αVβ5 integrin physically transfers between FAs and RAs. It has been shown that RAs arise more frequently at sites where the FA marker paxillin was progressively replaced by stonin1. In addition, the conversions in the opposite direction also occur by the recruitment of paxillin onto pre-existing β5 integrin scaffolds. These data indicate that two integrin αVβ5-based adhesions, having distinct molecular compositions, are intimately linked and dynamically interconvertible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lukas et al., 2024</xref>). FAs and RAs are inversely regulated complexes and the balance between these types of adhesions is influenced by phosphatidylinositols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lock et al., 2018</xref>). High levels of activated myosin light chain (p-MLC) also correlated with integrin αVβ5 localizing to FAs over RAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zuidema et al., 2022</xref>). Decreased membrane tension together with formation of contractile stress fibers, promotes the assembly of FAs, reduces RAs, and decreased cancer cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Djakbarova et al., 2024</xref>). In MDA-MB-435S cells talin2 knockdown enhanced stress fiber formation and reduced cell migration. In addition, talin2 knockdown increased the size of FAs indicating preference of αVβ5 for FAs over RAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Loncaric et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, our results are consistent with this mechanism of inverse regulation of FA and RA. These conclusions are further supported by results in the RPMI-7951 cell line, in which only talin2 alters FAs and consequently alters RAs.</p><p id="P40">This comprehensive analysis of RAs in two melanoma cell lines expands on previous findings and highlights novel molecular components. The presence of talin2 in RAs is confirmed and KANK2 is identified as a novel RA-associated protein in both cell lines. While neither protein is essential for RA formation, their knockdown significantly alters RA abundance and composition, reflecting their broader roles in other adhesion types such as FAs and FBs. These findings emphasize the importance of adhesion crosstalk and the dynamic balance between different adhesion structures, which is influenced by integrin composition, cytoskeletal integrity, and membrane tension.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures S1-S6</label><media xlink:href="EMS206223-supplement-Supplementary_Figures_S1_S6.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d59aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS206223-supplement-Supplementary_Table_S1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d59aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Table S2-S3</label><media xlink:href="EMS206223-supplement-Supplementary_Table_S2_S3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d59aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the Croatian Science Foundation Project (Grant No IP-2019-04-1577 to AAR), a Cancer Research UK Programme Grant to MJH (DRCRPG-100002) and an Academy of Medical Science Springboard award to JDH (SBF008\1094).</p></ack><sec id="S18" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="P41">All relevant data could be obtained from the corresponding author.</p></sec><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="con"><p id="P42"><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p id="P43">Material preparation, data collection and analysis were performed by [AR], [ML], [NS], [MF], [MR], [DH], and [AA-R].
