Recent studies suggest that radiation-induced astrocyte reactivity fosters a tumor-supportive environment, however effective strategies targeting reactive astrocyte phenotypes are lacking. Using a novel image-based assay, we screened over 1,700 small molecule compounds, identifying 29 that inhibit radiation-induced astrocyte reactivity in human astrocytes. Among these, Flunarizine, a calcium-entry blocker approved for migraine treatment, significantly reduced astrocyte reactivity in vitro and in vivo. In a genetically engineered glioblastoma mouse model, combining Flunarizine with radiotherapy markedly improved survival without affecting unirradiated controls, indicating specificity for a radiation-induced phenotype. Mechanistically, Flunarizine inhibited radiation-induced fibrosis in vivo and directly suppressed astrocytic TGF-beta activation in vitro. Notably, Flunarizine treatment had no direct effect on primary glioblastoma cells, emphasizing its microenvironmental specificity. In conclusion, we identified Flunarizine as a promising repurposed compound capable of effectively mitigating radiation-induced astrocyte reactivity and delaying glioblastoma recurrence. This approach offers a viable therapeutic strategy to enhance current glioblastoma treatments.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2"><fig id="F7" position="anchor"><label>Graphical abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS207387-f007"/></fig>

These tumors are highly heterogeneous, exhibiting a range of distinct cell states among tumor cells within the same tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), as well as diverse microenvironmental components, including various glial, immune, and vascular cell types that interact both with each other and with the tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). During the course of treatment, various cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) respond to and adapt as a result of RT. Mounting evidence indicates that RT alters the TME to cause the formation of tumor-supportive conditions in the recurrent tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Despite an increased understanding of the biological processes underlying such tumor-promoting consequences of RT, few therapeutic strategies have been developed to target microenvironmental stress responses specifically.</p><p id="P4">Astrocytes represent one of the most prominent cell types in the brain and react to various stresses in a process called reactive astrogliosis. As astrocytes become reactive, they modulate inflammatory processes, remodel the extracellular matrix, and isolate damaged tissue, resulting in protection and repair of neural tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Sustained or excessive reactive astrogliosis can, however, contribute to pathology including in primary and secondary brain tumors, where reactive astrocytes have been described as tumor-supportive elements of the TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). More specifically, tumor-associated astrocytes create an immunosuppressive microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), support tumor metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and promote brain metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that astrocytes, when reactive in response to RT, secrete extracellular matrix components that activate integrin/Src signaling on neighboring GBM cells, and that targeting these interactions can enhance the tumor cell response to RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). One clinical study has shown promising results in reducing brain metastasis growth by targeting reactive astrocytes, suggesting that targeting these stress responses may have therapeutic potential also in primary brain tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). These studies further support the pursuit of reactive astrocytes as therapeutic targets in malignant brain tumors.</p><p id="P5">While reactive astrocytes have been identified as potential therapeutic targets, astrocyte reactivity encompasses a spectrum of context-dependent phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) and there are no consensus drugs to target these states universally. Here, we leveraged reactivity-associated morphological changes induced by ionizing radiation (IR) to develop a high-content image-based approach to monitor IR-induced astrocyte reactivity, using both primary human and iPSC-derived astrocytes. Based on this approach, we performed phenotypic screens to evaluate the ability of more than 1,700 experimental and approved small molecule compounds to inhibit IR-induced astrocyte reactivity, identifying 29 compounds for further preclinical evaluation. Among these, the anti-migraine compound Flunarizine consistently reduced IR-induced astrocyte reactivity across model systems, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Treatment with Flunarizine prolonged survival and reduced the formation of fibrosis-like scars in a preclinical murine model of GBM. Together, our findings identify Flunarizine as a modulator of astrocyte reactivity and a promising therapeutic approach for GBM.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Sex as a biological variable</title><p id="P6">Animal, cell line, and clinical samples representing both sexes were used.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cells</title><p id="P7">Primary human astrocytes (3H Biomedical - SC1800-5) were cultured in astrocyte medium (3H Biomedical, SC1801) supplemented with 2% FBS, 1% PenStrep and astrocyte growth serum (provided by 3H Biomedical).

Mean signal intensity values were calculated from duplicate spots. Phospho-protein signals were normalized to their corresponding total protein signals, and fold changes were determined by comparing irradiated samples to non-irradiated controls.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Drug screening</title><p id="P16">For the primary drug screens, primary human astrocytes from two different batches were seeded in 384-well plates and cultured as described above. On the second day, cells were treated with one of the following libraries: 176 compounds from Enzo SCREEN-WELL Protease, Kinase and Epigenetics (PKE) Inhibitor libraries, 330 compounds from the TargetMol Anti-Cancer drugs library (#L2110, v2018) or 1,280 compounds from the FDA-approved Prestwick Chemical library (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://prestwickchemical.com">prestwickchemical.com</ext-link>, v2016). Compounds were tested at concentrations of 1μM and 3μM (PKE library &amp; TargetMol libraries) or 1μM and 10μM (Prestwick Chemical library). Two hours after compound addition, cells were irradiated with 10 Gy. Forty-eight hours post-irradiation, cells were fixed with 4% PFA and immunolabelled as described in the “Immunofluorescence and Analysis of Data” section to detect GFAP, vimentin, Hoechst, and phalloidin signals. Images were acquired using high-throughput microscope (IN Cell Analyzer 2200 for the PKE and Prestwick libraries; ImageXpress Confocal HT for the TargetMol library). CellProfiler v3.0-4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) was used for nuclear and cytoplasmic segmentation. Between 378 and 463 variables were extracted and used in subsequent analysis (the list of variables used for each drug screen is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Table 1</xref>). Briefly, the pipeline used Hoechst signal to identify nuclei and GFAP, vimentin and phalloidin signals to define cytoplasm regions. Morphological features (e.g., area, perimeter, shape descriptors), intensity features (for all four markers) and texture features (for vimentin and phalloidin) were quantified for nuclei, cytoplasm or whole cells. Quality control was performed using CellProfiler Analyst v3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) following established recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Furthermore, wells with a cell count <italic>z</italic>-score greater than 1.5 were excluded from the analysis to eliminate compound–concentration pairs that were toxic to astrocytes. Quantitative multivariate datasets were exported and then analyzed using HC StratoMineR (Core Life Analytics) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Redundant variables were excluded from analysis, and data were normalized across plate and scaled. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed using generalized weighted least squares, and a distance score was computed based on similarity to the non-irradiated control using Pearson approach.</p><p id="P17">For the confirmation screens, the same method was applied but using four batches of primary astrocytes, four concentrations (0.25 μM, 1 μM, 3 μM and 10 μM) and duplicate wells. Compounds included were those identified as hits in both astrocyte batches during the primary screens, along with 15 manually selected compounds. One astrocyte batch (AstroJ) was excluded from the mean distance score calculation due to its divergent response compared to the other three batches.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Western blot</title><p id="P18">Whole cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (cOmplete - Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor (PhosSTOP – Roche). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein were mixed with NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) and dithiothreitol (DTT; Sigma-Aldrich), then boiled at 70°C for 10 minutes. Proteins were separated on 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Stain-Free Protein Gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and transferred to PVDF membranes using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS-T (TBS with Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) diluted in blocking solution or in 5% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in TBS-T for phospho-protein detection.

The sequence was performed using NovaSeq 6000 System (Illumina) and NovaSeq 6000 S4 Reagent Kit v1.5 (20028312, Illumina). To process and analyze the data, paired-end RNA-seq data from irradiated and Flunarizine-treated samples were processed using the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline (v3.14.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), utilizing Salmon for transcript quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).

Gene annotations, including external gene symbols and biotypes, were retrieved from biomaRt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) and merged into the DESeq2 object. Protein coding genes with a minimum total count greater than 1 across samples were kept. For global differential expression analysis, expression data were modeled using a generalized linear model in DESeq2 with the formula ‘~ Rep + Irradiation + Treatment’. Variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) was applied to normalized counts for PCA, visualizing sample clustering according to treatment and irradiation conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 7C</xref>).

Following IR, we observed significant alterations in both cell and nuclear morphology, as well as increased expression of established reactive astrocyte markers such as GFAP and vimentin, in both primary human astrocytes and iPSC-derived astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Some of these changes are well-recognized hallmarks of astrocyte reactivity, including enlarged cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), increased GFAP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) and vimentin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Additional morphological features were also affected by IR, including nuclear and cell shape descriptors and phalloidin signal intensity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1 A-E</xref>).</p><p id="P34">To comprehensively capture these changes, we selected 35 quantifiable features that were the most altered in astrocytes after IR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), using CellProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). We then applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to integrate and analyze these variables, providing a multidimensional representation of astrocyte reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Using this approach, we successfully detected changes associated with reactivity in both primary human astrocytes and iPSC-derived astrocytes following treatment with 3 Gy IR. Interestingly, both cell types exhibited similar variance changes along the first principal component (Dimension 1), suggesting a conserved reactivity response to IR across different astrocyte models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Next, we exposed astrocytes to different stress conditions relevant to the GBM microenvironment, namely temozolomide, representing standard chemotherapeutic treatment, and hypoxia, which is characteristic of the GBM tumor niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). In primary human astrocytes, temozolomide exposure induced only a mild effect, whereas both IR (3 and 10 Gy) and hypoxia caused pronounced alterations in morphology and marker expression, with more marked effects observed at 0.1% O<sub>2</sub> compared to 1% O<sub>2</sub>. These findings are consistent with our previous work showing that hypoxia induces astrocyte reactivity with a more robust phenotype at 0.1% O<sub>2</sub> than at 1% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). However, in iPSC-derived astrocytes, we only observed a modest effect of hypoxia at 1% O<sub>2</sub> while 0.1% O<sub>2</sub> induced strong changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2A</xref>). Overall, iPSC-derived astrocytes responded strongly at 0.1% O<sub>2</sub> and 3 Gy IR but showed only mild changes after temozolomide treatment and 10 Gy IR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P35">To validate our approach, we tested the effect of the STAT3 inhibitor Silibinin, which has been shown to counteract the tumor-promoting effects of astrocytes in the brain TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). We first confirmed STAT3 activation by detecting increased phosphorylation of Y705-STAT3 following IR in primary human astrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2C</xref>). Co-treatment with Silibinin partially reversed the IR-induced phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). Similarly, inhibition of the NF-κB pathway - another key mediator of astrocyte reactivity - also resulted in a partial rescue of the IR-induced phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2D</xref>). Together, these results establish a robust, multidimensional image-based approach to quantify astrocyte reactivity, capable of capturing diverse reactive phenotypes and their modulation by environmental stressors or pharmacological interventions.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>The JNK pathway is required for the induction of IR-induced astrocyte reactivity</title><p id="P36">To identify signaling pathways essential for IR-induced astrocyte reactivity, we first performed a phospho-protein array including 1,318 phosphosites that compared phosphorylation levels between astrocytes treated with 10 Gy IR and non-irradiated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3A-B, Supp. Table 2</xref>). This analysis revealed increased phosphorylation within the canonical JNK1 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J–K</xref>), in contrast to other JNK substrates such as those from the Bcl-2 family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3C</xref>). To confirm JNK pathway activation in response to IR, we treated primary human astrocytes with Neocarzinostatin, a radiomimetic agent that mimics the IR-induced DNA-damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Shortly after Neocarzinostatin treatment, we observed increased phosphorylation of pT183/Y185-JNK1/2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1L</xref>) and pS63-CJUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1M</xref>), indicating rapid activation of JNK pathway. Additionally, pS727-STAT3, a described JNK1 target site, also displayed increased phosphorylation following IR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3D</xref>). To assess whether JNK signaling is functionally required for astrocyte reactivity, we applied our phenotypic approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>) and found that SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, partially reversed the IR-induced phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1N</xref>).

We screened three different compound libraries: 1) a small library of 176 kinase, protease and epigenetic inhibitors (PKE library); 2) a library of 330 anti-cancer drugs tested in humans (Anti-Cancer library); and 3) a larger library composed of 1,280 FDA-approved compounds (FDA Approved library) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). To minimize batch-specific effects, two independent batches of primary human astrocytes were used (AstroD and AstroF). Cells were treated, fixed, and stained as previously described. We extracted around 400 morphology and intensity features from the images using CellProfiler (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Table 1</xref>) describing cell and nuclear area, shape, signal intensities and cytoplasmic texture for phalloidin and vimentin signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4A</xref>). Image quality was assessed using CellProfiler Analyst, following established guidelines to exclude images with poor focus, saturation artifacts, or segmentation errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Using HC StratoMineR, a web-based tool for high-content data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), we scaled and normalized the data for each compound library and astrocyte batch, and performed PCA, revealing clear separation between irradiated and non-irradiated controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4B-D</xref>). To quantify this separation, a distance score to non-irradiated controls was computed, providing quantitative support for the observed divergence between conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supp. Table 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">5</xref>). Compounds yielding a distance score below 0.7 were considered hits. The proportion of hits detected in one or both astrocyte batches was visualized using pie charts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Interestingly, hits from the FDA-approved library spanned a wide range of therapeutic classes, with no enrichment for specific classes observed.</p><p id="P38">To validate the initial hits, we performed a confirmation screen that included all compounds scoring as hits in both batches from the primary screens, supplemented with 15 manually selected compounds. These additional candidates were chosen based on prior literature reports or because they target kinases implicated in the phosphorylation of top hits from the phospho-antibody array (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3A</xref>). In total, 134 compounds were tested across four astrocyte batches at four concentrations and in duplicates - substantially increasing data robustness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). PCAs and distance scores again showed good separation for all astrocyte batches between controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supp. Table 6</xref>).

To prioritize candidates suitable for drug repurposing in GBM, we focused on 18 compounds that had already been tested in humans. Of these, 16 are currently approved drugs across various therapeutic classes. We further refined the list to 12 compounds predicted to cross the blood-brain barrier, a critical feature for Central Nervous System (CNS)-targeted therapies. These included drugs used for migraine, psychosis, and depression, as well as several anti-parasitic agents - accounting for 25% of the final hits. Visual inspection of images confirmed that these compounds inhibited IR-induced morphological changes in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 6</xref>). Among the 12 hits, Flunarizine was selected for further investigation. It consistently ranked among the lowest distance scores in both the initial and confirmation screens, suggesting strong efficacy in suppressing astrocyte reactivity. Additionally, Flunarizine is an off-patent drug that has been approved for decades, primarily for the treatment of migraines, and has a well-established safety profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), making it a viable candidate for drug repurposing in GBM.

Interestingly, by comparing astrocytes that received DMSO or Flunarizine in combination with 10 Gy, among the most downregulated genes, there were several genes coding for extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (<italic>TGM2, TNC</italic>) or ECM-interacting proteins (<italic>LOXL4, ZYX, ADAM19, LTBP3, ITGA4, THBS1, CCN2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Surprisingly, despite Flunarizine being known as both a calcium channel and calmodulin inhibitor, Flunarizine treatment -alone or in combination with IR-had no detectable effect on the gene signatures associated with “positive regulation of calcium-mediated signaling” or “calmodulin-dependent kinase signaling” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 7A-B</xref>). Pathway activity inference using decoupleR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) and PROGENy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) revealed that IR and DMSO increased p53 signature activity in comparison to the DMSO control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>), as expected following DNA damage, and consistent with the reduced astrocyte viability observed after IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Additionally, IR induced significant EGFR and TGF-β pathway activities, both known regulators of astrocyte reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Notably, co-treatment with Flunarizine significantly suppressed the expression of these signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Moreover, cytokine array analysis showed increased secretion of both TGF-β1 and EGF among the many cytokines secreted following exposure to 10 Gy IR, among other induced cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>).

Furthermore, all three genes were preferentially overexpressed in tumors with wild-type IDH and without 1p/19q codeletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 13A-C</xref>), supporting their relevance in aggressive glioblastoma subtypes.</p><p id="P51">Based on our findings, we propose a model in which Flunarizine inhibits IR-induced astrocyte reactivity shortly after IR. This inhibition prevents the formation of the fibrotic scar composed of ECM proteins such as collagen I and TNC, thereby delaying tumor recurrence and extending survival in a preclinical mouse model of GBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S27" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P52">Astrocyte reactivity is an evolutionarily conserved process that plays a crucial role in protecting brain tissue from a wide range of insults. However, excessive, insufficient, or aberrant activation of astrocytes has been observed in -and, in some cases, directly implicated in-many different types of diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>) including neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune conditions, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and both primary and secondary brain tumors. Identifying compounds that modulate astrocyte reactivity holds significant therapeutic potential across these contexts. Over the past decades, efforts to understand astrocyte function and dysfunction have revealed challenges in identifying consistent markers of reactivity that are shared across disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). The only universal hallmark of astrocyte reactivity observed across most conditions is a profound change in cellular morphology following reactivity-inducing stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Building on this, we developed a novel <italic>in vitro</italic> approach to monitor astrocyte reactivity focusing on morphology changes in both the cell body and nucleus, as well as the expression, subcellular localization and signal pattern of two established reactivity markers. We validated this platform using a range of reactivity inducers and inhibitors. While changes in astrocyte morphology have traditionally served as a qualitative and empirical readout of reactivity, our approach provides an automated, unbiased, and robust method for quantification. Notably, a recent large-scale study has demonstrated that high-content morphological profiling is a powerful approach not only for assessing cellular responses but also for inferring mechanisms of action and compound bioactivity, emphasizing its growing value in drug discovery pipelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). In this context, our method extends these principles to astrocyte biology, providing a scalable and informative platform for screening modulators of astrocyte reactivity.</p><p id="P53">In recent years, a growing number of studies have demonstrated that stromal astrocytes play a pro-tumorigenic role in both primary brain tumors and brain metastases. Notably, astrocytes influence tumor progression through a wide variety of mechanisms. Within the brain tumor microenvironment, they have been shown to support tumor metabolism by fueling tumor cells with cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) or transferring mitochondria via gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>); to promote an immunosuppressive environment by inducing T-cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) or modulating the recruitment and activation of innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>); to regulate tumor dormancy in brain metastasis by inducing quiescence in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>); and to facilitate recurrence after RT by remodeling the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Targeting these pro-tumoral functions could therefore disrupt tumor growth on multiple fronts, potentially enhancing therapeutic efficacy and reducing the likelihood of resistance. A recent phase I clinical trial using the STAT3 inhibitor Silibinin - targeting STAT3+ reactive astrocytes- showed a significant improvement in overall survival in patients with various types of brain metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), highlighting the therapeutic potential of astrocyte-directed interventions. A phase-II trial is currently underway to evaluate Silibinin in patients with brain metastases from NSCLC or breast cancer. However, there remains a need to identify additional therapies that can selectively target reactive astrocytes and adapt to the various functional states they adopt in different disease contexts. Our work contributes to this effort by providing a list of promising drug repurposing candidates that target astrocytes activated in response to IR. Since RT is a part of the standard of care for both GBM and brain metastases, targeting IR-induced astrocyte reactivity is highly relevant to these conditions. We have already demonstrated the therapeutic potential of one of these candidates -Flunarizine- in a preclinical model, validating its efficacy in improving survival outcomes. Notably, Flunarizine is an off-patent compound, that has been approved for decades to treat migraines and is associated with only mild side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), making it an especially attractive candidate for drug repurposing in GBM.</p><p id="P54">Following astrocyte activation, the formation of a fibrotic scar has been observed across a wide range of pathological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). Previously referred to as “glial scar”, it is now understood that although astrocytes contribute significantly to scar formation, the majority of extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition is produced by fibrotic cells—justifying the updated term “fibrotic scar” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Nonetheless, several studies have shown that astrocytes themselves can secrete specific ECM components that may directly promote tumor recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Our findings showed that IR induces increased type 1 collagen deposition and elevated TNC expression by reactive astrocytes. We found that the genes coding for both proteins are associated with poorer survival outcome in GBM patients. Type 1 collagen is involved in the formation of “oncostreams” - structural features linked to tumor aggressiveness in glioblastoma - (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>), and in the organization of the glioma stem cell niche, further supporting its potential role in driving tumor recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). TNC has also been implicated in various aspects of glioma progression, including treatment resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Interestingly, while we observed upregulation of <italic>TNC</italic> by astrocytes, <italic>COL1A1</italic> and <italic>COL1A2</italic> expression were not induced by IR in our <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA-seq data. This suggests that astrocytes may contribute to type I collagen deposition indirectly, possibly by stimulating fibrotic stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment.</p><p id="P55">In conclusion, our study validated the pro-tumorigenic role of astrocyte reactivity in the context of GBM and provided evidence linking the formation of a fibrotic scar to tumor recurrence following RT. We introduced a novel, automated method to monitor astrocyte reactive states <italic>in vitro</italic>, enabling more robust and unbiased assessment of this complex phenotype. Finally, we identified Flunarizine as a repurposable compound that effectively inhibits IR-induced astrocyte reactivity and delays tumor recurrence, offering a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of current GBM treatments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS207387-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d29aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS207387-supplement-Supplementary_Table_1.csv" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="csv; charset=utf-8" id="d29aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS207387-supplement-Supplementary_Table_2.csv" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="csv; charset=utf-8" id="d29aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Table 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS207387-supplement-Supplementary_Table_3.csv" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="csv; charset=utf-8" id="d29aAcEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Table 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS207387-supplement-Supplementary_Table_4.csv" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="csv; charset=utf-8" id="d29aAcEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplementary Table 5</label><media xlink:href="EMS207387-supplement-Supplementary_Table_5.csv" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="csv; charset=utf-8" id="d29aAcEgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplementary Table 6</label><media xlink:href="EMS207387-supplement-Supplementary_Table_6.csv" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="csv; charset=utf-8" id="d29aAcEhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Katarzyna Radke and Elinn Johansson for valuable input.
