Here, we investigate the genetic diversity, population structure, and demographic history of the islands by analyzing whole genome sequencing data from 40 participants in the Faroe Genome Project. This represents the first whole genome sequencing panel of this size from the Faroe Islands. We observed numerous putatively functional private alleles, including stop gain variants and high impact missense variants in the cohort. Faroese individuals had a higher proportion of their genomes contained in long runs of homozygosity than other European groups, including Finnish, suggesting a more recent or stronger bottleneck in the Faroese population. Signals of positive selection were identified at loci containing genes that play roles in vitamin D and dietary fat absorption and DNA repair, while increased diversity on lactase persistence haplotypes was observed. Fine-scale analysis of haplotype structure in modern and ancient European genomes revealed genetic affinities with ancient Iron Age individuals from the North and West of Europe, providing evidence for potential contributions to the Faroese gene pool from Celtic and Viking populations as well as information about the temporal order in which these events happened.

The exact settlement history of the islands is unclear, though historical records and analysis of Y-chromosome microsatellite markers point to a few founders most likely having arrived primarily from Scandinavia and the British Isles starting around the 9th century C.E.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> However, archeological evidence supports a possible earlier settlement of the island around the 4th-6th centuries C.E.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> Studies of mtDNA reveal an excess of maternal ancestry from the British Isles, while Y chromosome studies reveal an excess of paternal ancestry from Scandinavia, suggesting sex-biased admixture between these ancestral groups during the founding of the population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> Since settlement and early waves of migration, the Faroe Islands have been mostly isolated and have experienced minimal immigration and population growth until recent years, with a census size of about 4,000 people in the 1700s6 increasing to over 54,000 as of August 2023 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://hagstova.fo/en/population/population/population">https://hagstova.fo/en/population/population/population</ext-link>). Patterns of genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium from few genetic markers reflect the founder event, followed by a historically small population size and subsequent rapid expansion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup></p><p id="P3">Overall, despite the small size and remote location of the Faroe Islands, the above evidence suggests that the genetic makeup of Faroese people may have been influenced by waves of early migration and admixture from various northwest European and Scandinavian populations. However, no population genomic studies have yet been carried out on wholege—nome sequencing data to date, with the exception of one study investigating relatedness and autozygosity for a limited sample size of eight individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> An in-depth analysis of the genomic architecture of the Faroese may reveal how the islands’ demographic history has contributed to present-day health and disease in this population. This is of particular interest as the Faroese have a high burden of certain diseases relative to global and other European populations, such as inflammatory bowel disease and type 2 diabetes, among others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> The Faroe Genome (FarGen) Project set out to understand how the genetic diversity of the Faroese contributes to health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup></p><p id="P4">Moreover, studying the genetic diversity of the Faroese provides potential insight into human migration, adaptation, and population structure in the North Atlantic region. Recently developed haplotype-based methods can provide fine resolution for inferring shared ancestry among individuals and the detection of population-specific haplotypes, but they require panels of whole-genome sequencing data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> These methods serve to better account for recent patterns of population structure and cryptic relatedness in population-based genetic studies, particularly in populations like the Faroe Islands with strong founder effects.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we present the first whole genomes sequenced as part of the FarGen Project. A set of 40 individuals were selected to optimally represent the genetic diversity of the broader Faroese population, with the aid of genealogical data reaching back to approximately 1650 CE. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) data was generated and used to identify putatively functional alleles enriched in the Faroese population, assess ancestry patterns within contemporary genomes, map signals of recent positive selection, and analyze local ancestry in a combined dataset of ancient and contemporary genomes of European descent spanning a period of 3,000 years.</p><p id="P6">This study provides insight into the genetic variation, demographic history, and selection landscape of the Faroese population. These first whole genomes from FarGen may serve as a useful reference for studies on the broad implications of various evolutionary genetic processes, including bottlenecks, ancient admixture, and positive selection. More in-depth studies may expand this current study by further investigating the genetic architecture of the Faroese to unravel the demographic and evolutionary history of the population and its impact on complex traits and diseases in the islands.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Whole Genome Sequencing of Faroese Individuals</title><p id="P7">The Faroese Multi Generation Register (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fargen.fo/research/multi-generation-registry">https://fargen.fo/research/multi-generation-registry</ext-link>) was used to reconstruct a single connected genealogical tree for the 1,541 participants in the first phase of the FarGen cohort.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> Individuals with fewer than six direct ancestors (two parents and four grandparents) recorded in the registry were excluded. Pairwise kinship coefficients were estimated from the genealogical tree and used to perform relatedness pruning with a threshold of 2<sup>-6</sup> resulting in 332 minimally related individuals. We defined six geographical regions of the Faroe Islands using language dialects, and assigned individuals to these regions based on their place of birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). A total of 40 minimally related individuals were selected for inclusion in the study, with five to eight individuals sampled from each region.</p><p id="P8">The genomes of the 40 individuals were sequenced to a median depth of 20x in the Faroe Islands at the FarGen laboratory, and they all passed quality control metrics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1, Table S1</xref>). Variant calling was performed jointly with relevant reference genome panels, including 1000 Genomes high-coverage data from Northern European (CEU &amp; GBR, N = 190), Southern European (TSI &amp; IBS, N = 214), Finnish (FIN, N = 99), East Asian (CHB, N = 103), and West African (YRI, N = 108) individuals, and imputation was performed within the cohort using an approach we have previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> The first component of principal component analysis (PCA) on the jointly called genotype data captured the cline between West African (YOR) and all other individuals, and the second component captured the cline between East Asian (CHB) and all other individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>).

Using these annotations, we identified 35 putatively functional alleles present in our Faroese panel, that are unobserved in the European mainland reference panels included in this study (CADD &gt; 30 and at least two minor alleles observed in Faroese individuals, and no minor alleles observed in Finnish or Northern European reference individuals, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). These included 13 stop gain variants and 18 missense variants, and a maximum minor allele count of 5, corresponding to a frequency of 6.25% in the cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>HLA-B Allele Frequencies</title><p id="P10">Observational evidence from the FarGen project found that ankylosing spondylitis (AS) may be at a higher prevalence in the Faroe Islands (unpublished data), however this has not been confirmed by followup epidemiological studies. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) plays a role in various autoimmune diseases that may be at higher prevalence in the Faroes, including ankylosing spondylitis and other more common diseases like inflammatory bowel disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> In particular, HLA-B*27 is associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), with approximately 80-90% of AS patients carrying the HLA-B*27 allele.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> It explains about 30% of the heritability, and ~6-8% of European populations are carriers of HLA-B*27<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Using the WGS data, we genotyped human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles with HLA*LA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> We provide HLA-B allele counts and allele frequencies in the Faroese cohort as well as the allele frequencies in 1000 Genomes British (GBR), Central European (CEU), and Finnish (FIN) individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, there have not been any larger studies of HLA-B allele frequencies in Faroese individuals, and none are currently recorded in the Allele Frequency Net Database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup></p><p id="P11">The most frequent HLA-B allele in the Faroese cohort is HLA-B*07:02 (17.5% of haplotypes), which is a common haplotype in European populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>).31,32 We did not observe a substantial difference in HLA-B*27 allele frequency in Faroese individuals (6.25% with four B*27:05 and one B*27:01 calls) as compared to other European reference groups (2-7.6%). While 80-90% of people of European ancestry with AS carry the HLA-B*27 allele, only ~6% of HLA-B*27 carriers in the US and Europe have AS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> The low frequency of the HLA-B*27 allele in this Faroese cohort in the population broadly suggests that if AS is at a higher prevalence, there may be other underlying genetic or environmental factors that explain some of the increased risk.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Population Structure and Relatedness</title><p id="P12">Pairwise kinship was calculated in the cohort using <italic>popkin</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> Clustering by geography was observed when including global reference populations in the kinship calculation, however the Faroese individuals do not show obvious clustering by region, which is expected given the relatedness pruning during sample selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-B</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We also looked at runs of homozygosity (ROHs) in the Faroese and reference cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), which can provide insights into the demographic history of the population. As the Faroese population likely experienced a founder event during the settlement of the islands followed by rapid population size expansion in recent generations, we would expect to see more of the genome contained in ROHs compared to other global populations that have not experienced as strong a bottleneck.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> When looking at the sum total amount of the genome in ROHs, we found overall elevated levels of ROH in the European and Asian groups included in this analysis, most likely reflecting ancestral out-of-Africa bottlenecks for Eurasian populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, top panel). However, the Faroese population did not have an elevated total amount of the genome contained in ROHs compared to other European groups.</p><p id="P14">To explore this further, we calculated the sum total amounts of ROH at different size categories (small, medium, large) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, bottom 3 panels). We see that, on average, the Faroese individuals have less of the genome contained in short (&lt;300 Mb) and medium (&gt; 300 Kb and &lt;= 1 Mb) ROHs compared to other European groups, but more of the genome contained in long (&gt; 1Mb) ROHs. Short and medium ROH are chunks inherited from older ancestors and reflect older events, for example, an ancient population bottleneck or founder event that has resulted in lower overall haplotype diversity, yet with enough time for recombination to break up haplotypes, while long ROH reflects chunks inherited from recent ancestors and can reflect more recent bottleneck events.39 Interestingly, the average amount of an individual’s genome that is contained in ROHs extending over 1Mb in length is higher in the Faroese population (~82.5 Mb) than the Finnish reference individuals (~63.9 Mb) and any of the other groups analyzed, which is consistent with a more recent or stronger bottleneck or founder event.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Signals of Positive Selection</title><p id="P15">We investigated signals of recent or ongoing positive selection in this Faroese cohort by calculating both the integrated haplotype score (iHS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> using <italic>hapbin</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> The sample size of the WGS cohort is relatively small (n=40), so our ability to detect signals of selection is limited. For comparison, we also calculated iHS in British individuals from the 1000 Genomes (GBR) that were included in joint calling and passed subject-level filters (n=90). The iHS values were standardized genome-wide and two-tailed p-values were computed according to the standard normal distribution. We additionally calculated q-values (the minimum False Discovery Rate (FDR) should a test be considered significant) for each test,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> and determined p-value significance thresholds at which FDR &lt; 0.01 and FDR &lt; 0.001 for each population (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). We observed that a number of significant selection signals were shared between the Faroese and British cohorts, which is not unexpected given the relationship between these two populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). The strength of these signals did differ from one population to the other, though this may be due to differences in sample size or changes in selection pressure after the populations diverged. To better identify population-specific signals, we also calculated the crosspopulation expected haplotype homozygosity (XPEHH) comparing Faroese and British haplotypes, and identified significance cutoffs following the same approach described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> Any extreme positive values of this statistic indicate longer haplotypes at a focal marker in the Faroese cohort compared to the British cohort, while extreme negative values indicate the reverse. Therefore, positive values are indicative of selection signals in the Faroese cohort. Across both tests, we highlight 20 loci with the most extreme values for these statistics, serving as evidence of positive selection in the Faroese genomes at those loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>).</p><p id="P16">One signal that has been consistently observed across northern European populations is in the <italic>LCT</italic>/<italic>MCM6</italic> region, corresponding to positive selection for lactase persistence alleles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> Interestingly, this region showed strong iHS signals (|standardized iHS| &gt; 8) in GBR and was considered genome-wide significant in our analysis (minimum p = 5.95 x 10<sup>-19</sup>, q = 7.82 x 10<sup>-14</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), but the signal is weaker in the Faroese (|standardized iHS| &gt; 4) and was not considered significant in our analysis (minimum p = 3.57 x 10<sup>-6</sup>, q = 0.0118) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). To investigate the haplotype structure further, we plotted the decay in expected haplotype homozygosity (EHH)46 and haplotype furcation around one of the lactase persistence alleles (rs4988235; chr2_135851076_G_A) for the Faroese and British cohorts using the <italic>rehh</italic> package (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-D</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> The decay and furcation plots are centered around the focal marker, and a furcation occurs when unique haplotypes arise at an allele, similar to a tree splitting into branches. Thicker branches in the furcation plot indicate higher frequency of that haplotype in the population. Significant differences between the furcation patterns for an “ancestral” (reference) and “derived” (alternate) allele correspond to extreme iHS values and therefore are indicative of strong positive selection. For an alternative view of the region, we used <italic>Haplostrips</italic> to visualize the haplotype structure from chr2:135677850-135986443 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> From these plots, we observed far less diversity on the lactase persistence haplotype in GBR, consistent with a stronger selection signal. This may be explained by shared selection on the ancestral northern European branch followed by either relaxed selection for lactase persistence or population-specific drift in the Faroes after the population split from other northern European groups and settled the archipelago.</p><p id="P17">One of the top XPEHH signals in the Faroese WGS cohort included variants in <italic>SLC10A1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>), a sodium/bile acid transporter that plays a role in circulating bile salts to and from the liver and small intestine for the absorption of dietary fat and fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin D.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> SLC10A1 deficiency has been associated with familial hypercholanemia, or elevated concentrations of bile acids, which can lead to fat malabsorption and vitamin D deficiencies among other secondary health conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> Another top XPEHH signal included variants in <italic>POLQ</italic>, encoding for a DNA polymerase which plays a role in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> <italic>POLQ</italic> has been shown to be involved in various cancers in mice and humans, in particular skin, stomach, lung, breast, and colon cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Fine-Scale Structure and Connections to Ancient Genomes</title><p id="P18">Given that early Faroese settlers have documented historical relations to both Northern European Vikings and Northwestern European Celtic communities, we sought to study fine-scale genome-wide ancestry relationships between the sequenced Faroese genomes and publicly available ancient genomes from Iron Age and Viking Age Europe. We downloaded 616 ancient imputed genomes from Allentoft <italic>et al.</italic> 2024, spanning from the present-day to the late Bronze Age from Europe and focusing specifically on West- and North-Europe, including ancient Faroese genomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> We incorporated these genomes into a combined panel including our present-day Faroese dataset and used the software HaploNet to infer fine-scale population structure based on patterns of haplotype similarity across the genome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup></p><p id="P19">HaploNet identified five ancient sources, through unsupervised ancestry estimation. We then used HaploNet to model both ancient and present-day Faroese genomes as composites of any of the five ancestries through supervised ancestry estimation. We used the ancestral haplotype cluster frequency estimates from individuals not found in the Faroe Islands in order to estimate the admixture proportions of these sources in the European mainland. We used these admixture proportions to label the sources based on the locations in the map where these ancestries tend to be maximized in the Iron Age and Viking Age periods. The resulting labels were: “Steppe”, “East Europe”, “Levant and East Mediterranean”, “West Europe” and “North Europe”. For example, the ancestry labeled “West Europe” is maximized in individuals predominantly found in Celtic contexts (e.g. Roman and Iron Age Britain, Iron Age France) while the ancestry “North Europe” is maximized in individuals characteristic of historically Viking or pre-Viking contexts (e.g. Iron Age individuals from Denmark, as well as Viking Age individuals from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Estonia). However, we note there is no one-to-one correspondence between archaeological context and genetically inferred ancestry, and that many mainland individuals contain inferred ancestries from diverse sources. Indeed, Margaryan <italic>et al</italic>. 2020 showed that Viking-context individuals can derive ancestries from multiple Bronze and Iron Age sources across Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup></p><p id="P20">We then focused on the frequency of the ancestry sources in the Faroese individuals. We find that the present-day Faroese individuals are predominantly composed of roughly equal proportions of “West” and “North Europe” ancestry, while “East” and “South Europe” ancestries are detected at much lower frequencies. Present-day ancestry proportions are identical to those found in the Faroese ancient samples from the Sandur church site in Sandoy and dated to the 17th or 18th centuries based on their archaeological contexts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>).64 Margaryan <italic>et al.</italic> also sequenced a Faroese sample that was excavated from the á Bønhúsfløtu site in the village of Hvalbøur on Suõuroy, and was contextually-dated to be approximately 800 years old.

When plotting ancient European samples together with the Faroese samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), we observe that present-day Faroese individuals (circled in black) separate from the ancient Europeans along the second principal component (PC2), as do the older Faroese samples from the 17th and 18th centuries (circled in red). This perhaps suggests a bottleneck process that differentiates the 17th/18th-century and present-day Faroese from the rest of the ancient European samples, in concordance with the above ROH results. Notably, the 800-year-old sample of a Faroese individual with predominantly “West Europe” ancestry does not fall along the Faroese PC2 cline, suggesting that this individual might predate the bottleneck.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">Here we presented the first whole-genome sequence data from 40 minimally related individuals from across the Faroe Islands, a North Atlantic founder population. The Faroese have a high prevalence of several diseases in comparison to other European or global populations, several of which have been of particular interest in epidemiological studies of the region (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and ankylosing spondylitis).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> We investigated the frequency of HLA-B27 in the Faroe Islands, an allele which has been previously associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). We found that despite the observed high prevalence of AS in the Faroe Islands there was no evidence of increased HLA-B27 allele frequency compared to other European populations. However, a stop gain variant in <italic>SERPINB10</italic> was among those enriched in the Faroese cohort, and it may contribute to increased AS risk (rs138084090, AF = 2.5%). Rare variant analysis of this gene in the UK Biobank found that an independent stop gain variant in the same gene is nominally associated with increased AS risk (rs145346731, p = 2.5e-4), which was the most significant phenotypic association for the gene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup> <italic>SERPINB10</italic> is most highly expressed in neutrophilic metamyelocytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup> a cell type with disease relevance to AS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> <italic>CCDC168</italic>, another gene with a Faroese enriched stop gain variant had highly significant rare variant associations in the UK Biobank with corneal hysteresis and intraocular pressure (rs1361247423, p = 1.79e-57, p = 5.21e-13, respectively). Finally, a Faroese enriched stop gain variant in <italic>AGL</italic> identified in this study (rs113994128) has been previously reported as causing glycogen storage disease type IIIA in the Faroe Islands, which is estimated to have the highest prevalence of the disease world-wide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup> These findings emphasize the importance of further research into the role that unique genetic variation in the Faroe Islands may play in the incidence of diseases that, while common in the Faroes, have a global burden as well.</p><p id="P23">We found elevated amounts of the genome contained in long runs of homozygosity (ROHs) compared to other European reference cohorts, including another founder population from Finland. The higher proportion of the Faroese genome contained in these long ROHs suggests a stronger or more recent bottleneck in the Faroese population history. With the second phase of the FarGen study, a larger sample size will facilitate investigation into the timing and severity of the bottleneck(s). Additionally, founder populations such as the Finnish, have been a common focus for studies of founder events, genetic isolation, and the effects of haplotype sharing on aspects of human health and disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup> As such, the Faroese population may serve as another useful global reference for studying the influence of demographic history on genetic variation and trait architecture.

We found that many of the top selection signals were shared between the Faroese and British cohorts, which is unsurprising given the recent divergence between these two populations. We did find differences in the strength of these signals; for example, there is more diversity on the Faroese <italic>LCT</italic>/<italic>MCM6</italic> lactase persistence haplotypes. The lactase persistence allele rs4988235 (chr2_135851076_G_A) has been inferred to be under strong selection at least until the medieval period in northwestern European groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup> Patterson et al. 2021 found that the rate of increase in allele frequency may have slowed in recent periods; however, this does not exclude the possibility of continued or fluctuating selective pressure as this is consistent with the expected sigmoidal trajectory for an allele under ongoing selection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup> While the increased diversity on the Faroese lactase persistence haplotypes may be simply explained by populationspecific drift, this result could also indicate relaxed selection for lactase persistence alleles after settlement of the Faroe Islands, possibly due to changes in dietary habits in the new environment. The traditional diet of the Faroe Islands consisted of a higher reliance on animal and marine fats such as sheep tallow, whale blubber, and liver from codfishes, while dairy products such as milk and cheese, and particularly that from cattle, were more limited in availability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup> Based on the ancient genomes for which we have available data, we can attest that the selected variant at rs4988235 was present at high frequencies already in the 17th/18th centuries, and imputation further suggests the haplotype containing the allele to at least have been present in the islands 800 years ago.</p><p id="P25">We detected selection targets that were specific to the Faroese population using the XPEHH statistic with the British cohort as the comparison population. One top selection signal is in <italic>POLQ</italic>, which plays a role in DNA repair and various cancers. Without collecting relevant phenotypes or environmental factors, it is difficult to hypothesize what selection pressure may be driving the strong signal in <italic>POLQ</italic>, so this will be an important area of follow-up for future studies. In another top signal, we find <italic>SLC10A1</italic> which plays a role in fat and vitamin D absorption.

It is certainly possible that variants that have risen to high frequencies due to past or ongoing positive selection now play a role in health outcomes in modern populations. For example, the gene <italic>TBC1D4</italic>, which was shown to be under positive selection in the Greenlandic Inuit population likely due to a historical diet low in carbohydrates, has been associated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance in the same population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup> The prevalences of some diseases enriched in the Faroese population may be related to genomic regions under positive selection.

We found that present-day Faroese individuals have similar relative ancestry contributions from past “North” and “West Europe” Iron Age populations. The most ancient genome available from the Faroe Islands matches ancestry patterns found in Iron Age Wet Europe. This suggests that the “North Europe” ancestry may have arrived in the islands afterwards. This could have occurred either via a mixture of the original “West Europe” ancestry with individuals of predominantly “North Europe” ancestry, or a by replacement with individuals that were already of mixed ancestry at the time of arrival in the islands (the latter are not uncommon in Viking Age mainland Europe). Our analysis also suggests a bottleneck or a more progressive differentiation process in the islands relative to the mainland, which may postdate the most ancient Faroese genome currently available (approximately 800 years old). The most ancient Faroese sample from Margaryan <italic>et al.</italic> -composed almost entirely of “West Europe” ancestry -is a male individual found in a chapel-site in Suõuroy.
