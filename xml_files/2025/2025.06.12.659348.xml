Macrophages, fundamental components of these lesions, are crucial to TB pathogenesis, yet their phenotypic and functional diversity is incompletely understood. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence to profile macrophages in lung tissue and granulomas from a nonhuman primate model of early TB. We identified distinct subsets, including embryonic-origin tissue-resident alveolar macrophages and monocyte-derived alveolar and interstitial macrophages, with distinct spatial localization in granulomas. Tissue-resident alveolar macrophages and a subset undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition accounted for the highest frequency of Mtb-infected cells. Infected cells exhibited differential expression of immune- and migration-associated genes compared to uninfected counterparts, suggesting Mtb either induces or exploits these pathways as a survival strategy. These findings highlight macrophage heterogeneity as a major driver of differential susceptibility to Mtb and provide insights relevant to future immunomodulatory strategies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health challenge, causing over 1.3 million deaths annually despite continued efforts to improve treatment and prevention strategies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. TB begins when <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) is inhaled into the lungs, initiating immune responses that culminate in the formation of granulomas—complex immune cell aggregates that are the hallmark of the disease. These lesions can effectively limit bacterial replication or, paradoxically, serve as a reservoir for Mtb growth and persistence[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Macrophages are central to granuloma biology, acting as intracellular niches for Mtb, antimicrobial effectors that limit bacterial replication, and key regulators of the immune networks shaping granuloma functionality[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. However, the phenotypic and functional diversity of macrophage subsets within granulomas remains incompletely understood, and expanding this knowledge is critical for refining immunological correlates of protection and developing targeted TB interventions.</p><p id="P3">Multi-modal single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our ability to dissect complex population structures and cell-cell interactions within TB-affected tissues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. This technology has provided detailed insights into the immune cell composition of Mtb-infected nonhuman primate (NHP) lungs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], detailed the functional dynamics of granulomas following CD4 and CD8 T cell depletion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], and linked immune cell subsets to bacterial burden[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Although these studies revealed the presence of major diverse myeloid subsets in Mtb-infected NHP lungs, shedding light on pathways that influence macrophage differentiation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], they did not focus specifically on identifying macrophage subpopulations or their unique contributions to granuloma organization and host defense. Consequently, gaps remain in our understanding of which macrophage subsets facilitate or restrict Mtb growth, and how these subsets shape protective versus pathogenic outcomes.</p><p id="P4">Building on approaches used in murine models—which employed fluorescent fitness reporter strains to profile both host and pathogen phenotypes with high resolution, revealing how specific macrophage subsets are associated with distinct bacterial states and fitness levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]—we adapted a similar strategy for the NHP model of TB, where disease pathology more closely parallels human infection.</p><p id="P5">By using a virulent Mtb strain expressing the fluorescent protein mCherry and integrating immunostaining, flow cytometry, and multi-modal scRNA-seq analyses, we provide an in-depth understanding of macrophage phenotypes in early TB in NHP lungs by detailing the composition, spatial localization, and infection status of alveolar (AMs) and interstitial macrophages (IMs). We demonstrate that extravasating monocytes give rise to diverse macrophage subsets that drive the local immune response. Through the identification of novel subset-specific markers, we show that AM and IM subpopulations occupy distinct niches within caseous granulomas, and that monocyte-derived AMs (moAMs) exhibit pronounced inflammatory phenotypes in these lesions. Although multiple macrophage subsets harbor Mtb, we discovered a minor mesenchymal-like macrophage population that is disproportionately infected, identifying an opportunity induced or exploited by Mtb to subvert host immunity. Altogether, these findings provide a novel perspective on macrophage diversity and dynamics in the early stages of TB—an interval critical for shaping long-term disease outcomes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. By identifying key macrophage subsets and their interactions with Mtb, we provide a novel framework for targeting macrophage-specific pathways in granulomas with implications for improving therapeutic strategies for TB.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Animal ethics statement</title><p id="P6">All experimental manipulations, procedures, protocols, and husbandry for the non-human primate studies were approved by the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol number 20067350.

To explore the functional properties of AM and IM in NHPs lungs, we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on their differential transcriptomes (Supplementary Data 1). Consistent with previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>], GSEA revealed that AMs exhibited metabolic polarization towards fatty acid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation, pathways associated with tissue homeostasis but also implicated in facilitating Mtb persistence and replication[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].

Previous studies suggest that human CD14<sup>+</sup> and CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes extravasate into the lung and differentiate into diverse macrophage populations, including both AMs and IMs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. Using CITE-SEQ surface staining, we leveraged CD14 and CD16, markers of monocyte-derived cells, to show that most macrophages in infected NHP lung tissue were monocyte-derived, with the exception of tissue-resident alveolar macrophages (TR-AMs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> – <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Figure 4A</xref>).

This analysis identified 23 distinct gene co-expression modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>), many of which recapitulate the origin and function of specific macrophage subsets. In particular, one module consisting of 25 co-expressed genes was expressed in both monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MO-DCs) and a subset of cells within the “Early Monocytes” cluster, which we termed “Blood and Recruited Extravasating Monocytes” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, Supplementary Data 2).

From this juncture, monocytes follow one of two distinct routes: they either differentiate toward M2-polarized AM phenotypes (indicated by gray circles) or progress toward M1-like IMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). This bifurcation suggests that distinct microenvironmental cues within infected lung tissue guide monocytes into either an anti-inflammatory (M2) or a pro-inflammatory (M1-like) state during early Mtb infection.</p><p id="P42">To investigate the signals driving differentiation around branching point 1, we targeted cells near this bifurcation and analyzed their cellular dynamics and gene expression changes along the pseudotime axis. Six gene modules with unique expression profiles emerged near the split (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>; Supplementary Data 3). Module 1 is associated with early-stage monocytes, enriched for pathways regulating protein synthesis, RNA processing, and other homeostatic functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4D</xref>). Module 4, expressed by cells transitioning from early monocytes to branching point 1, is linked to immune activation pathways—cytokine signaling, Toll-like receptor cascades, TNFR1 signaling, and MyD88-independent TLR4 pathways—critical for early immune responses following infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4E</xref>). Module 3 extends from branching point 1 toward M1 macrophages (though some expression overlaps with M2 cells) and includes pathways connected to membrane trafficking, vesicle-mediated transport, receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (e.g., VEGF), and RHO GTPase activity, which mediate cell motility, survival, and proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4F</xref>). In contrast, Module 2 is associated with monocyte differentiation into monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages (moAMs), enriched for pathways linked to cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration (e.g., Rho GTPase, RAC1). Additionally, the expression of RORA and genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis suggests a transition toward tissue-resident, M2-like anti-inflammatory states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4G</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>].

Immunostaining revealed differential expression of canonical and alternative surface markers that distinguish monocyte-derived alveolar macrophage subsets (moAMs_1-moAM3) from tissue-resident alveolar macrophages (TR-AMs). Expression of CD206, a hallmark AM receptor, varied notably in moAMs depending on whether they originated from granuloma-containing or non-diseased lung tissue. This variability was mirrored by changes in CD63 levels, suggesting that moAMs undergo phenotypic reprogramming in response to localized inflammatory conditions within granulomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Figure 5B</xref>). Additional distinctions emerged from CD86 staining—a CD28 ligand indicative of antigen-presenting capabilities and immune activation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>]—which was predominantly expressed by moAMs, distinguishing them from TR-AMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).

This module exhibited a pro-inflammatory signature, encompassing genes involved in lysosomal and phagolysosomal functions (e.g., CTSB, CTSD, CTSL), antioxidant and iron metabolism (GPX1, ATOX1, FTL, FTH1, GSTP1), lipid metabolism and cholesterol efflux (APOC1, APOE), complement activation (C1QA, C1QB, C1QC, CFD, CD59), and IFN-γ/LPS responses (GLUT5, ADAMDEC1, AZU1, RARRES3, TMSB10, BRI3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 6B–C</xref>, Supplementary Data 6)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>]. This pro-inflammatory profile suggests that both TR-AM and moAM subsets in granulomas actively contribute to the inflammatory milieu. Trajectory and pseudotime analyses supported these findings by showing that group 6 cells converge on terminal fates corresponding to TR-AMs (fate 13) and moAMs (fates 9, 18, 20, 24) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p id="P51">We then focused on subpopulations reduced of lesser abundance in granulomas. Group 3 emerged as a distinct subset comprising only TR-AMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>). Two gene modules were associated with this group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>). Module 12 (49 genes) included factors that suppress NF-κB–mediated inflammation (PDLIM1, ENPP1, FHL1, NID1, SERPINE1, MCEMP1, GHR, WLS), calcium-activated enzymes (FER1L6, CACNB4, CACNA1D, ANO2), and mediators of actin-dependent processes and cell-cell interactions (LIMCH1, PCDH7, MYO6, MICAL3, AMOTL1, CDH1, CGNL1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5J</xref>; Supplementary Data 7)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R113">113</xref>]. In contrast, module 13 (212 genes) reflected the TR-AM–typical transcriptional signature found in non-diseased lung tissue, including PPARG, MRC1, PCCA, CD36, ABCG1, and LPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5G</xref>, Supplementary Data 8). Expression of CD101, a marker linked to regulation of T-cell activity via reduction of IL12RA and IL-2 secretion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R114">114</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R117">117</xref>], was lower in granulomas and present only in group 3 TR-AMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I–K</xref>). This decrease likely corresponds with increased macrophage activation and reduced numbers of anti-inflammatory TR-AMs in granulomas.</p><p id="P52">In summary, we identified two distinct TR-AM populations within granulomas: (1) group 6 TR-AMs, enriched in granulomas and displaying pro-inflammatory features, and (2) group 3 TR-AMs, reduced in granulomas and associated with lower pro-inflammatory activity. Despite these functional differences, both populations lacked CD14 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) and showed embryonic origins, as indicated by the absence of expression of the monocytic transcriptional signature identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>. These observations align with murine TB models showing pre-existing TR-AMs endowed with epigenetically driven pro-inflammatory potential in the lung prior to infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Interstitial macrophages increase expression of canonical pro-inflammatory signatures in granuloma and are located in proximity of the granuloma core</title><p id="P53">Focusing on IMs, we first characterized their transcriptional profiles in non-diseased lung tissue. As detailed previously, using scWGCNA, we identified two gene modules that were specifically expressed by this macrophage ontogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). The first module (39 genes) contained components essential for NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>; Supplementary Data 9). The second module (60 genes) reflected M1 macrophage polarization, harboring genes linked to LPS and TNF stimulation, such as TNFAIP2, POU2F2, IRAK2, RFTN1, SLC7A5, ACSL3, MX2, ARID5B, FOXO1, and IER3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Figure 6D</xref>; Supplementary Data 10)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R118">118</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R130">130</xref>]. Consistent with this pro-inflammatory profile, immunostaining confirmed the functional phenotype of these IMs, as evidenced by their expression of CD80 and CD1d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p id="P54">When we restricted our analysis to IMs within granulomas, we discovered a 63-gene module that, akin to non-diseased lung IMs, showed robust IL-1β expression and included genes linked to M1 pro-inflammatory polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>; Supplementary Data 11). A comparative analysis revealed that granuloma IMs showed increased expression of the macrophage regulome transcription factors IRF8 and IRF1. These transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>), activated by IFN-γ in a STAT1-dependent manner, modulate key transcriptional programs central to inflammation and antimicrobial defense mechanisms against Mtb[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R131">131</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R132">132</xref>]. Consequently, compared to non-diseased lung, granuloma IMs upregulated genes associated with pro-inflammatory cytokine production (e.g., EZH2, ACSL1, LITAF, ATF6, GADD45B, RIPK2) and phagosome/lysosome fusion and antimicrobial defense (e.g., PLEK, NKLAM, RARRES3, ZC3HAV1, AIM2, GBP1, STX11, NAPA, ATP6V1B2)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R133">133</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R146">146</xref>]. Additionally, they exhibited higher expression of genes related to glucose and glutamine/glutamate metabolism (e.g., GLUT3, ID2, PFKFB3, GBE1, GLS), consistent with the metabolic reprogramming towards glycolysis characteristic of M1 macrophages. This metabolic adaptation aligns with the critical role of glutamine/glutamate metabolism in promoting pro-inflammatory responses during TB[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R147">147</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R148">148</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>; Supplementary Data 12).</p><p id="P55">Immunostaining of granulomas confirmed the expression of IM-associated antigens, including GLUT3, IL-1β, and IDO1, in areas adjacent to the granuloma’s necrotic core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). Some IM antigens, such CD68, PPARG, and FTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>), were also expressed by pro-inflammatory AMs, suggesting these macrophages may undergo overlapping transcriptional programs during activation, despite residing in different microenvironments. In summary, IMs are abundant in granulomas and display specific pro-inflammatory profiles that distinguish them from IMs in non-diseased lung. Their antimicrobial phenotypes and metabolic reprogramming not only set them apart from alveolar macrophages but also suggest critical roles in mediating local immune responses against Mtb.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Mtb reside in multiple macrophage subsets during early infection</title><p id="P56">We next sought to identify which host macrophage populations are preferentially infected by Mtb during the acute phase of the disease and elucidate how Mtb infection influences macrophage function. To visualize the bacteria <italic>in situ</italic>, we stained for mCherry (Mtb) and used CD11c as a general macrophage marker. To better characterize infected cells, we also stained for perilipin-2 (plin-2), a protein expressed by foamy macrophages and linked to caseation in human granulomas[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R149">149</xref>]. While mCherry<sup>+</sup> Mtb were detected extracellularly in necrotic granuloma regions, consistent with previous findings in NHP granulomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], we also observed bacteria-rich cells at the granuloma’s outer edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>, regions 1, 2), where Mtb appeared as either singlets (region 1) or doublets (region 2) inside the cells. Phenotypically similar cells were also infected in non-caseous granulomas. Although plin-2<sup>+</sup> macrophages were proximal to Mtb-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>), mCherry<sup>+</sup>Mtb<sup>+</sup> macrophages themselves did not express plin-2. These findings confirm the presence of both extracellular and intracellular Mtb within NHP granulomas and show that infection extends beyond the granuloma’s myeloid core during early TB. This could reflect early dissemination from the granuloma.</p><p id="P57">To further define the phenotype of Mtb-infected cells, we compared the transcriptional profiles of infected and uninfected cells that were flow-sorted based on their mCherry fluorescence. Because most bacteria reside extracellularly in the caseum, only a small number of mCherry<sup>+</sup> cells were recovered by flow-sorting. After quality control, we retained n=511 mCherry<sup>+</sup> cells, revealing that TR-AMs were the most frequently infected subset in both granulomatous tissue (155 of 380 infected cells) and tissue without gross evidence for disease (50 of 131 infected cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Differential gene expression analysis of infected TR-AMs revealed upregulation of genes involved in negative modulation of innate inflammatory responses (ATG16L2, TFPI, SDC2, WLS, GPNMB, MARCH1, GDF15, CD9) and promotion of cell migration (ARHGEF28, MME, RAPH1, KDM3A, EXOC6B)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R150">150</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R162">162</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Figure 7A</xref>), alongside downregulation of ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7B</xref>; Supplementary Data 13).</p><p id="P58">When comparing the infected cell subsets, we identified a unique cluster within granulomas that showed significantly higher levels of Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). The cells comprising this population exhibited high expression of genes associated with adherens and tight junctions (e.g., cadherins, catenins, claudins, occludins), as well as adhesion- and polarity-related proteins (e.g., integrins, desmosomes), indicating a strong link to epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Their transcriptional profile paralleled cells undergoing epithelioid macrophage transformation (EMT macrophages), as described by Cronan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R163">163</xref>](Supplementary Data 14).</p><p id="P59">To validate this subset, we stained granulomas for IDO1, an IM-associated antigen, and ITGβ3, expressed by EMT macrophages in scRNA-seq. Immunostaining confirmed EMT macrophages as ITGβ3<sup>+</sup>, localized near the caseum-macrophage interface, interspersed with IDO1<sup>+</sup> IMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). scWGCNA analysis revealed a 66-gene module specific to EMT macrophages enriched for genes known to be associated with cytoskeletal organization, invasion, cell adhesion and positioning, and extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions (CTNNA3, PTPRD, SLIT3, EPHA6, CSMD1, SPOCK1, NRXN3, CNTN5, NAV2, CDH13, ERBB4, GRID2)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R164">164</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R174">174</xref>] (Supplementary Data 15). Macrophage mesenchymal migration only occurs in pathological conditions, where tissue destruction is supported by specialized cell structures called podosomes that facilitate infiltration into pathological tissues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R175">175</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R179">179</xref>]. We hypothesize that a similar transcriptional profile, enriched for pathways involving cytoskeletal organization, invasion and mesenchymal migration, would enable EMT macrophages to adopt an invasive mesenchymal-like state that facilitates their movement through TB-damaged lung tissue. Supporting this hypothesis, EMT macrophages expressed markers characteristic of mesenchymal and stromal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Figure 7C</xref>) and exhibited elongated morphologies, that differentiated them from the non-EMT macrophages in this granuloma region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>, right). Moreover, EMT macrophages co-expressed both classical macrophage and mesenchymal markers, suggesting the presence of sub-structure within this population. To investigate further, we isolated and re-clustered the transcriptomes of EMT macrophages and identified substructure in this population that separated non-transformed macrophages within this subset and macrophages strongly characterized by their mesenchymal/stromal transformation. The latter subset was characterized by upregulated expression of EMT-associated genes and a concurrent loss of classical macrophage markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Figure 7D and 7E</xref>). This phenotype was restricted to granulomas, and we found 57 of the 128 EMT cells recovered from granulomas were infected with Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p id="P60">Comparative transcriptional analysis between Mtb-infected and uninfected EMT macrophages revealed significant downregulation of genes critical for macrophage infection responses in infected cells, including ferritins (FTL, FTH1), actin sequestration (TMSB4X, TMSB10), and microtubule-stabilizing factors (TPT1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Figure 7G</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R180">180</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R183">183</xref>]. In addition, expression of VIM, which promotes inflammatory cytokine release and oxLDL-induced TNF and IL-6 secretion, was abolished in infected EMT macrophages[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R184">184</xref>]. Antigen presentation pathways were similarly downregulated as evidenced by MHCII (LOC102144039) and lysosomal enzyme saposin (PSAP) — essential for presenting lipid antigens to CD1d-restricted T-cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R185">185</xref>] — and cathepsins (CTSB). This transcriptional changes extended to IFN-γ-mediated responses, with reduced expression of CST3, which is critical for this pathway[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R186">186</xref>]. Other key genes, including AKAP13, an activator of NF-kB downstream of TLR2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R187">187</xref>], and SAT1, which plays a role in ferroptosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R188">188</xref>] were also downregulated (Supplementary Data 16). These data identify a novel pathway either induced or exploited by Mtb that would favor its survival and growth. Furthermore, EMT macrophages demonstrated reduced expression of lipid-metabolizing enzymes (APOC1, APOE), the MIF receptor (CD74), and the ECM receptor (CD44) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>). Altogether, these findings suggest that EMT macrophages might be metabolically and transcriptionally reprogrammed to create an environment permissive to Mtb.</p><p id="P61">Taken together, our results indicate that TR-AMs are the dominant infected subset in early TB, exhibiting muted immune responses. In addition, a granuloma-specific EMT process produces a unique macrophage population that appears highly susceptible to Mtb infection. The extensive transcriptional alterations in EMT macrophages, including the suppression of crucial antimicrobial pathways, suggest they may serve as key players in disease progression and represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S28" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P62">Macrophages play key roles in TB pathogenesis, yet their phenotypic and functional diversity within granulomas, and their interactions with Mtb <italic>in situ</italic>, are not well understood. We addressed this knowledge gap by combining multimodal scRNA sequencing with spatial visualization to identify novel aspects of macrophage biology in granulomas from Mtb-infected NHPs, a model that closely mimics human TB pathogenesis. We uncovered a diverse macrophage landscape within granulomas, comprising subsets of TR-AMs, moAMs and IMs in different polarization and differentiation states. We also identified TR-AMs and a novel subset of EMT macrophages as the cell populations most permissive to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection during the early stage of infection. These infected macrophages exhibited blunted antimicrobial responses, aligning with murine studies that suggest <italic>Mtb</italic> preferentially infects and replicates in permissive cell subsets in early infection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. The enrichment of these cells in early granuloma formation underscores the importance of understanding early host-pathogen interactions that may influence disease progression.</p><p id="P63">The interaction between macrophages and Mtb have been difficult to assess in humans and much of our current understanding comes from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, murine TB studies, and research on resected tissue from patients with severe or chronic TB. This approach has made it difficult to investigate key aspects of TB progression in humans including identification of which cells are infected within granulomas, where these cells are located within the granuloma’s spatial context, and how Mtb influences the functional state of these cells. Moreover, the early events in tissues prior to development of adaptive immunity are even less understood but could have significant implications for later stages of disease progression. To investigate those questions in early TB, we used an NHP model with human-like pathophysiology and infection with mCherry-expressing Mtb to visualize the bacteria <italic>in situ</italic> and to phenotype the Mtb-infected cells in granulomas. We found extracellular bacteria in caseum, as previously noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], and intracellular bacteria in both caseous and non-caseous granulomas. Further phenotyping of these cells revealed multiple subsets of Mtb-infected cells but also highlighted an apparent preference for TR-AMs as host cells. This finding is consistent with previous work in mice where TR-AMs were permissive for Mtb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R189">189</xref>] and suggests that even after acute Mtb infection, TR-AMs may play unappreciated roles in bacterial persistence, proliferation, and dissemination.</p><p id="P64">One of the more striking revelations of our work is the identification and characterization of an EMT-like process within a subset of granuloma macrophages, a phenomenon widely studied in cancer that has received little investigation in TB. Intriguingly, we found a high proportion of the Mtb-infected macrophages were undergoing EMT, which was characterized by increased expression of genes involved in cell adhesion, cytoskeletal remodeling, and extracellular matrix interactions. A further analysis comparing the infected to uninfected cells within this subset suggests that Mtb may be actively undermining macrophage defenses by downregulating immune functions. Alternatively, we may be detecting cells with preexisting immune deficits in which Mtb can persist and proliferate. Future work investigating this relationship, including at different stages of TB, will yield information on macrophage-centric factors the correlate with bacterial permissiveness in granulomas.</p><p id="P65">Our study provides a foundation for future research identifying the molecular mechanisms driving differential macrophage susceptibility to Mtb infection. Understanding the implications of these transcriptional alterations on macrophage functionality and the overall immune response to Mtb infection is needed because macrophage behavior directly influences bacterial containment, granuloma formation, and progression to active disease. Early alterations that impair macrophage antimicrobial functions or promote a permissive environment for Mtb can shape long-term infection outcomes and limit the efficacy of host-directed therapies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R190">190</xref>]. Expanding analyses to later infection stages and utilizing genetic or pharmacological interventions to modulate pathways identified in macrophages will be critical for verifying their contribution to Mtb pathogenesis and assessing their viability as targets for improving host resistance to Mtb infection.</p><p id="P66">Our study has limitations that need to be considered in the interpretation of our data. First, we focused on the early stage of disease in a NHP species that is before development of robust adaptive immunity and is permissive for Mtb replication. Considering that, we are examining granulomas prior to their segregation into protective and non-protective lesions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R190">190</xref>]; thus, we were not able to define macrophage subsets and lesion-level correlates of immunity. Future experiments investigating stages of the disease where granulomas are more restrictive for Mtb replication may improve our understanding of how granuloma macrophage function and population composition changes as immunity matures in TB. Second, our sample size was limited, and future studies with larger cohorts across different disease stages will provide a more comprehensive understanding of granuloma macrophage dynamics. Finally, while we identified novel transcriptional and spatial features of macrophage subsets, functional validation is necessary to confirm their roles in TB progression. likewise, we lacked the ability to determine if the differences we noted between macrophage infection status and immune function were based on cause-effect relationships driven by the bacterium or the Mtb-infected cells had pre-existing deficits in their antimycobacterial immune capacity that allowed us to detect bacteria in these cells. Future studies investigating macrophage responses <italic>ex vivo</italic> may provide insight into aspect of host-pathogen interaction in TB.</p><p id="P67">In conclusion, our study advances the understanding of the macrophage ecosystem in TB granulomas, revealing the phenotypic complexity of macrophage subsets during Mtb infection in NHPs and identifying potential processes that Mtb exploits to improve its survival. This research provides a basis for future work aimed at developing targeted interventions against TB. The diversity in macrophage responses, especially the distinct functions of moAMs and TR-AMs, emphasizes the importance of nuanced therapeutic strategies. These strategies should account for the different roles and states of macrophages in the Mtb-infected lung.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS206949-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d41aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The Authors acknowledge Jamie Tomko, Carolyn Bigbee, and the Flynn Lab technician and veterinary teams for their contributions to the NHP studies.
