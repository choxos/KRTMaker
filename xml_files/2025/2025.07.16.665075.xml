This necessitates the development of multimodal sensors capable of simultaneous measurements without interference between measurement modalities. Guided mode resonance (GMR) biosensors are highly sensitive to refractive index changes and well suited to out-of-plane optical coupling, but have not previously been implemented in a multimodal configuration. Here, we present the electrochemical guided mode resonance (EC-GMR) sensor, a Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> GMR photonic grating integrated with an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode that enables concurrent optical and electrochemical sensing. Finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations show that the resonance wavelength of the GMR shifts as a function of ITO thickness and applied bias. These findings are validated experimentally using EC-GMR devices fabricated with a range of ITO thicknesses. We demonstrate that the EC-GMR achieves a refractive index sensitivity of 84.4 nm/RIU while simultaneously measuring the double-layer capacitance. To highlight its multimodal capability, we characterise the optical and electrochemical responses of methylene blue, a widely used redox reporter in biosensing. By integrating photonic and electrochemical modalities in a compact format, the EC-GMR platform provides critical analytical information beyond that which could be obtained from a traditional single-modality sensor. This approach extends the analytical utility of GMR sensors and represents a robust, adaptable solution for diverse biosensing applications, from clinical diagnostics to environmental monitoring.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">A comprehensive understanding of biological systems for diagnostic and research purposes requires untangling a system of complex molecular interactions. The majority of biosensing techniques are “single domain”, relying on a single method of transduction such as optical, electrochemical or mechanical, limiting the total information that can be extracted and the range of biological interactions that can be investigated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Multi-domain sensors combine multiple transduction techniques to simultaneously probe different elements of a biological interaction increasing the amount of information obtained compared to single domain biosensors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. A recent area of interest in multimodal sensing has been the combination of electrochemical and photonics biosensors. The integration of these modalities allows simultaneous measurement of refractive index and charge transport to extend the range of the interactions that can be detected and the richness of analytical information that can be obtained. For example, a sensor that combines photonic and electrochemical transduction can interrogate both protein ligand interactions through the associated change in refractive index, alongside electrical characterisation of surface immobilised enzyme activity that cannot be measured with a single domain sensor alone for example in antibiotic binding and enzymatic turnover of β-lactam antibiotics by β-lactamase enzymes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, the integration of the electrochemical and the photonic domains not only allows us to combine information contained within the two, complementary measurements, but also to actively perform electrochemistry simultaneous with optical characterisation, for example to provide insight into electrochemical processes such as the role of redox active signalling in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation or to permit electrochemically driven surface modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The most established electrochemical and optical multimodal technique is Electrochemical Surface Plasmon Resonance (EC-SPR). EC-SPR uses the Au surface of the SPR sensor as the working electrode and integrates standard counter and reference electrodes for performing electrochemical measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The multimodality of the EC-SPR has been used for the parallel detection of glucose and IgG using a surface functionalised with a mixed layer of glucose oxidase and anti-IgG, where the glucose oxidase activity was monitored electrochemically and the binding of IgG detected optically through the SPR angle shift <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Electrical control of the surface charge afforded by EC-SPR can also be exploited to improve the performance of SPR detection compared to single modality devices <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. EC-SPR also provides additional value over single modality sensors when applied to electron transport processes that regulate cell growth and viability of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">In contrast to the metallic materials used in plasmonic sensors such as SPR, photonic biosensors are typically fabricated in loss-less dielectric materials. It is thus necessary to integrate a conductive material such as transparent conductive oxides or conductive polymers into the structure to add the electrochemical modality. This approach to combining electrochemical and photonic modalities is employed in electrochemical optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (EC-OWLS) and Fibre based lossy mode sensors (LMR). EC-OWLS has been used to characterise the electric-field mediated surface-adsorption of proteins and charged polymers such as poly-L-lysine, and to probe the activity of surface immobilised redox-active molecules such as cytochrome c <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,</sup>. EC-OWLS however requires high-quality He-Ne lasers, precise control over the angle of incidence, and facet out-coupling of the detected signal, making them less suitable for cost-effective implementations and environments with high levels of mechanical or optical noise. Electrochemical LMR has been used to characterise electropolymerisation of isatin, a drug precursor compound, using a combination of cyclic voltammetry and optical measurements of the change in refractive index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. The issue with LMR is that its optical response under applied bias voltage has been shown to be dependent on both the properties of the cladding and of the surrounding electrolyte <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, so it is difficult to extract photonic and electrochemical information independently.</p><p id="P7">We have previously demonstrated an electrophotonic silicon biosensor using a doped optical ring resonator that supports both optical sensing and electrochemical measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In a DNA hybridisation assay, only the combined optical and electrochemical signals confirmed the conformational change of a redox-labelled DNA hairpin. Optical detection alone lacked sensitivity, while the electrochemical signal was not uniquely attributable to the structural change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>These exemplars clearly demonstrate the value of simultaneous electrochemical and optical measurements, yet several challenges remain preventing their wider adoption. First, electrically induced resonance shifts in EC-SPR and LMR sensors complicate parallel electrochemical and refractive index measurements, as the shifts cannot be attributed solely to refractive index changes during voltametric scanning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Although this effect can optically track electrochemical processes, true multimodal integration requires the signals to be independent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Second, quantitative validation of both refractive index sensitivity and electrochemical response, across faradaic and non-faradaic system.is needed to fully demonstrate the technique’s potential, which, to our knowledge, has not yet been achieved. Finally, a key technological limitation with existing multimodal biosensing technology such as EC-OWLS is the requirement for complex and sensitive measurement apparatus for both sensing modalities, which often precludes their use for applications where portability or mechanical robustness are critical.</p><p id="P8">We recently demonstrated a biosensor platform based on photonic guided mode resonances (GMR) which offer the same evanescent wave sensing principle and performance of SPR without the need for complex instrumentation. Moreover, the entire device (GMR sensor, optical system and control electronics) can be implemented in a small and robust, instrument reducing sensitivity to mechanical vibrations such as those in industrial manufacturing systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Electrically tunable filters using GMR surfaces have been previously demonstrated but there has been no work to date on combining optical and electrical sensing modalities using a GMR biosensor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.When combined with low cost potentiostat electronics, an electrochemical GMR sensor has the potential to be a highly robust and economical multimodal sensing platform <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">A GMR sensor is a 1D periodic sub wavelength grating, which acts as both a diffraction grating and a waveguide. The guided mode is scattered at the grating interfaces and by tuning the grating parameters including thickness, period and filling fraction, deconstructive interference between the 0<sup>th</sup> order and guided mode results in a high reflectance peak at the resonance wavelength <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. The resonance wavelength is dependent on the local refractive index (RI) within 200 nm of the sensor surface. When functionalised with selective biomolecules, such as antibodies, the change in RI at the GMR surface that occurs following formation of the antibody–antigen complex is detected by the corresponding change in resonance wavelength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. GMR sensors have also been used for cell sensing such as bacterial biofilm formation and adherence in response to antibiotics and spatially resolved signalling protein secretion in hepatocyte cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">Here we present electrochemical GMR (EC-GMR), a multimodal GMR sensor with an integrated ITO working electrode that can be used for parallel optical and electrochemical sensing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). We explore theoretically the influence of an ITO layer on the GMR resonance and electric field distribution for the resonant mode and how modulation of the accumulation layer refractive index at the ITO media interface affects the E-GMR resonance. We then fabricated the proposed structure, in order to experimentally determine the relationship between optical resonance and applied bias voltage. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of the multimodal EC-GMR sensor by performing refractive index sensing in parallel with electrochemical measurements. In particular, we show that the sensor is capable of supporting quantitative measurements of both Faradaic and non-Faradaic electrochemical processes alongside parallel quantitative measurements of local refractive index which, when combined, provide critical analytical information beyond what is possible form a single-modality. Together, our data lay the foundation for future applications of this combined optical-electrochemical sensor in basic and applied biochemical research.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>Simulation of a functional hybrid ITO Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> EC-GMR biosensor</title><p id="P11">To verify that a GMR structure can still support a resonance when coated with a uniform and continuous film of ITO, we performed finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations on a GMR structure consisting of a 150 nm thick Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> grating with 555 nm grating period and 80% filling fraction. The glass substrate and media layers were assumed to be infinite. Firstly, we simulated the GMR structure with increasing thicknesses of ITO from 0 – 100 nm. To account for a potentially non-conformal coating of the ITO, we varied the ITO thickness on the sidewalls of the GMR trenches following deposition. The sidewall thickness was varied from 10 - 50% of the thickness deposited on the top of the grating.</p><p id="P12">We observe that the structure is theoretically capable of supporting the TE mode of the resonance for all thicknesses of ITO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2 a</xref>) and displays the asymmetry of the Fano line shape due to coupling of the Bragg reflectance and the Fabry Perot thin film resonance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> As the ITO thickness increases, the resonance wavelength for the TE mode increases from 810 nm at 0 nm ITO thickness to 890 nm for a 100 nm thick ITO layer. The Q factor also theoretically increases with ITO thickness due to increased confinement of the electric field within the grating structure. The electric field intensity in an ITO coated grating is confined within the centre of the structure and in the trenches of the grating, showing a strong overlap with the ITO in the centre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Increasing the sidewall coverage of the ITO further increases the resonance wavelength for all thicknesses, as expected by increasing the effective refractive index experienced by the resonant mode (Fig supplementary 1).</p><p id="P13">To investigate how the resonance changes due to electrically induced electron accumulation/depletion within the ITO layer, we simulated a 60 nm thick layer ITO with 40% infilling of the trenches and assuming a 1 nm thick accumulation region at the interface between the ITO and surrounding media. Here, the RI of the accumulation layer was changed (from 1.5 to 3 RIU) to simulate the shift in RI due to applied bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The resonance is still supported as expected and the peak resonance wavelength, λ<sub>res</sub>, increases linearly with refractive index of the accumulation layer at 2.9 nm/RIU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). This suggests that calibration of the electrically induced resonance would be required for parallel optical and electrochemical measurements. It is important to note the overlap between the ITO accumulation layer and the resonant electric field is much greater for the TE mode compared to the TM mode, which will contribute to a greater resonance wavelength change (Fig supplementary 2). FDTD simulations demonstrate that the resonant mode within the GMR is robust to the addition of an optical lossy high refractive index material and therefore viable as a multimodal biosensing platform.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>EC-GMR Fabrication</title><p id="P14">The grating structure was fabricated using electron beam lithography and RIE to etch the grating into a 150 nm thick Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> layer deposited onto a glass substrate. ITO is then deposited on top of the grating by electron beam evaporation. Electron micrographs of an ITO-coated GMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) reveal ITO deposition on the top of the grating and on the sidewalls. Moreover, the ITO within the grooves of the grating has greater thickness and surface roughness than that on the top of grating. All of the samples fabricated showed a single resonance peak in the 800 - 900nm region when illuminated with a broadband white light source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The resonance wavelength increases with ITO thickness as predicted by simulations (Fig . <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>) due to the increase of the effective index of the structure. The EC-GMR is theoretically capable of supporting the TM mode but it was not observed in any of the structures that were measured.</p><p id="P15">Simulations also predicted an increase in Q factor with increasing ITO thickness, as the propagation length of the mode will be reduced by the optical losses introduced by the ITO. In contrast, experimentally we observed a broadening of the resonance with increasing thickness of ITO and a subsequent decrease in Q factor compared to the uncoated Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> grating (0 nm thick ITO in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). This is most likely caused by light scattering due to the inhomogeneity of the ITO film which introduces many additional randomly orientated surfaces from which the guided mode can scatter.</p><p id="P16">Hyperspectral imaging of an uncoated Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> grating shows that the resonance wavelength is consistent across the entire grating, with a standard deviation of only 1.02 nm in resonance wavelength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> left). In contrast, the standard deviation of the resonance wavelength in the ITO coated EC-GMR is 1.54 nm, over 50% greater than the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> grating. Moreover, the resonance is inhomogeneous across the grating, with areas of high and low resonance contributing to the overall broadening of the reflectance peak, again likely associated with inhomogeneities within the evaporated ITO film (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> right).</p><p id="P17">To evaluate the replicability of the EC-GMR fabrication process, five different EC-GMRs with a 60 nm thick ITO layer were fabricated using identical processes. The optical characteristics of these EC-GMR sensors in terms of the resonance wavelength and Q factor are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary table 1</xref>. The fabrication process consistently results in EC-GMR sensors that successfully support an optical resonance. The resonance wavelength for these five sensors was seen to vary by 5.2%. We note, the absolute resonance wavelength is not critical for the application of the EC-GMR as a biosensor as measurements are typically performed relative to the initial resonance wavelength.</p><p id="P18">FDTD simulations indicated that the optical resonance of the EC-GMR is influenced by the application of bias voltages, as has been observed in many combined electro-optical techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. To measure the effect of bias voltage on the EC-GMR, we monitored the resonance wavelength of a 60 nm thick ITO coated EC-GMR while applying increasing negative bias voltage to the ITO layer in 100 mM KPi buffer at pH 7.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Here, electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode cell configuration using a Pt wire counter electrode and the ITO as the working electrode which was biased relative to a Ag/AgCl reference electrode.</p><p id="P19">The wavelength was seen to be stable up to a voltage of -0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl, after which the resonance wavelength was seen to shift to lower wavelengths up to a maximum applied voltage of -1 V vs Ag/AgCl where the resonance wavelength had reduced by 0.35 nm. The ITO surface is negatively charged at pH 7.2 resulting in a Stern layer of predominantly positively-charged potassium ions at the ITO surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> which will further increase when a negative bias is applied to the ITO. This high surface concentration of positively charged ions at the ITO-electrolyte interface will induce accumulation of electrons at the ITO surface. From the Drude model, the permittivity of the ITO is dependent on the free electron carrier density, such that the accumulation of electrons at the ITO surface will reduce the permittivity of the ITO and consequently lead to the observed negative resonance wavelength shift. The simulations of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref> predicted a linear relationship between resonance wavelength and the refractive index of the accumulation layer, however we observe a voltage window (between 0 and -0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl) where the resonance wavelength is stable. This may relate to the counteracting processes of bias driven depletion of electrons from the ITO and the accumulation of positive charge on the surface from ions in the media.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Electrical and Optical Refractive Index Sensitivity</title><p id="P20">To quantify the refractive index sensitivity of the EC-GMR, a GMR sensor capped with a 60 nm thick ITO layer was integrated into a bespoke PDMS flow cell and exposed to solutions containing an increasing concentration of NaCl (0.1% to 20% w/v in ddH2O). The resonance wavelength increases with NaCl concentration, starting at 889.5 nm for 0.1% NaCl and increasing to 892.5 nm for 20% NaCl, reflecting the increasing refractive index of the solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 a</xref>). The bulk RI sensitivity was determined to be 84.4 nm/RIU a with a limit of detection (LOD) of 4.4× 10<sup>−3</sup> RIU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 b</xref>). Previous GMR gratings have been reported which have a bulk sensitivity in the range of 84-140 nm/RIU<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. The relatively low optical performance is likely due to the reduced Q factor associated with optical scattering from the ITO layer. Improving the surface quality of the ITO and using improved fitting procedures such as Kalman filtering projection is likely to improve LOD in the future<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">Cyclic voltammetry was performed simultaneously to quantify the electrochemical double layer capacitance. The voltage was scanned between 0 to -0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl over which range the bias induced shift in resonance for a EC-GMR coated with a 60 nm thick ITO layer was negligible (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). The absence of redox peaks over this voltage range and the symmetry between the anodic and cathodic currents indicate that we are measuring the non-Faradaic current associated with charging the double layer capacitance only rather than charge transport across the electrode-electrolyte interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 c</xref>).

This loss in sensitivity is however offset by the gain of the entirely new electrochemical modality which has not been reported before using GMR structures.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Decoupling surface adsorption and quasi electrochemical behaviour of redox active molecules by multimodal sensing</title><p id="P27">Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the EC-GMR to characterise both the refractive index and electrochemical properties of a solution of redox active molecules in parallel. We focus here on methylene blue (MB), a pH sensitive redox active molecule that reduces to leucomethylene blue in a 2 electron 1 proton process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and has become a widely used redox reporter in applied and basic biomedical research, including microRNA detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> DNA damage reporting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> antibiotic susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, eukaryotic cell viability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and aptamer antigen detection assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. MB is an attractive redox active reporter because of its chemical stability, electrochemical reversibility, pH sensitivity and unambiguous redox potential compared to the electrochemical background observed on typical electrode materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. However, the electron transfer process is dependent on buffer properties, such as pH, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> surface chemistry and on the voltametric techniques themselves which can regulate the mechanism of electron transfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. It thus remains challenging to deconvolute each of these contributions using electrochemical measurements alone. Here we show how greater insight into the redox activity of MB can be provided by combining the complementary information revealed by the EC-GMR multimodal sensor.</p><p id="P28">The EC-GMR reflectance spectra show an increase in optical reflectance with concentration of MB due to the higher reflectance of MB solutions in the near infrared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). We also observed an increase in resonance wavelength with increasing concentrations of MB corresponding to the increase in solution refractive index. The fitted resonance wavelength increased exponentially with increasing concentrations of MB, increasing by 0.45 nm between the KPi electrolyte and 1 mM MB in KPi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The LoD of the EC-GMR for the detection of MB is 60 µM, showing a slight improvement over existing evanescent field methods for the detection of redox molecules such as MB and with a larger dynamic range <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">CV measurements at each MB concentration from 1 µM to 1 mM were performed simultaneously with the optical measurements, demonstrating that the EC-GMR is able to support refractive index sensing in parallel with Faradaic processes as required for electrochemical measurements of redox active molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 c</xref>). While the redox peaks can be determined for MB concentration between 1 mM and 100 µM using CV (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), the large, non-Faradaic background current masks the reduction and oxidation peaks at lower concentrations. The anodic and cathodic redox potentials, <italic>E</italic><sub>pa</sub> and <italic>E</italic><sub>pc</sub> respectively, show good agreement with previously published values for MB in phosphate buffer using an Ag/AgCl reference electrode <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. The shift in peak potential and peak width with increasing MB concentration is likely due to the change in the buffer, such as pH and conductivity, that occurs upon addition of high concentrations of MB.</p><p id="P30">From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>, we find that the separation between oxidation and reduction peaks for MB is 49 mV and 81 mV at 1 mM and 100 µM respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). This is greater than the theoretical ideal peak separation expected for a two-electron redox reaction of 29 mV. Differences in the peak separation values are typically attributed to either the resistance of the working electrode limiting electron transfer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> or physisorption of MB on to the ITO surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Moreover, as the redox reaction for MB is reversible, the peak reduction current, <italic>I<sub>c</sub></italic>, is expected to increase linearly with voltage scan rate. In contrast, here we observed that at low scan rates, the relationship is non-linear. This known phenomenon is attributed to either a quasi-reversible electrochemical reaction or to surface adsorption on the electrode, Critically, the explanation for the observed deviations from the theoretical ideal cannot be reconciled from the electrochemical measurements alone (a more detailed explanation is provided in the supplementary information).</p><p id="P31">To explore if the combined optical and electrical measurements can reconcile the observed differences from the ideal redox behaviour of the MB system, we measured the λ<sub>res</sub> change and the corresponding CV profile of 100 µM MB in the pH range 6-8. As the MB redox reaction is a 2 electron, 1 proton process, the resulting voltammograms are expected to shift with pH, as can be clearly observed by the increase in redox potential with respect to increasing pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). We observe non linearity with respect to root of the scan rate for all observed pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>) However, the charge of the MB will also change over this pH range, becoming increasingly less positively charged until around pH 8 when the MB will become charge neutral and thus hydrophobic, leading to greater physisorption on the EC-GMR sensor surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Evidence of MB physisorption is found in the shift in λ<sub>res</sub> (normalised to the resonance wavelength of the electrolyte) which increases with pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>), and is indicative of an increase in local refractive index that would be expected due to surface adsorption of MB. The ability to decouple surface adsorption from the electrochemical behaviour of the MB demonstrates clearly the complementary information that can be obtained from a multimodal measurement as the non-linearity can be attributed to apparent quasi electrochemical behaviour of the molecule, likely due to non-ideal electron transfer between the molecule and the electrode. We note, the insensitivity of the resonance wavelength to the solution pH does open opportunities of using redox active labels as pH sensors while performing simultaneous refractive index measurements.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P32">In this study we have presented the EC-GMR, a guided mode resonance biosensor with an ITO electrode capable of performing simultaneous optical and electrochemical measurements. We have shown that guided mode resonances can be theoretically supported in structures containing optical lossy materials such as transparent conductive oxides and that the resonance can be observed experimentally for the TE mode. The resonance wavelength is stable below -0.6 V of applied bias for a 60 nm ITO film which affords independent optical and electrochemical measurements. We have characterised the optical and electrical sensitivity and shown that while the optical sensitivity is lower than previously reported GMR structures we can also perform quantitative measurements of the electrochemical double layer within 10% of the expected theoretical predictions. Finally, we have demonstrated that the EC-GMR can be used for monitoring redox processes while performing optical measurements giving rise to the potential for simultaneous measurements of redox active reporter molecules in parallel with optical surface binding measurements. We believe that the parallel combination of quantitative electrochemical measurements and optical sensing using the robust low cost GMR platform will open novel opportunities for the interrogation of complex biological systems such as monitoring of bacterial biofilm adhesion combined with detection of redox quorum sensing molecules or enzymatic degradation of antibiotics by drug resistant bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Design and Simulation</title><p id="P33">The numerical modelling of the nanostructures was performed using a Finite difference time domain (FDTD) method with commercially available FDTD software (Lumerical FDTD Solutions).

The Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> layer was assumed to have a uniform refractive index of 1.89 with the loss factor assumed to be negligible. The ITO layer was modelled as an continuous layer, with a uniform thicknesses on the top and in the troughs of the grating, whilst the thickness of the ITO on the sidewalls was varied as a percentage of the total ITO thickness.

For accumulation layer simulations, a minimum mesh step of dz = 0.5 nm was used, so as to accurately resolve the layer.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>GMR Fabrication</title><p id="P34">150 nm Si3N4 wafer on borosilicate glass (Silson) was diced into 15 x 15 mm squares (Disco DAD-321 wafer saw, Giorgio Technology), cleaned by sonication in acetone and iso-propyl alcohol (IPA) then dried under nitrogen gas. A layer of positive electron beam resist (AR-P 6200.13, All Resist) was spin coated onto the wafer at 5000 RPM then baked at 180 ⍰C for 7 minutes.

After development the sample was hardbaked for 15 minutes at 150 ⍰C. An antiadhesion layer was formed by placing the master in a vacuum chamber alongside a drop of Trimethylchlorosilane on a petri dish for 15 minutes. The channel dimensions were 1 mm wide, 10mm long and 100 µm high. The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) channel was made by mixing the silicon elastomer and curing agent at a 10:1 ratio. The PDMS was poured onto the mould and then degassed in a vacuum chamber for 15 minutes until all of the bubbles in the mix had been removed. The PDMS was baked at 60 ⍰C overnight then removed from the mould, cut to size using a scalpel and then hole punched to allow access to the fluidic tubing. To adhere the PDMS channel to the ITO surface, the sensor and the channel were treated with O<sub>2</sub> plasma (22 SCCM of O<sub>2</sub> for 25 seconds at DC voltage of 180V). The PDMS was then aligned to the GMR substrate and the assembly was baked at 60 ⍰C overnight to permanently seal the PDMS to the sensor surface. After bonding, tygon tubes were inserted into the holes punched in the PDMS. Samples were flushed through the channel using a syringe pump operating at 20 µl min<sup>−1</sup>. For electrochemical measurements, the Pt counter electrode and Ag pseudo reference were placed in the waste receptacle for the PDMS flow cell drain tube.
