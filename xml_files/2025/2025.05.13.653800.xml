However, the fragmented ecosystem of available OoC systems leads to wasted resources and collaboration barriers, slowing uptake. To address this, there is a need for OoC platforms based on interoperability standards, modularity, and reconfigurability. Technology platforms based on open designs would enable seamless integration of diverse OoC models and components, facilitating translation. Our study introduces a modular microfluidic platform that integrates swappable modules for pumping, sensing, and OoCs, all within the ANSI/SLAS microplate footprint. Sub-components operate as microfluidic building blocks (MFBBs) and can interface with the demonstrated Fluidic Circuit Board (FCB) universally as long as the designs adhere to ISO standards. The platform architecture allows tube-less inter-module interactions via arbitrary and reconfigurable fluidic circuits. We demonstrate two possible fluidic configurations which include in-line sensors and furthermore demonstrate biological functionality by running both in-vitro and ex-vivo OoC models for multiple days. This platform is designed to support automated multi-organ experiments, independent of OoC type or material. All designs shown are made open source to encourage broader compatibility and collaboration.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>organ on chip</kwd><kwd>modular</kwd><kwd>integrated sensing</kwd><kwd>standardization</kwd><kwd>open access</kwd><kwd>starter</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Organ-on-Chips (OoCs) are advanced cell culture systems within controlled microfluidic environments. OoC research aims to replicate human physiological conditions more accurately for disease modelling and drug testing. Since their inception in 2010, OoC systems have evolved to include multi-organ systems and enhanced physiological realism, needing further capabilities in environmental control, sensing, actuation, and automation.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]</sup> With the increasing complexity of OoC systems, there is a strong emerging need for flexible, general architectures that can accommodate a variety of biological models and experimental setups. While both academic and industrial efforts have addressed the need for integrated micro-physiological systems, the lack of coherence leads to trade-offs in model complexity, throughput, and interoperability.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]</sup> This incompatibility impedes the development of innovative OoC models and hampers their operation and implementation in relevant end-user settings.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]</sup> Therefore, platforms based on modular design and standardized integration principles, such as those seen in the electronics industry, will be necessary to promote rapid innovation and future impact of OoC models.</p><p id="P3">Typical OoC studies rely on peripherals for functionalities like perfusion, parallelization, and sensing. However, traditional OoC systems often use peripherals from closed commercial ecosystems which include application-specific functionalities<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]</sup>. For example, platforms have been designed to cater to a particular OoC model <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]</sup>, incorporate multiple OoCs on a single chip through monolithic integration<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]</sup>, support transwell-based models by employing specialized interfacing manifolds on fluidic boards<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]</sup> or even offer fully integrated and self-contained solutions<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]</sup>. The diverse integration strategies adopted by these companies adds complexity and cost to the process of designing cross-compatible modules. Moreover, these highly specific and gatekept solutions limit translation across labs unless all labs make a similar investment in the same ecosystems, thereby increasing the capital required to conduct OoC research. While these closed ecosystems can offer a higher level of user-friendliness, the lack of modularity and inter-compatibility creates its own barrier to entry, especially for researchers with unique experimental needs.</p><p id="P4">Several custom platforms have been shown to offer more flexibility in integrating varying OoC models and sensors. However, these platforms typically offer low-throughput and limited external compatibility. For example, platforms have explored plug-and-play connections<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]</sup>, but the diversity of commonly-used microfluidic interconnection methods typically limits the use of the platforms to the founding labs. Multiplexed systems improve throughput<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]</sup> but still rely on expensive peripherals and complex control systems, limiting scalability and broad adoption across research labs. As a result, despite various novel and creative solutions<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]</sup>, a universal integrating platform is yet to be reported. Standardized design guidelines are a first step towards universal interoperability, generating the opportunity to unite users, developers, and manufacturers in shared use of a custom OoC platform that has extended reach in the field. The ISO 22916:2022 ‘Microfluidic Devices’ standard provides a coherent framework to enable interoperability between microfluidic components<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]</sup> from different sources. This paves the way to address the need for universal modular multi-OoC platforms that can perform automated experiments within commonly used lab workflows.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]</sup></p><p id="P5">One example of implementation of ISO 22916 relies on the concept of utilising a Fluidic Circuit Board (FCB) with the ANSI/SLAS standardized footprint<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]</sup> of a microplate as the central fluidic manifold. Individual Microfluidic building blocks (MFBBs) with ISO-compliant footprints and port positions are connected to the FCB, resulting in a modular integrated platform. Dekker et al. have shown an initial catalogue of commercial components converted into ISO-compliant MFBBs.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]</sup> In the application domain of OoC, this concept of integrating standardized MFBBs and FCBs resulted in an open platform termed the ‘Translational Organ-on-Chip Platform (TOP)’<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]</sup>. Even though the ISO standards were not always strictly followed in these earlier platforms, the first conceptual implementations of TOP have demonstrated strong promise. For example, Vivas et al. demonstrated how commercial components can be combined with a custom Heart-on-Chip device for automated perfusion through an FCB<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]</sup>. De Graaf et al. demonstrated perfusion of 12 vessel-on-chips (VoC) on a FCB with controlled wall shear stress and circumferential strain<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]</sup>. Vollertsen et al. used similar interconnection and design principles with multiple highly multiplexed chips to demonstrate 192 individually controlled cell culture experiments on a modular platform.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]</sup></p><p id="P6">In all of the initial implementations of TOP, external peripheral equipment was still required to control the flow and pneumatic actuators. Moreover, they relied on a ‘hard-wired’ single fluidic circuit, which limited flexibility in experimental design. To enable broader uptake of TOP, it will be important to provide a set-up that does not rely on external peripheral equipment, is compatible with existing tissue culture workflows and can be adapted for use in many different applications. In short, we identify a strong need for a standalone, reconfigurable platform that supports a broad range of OoCs, sensors, and actuators and explicitly invites stakeholders’ adoption in the field.</p><p id="P7">This work presents STARTER - a TOP-based, standardized, modular, and reconfigurable microfluidic platform that integrates OoCs, sensors, reservoirs, and pumps from diverse manufacturers and materials. We demonstrate that the platform is standalone, combining three OoC devices with pumping and in-line sensing, all within a microtiter plate footprint. The platform’s architecture includes a ‘routing block’ that allows for complete reconfiguration of the fluidic circuits, enabling parallel, combined, or custom perfusion of the OoC devices. By adhering to ISO 22916, the platform ensures that compliant MFBBs can interface universally, whether commercially available or fully custom-designed. The specific port pitches and footprints of the MFBBs used in this work are openly documented. All design files for STARTER are publicly available in an open-source library, allowing the community to reproduce or build upon this work. This open-source approach aims to foster collaboration, to align research efforts in OoC, and to encourage wider industry adoption of standardized approaches.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><label>2</label><title>Design</title><p id="P8">The STARTER platform is designed to be a standalone and flexible implementation of TOP to facilitate realization of a more diverse set of applications. This is achieved by dictating the fluidic circuits using the architecture of the FCB and a specific MFBB we refer to as ‘routing block’. The ‘routing block’ serves as a central hub where channels from all other modules are connected as required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). This strategy offers freedom in deciding interactions between various MFBBs and reconfigurability of the whole system by replacing a single MFBB. Together, the FCB and the routing block lay the foundation of a flexible architecture that facilitates multiple operation modes even with a fixed set of MFBBs.</p><p id="P9">The architecture opens up the possibility to utilize various MFBBs in custom configurations. In this work, the selection of MFBBs is catered towards a generic OoC experiment and aims to showcase the types of MFBBs that can be integrated into STARTER for such applications. Furthermore, this particular set of MFBBs can combine within the footprint of the FCB to enable fully automated and standalone experiments with only a 12 Volt power adaptor as a peripheral. The concept of being-stand-alone is not limited to these specific MFBBs however and can be implemented with other MFBBs with similar functionalities.</p><p id="P10">We also publish detailed designs of our MFBBs and FCB to provide insight for other developers to design OoC technology with ISO 22916 compatibility in mind (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). ISO 22916 specifies guidelines regarding the external footprint and fluidic port locations of an MFBB. In particular, this ISO allows port positions to be specified on a 1.5 mm grid and the footprint dimensions to be specified in increments of 15 mm<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, ISO 22916 allows a wide range of port and footprint selections, offering freedom to module developers while imposing common-sense constraints. In this work, we further streamline our design process by following the TOP Design Rules (TDRs), a publicly available set of ISO 22916 compliant footprints and port locations. This set is available online and all the MFBBs shown in this work are compliant with the TDRs<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]</sup>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> summarizes the MFBBs utilized in this work.</p><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Components</title><sec id="S4"><label>2.1.1</label><title>Fluidic Circuit Board</title><p id="P11">The FCB has a footprint of 127.75 mm × 85.5 mm, which makes it compatible with microtiter plate holders. MFBBs can be connected from the top or bottom side and are interconnected via 400 μm square channels in the FCB. All MFBBs connect to 400 μm diameter fluidic ports in the board connected to the channels in the FCB, with the locations of the ports on the FCB precisely matching those of the MFBBs. The layout is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, along with the schematic of the architecture in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>. Leak-free connections are made using O-rings recessed into the board that act as gaskets around the fluidic ports. The MFBBs are fastened onto the board using screws and nuts. The board has cut-outs that function as imaging windows or access points for inserts, depending on the type of the OoC. The FCB is either made of poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) or cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) depending on if it is made in-house for iteration purposes or fabrication is outsourced to third-party suppliers.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.1.2</label><title>Routing Block</title><p id="P12">All ports on the platform are fluidically connected via the FCB to a single module called the ‘routing block’. The routing block is located in the central region of the FCB and completes all fluidic circuits to dictate the fluidic routing between all MFBBs on the board. This enables complete reconfigurability of all the fluidic circuits on the platform by just replacing the routing block. The routing block has a 105 mm × 15 mm footprint and connects to the bottom of the FCB.</p><p id="P13"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows two examples of different circuit configurations realized on the platform and corresponding routing blocks. However, this reconfigurability is not limited to the examples shown here. Together, this FCB architecture and routing module offer the flexibility of realizing a highly customizable set of fluidic circuits on the platform.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>2.1.3</label><title>Pump Block</title><p id="P14">This MFBB enables fluidic circulation on the platform. The pump block is comprised of six commercial peristaltic pumps driven by a custom printed circuit board (PCB) that houses an onboard Arduino. This enables wireless control of the pumps over low-energy Bluetooth (BLE). The electronics and pumps are integrated into a 105 mm × 30 mm block that connects with the FCB, powered by a single power cable. The pumps have a flow rate range of 0.18 μL/min to 180 μL/min using medical-grade PharMed tubing. The pumps and the tubes are housed in a PMMA baseplate that converts the entire block into an ISO-compliant MFBB. The tubes make a leak-free interface with the baseplate mounted to the FCB.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><label>2.1.4</label><title>Sensor Blocks</title><p id="P15">The FCB can integrate three 15 mm × 15 mm MFBBs, which can be chosen for in-line sensor blocks. This work shows a flow sensor and optical pH sensor module, both adapted from existing off-the-shelf products. The flow sensing module is built by making custom manifolds around a commercial thermal flow sensor chip. The pH module integrates a commercially available optical pH sensor spot into a microfluidic channel of a 15 mm × 15 mm MFBB. The pH module is designed so that an optical fiber aligns exactly above the location of the sensor spot.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><label>2.1.5</label><title>Various Organ-on-Chips</title><p id="P16">Compatible OoC MFBBs have a footprint of 30 mm × 30 mm and port location as specified by the TDRs. This FCB accommodates OoCs with 8 ports (4 inlets and 4 outlets) that can reversibly interface with the board via a clamp. Overviews of different OoC materials have been reported along with their specific applications <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]</sup>. Yet, no platform prior to this work has demonstrated interfacing with OoCs of different make, organ types, and materials. Here, we first use PDMS chips closed with coverslips as example OoC devices. This particular PDMS OoC has two wide outer channels and two narrow channels used for endothelial cell culture to form a VoC model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>). The broader outer channels are designed to act as ‘worst case’ design in terms of bubble formation and accumulation and can be used to technically monitor bubbles during extended operations. In addition to the PDMS chips, previously reported Intestinal Explant Barrier Chips (IEBC)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]</sup> were adapted according to the TDRs to conform to a 30 mm × 30 mm MFBB footprint. This enabled the integration of the 3D-printed OoCs onto the platform via the same clamps used for the PDMS devices. However, the types of OoCs compatible with the platform are not limited to these two particular examples, as the strategy of clamping OoCs onto the FCB is agnostic to the OoC material and architecture.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><label>2.1.6</label><title>Reservoir Blocks</title><p id="P17">The reservoir block stores the liquid that circulates between the OoCs, pumps, and the sensors. The platform allows the attachment of 3 reservoir MFBBs at once, each having a footprint of 30 mm × 15 mm. Each block has 4 ports distributed between two reservoirs per MFBB. This, therefore, amounts to 6 reservoirs on the platform. The reservoirs can have varying designs based on volume requirements and customizations. In this work, we showcase 3D-printed reservoirs as well as ISO 22916 compliant MFBBs built around commercially available reservoirs.

This is also a differentiating factor compared to previously reported TOP platforms that used Vitron O-rings<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]</sup>. Our choice of O-rings makes this platform universal to various MFBB materials, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The screw arrangements are designed so that each MFBB can be detached from the FCB independent of the other MFBBs. This is especially useful in preparing the platform for perfusion experiments, where the priming of the platform and the initial culture of the OoC can be done independently. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>) The cultured OoCs can be swapped on and off the platform without generating bubbles at the fluidic ports. This is possible due to the hydrophobicity of the chosen O-rings which allows the port to retain a hanging drop when an OoC is removed. The hanging drop enables liquid-liquid connection when reconnecting the already filled OoC, allowing bubble-free swapping of the OoC.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><label>3.2</label><title>Microfluidic Operation</title><p id="P19">As previously mentioned, the fluidic circuits of STARTER can be reconfigured by replacing the routing block and to demonstrate this, we show two specific configurations along with the fluidic routing.

The OoCs used are made of PDMS and bonded with coverslips (as described in section 2.5), each OoC consisting of 4 individual channels corresponding to 4 inlets and 4 outlets. The pumps are distributed to perfuse two channels per chip to perform identical parallel and isolated operations of the 3 OoCs. Two channels of each OoC are connected to a pump and reservoir, and one channel out of these two channels has the possibility of an in-line sensor. The experimental validation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>, where red food dye is circulated in isolated loops at a flow rate of 27 μL/min. A variation of this configuration was used to perform cell culture experiments.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><label>3.2.2</label><title>Combined Operation</title><p id="P21"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref> depicts the fluidic circuit that combines parallel and series operation within the 3 OoCs. The OoCs, reservoirs, and pump block are the same as described before, with the only change being a different routing block. In this fluidic circuit, each OoC has one channel under isolated circulation (red) and one in combined circulation (green). For the series circuit, liquids from two reservoirs (blue and yellow) get mixed in the routing block before flowing into the inlet of the first OoC (right) through a MFBB that serves as a non-functional substitute for a sensor. The outlet of this channel from the first OoC is connected to the inlet of the next OoC channel (middle), which similarly connects to the inlet of the third OoC (left). This is visible as the green color being perfused through the channels connected in series (right to left in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). This configuration utilizes 5 pumps and 6 reservoirs and is visualized using the respective food dyes as depicted in the schematic. The flow rate applied is 27 μL/min, and the mixing flow rate variations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><label>3.2.3</label><title>Sensor measurements</title><p id="P22">The platform has the capability to integrate three 15 mm × 15 mm sensor modules. Here, we demonstrate two sensors that can be applied in an OoC experiment. First, a commercial thermal flow sensor is converted into a module and used to characterize the pump block. It is also used to measure the flow rate variations over time for different flow rates. In addition to the flow sensor, a commercial optical fiber based sensor is integrated to showcase the capability of utilizing optical in-line sensors. In this case, a pH sensor is integrated and characterized before applying it during a cell culture experiment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16"><label>3.3</label><title>Flow Sensing</title><p id="P23">The pumps in the pump block are characterized over a flow range of 0.5-120 μL/min, as this was the measurement range of the selected flow sensor. The sensor measures the flow rate variation for a particular pump frequency, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>. This flow variation is then averaged to obtain average flow rates at specific frequencies. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref> shows the measured average flow rates with respect to specific operating frequencies. An almost linear relation between the pump frequency and flow rate was observed. The monitoring of flow variation can be particularly useful for experiments where change in flow rates is critical. Furthermore, by running two peristaltic pumps with each other, we show mixing capabilities and also obtain a concentration gradient. This is demonstrated by mixing blue and yellow colors to obtain different shades of green by varying the ratio of the respective flow rates. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). We also compare the flow rate variation of two pumps running together against the isolated pump performance.

PBS was used as a reference to check for drift before and after pH solutions varying from 6.0 to 8.0 in steps of 0.5 were flowed through at a flow rate of 27 μL/min. pH of room temperature and pre-incubated cell medium was also measured. The pH sensor readout was observed to be more accurate around pH 7.0 and had a maximum deviation of 0.2 pH at pH 6.2. No drift was observed over 3 hours. Finally, these pH sensor spots were used to monitor the pH on two platforms over a 3-day cell culture.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18"><label>3.4</label><title>Biological Experiments</title><sec id="S19"><label>3.4.1</label><title>Vessel-on-chip perfusion</title><p id="P25">The platform was tested for compatibility with automated cell culture experiments. A VoC was selected as an example OoC system as they are known to benefit from recirculating unidirectional medium flow. For this experiment, the middle channels of the previously described OoCs were perfused in isolated loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a i</xref>). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured under continuous flow conditions of 1 μL/min for 3 days on the platform showed characteristic cobblestone morphology, a cortical filamentous actin pattern, and expressed endothelial cell marker vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, indicative of a healthy endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a ii</xref>). Two platforms were used during the experiment – one with 3D-printed reservoirs and one with commercially available reservoirs. It was observed that the cells performed better in terms of cell coverage with commercial reservoirs compared to the 3D-printed reservoirs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 a iv</xref>). This difference is suspected to be due to leaching of the 3D printed resins on exposure to daily fluorescence imaging but is comparable to additional controls with pro-inflammatory stimulus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). Furthermore, the OoCs on the platform with commercial reservoirs were identical to control OoCs that were not connected to the FCB and under slow bidirectional perfusion on a rocking platform. No significant pH change was measured over the course of the cell experiments, with both platforms showing pH 7.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a iii</xref>). This demonstrates the platform’s suitability for microfluidic OoC experiments traditionally perfused with rocking platforms or external pumps.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><label>3.4.2</label><title>Intestinal explant barrier chip (gut-on-chip) culture</title><p id="P26">To further showcase the versatility and translatability of the platform, IEBCs were integrated into the platform. The IEBC allows perfusion on both sides of a scaffold with intestinal tissue, thus enabling the possibility of conducting gut permeability assays. Freshly obtained porcine gut explants were inserted into the chips after the channels were primed using the platform. Flow rates of 33 μL/min were applied at either side of the explant tissue for 24 hours. The reservoirs were sampled at fixed intervals (3, 4, 23, and 24 hours) and checked for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) secretion from the tissues to determine cellular viability. The concentration of LDH produced by IEBCs on the platform was then compared to control IEBCs perfused via the standard setup<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]</sup>. The results confirmed proper tissue viability in both setups with a similar profile over the entire course of the experiment.</p><p id="P27">Furthermore, tissue barrier function was confirmed in both setups by measuring the transport of atenolol, a low permeability compound that translocates across the intestinal barrier paracellularly. Results showed that transport in both setups was again comparable, with low transport of atenolol across the intestinal barrier, confirming intact tight junctions. Notably, transport in both setups was significantly lower than that in control IEBCs without tissue included. We, therefore, showcase comparable performances of established IEBCs on the platform, which features a much more compact footprint (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>) and offers possibilities for future sensor integration and customization.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S21"><label>4</label><title>Conclusion and Outlook</title><p id="P28">In this work we introduce STARTER, a stand-alone, modular reconfigurable platform based on TOP and demonstrate its versatility for designing and carrying out OoC experiments. STARTER accommodates both tissue culture insert-based and microfluidic channel-based OoC models, agnostic to the substrate material. Pumps, reservoirs and sensors are all integrated within an ANSI/SLAS microplate footprint enabling dynamic monitoring of automated multi-OoC experiments in a compact portable package. The fluidic circuits can be customized as per requirements, thus offering experimental freedom with the integrated modules. Demonstrations of mixing and metering, pump characterization and sensor characterization highlight the technical capabilities of our integrated system. To highlight the applicability of STARTER’s versatility in OoC experiments, both in-vitro and ex-vivo studies were performed. As an exemplar in-vitro experiment, HUVECs were cultured over the course of 3 days in a vessel-on-chip model with continuous pH monitoring. The results confirm similar cell numbers and coverage to controls while revealing difference between 3D-printed and commercially available reservoirs. Furthermore, ex-vivo experiments were conducted in previously reported OoCs on STARTER over 24 hours. Cell viability and barrier function of a porcine gut explant was assessed and shown to be comparable to controls in the traditional setup. These results showcase the advantage of STARTER in reducing experimental footprint, adding functionality and versatile integration without compromising on biological performance.</p><p id="P29">The design of STARTER is complaint with ISO 22916 and specifically the TOP Design rules (TDRs) which is a specific implementation of ISO complaint footprints and port layouts. A wide variety of modules become eligible for integration as long as the port locations and footprints adhere to these standardized design guidelines. In this work, we showcase a few possible module combinations along with a general strategy for the implementation of the standardized designs in modular microfluidic systems. The list of components used in this work as well as design files are all made freely available in an open source environment - <underline>GitHub - TOP-OoC/Starter-Kit</underline>. These openly accessible resources will serve as a ‘STARTER kit’ for easier adoption and implementation by developers at this nascent stage of standardizing modules. Additional resources such as ISO explainer documents, TDR guidelines and an automated fluidic routing tool (<underline>MMFT Routing Block Channel Router</underline>) are also available. The fluidic routing tool is developed by collaborators in Technical University of Munich (TUM) with renowned experience in design automation<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]</sup> and is especially useful in designing routing blocks for customized applications. These resources aim to lower the threshold of adoption of standardized designs, particularly in the field of OoC.</p><p id="P30">The architecture of STARTER can serve as a foundation for generic platforms aiming to add perfusion to existing modules in a portable footprint. The ability to have a standalone and reuseable platform makes it truly translational. However, implementing STARTER in external lab settings is a key next step in validating the translatability, design choices, interfacing and robustness of the platform. A natural progression for wider adoption would involve simplifying the mechanical connections to improve useability. This will particularly benefit time constraining and space restricted workflows. Future work on reducing electrical connectors is also of vital importance. As the number of integrated sensors increase in a compact form factor, the web of cables running to these sensors can cause congestion and hamper useability. A method to further integrate the electronics and sensor read-out on the platform will enhance ease-of-use while benefiting from an already matured electronics industry. Integration of valves in the routing block would enable active re-programmability of the platform compared to the current method of replacing the block itself. This will allow further possibilities of multiplexing, pumping and fluidic operations on the platform.</p><p id="P31">Dissemination of the benefits of standardized designs also becomes vital to ignite adoption by component developers. The ISO 22916 standard could harmonize international academic and commercial entities, initiating an interoperable market. The benefits of the ISO standard is not limited to module developers alone, the growing ecosystem of complaint components can be used by system designers to realize custom platforms for their specific applications. In a wider perspective, a generic open-source platform tackles fundamental obstacles in the industrial adoption of MPS systems, as emphasized by various global committees.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]</sup> Standardized design principles enable the development of tailored OoC models and platforms with integrated automation, facilitating rapid iteration of more novel and complex models. An OoC model developed for a standardized platform such as STARTER has the potential to be adapted for high-throughput systems that follow the same standards in the future <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]</sup>. This translational capabilities not only strengthens collaboration but also supports continuous improvements informed by user feedback and preferences. This approach can bridge the gap between academia and the pharmaceutical industry by first validating experimental models on generic platforms, then enabling their scaled automation once validated. Therefore, embracing an open-source approach fosters collaborative development of solutions aimed at enhancing robustness, reproducibility, and technical maturity, ultimately facilitating future regulatory approval processes.</p><p id="P32">In conclusion, we introduce a novel generic platform designed for stand-alone multi-OoC experiments, with in-line sensing and fluidic reconfigurability capabilities. The versatility of the architecture combined with a reversible and material agnostic integration strategy makes STARTER suitable for a wide range of applications. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first application of standardized designs on a universal platform capable of accommodating diverse OoC models from multiple suppliers. The applications extend beyond OoC experiments demonstrated in this work and can include module testing, quality control, benchmarking, integration tests, and automated microfluidics, all within a portable form factor. The open access dissemination of resources will foster broader collaboration and contribution of new designs from the community. Eventually, we expect that development, testing and implementation of new OoC applications will be strongly accelerated, both in the setting of early R&amp;D and in commercial product development. The paradigm of open-source design represents a significant breakthrough in efficiency and innovation by creating a precompetitive domain in a field that has been converging towards ‘point solutions’ and proprietary platforms. The boom in development, validation and testing of OoCs will, in-turn stride towards the ultimate objective of wider adoption of micro-physiological systems.</p></sec><sec id="S22" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>5</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S23"><label>5.1</label><title>Assembly</title><p id="P33">The MFFBs and clamps were connected to the FCB using M2 nuts and bolts. 40° shore-A silicone O-rings (Gteek) with dimensions 1.02 mm × 0.74 mm were recessed at the locations of the fluidic ports.
