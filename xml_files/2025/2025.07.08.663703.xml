Recruitment of Mre11 to meiotic DSB sites depends on Rec114-Mei4 and Mer2 (RMM) that organize the meiotic DSB machinery by a mechanism involving biomolecular condensation. Here, we explored the role of Mre11 during meiosis and its relationship to RMM condensation. We show that both Mre11 and MRX complexes form DNA-dependent, hexanediol sensitive condensates <italic>in vitro. In vivo</italic>, Mre11 assembles into DNA damage-dependent foci in vegetative cells and DSB-independent foci in meiotic cells. <italic>In vitro</italic> condensates and <italic>in vivo</italic> foci both depend on the C-terminal intrinsically-disordered region (IDR) of Mre11. Importantly, while the Mre11 IDR is dispensable for vegetative DNA repair it is essential during meiosis. The C-terminus of Mre11 forms a short α-helix that binds a conserved region of Mer2, and mutating residues within this interface reduces Mre11 foci and DSB formation. Finally, we identified a SUMO-interacting motif within the Mre11 IDR that enhances recruitment of Mre11 during meiosis and facilitates DSB formation. This work identifies multiple mechanisms that collaborate to recruit Mre11 during meiosis to initiate recombination.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cells continuously experience exogenous and endogenous stress leading to cytotoxic lesions such as DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.

Meiotic DSBs are generated by the highly conserved type II topoisomerase-like protein Spo11 that acts in a consortium with several accessory factors, referred to as DSB proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the nine known DSB proteins include Rec114-Mei4 and Mer2. These RMM proteins are proposed to assemble into nucleoprotein condensates along meiotic chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> that act as sub-cellular compartments that recruit other DSB proteins to stimulate DNA cleavage by controlling Spo11 dimerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. This condensation model provides a mechanism that ties DSB formation to the loop-axis organization of meiotic chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, DSB formation also depends on the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. In addition, MRX initiates the resection of DSB ends in both meiotic and mitotically cycling cells, through the endonuclease and exonuclease activities of Mre11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.

The Mre11 C-terminus was previously shown to be required for meiotic DSB formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> and was recently found to bind Spo11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. We demonstrate that the C-terminus of Mre11 also binds directly to Mer2 and contains a SUMO-interacting motif that also facilitates its recruitment to DSB sites. Thus, our work delineates multiple mechanisms whereby the Mre11 C-terminal tail specifically promotes meiotic DSB formation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mre11 and the MRX complex assemble DNA-dependent condensates in vitro</title><p id="P7">During meiosis and in mitotically cycling cells exposed to DNA damage, budding yeast Mre11 forms numerous foci visible by immunofluorescence microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, Mre11-Rad50 complexes have been shown to form higher-order assemblies on DNA, mediated by Rad50 oligomerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. However, whether Mre11 itself participates in the assembly of higher-order structures has not been established.</p><p id="P8">To investigate the biochemical properties of Mre11 and the MRX complex, we purified Alexa488-labeled Mre11 and MRX complexes with an eGFP tag at the N-terminus of Mre11 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A and S2A</xref>) and asked whether they undergo condensation <italic>in vitro</italic>. In the presence of plasmid DNA, we found that Mre11 and MRX form large clusters visible by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A and 1C</xref>). While foci were almost absent when DNA was omitted, low concentrations of DNA led to few foci of very high intensity, suggesting that the limited number of DNA molecules provide nucleation points for Mre11 to agglomerate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). Time-course analysis showed a progressive increase in foci number and intensity over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>); and protein titration revealed a steep increase in foci intensity above 200 nM Mre11 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>). A similar concentration-dependent increase in foci intensity was also observed for MRX condensates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). Mre11 and MRX condensation was also promoted in the presence of crowding agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E and 1F</xref>). Mre11 condensation was enhanced in the presence of divalent metal ions, likely through charge neutralization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To address whether the condensates are reversible, we assembled condensates for 20 minutes and treated the reactions with DNase I. While nuclease treatment strongly reduced the numbers of Mre11 and MRX foci, the minority of Mre11 foci that resisted nuclease treatment tended to accumulate more protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B and 1D</xref>). This observation is consistent with the idea that, following initial nucleation by DNA, Mre11 and MRX condensates grow primarily through protein-protein interactions.</p><p id="P10">To further test this interpretation, we asked whether Mre11 and MRX condensates are sensitive to 1,6-hexanediol, an aliphatic alcohol that often dissolves biomolecular condensates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Ten-minute treatment with 5% hexanediol led to a strong reduction in foci intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1G and 1I</xref>). Similarly, brief exposure to 500 mM NaCl strongly reduced foci intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1H and 1J</xref>). Hence, Mre11 and MRX nucleoprotein condensates are stabilized through a combination of ionic and weak hydrophobic interactions.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The C-terminal IDR of Mre11 is required for condensation</title><p id="P11">Mre11 consists of an N-terminal phosphodiesterase domain, a capping domain followed by a Rad50 binding domain, and a C-terminal tail, predicted to be largely disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. The last 15 residues form a short, conserved helix.

In contrast, deleting the disordered region (residues 524-677, Δ<italic>IDR</italic>) or C-terminal 49 residues (residues 644-692, Δ<italic>C49</italic>) strongly reduced Mre11 foci intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Similarly, <italic>mre11-ΔIDR</italic> mutants were as resistant to MMS or CPT as wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).

When Mer2 and Mre11 condensates were first assembled separately on a DNA substrate and then incubated together prior to imaging, we observed nearly absolute colocalization between the two proteins, supporting the hypothesis that Mer2 condensates recruit Mre11 through direct protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p id="P21">When these experiments were performed with the Mre11-ΔC49 truncation and wild-type Mer2, we observed strongly reduced colocalization as compared to wild-type Mre11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting that the C-terminus of Mre11 is important for interaction with Mer2. While C-terminus of Mre11 does not form condensates independently, in the presence of Mer2, it forms a halo-like structure around Mer2 condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). This suggests that the interaction between Mer2 and the Mre11 C-terminus provides a nucleation site that is sufficient for further Mre11 recruitment through self-association.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The C-terminus of Mre11 binds a conserved motif of Mer2</title><p id="P22">To delve deeper into the interaction between Mre11 and Mer2, we used AlphaFold2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> to model interaction between Mre11-C49 and a Mer2 tetramer (previously defined as the Mer2 oligomeric state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. AlphaFold produced a model in which the terminal α-helix of Mre11 is positioned close to the N-terminal end of the Mer2 coiled coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>).
