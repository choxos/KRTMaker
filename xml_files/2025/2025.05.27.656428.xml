PNGaseF is the most well-characterised enzyme of this family and is widely used in glycobiology to allow study of the N-glycome of a specific protein, cell and tissues, for instance. Despite this, PNGaseF has limitations in the types of N-glycan structures it can target. In this study, we explored the specificities of six uncharacterised PNGases selected from diverse parts of the PNGaseF superfamily. One of these enzymes, PNGaseL from <italic>Flavobacterium akiainvivens,</italic> is the highlight of this study due to its very broad specificity exemplified by its ability to cleave mammalian-, plant- and invertebrate-type complex N-glycans as well as high-mannose N-glycans. A detailed biochemical and structural characterisation was carried out against a variety of substrates to illustrate the advanced capability of PNGaseL in comparison to the canonical PNGaseF and PNGaseA enzymes. To determine the optimal reaction conditions, assess stability and define limitations of PNGaseL, a series of validation studies was performed. The data reveal that PNGaseL has potential utility in a range of glycobiology applications that are superior to the current commercially available options.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>N-glycans</kwd><kwd>PNGase</kwd><kwd>nutrient acquisition</kwd><kwd>chromatography</kwd><kwd>crystal structures</kwd><kwd>modelling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">N-glycans are common posttranslational modifications to mainly eukaryotic proteins, particularly on secreted proteins, and have a variety of roles including protection from degradation and cell-to-cell communication. A pentasaccharide core (Man3GlcNAc2) is ubiquitous to all eukaryotic N-glycan structures, but elongation of this core structure is categorised into three types: high-mannose, complex and hybrid, which combines features of both other types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. High-mannose N-glycans have highly conserved structures across organisms, although the number of mannose sugars per glycan may vary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In contrast, complex N-glycan structures vary significantly between kingdoms and there are characteristic decorations recognised for mammals, plants and invertebrates, for example<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. ‘N-glycome’ studies have also revealed heterogeneity in terms of the variety of N-glycan structures attached to individual proteins at different sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">One of the main classes of enzymes that target N-glycans are Peptide:N-glycosidases (PNGases) that hydrolyse directly between N-glycan and protein, and several different enzymes have now been described with specificity towards different types of N-glycans and the state of the protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. There are currently two major groupings of PNGase enzymes – PNGaseF and PNGaseA, where the “F” and “A” represent <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> and almond, respectively (<italic>Flavobacterium meningoseptica</italic> was later renamed <italic>Elizabethkingia meningoseptica</italic>). PNGaseF and A are broadly associated with prokaryotes and eukaryotes, respectively. In prokaryotes, these enzymes are used to remove N-glycans from proteins to use as a nutrient source and are typically localised to the cell surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. PNGaseA enzymes expressed by eukaryotes usually act intracellularly to recycle N-glycans. The putative PNGaseA enzymes found in prokaryotes are largely from the Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria phyla. Putative PNGaseF enzymes found in eukaryotes are largely associated with marine and aquatic organisms, such as fish, oysters, starfish, sea cucumbers, and algae.</p><p id="P4">In glycobiology studies, one of the main enzymes used is PNGaseF as it has a broad specificity for mammalian-type N-glycan structures and well-established protocols exist for its application<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The specificity of this enzyme, however, is limited to N-glycans without α1,3-core fucose, so it cannot act on plant or invertebrate-type glycans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. PNGaseA, conversely, can remove N-glycans with an α1,3-core fucose, but its preference for N-glycans attached to only a short peptide presents another disadvantage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In this study, we characterise six new PNGase enzymes from the PNGase F superfamily, focussing on candidates from microbes that are not associated with being mammalian commensals or pathogens. This includes a PNGase from eukaryotic origin. We demonstrate that one of these, PNGaseL, exhibits very broad specificity and high potential for biotechnological applications.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Bioinformatics analysis and identification of target enzymes</title><p id="P5">1897 PNGaseF sequences (IPR015197) were downloaded from InterPro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.

The catalytic modules were all predicted to be two eight-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet structures sitting side-by-side, akin to published PNGase enzyme structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The accessory modules, however, varied between the different enzymes. PNGaseDo has three β-sheet modules, which likely have linker or carbohydrate binding roles. This arrangement of modules, where the final module is positioned above the active site of the catalytic module has been observed previously, for example a GH20 β-GlcNAc’ase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and a GH29 α-fucosidase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The module positioned over the active site likely has a substrate binding role and siphons substrate towards the active site. PNGaseCg has an α-helix running up the back of the catalytic module (orange), which is connected to a module (“P”) comprised of both α-helices and β-sheets and is a module associated with proteases. P module is also positioned over the active site, so could possibly be binding substrate. PNGaseRz has a β-sheet module that is connected to the catalytic module via a small α-helix. This accessory module is positioned away from the active site and is reminiscent of the N-terminal bowl-like (NBL) accessory module from PNGaseF TypeII from <italic>Elizabethkingia meningoseptica</italic> and B035DRAFT_03341<sup>PNGase</sup> from <italic>Bacteroides massiliensis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The role of this module is unknown, but in all cases these accessory modules could orient the catalytic module to face outward from the bacterial cell and towards potential substrates. PNGaseL has a small β-sheet module at the C-terminus, which could also possibly interact with substrate. The PNGaseLl structure is a catalytic module and a flexible linker, again likely facilitating the enzyme to project away from the bacterial cell wall. PNGaseDr has a similar modular organisation to PNGaseCg, with an α-helical spine and possible binding modules positioned over the active site. Notably, PNGaseL and PNGaseDo have C-terminal T9SS secretion signals, so these enzymes are likely secreted by their respective organisms.</p><p id="P15">The genetic context of the genes encoding the PNGases was also considered, as genes encoding complementary functions are often grouped together, especially in bacterial genomes. Most of these genes were orphans, but the gene encoding PNGaseRz is likely part of an operon encoding putative enzymes with probable activity against N-glycans: α-fucosidases, an α-mannosidase, a glycoside hydrolase 18 family member, and an asparaginase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Biochemical characterisation of the six PNGases</title><p id="P16">To investigate the activities of the putative PNGase enzymes, they were recombinantly expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 1</xref>) and assays were carried out with six glycoprotein substrates with varying types of N-glycans. The release of glycans was observed using thin layer chromatography and the decrease in protein size from N-glycan removal was monitored through SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4</xref>). The SDS-PAGE gels were stained for both total protein and glycoprotein. The substrates decorated with mammalian complex N-glycans (α1acid glycoprotein and fetuin) and high-mannose N-glycans (RNase B) were also treated with α-sialidase and α1,2-mannosidase, respectively, to provide simpler N-glycan structures to provide the best chance of observing activity. PNGaseL showed activity against all substrates tested, which included mammalian complex, high-mannose, plant-type and invertebrate-type N-glycans. The other five enzymes showed narrower specificity. The most common activities were observed against bovine RNase B and Honeybee venom phospholipase A2, which have high-mannose and invertebrate-type N-glycan decorations, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Investigating the structural basis for specificity displayed by the different PNGases</title><p id="P17">To investigate the specificity displayed by the six PNGases at a structural level we compared the active sites of the Alphafold models to four crystal structures – PNGaseF (1PNF), PNGaseF-II (4R4X, PNGaseBf (<italic>Bacteroides fragilis;</italic> 3KS7) and PNGasePm (<italic>Phocaeicola massiliensis;</italic> 7ZGN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.

To compare the active sites, we coloured the different loops extending out of the core β-sheets on the side of the protein with the active site and overlaid chitobiose from PNGaseF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5</xref>). Active site residues were selected that likely interact with substrate based on previous literature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 2</xref>) and a surface representation to visualise the contribution of the different loops to the active site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Comparison of the active site residues that likely interact directly with the substrate, reveal three broadly conserved features, which are provided by residues coming from the orange, lime green, and cyan loops in most cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 2</xref>). The orange loop contributes an aromatic-D-positive/aromatic motif. All three of these residues sit on the α-face of the first GlcNAc, but the first aromatic residue and third aromatic/positive also likely interact with the amide group from the second GlcNAc. The orientations of these aromatics are such that it is unlikely they provide hydrophobic platforms for the GlcNAc to stack against. The cyan loop predominantly interacts with the β-face side of the first GlcNAc through a histidine and glutamic acid. The exception to this is PNGaseF, which has a tryptophan instead of a histidine. PNGaseL and PNGaseDr have an additional serine and phenylalanine, respectively, provided by the cyan loop, that may make interactions with this GlcNAc at C6. Finally, the lime green loop provides a tryptophan or tyrosine on the β-face of the second GlcNAc. The orientation of these aromatics suggests this residue provides a hydrophobic platform for the β1,4-linked mannose of N-glycans also. Notably, for PNGaseL and PNGaseDr, these aromatic residues are provided by the red loop instead. In the case of PNGaseDr, the red loop takes this role away from the lime green loop by almost completely shrouding the lime green loop (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 3</xref>). In contrast, the lime-green loop of PNGaseL is not buried but instead forms a relatively large structure above the second GlcNAc. From the model, it is unclear how this loop may interact with substrate, and it is possible this loop may take on a different conformation in the presence of substrate. Overall, the α-face of the second GlcNAc in the N-glycan core is the most exposed part of the glycan.</p><p id="P19">One of the most striking aspects of the models of the PNGase enzymes explored in this report, is the open space underneath the chitobiose, which contrasts what has been seen in crystal structures of PNGase enzymes solved so far (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). PNGaseF, F-II, Bf, and Pm all hold the chitobiose more extensively in the region of C3 of the core GlcNAc and C6 of the second GlcNAc than the six new PNGase models analysed here. This complements the observed activities against substrates with α1,3-fucose on the core GlcNAc (plant and invertebrate) for the six PNGases described here. In contrast, the activity of PNGaseF-II and PNGasePm against substrates with core α1,3-fucose is facilitated by a pocket to accommodate this fucose rather than this area being completely open<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">One question that remains unanswered from the models is the reason why most of these PNGase enzymes cannot act on mammalian complex N-glycans, even the relatively simple de-sialylated biantennary structures found on α1acid glycoprotein. There are no obvious structural characteristics of these enzymes that would sterically hinder the accommodation of these structures compared to high-mannose N-glycans. However, no structures of PNGases have been solved with anything larger than chitobiose, which demonstrates there is still much to be understood about how structure relates to function for this family of enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Comparison of PNGaseL activity to PNGase F and A</title><p id="P21">The broad specificity displayed by PNGaseL led us to compare its activity in more detail with the main PNGases used in glycobiology, PNGaseF and A. These three PNGases were tested against glycoprotein substrates decorated with a range of different N-glycan structures and prepared under three conditions: 1) untreated 2) boiled and 3) boiled and detergent (following the commercial PNGaseF protocol). The released glycans were labelled with procainamide and analysed by liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection-electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (LC-FLD-ESI-MS). The results are summarised as a heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">figure 6</xref>) and full data is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 4</xref>. PNGaseF was able to fully remove mammalian complex and high-mannose N-glycans from different glycoproteins when they had been pre-treated by boiling and detergent, but unable to remove plant- or invertebrate-type N-glycans (α1,3-core fucose decorated) in line with previous observations. This activity was slightly reduced under the boil-only conditions and vastly reduced under the untreated conditions. In contrast, PNGaseA was only able to act on plant N-glycans and the activity was not very high under any condition. This is likely due to PNGaseA preferring substrates where the protein has been partially digested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. PNGaseL was able to remove N-glycans from all the glycoproteins tested and, where there was overlap in specificities, the activity was largely comparable to PNGaseF. The results for honeybee venom phospholipase A demonstrate this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">figure 6</xref>). It is of note that most of the N-glycans observed for honeybee venom phospholipase A do not have core fucosylation. This likely explains why activity against the insect N-glycans was common during the initial screening of the six PNGases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4</xref>). From this screen, the data suggest that PNGaseL does remove N-glycans with bisecting GlcNAcs, but it does not do this as well as PNGaseF for some substrates.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Assessing PNGaseL activity parameters and stability</title><p id="P22">A series of validation studies were carried out to find the optimal storage and assay conditions for PNGaseL and then to test its robustness and lifespan. In terms of stability, we carried out Differential Scanning Fluorimetery (DSF) using different buffers, pHs, and additives. We found that PNGaseL was most stable in 20 mM citrate buffer, 100 mM NaCl, at pH 6. Different pH was then assessed for optimal activity and assays carried out at pH 7.5 were found to release more glycan than pH 6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 5</xref>). This is the case for both bovine fetuin and human IgG. The stability of PNGaseL was then assessed by storing at different temperatures (room temperature and 37 °C) and over time (7 days and 14 days). Assays were then run against horseradish peroxidase and human IgG (only 7 days). The results showed that PNGaseL remained active under these parameters.</p><p id="P23">Finally, the ability of PNGaseL to remove N-glycans decorated with bisecting GlcNAc was explored in more depth using chicken egg white ovalbumin. The results confirm that PNGaseL releases these glycans, albeit less efficiently than PNGaseF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 5</xref>). The active site of the PNGaseL model has a tyrosine from loop 1 (Y38) that is approximately in the same position as W200 from loop 4 of the PNGaseF crystal structure. When the chitobiose from the PNGaseF 1PNF structure is overlaid into the PNGaseL active site then this tyrosine is significantly closer to the C4 of the GlcNAc where the bisecting sugar would attach than the W200 is in the PNGaseF structure. The closer positioning of this tyrosine may sterically hinder N-glycans with bisecting GlcNAcs. However, direct evidence of this would need to be confirmed with structural data and this is only a logical suggestion for why PNGaseL struggles to accommodate this decoration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">PNGaseF is extensively used in glycobiology to allow release of the N-glycome of the target protein, cell or tissue under study. While the enzyme has a wide specificity for N-glycans, it requires certain conditions for optimal activity and is unable to accommodate core α1,3-fucose decorations found in plant and invertebrate N-glycans. In this study, six PNGase enzymes were characterised from sources that are not associated with mammals. Overall, activity against high-mannose N-glycans was the most common among these six and this is reflective of these glycans having a consistent structure across kingdoms. Screening against substrates with different N-glycans revealed some notable observations. For instance, PNGaseRz selects specifically for α1,3 core-fucosylated glycans and this has been observed previously for PNGaseFII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. There was not much activity observed for PNGaseCg and it is likely that its true substrates have not been tested here as there is evidence of unusual N-glycan structures in oysters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P25">PNGaseL was selected for more in-depth characterisation given its broad specificity for core fucose decorations. It is a robust enzyme with high potential for commercialisation and can be used under the same conditions as PNGaseF. The only shortcoming is the lower activity towards N-glycans with bisecting GlcNAcs compared to PNGaseF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS206068-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d5aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The work was funded by The Academy of Medical Sciences (SBF0061175), the Wellcome Trust and Royal Society Sir Henry Dale fellowship (224240/Z/21/Z) awarded to L.I.C. and a BBSRC/Innovate UK IB catalyst award to D.N.B. ‘Glycoenzymes for Bioindustries’ (BB/M029018/1).

N-glycans. The core of an N-glycans structure is indicated by the orange box and α-linkages are labelled. High-mannose N-glycans are ubiquitous to many organisms (far left) and only comprise of α-linked mannose. Mammalian complex N-glycans (centre) have LacNAc antenna capped with sialic acid. These types of N-glycans are much more variable than other characterised types with the possibility of up to four antenna (two antenna are shown here) and core (α1,6) or antenna fucosylation. Plant complex N-glycans have Lewis A antenna structures, core α1,3-fucose, and bisecting β1,2-xylose. N-glycans from invertebrates can have both α1,3- and α1,6-fucosylation on the core GlcNAc.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206068-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic tree of the PNGaseF superfamily. 1897 PNGaseF sequences were used to construct a phylogenetic tree.

The loops extending from the β-sheets have been coloured according to the diagram to indicate where the contributing interactions with the core N-glycan chitobiose originate. The loops are the most variable parts of the catalytic module between PNGase structures. The chitobiose from PNGaseF (1PNF) has been overlaid into the PNGaseL model to provide context. b) The interactions of different PNGases with the core N-glycan chitobiose can be categorised into three types indicated by different colours. Interactions with the α-face of the core GlcNAc and the β-face of the second GlcNAc is consistent between PNGases (left). The interactions around the C3 of the core N-glycan GlcNAc and C6 of the second GlcNAc vary (right). PNGaseF forms relatively close contact and prohibits the accommodation of an α1,3-fucose (green), but PNGaseF-II has a pocket conferring specificity towards this sugar (orange). In contrast, PNGaseL provides a much more open space in this area to allow broad specificity (purple). RE and NRE stand for reducing end and non-reducing end, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206068-f005"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title><bold>Comparison</bold> of PNGaseL activity to PNGaseF and A.</title><p>(a) A heat map summary of the recombinant PNGaseL activity against a variety of N-glycosylated proteins in comparison to PNGaseF and PNGaseA The dark blue and white indicate full and no activity, respectively, and partial activities are represented by lighter blues.
