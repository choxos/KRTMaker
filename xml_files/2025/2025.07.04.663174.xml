Honeybees have sophisticated cognitive and learning capacities, including categorization of stimuli on the basis of perceptual (e.g., symmetry) and abstract (e.g., sameness/difference) concepts. Here we investigated whether bees could extrapolate the temporal regularity of a sequence. By exploiting the olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER), we investigated whether honeybees could learn and generalize a particular sequence structure composed of different odors presented in a specific temporal order. Different conditioning paradigms (i.e., absolute, differential, generalization) were employed. Bees used different strategies, such as an early tendency to encode the single odor properties, instead of learning the entire sequence pattern. The use of a generalization paradigm potentially uncovered a spontaneous tendency to transfer over similar structures one hour after the training irrespective of the single-element properties, though this finding is not yet conclusive. These results shed light on the strategies used by bees to solve an odor abstraction task, highlighting the crucial role of the type of conditioning to let them emerge.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>honeybees</kwd><kwd>insect cognition</kwd><kwd>odor sequences</kwd><kwd>proboscis extension response (PER)</kwd><kwd>abstracting regularities</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">From an evolutionary perspective, inferring a rule that allows the treatment of different stimuli as belonging to the same category could be extremely important. It might help an animal in anticipating a particular outcome, as well as to generalize its response, thus maximizing its fitness. This capacity has been thought to be one of the core mechanisms underlying human language acquisition, albeit not limited to our species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>].</p><p id="P3">The ability to extrapolate regularities and generalize them to new stimuli has been found in different vertebrate species, such as primates and birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Evidence from precocial species suggests that this ability might be present at the onset of life. Exploiting imprinting, an early form of learning by exposure, domestic chicks <italic>(Gallus gallus)</italic> successfully discriminated between XX and XY multimodal patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] and between triplets of simultaneous visual elements having an AAB <italic>vs.</italic> ABA structure, without explicit training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Newborn ducklings imprinted with visual 3D stimuli being the same or different in shape or color, at test chose novel stimuli having the same relationship as the imprinted ones, even though an alternative explanation involving stimuli visual symmetry might be in place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P4">The ability to abstract and generalize structural sequence regularities has been only marginally investigated in invertebrates, even though there are natural examples of possible stereotypical use of signal sequence production and response. For instance, the treehopper males <italic>(Enchenopa binotata)</italic> combine two different elements to attract females during mating: an initial whine followed by several pulses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Females of this species seem to respond to the typical structure of this stimulus, being guided by a combinatory strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Likewise, during the final phase of courtship, males of the black widow spider <italic>(Latrodectus hesperus)</italic> display an organized signal whose stereotypical structure is different from that of the signals emitted in other phases of the mating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Despite this ecological evidence, very few studies have consistently investigated the ability of invertebrates to actively learn and process stimuli sequence, supported by cognitive mechanisms rather than stereotypical stimulus-response. Macquart et al. (2008) studied the ability of an ant species <italic>(Gigantiops destructor)</italic> to learn simple motor sequences. To reach their nest, ants were forced to explore Y-mazes according to rules of turns of increasing difficulty: from constant and repetitive turns (e.g., RRRRRRRR or LLLLLLLL; R = right, L = left) to simple alternating (e.g., RLRLRLRL), double alternating (e.g., RRLLRRLL), and irregular alternating turns (e.g., RLRRL). At test, ants correctly extended a constant-turn learning to two following novel chambers, albeit failing in applying both the simple and double alternating rule, with performance dropping from 88.8%-71.4% to 55.5%-14.3%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. A probable explanation implies the memorization of the maze length or number of turns needed to reach the nest, causing ants to deploy a more natural searching behavior after the first novel chamber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, these results suggest the possible use of sensorimotor sequence learning in this species, highlighting its adaptive value with respect to costlier landmark memorization during navigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Similarly, Zhang and colleagues (1996) demonstrated the ability of honeybees to learn a sequence of flight turns to navigate a complex maze, even though their performance was poorer than learning the path by using color marks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Free-flying bees presented with a serial position visual task, take into account the number and relative position of four sequential color signals to subsequently choose the rewarded left/right arm. However, while authors hypothesized a minimal role of serial pattern learning, bees seemed to rather give different salience weights depending on stimulus proximity with the reward, exhibiting a choice behavior compatible with a recency effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. In this experimental design, the temporal encounter with single elements of the visual pattern was not carefully controlled, potentially leading to temporal weighting differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Overall, existing studies do not provide conclusive evidence regarding the capacity of sequence generalization in invertebrates, especially in the olfactory domain.</p><p id="P5">Nevertheless, honeybees offer a unique opportunity to try to further study their ability to form a sequence learning since they appear to be equipped with impressive cognitive and learning abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Bees show generalization capacities, treating equally different visual stimuli based on specific physical characteristics, such as radial, circular, and bilateral symmetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Bees can also master abstract concepts such as <italic>same/different</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], <italic>above/below</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], and <italic>right/left</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. They have also been tested for their ability to encode and use the temporal information of a visual stimulus to solve a subsequent task, albeit with negative results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Here we aimed to investigate whether honeybees could abstract the underlying structure of a temporal sequence of three odors, and then generalize their responses to novel stimuli. We performed six experiments using the <italic>proboscis extension response</italic> (PER) conditioning paradigm, which allows the formation of an association between an odor stimulus and a sucrose solution that, when provided to the antennae, elicits the spontaneous extroversion of the ligula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>].</p><p id="P7">The first two experiments investigated whether bees could learn an arbitrary odor sequence, spontaneously generalize their response to novel stimuli with a similar structure but composed of novel odors, and reject different novel configurations although composed of familiar odors. We investigated the role of the position of a particular odor in the sequence and its temporal closeness to the reward, studying whether this affected beesâ€™ memorization and recall abilities in a third control experiment. We also investigated whether differential conditioning could lead to successful discrimination of sequence structures (Exp. 4, 5). Lastly, we aimed to determine whether, by using a conditioning procedure in which a generalization strategy is favored to solve the task, a spontaneous encoding of the internal structure of odor sequences could be established and used to respond accordingly to novel stimuli (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> for a schematic representation of experimental sequence stimuli).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Method</title><p id="P8">All experiments were conducted at the Animal Cognition and Comparative Neuroscience Lab (ACN Lab, CIMeC, University of Trento) in Rovereto (Italy).

Each fixed bee was fed with 3 Î¼l of 30% sucrose solution (w/w) and kept in a dark, humid box for about 1 hour before starting training. In general, the day after training, all subjects were checked for their PER response following the antennal stimulation with the sucrose solution. Bees that did not exhibit the ligula extension response, were discarded from the analysis.

The minimum sample size of each experiment was determined based on previous guidelines, suggesting the use of a large sample size for PER experiments (i.e., 40/50 bees per group; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>b)</label><title>Apparatus and stimuli</title><p id="P11">In all experiments, the setup used to deliver the odor sequences was composed of a computerized olfactometer controlled by a MATLAB program (MATLAB R2019a, The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA), connected to six valves.</p><p id="P12">The stimuli consisted of six different odors, used according to the aim of each experiment: 3-hexanol (A), acetophenone (B), 1-nonanol (C), citral (D), benzaldehyde (E) and 2-octanone (F) (SIGMA-ALDRICHÂ®), with a 1:200 concentration (5 Î¼l odor / 1000 Î¼l mineral oil).

This has been proposed as one of the optimal durations of stimulation in the PER paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. At the same time, we wanted to have a nice separation between odors, to minimize the risk of odor mixture during training. Given these experimental constraints and beesâ€™ working-memory limits of up to 3-4 elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], each odor sequence comprised three distinct puffs (1 second each), separated by 500 ms of air.

Each conditioning trial lasted â‰ˆ 1 minute. The bee was placed in front of a continuous airflow for 25 seconds before the odor stimulation (4 seconds). The reinforcement (3 seconds) was delivered with a toothpick soaked in sucrose solution (i.e., â‰ˆ 2Î¼l of 50% sucrose solution w/w), after 3 seconds from the beginning of the odor. This allowed an overlapping of 1 second between odor and sucrose delivery. Then, after the stimulation, the bee was kept in front of the airflow for another 27 seconds and then removed. An inter-trial interval (ITI) of 10 minutes was used.

To this aim, we adapted the classical PER paradigm and observed beesâ€™ ability to extrapolate an underlying structure of consecutively presented odors forming a sequence.</p><p id="P63">Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that bees associated the trained sequences with positive reinforcement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>) without, however, being spontaneously able to generalize this response to novel odors presented with the same structure (i.e., CDC, Exp. 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>; ABA, Exp. 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). In these conditions, honeybeesâ€™ behavior suggested a primary encoding of the individual odor properties instead of the entire sequence order presentation. Interestingly, bees also showed a significant increase in response to novel-structured sequences at <italic>recall</italic> test (i.e., BAA, Exp. 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>; DCC, Exp. 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). This outcome was not driven by a different retrieval of one of the two odors constituting the sequence stimulus (see Results of Exp.3, <italic>recall</italic> test). When we analyzed the exact moment of PER display (Exp. 3), bees preferentially responded to both the A and B odors presented in the first position, suggesting again a similar encoding of the two odors irrespective of their ordering structure and temporal closeness to the reward (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). The existence of a better memorization of the peculiar dyad composed of second and third elements (e.g., BA, DC) could be another possible explanation for this result. This option might have been favored by the stricter temporal contingency of the second and third elements with the sucrose solution provided as reinforcement (i.e., just before and during the sucrose delivery, respectively).</p><p id="P64">It might be argued that bees could have learned an A+B odor mixture compound, instead of a sequential ABA odor presentation where each elemental component has a unique position in the sequence. First and foremost, we temporally separate the three sequential odor puffs, providing a continuous airflow to clean the environment and minimize any possible odor overlapping. Furthermore, results from the first two experiments might help to answer this concern. If bees were mainly learning to respond to a compound formed by mixed odors (e.g., A+B rather than ABA in Exp. 1; C+D rather than CDC in Exp. 2), we would not have expected to observe the significantly different proportion of response between trained sequences (i.e., ABA, Exp. 1; CDC, Exp.2) and novel structure sequences composed of familiar odors in the <italic>recall</italic> test of Experiment 1 and 2 (i.e., BAA, Exp. 1; DCC, Exp. 2) as they equally carried the â€˜mixtureâ€™ cue, despite the temporal order of their composing elements.</p><p id="P65">The use of differential conditioning highlighted again an inability of bees to actively differentiate between ABA and BAA (Exp. 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), or ABA and AAB structures (Exp. 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Furthermore, the significant difference in the proportion of response between ABA and AAB sequences at the <italic>recall</italic> test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>), could not rule out a discrimination capacity based on the last element dissimilarity, rather than a complete sequence learning.</p><p id="P66">Observation of the exact moment of PER display (Exp. 5: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>) might suggest the presence of an additional <italic>response to the odor change</italic> strategy. When novel odors were presented (i.e., CDC, CCD; <italic>recall</italic> test of Exp. 5), a considerable number of bees responded to the D odor, namely the odor different from the first one presented (C; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Similarly, when the trained ABA and AAB stimuli were presented, bees were more likely to respond not only to the first odor (A) but also to the subsequent different odor (B) irrespective of the position of the latter (either second or third in the sequence; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>), supporting a possible spontaneous use of this strategy. Arguably, a generalization response among citral (D) and 3-hexanol (A) or between citral (D) and acetophenone (B) could explain these results. However, past research demonstrated beesâ€™ discrimination ability between citral and 1-hexanol compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Since a strong generalization at both behavioral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] and neuronal levels between different hexanols (i.e., 1-hexanol, 2-hexanol, 3-hexanol; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]) has been suggested, we could acknowledge a low probability for bees to generalize their response between citral and 3-hexanol in our study. Likewise, citral and acetophenone have different neuronal activity, sustained by specific glomeruli activation in the bee brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. The low generalization response between sequences in Exp. 1 and 2 (i.e., ABA <italic>vs.</italic> CDC) also supports the idea that a generalization among odors was unlikely to be present in our research.</p><p id="P67">Honeybees showed a response congruent with structure similarity (i.e., ABA, CDC, and EFE) and dissimilarity strategy (i.e., FEE) in experiment 6 <italic>(memory</italic> test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The capacity to generalize the structure across different odors was present only one hour after training. When we tested the long-term memory capacity, a higher response for the two trained sequences (i.e., ABA, CDC) was found, together with a significant difference between them <italic>(recall</italic> test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). This latter difference might be caused by a more robust memorization of the 3-hexanol and acetophenone odors (composing the ABA stimulus) compared to 1-nonanol and citral odors (composing the CDC stimulus). Results of the <italic>recall</italic> test of experiments 1 and 2 support this hypothesis, with the proportion of bees responding to the ABA-trained sequence (61,7%, Exp. 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) being higher than the proportion of subjects responding to the CDC-trained sequence (41,7%, Exp. 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We did not find a significant difference between novel stimuli with either a familiar or a non-familiar structure (i.e., EFE, FEE). This might be an effect of the relatively short training (i.e., 8-trials training providing only two odor sequences with the same structure). Future research should investigate whether a more extended and diverse training procedure could enhance the ability of bees to generalize their response and differentiate between novel odors with familiar and unfamiliar structures. In visual discrimination tasks, the use of appetitive-aversive conditioning has been shown to enhance honeybeesâ€™ solving performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Unfortunately, the use of quinine solution as the aversive stimulus is not fully supported during the PER conditioning paradigm due to its toxicity rate (just under 60% mortality for 100mM quinine concentration; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]).</p><p id="P68">Bees showed different patterns of response at <italic>memory</italic> and <italic>recall</italic> tests in our experiments (e.g., lower rate of response during <italic>recall</italic> tests with respect to <italic>memory</italic> tests). In Pavlovian conditioning, memory retrieval can depend on several factors that can be modulated during training: interstimulus interval (i.e., time intercourse between CS and US; ISI), intertrial interval (i.e., time intercourse between subsequent trials; ITI), and the total number of trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Moreover, a process of memory decay can also explain the differences in response during <italic>recall</italic> tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>].</p><p id="P69">Bees seem to use different strategies when presented with the sequence discrimination task. This should not be surprising as it has been demonstrated that the use of different conditioning procedures (i.e., absolute or differential) could determine variations in stimuli discrimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. The discovery of alternative strategies implementation is pivotal for understanding honeybeesâ€™ learning processes, the construction of abstract knowledge, and which experimental tools are necessary to let it occur. AvarguÃ¨s-Weber et al. (2011) demonstrated the existence of an abstract <italic>above/below</italic> categorization rule based on the elementâ€™s spatial relationship during honeybeesâ€™ visual discrimination task, without relying on target absolute position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. High-speed videography analysis suggested that bees could solve the task by employing a scanning behavior of the lower visual item before making a decision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], without necessarily relying on a more abstract conceptual rule. However, it is worth noticing that even in this latter study, evidence for above/below categorization was found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. After extensive training, bumblebees trained in a <italic>small</italic> vs. <italic>large</italic> visual shape discrimination, opted for a simpler win-stay/lose-switch strategy, albeit still retaining the learning of a relative size rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Despite the apparent incompatibility of the described evidence, it has been suggested that the development of different mechanisms supporting low and high-cognitively demanding behaviors could be adaptive in ecological situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>].</p><p id="P70">The experimental design of the present study involved a presentation of odor stimuli that might appear to be as not ecologically relevant, for it could be argued that foragers might not encounter temporally separated odor bouquets during their flight, so that any direct comparison between our experimental conditions and natural behavior may appear weak. However, to investigate the ability of bees to learn and generalize among sequences, it is mandatory to use a design that allows for rigorous control over independent variables (e.g., the timing of stimuli occurrence) and presentation of ecologically salient sequences with which honeybees could create an association with positive reinforcement (i.e., odor sequences). Thus, the main goal of our experimental design was not to mimic natural behavior and study the underlying cognitive process but to provide an effective experimental method to investigate the presence of a specific cognitive ability in an insect species, shedding light on our understanding of beesâ€™ cognition.</p><p id="P71">The capacity to extrapolate regularities from the environment is thought to be of high adaptive value as it allows animals to conform their behavior in response to stimuli that share common regular characteristics despite being composed of different elements, ultimately helping to discover the underlying environmental structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Bees are equipped with a minimal circuit favoring the construction of categorical and generalization processes rather than overloading the memory capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Moreover, bees communicate through a sensorimotor display known as the waggle dance, which comprises elements presented according to a sequential structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Therefore, an abstraction capacity related to temporal sequence structures in bees could be hypothesized. However, our results do not provide a further and clear demonstration of the ability of bees to extrapolate temporal contingencies and successfully generalize that knowledge to novel stimuli. Rather, our findings support the implementation of simpler rules to address an odor sequence discrimination task. Still, we do not exclude the possibility that the ability to extrapolate a structure regularity might be present or better developed in other sensory modalities (e.g., tactile) in honeybees.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS207182-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d26aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S16"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Francesco Rughi for his help in the data collection of experiments 2, 4, and 6, and Bastien Lemaire, Mirko Zanon, and Orsola Rosa Salva for their useful comments on the previous version of this manuscript.</p><sec id="S17"><title>Funding</title><p>This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No. 833504, ERC Advanced Grant SPANUMBRA to G.V.).</p></sec></ack><sec id="S18" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data and code availability</title><p id="P72">Raw data have been deposited at the Mendeley Data repository (DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/bcxx3j4y32.1">10.17632/bcxx3j4y32.1</ext-link>).</p></sec><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="con"><p id="P73"><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p id="P74">M.B. and G.V. conceived the study.
