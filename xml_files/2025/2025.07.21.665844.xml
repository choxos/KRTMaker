High-light (HL) tolerant <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC6803 strains were developed through laboratory evolution, with tolerance attributed to specific point mutations. Key mutations affected the NDH-1L complex F1-subunit (NdhF1<sub>F124L</sub>) and translation elongation factor G2 (EF-G2<sub>R461C</sub>). Reintroducing these mutations into laboratory strains conferred HL tolerance. Comparisons with knockout and overexpressor lines showed NdhF1<sub>F124L</sub> and EF-G2<sub>R461C</sub> result in gain of function. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis unveiled a network of responses contributing to HL tolerance, including maintenance of phosphate metabolism and decreased antenna size by depleting a specific linker protein in EF-G2<sub>R461C</sub> cells. Consequently, overexpression of Pho regulon genes increased HL tolerance. NdhF1<sub>F124L</sub> enhances cyclic electron flow (CEF) by increasing NDH-1 complex subunit accumulation. Other HL-adapted strains demonstrated that increased CEF and decreased antenna size are recurring outcomes, achievable through various mutations. This study demonstrates how limited mutations can reconfigure cells for enhanced HL tolerance, offering insights for improving photosynthetic efficiency.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Improving photosynthesis is crucial for addressing future food, energy, and climate challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). One promising approach involves broadening the absorption spectrum through synthetic biology and reconfiguring photosynthetic light reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). However, excessive solar energy input can cause photodamage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), necessitating the development of new chassis with strong resilience to high light (HL).</p><p id="P4">Cyanobacteria serve as excellent models for manipulating photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>).

Two key mutations, phenylalanine (F) 124 to leucine (L) in the F1 subunit of the type 1 NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH-1) complex (referred to as NdhF1<sub>F124L</sub>) and arginine (R) 461 to cysteine (C) in the translation elongation factor EF-G2 (hereafter referred to as EF-G2<sub>R461C</sub>), were found to increase HL tolerance in laboratory-type (LT) background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P5">NdhF exists in three isoforms, each incorporated into distinct NDH-1 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). The NDH-1L complex, which includes NdhF1, is predominant under normal growth conditions and facilitates cyclic electron flow (CEF) around photosystem I (PSI) during short-term HL exposure and respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In contrast, NdhF3 and NdhF4 are components of the NDH-1MS complex, which is involved in CO<sub>2</sub> uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) and further enhances CEF under extended HL stress periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). CEF plays a vital role in protecting cyanobacteria from reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage during environmental stress by preventing excess electron accumulation at the PSI acceptor side and generating additional ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that HL exposure significantly induces NDH-1 subunit expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Additionally, our prior research revealed that the NdhF1<sub>F124L</sub> mutation enhances CEF activity, protecting cells against HL stress, shifting the ratio of CEF to CO<sub>2</sub> uptake activities in favor of CEF, and boosting respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The translation elongation factor G (EF-G) is responsible for translocating tRNA and mRNA down the ribosome during the translation process. The <italic>Synechocystis</italic> genome contains three genes (<italic>slr1463/fusA, sll1098/fusB</italic>, and <italic>sll0830</italic>) that encode different homologues of EF-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). EF-G has been identified as primary target within the translational system that becomes inactivated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) during photoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Oxidation of EF-G inhibits the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of the D1 protein, which in turn inhibits the repair of photodamaged photosystem II (PSII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). The expression of redox-insensitive EF-G1 (encoded by <italic>fusA</italic>) by substituting a cysteine residue with serine has been shown to enhance the repair of PSII by accelerating the synthesis of the D1 protein under strong light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). R461 of EF-G2 (encoded by <italic>fusB</italic>) is highly conserved across the green lineage. During ALE, it was found to be substituted to C, resulting in enhanced tolerance to HL stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). The mechanism by which a redox-sensitive cysteine in EF-G2<sub>R461C</sub> increases its tolerance to oxidative damage is not yet clear.</p><p id="P7">This study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of HL tolerance conferred by these mutations through transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of single and double mutant strains.

The NdhF1<sub>F124L</sub> mutation, initially present at very low frequency (0.04%) in the original laboratory-type (LT) strain, appeared at higher frequencies after the final mutagenesis in UMMM2 (0.19%) and UMMM4 (100%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).

NdhF1<sub>F124L</sub> cells showed superior growth at mHL but could not grow at sHL, while the EF-G2<sub>R461C</sub> strain and the double mutant grew at sHL. The original wild-type motile strain from the Pasteur Collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) (WT) tolerated both HL conditions with a significant CL trade-off. The performance of UMMM2 was comparable to the point mutation strains under HL conditions but showed reduced growth and pigment content at CL <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-D</xref>).

The six strains (LT, WT, UMMM2, NdhF1<sub>F124L</sub>, EF-G2<sub>R461C</sub>, and NdhF1<sub>F124L</sub>+EF-G2<sub>R461C</sub>) serve as a model system for analyzing HL tolerance mechanisms evolved during ALE and their interplay in UMMM2.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>NdhF1<sub>F124L</sub> and EF-G2<sub>R461C</sub> are gain-of-function mutations</title><p id="P11">To explore the effects of the NdhF1 and EF-G2 mutations, insertional knockout (KO) and overexpression (OE) lines (using the strong <italic>psbA2</italic> promoter) were created (see Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

These results, in particular the CEF activity data, suggest that NdhF1<sub>F124L</sub> is a gain-of-function mutation, although overexpression alone was insufficient for HL tolerance.</p><p id="P12">For EF-G2, protein levels showed minor changes in EF-G2<sub>R461C</sub> and NdhF1<sub>F124L</sub>+EF-G2<sub>R461C</sub> strains under different light conditions, but a clear decrease in UMMM2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

Only up-regulated shared HL-DEGs/DEPs were identified in WT. Genes/proteins from shared up-regulated and down-regulated HL-DEGs/DEPs groups are written in red and blue, respectively.

Highlighted are proteins with markedly different changes from their corresponding transcripts (at least 3-fold up- or down-regulated at protein level, while either oppositely or no more than 1.5-fold regulated at transcript level) across all light conditions. Among these, up-regulated and down-regulated HL-DEPs in #2 are labeled in pink and blue, respectively. <bold>(B)</bold> PBS size analysis using sucrose gradient.
