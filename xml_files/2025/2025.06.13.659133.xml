However, activin’s role in tumourigenesis has been relatively overlooked compared to TGF-β’s. We generated and characterized a dual specificity human antibody that recognizes both activin A and B and compared its activity in syngeneic mouse models of breast cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with an activin A-specific antibody. We demonstrate that activin A and B are central to the function of CAFs and therapeutic inhibition of activin results in a reduction of collagen rich desmoplastic barriers, enabling the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells. This is correlated with an upregulation of the T cell chemoattractant CXCL10, which is normally repressed by activin signalling. Interestingly, despite greater T cell infiltration, activin A inhibition resulted in poorer survival in the KPC mouse model of PDAC and slightly larger tumours in the breast cancer model, indicating a tumour suppressive role of activin A-rich CAFs. Strikingly, however, treatment with the same anti-activin A antibody of PDAC tumours where SMAD4 is deleted in the tumour cells, resulted in increased survival, which was potentiated with additional treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. These results suggest that anti-activin therapy has potential for the cohort of PDAC patients exhibiting inactivation of SMAD4.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>activin</kwd><kwd>pancreatic cancer</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>immune infiltration</kwd><kwd>therapeutic antibodies</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) ligands (TGF-β1, 2 and 3) have long been known to play important roles as both tumour suppressors and tumour promoters in many different types of human cancer. As a tumour suppressor, TGF-β can induce apoptosis, particularly in tumours containing KRAS mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, induce cytostatic effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, and also can elicit indirect effects via the tumour stroma, primarily by preventing inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. As tumours develop, cancer cells use various strategies to circumvent the tumour suppressive effects of TGF-β, such as by mutating or deleting key components of the TGF-β pathway to make the cancer cells unresponsive to ligand. Loss-of-function mutations are found in the type I or type II receptors (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 respectively), or in the SMADs which transduce the signal to the nucleus. In particular, SMAD4, the so-called common mediator SMAD, which is required for most TGF-β responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, is deleted or acquires loss-of-function mutations in about a third of pancreatic cancers as well as in a subset of colorectal cancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. As a tumour promoter, TGF-β has numerous effects on the tumour stroma by reprogramming fibroblasts to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which become a source of further TGF-β and activin (another subgroup of the TGF-β family) ligands, as well as of inflammatory cytokines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, TGF-β can act as a pro-angiogenic factor, and as an immune suppressor, by suppressing proliferation and cytolytic functions of cytotoxic T cells and preventing their access to the core of the tumour <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. TGF-β can also promote pro-tumourigenic phenotypes of tumour-associated macrophages and neutrophils <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Given these well documented tumour promoting activities, there have been numerous attempts to target TGF-β signalling therapeutically in cancer using, for example, ligand traps, neutralizing antibodies, or small molecule ATP competitive inhibitors of the type I receptor kinase activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, despite more than 20 molecules being tested in clinical trials over the past two decades, no treatment in solid tumours has yet been approved. More recently, there has been growing interest in combining anti-TGF-β therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as anti-PD-L1 antibodies, in view of TGF-β’s strong immune-suppressive effects and the link of TGF-β signalling to poor response to ICIs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In one case this has been attempted with a bi-functional agent, M7824, comprising a TGF-β ligand trap with an anti-PD-L1 antibody <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Although these combinations were very successful in preclinical mouse models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, this approach has not yet translated to success in the clinic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">One issue with targeting the TGF-β ligands in disease, is that they share a downstream signalling pathway with other TGF-β family ligands, in particular, activin A and activin B (encoded by the genes <italic>INHBA</italic> and <italic>INHBB</italic> respectively), which are also widely expressed in many different tumours <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Although the activin receptors (ACVR1B/ACVR1C and ACVR2A/ACVR2B) are distinct from the TGF-β receptors (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2), their activation by ligand results in phosphorylation of the same receptor-regulated SMADs, SMAD2 and SMAD3. These phosphorylated SMADs form complexes with SMAD4, which accumulate in the nucleus to transcriptionally regulate target genes. As a result, activin and TGF-β share many of the same target genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and thus the presence of phosphorylated SMAD2/3 or a specific target gene signature cannot be used in vivo as an indication of the activity of a specific ligand <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Furthermore, these ligands exhibit distinct signalling dynamics. Cell responses to the TGF-β ligands quickly attenuate due to rapid internalisation of receptor complexes, resulting in depletion of receptors from the cell surface <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. This means that long-term stimulation with TGF-β results in low levels of phosphorylated SMAD2/3. The activin signal, in contrast, is integrated over time. Thus, long-term activin stimulation results in high levels of phosphorylated SMAD2/3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. As a result, some activities that have been ascribed <italic>in vivo</italic> to the TGF-βs may be the result of activin signalling.</p><p id="P6">This view is supported by the fact that activities, such as immune suppression and CAF activation are co-induced by TGF-β and activin A and B <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Moreover, loss-of-function mutations/deletions of activin receptors (ACVR1B, ACVR2A and to a lesser extent ACVR2B) are observed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) as an alternative to SMAD4 mutations/deletions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. This strongly suggests that activins have a tumour suppressor function in human PDAC. In addition, a number of pre-clinical studies in mice have shown that activins also drive tumorigenesis in PDAC, breast cancer, melanoma and other skin cancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and is important for lung metastasis in breast cancer patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Therefore, like TGF-β, evidence is emerging for activins playing both tumour suppressive and tumour promoting roles. Untangling these opposing roles is going to be essential for treatment of human cancer.</p><p id="P7">To delineate the roles specifically played by activins in tumourigenesis we developed and characterized a human dual specificity anti-activin A/B antibody of high affinity and compared it in syngeneic mouse models with an anti-activin A-specific antibody containing the variable regions of garetosmab <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> and with an IgG control. We show that these two anti-activin antibodies bind at different sites on mature activin A, but both effectively neutralize activin signalling in vivo. We chose to focus on two cancer types – invasive breast cancer which is associated with high levels of circulating activin A in patients with primary tumours and bone metastases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, and PDAC, one of the hardest to treat cancers which is known to exhibit loss-of-function mutations in activin receptors or SMAD4, and where high levels of activin expression are associated with a worse prognosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Using these antibodies, we demonstrate that the major effect of inhibiting activin A/B signalling in breast cancer is to allow infiltration of cytotoxic T cells into the core of the tumour and to decrease collagen deposition by CAFs. In the PDAC model, we show that neutralizing activins in tumours where SMAD4 is wild type results in poorer survival. Strikingly however, in mice bearing tumours in which SMAD4 has been deleted specifically in the tumour cells, inhibiting activin A function promotes survival, and this is further increased with treatment with anti-PD-L1 antibodies. These data indicate that we can successfully disentangle the tumour promoting and tumour suppressive effects of activin and suggest a therapeutic potential of inhibiting activin A signalling in human PDAC tumours that have lost SMAD4 function.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>INHBA</italic> and <italic>INHBB</italic> are strongly expressed in breast and pancreatic cancer and high expression of <italic>INHBA</italic> correlates with poorer survival</title><p id="P8">To confirm the relevance of activin expression in human cancer we analysed cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data. Patients with PDAC tumours expressing high levels of <italic>INHBA</italic> (which encodes activin A) showed reduced survival compared to those expressing low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We followed this up by analysing levels of activin A and activin B protein in serum from patients with PDAC compared with age- and sex-matched normal controls. Both activin A and activin B levels were significantly enhanced in the serum from cancer patients compared with the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). To determine which cells in PDAC tumours expressed <italic>INHBA</italic> and <italic>INHBB</italic> (which encodes activin B), we reanalysed human single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from PDAC tumours and control pancreases from patients with non-pancreatic tumours or non-malignant pancreatic tumours <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Little expression of <italic>INHBA</italic> was observed in the control pancreases, but high expression was detected in CAFs, predominantly in the myCAF population <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> and in myeloid populations, particularly in macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). In contrast, <italic>INHBB</italic> was expressed at low level in a range of cell types in both the control pancreases and in the PDAC tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). These findings were confirmed by performing combined RNAscope™ in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence for α smooth muscle actin (αSMA, encoded by the <italic>ACTA2</italic> gene), a marker of myCAFs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Much of the expression of <italic>INHBA</italic> co-localized with αSMA in human PDAC samples, whilst expression of <italic>INHBB</italic> was more uniform throughout the sample in epithelial cells and in CAFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We next investigated whether a mouse model of PDAC (the KPC model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>) recapitulated our findings in human PDAC and found this to be the case. Reanalysis of scRNA-seq data from this mouse model demonstrated high levels of <italic>Inhba</italic> expression in myeloid cells, myCAFs and low expression in ductal cells, whilst <italic>Inhbb</italic> transcripts were detected in myCAFs, iCAFs and ductal cells but were absent in cells of the myeloid lineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A–C</xref>). RNAscope™ for <italic>Inhba</italic> or <italic>Inhbb</italic> with immunofluorescence for αSMA confirmed the scRNA-seq analysis with <italic>Inhba</italic> transcripts co-localising with αSMA staining, whilst expression of <italic>Inhbb</italic> was more delocalized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We went on to investigate whether other tumour types also expressed high levels of these two activins, focusing on human invasive breast cancer. Analysis of TCGA data indicated that high <italic>INHBA</italic> expression was associated with poorer survival and <italic>INHBA</italic> expression was significantly higher in tumours compared with normal mammary tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>, H). RNAscope™ for <italic>INHBA</italic> or <italic>INHBB</italic> with immunofluorescence for αSMA indicated that, like PDAC, expression of <italic>INHBA</italic> was mainly associated with CAFs, whilst <italic>INHBB</italic> was more widely expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). A similar analysis in a syngeneic mouse orthotopic transplantation model of breast cancer (D2A1-m2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>) indicated very high levels of <italic>Inhba</italic> expression within CAFs and in tumour cells, but much lower levels of <italic>Inhbb</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>). Analysis of mouse plasma indicated increased levels of activin A and activin B in tumour-bearing mice compared with wildtype mice in the MMTV-PyMT model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> and in the D2A1-m2 model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1F, G</xref>).</p><p id="P11">In summary, both human and mouse PDAC and breast tumours exhibit high levels of <italic>INHBA</italic> expression predominantly in the myCAFs and myeloid populations, as well as broad expression of <italic>INHBB</italic>. In both cancer types, raised levels of circulating activin A and B in the bloodstream are detected in tumours versus controls.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Activin secreted by CAFs promotes ECM production and contractility</title><p id="P12">Building on our observation that CAFs are a major source of activins, we investigated their functional role in this cell type. We first determined whether activins were the only TGF-β family member secreted by the CAFs. Conditioned media was prepared from an immortalized clone of CAFs (CAF1), obtained from the MMTV-PyMT mouse breast cancer model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> and from immortalized normal fibroblasts (NF) extracted from normal mammary glands. This was used to induce phosphorylated SMAD2 (pSMAD2) in HaCaT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). The CAFs, but not the NFs, secreted an activity that could be inhibited by the activin A and B antagonist, follistatin, but not a TGF-β blocking antibody, indicating that the CAFs secrete activin, but not TGF-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To investigate the functional role of activins in the CAFs, we generated single and double knockouts of activin A and activin B using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) and confirmed that the double knockouts did not secrete any ligands that could induce pSMAD2 in HaCaT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Reactome pathway analysis of bulk RNA-seq data, comparing parental CAF1 cells with those deleted for activin A and B, revealed collagen biosynthesis and collagen formation as major pathways, among others, that differed between the two cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). We therefore investigated whether activin signalling was required for the CAF’s ability to remodel the extracellular matrix using the collagen gel contraction assay. Parental CAF1 cells could readily contract collagen, but the activin A and B-null CAF1 cells were unable to, and this deficit could be rescued by addition of recombinant activin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F, G</xref>). Consistent with this, the activin A and B-null CAF1 cells expressed considerably lower levels of phosphorylated MYL9, which is required for contraction, compared to the parental line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). Thus, activin A and B produced by CAFs is required for ECM production and CAF contractility in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Generation and characterization of anti-activin neutralizing antibodies</title><p id="P14">To determine the role of the secreted activin A and B in vivo we generated a dual specificity anti-activin A/B antibody by screening AstraZeneca’s phage display libraries of randomly combined human single chain variable fragments (scFvs) using recombinant mature activin A and activin B as baits. This resulted in a dual specificity anti-activin A/B antibody that was converted to the human IgG1 format. Using bio-layer interferometry we demonstrated that this antibody has a K<sub>D</sub> for human activin A of 130 pM and a K<sub>D</sub> for human activin B of 750 pM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). We demonstrated that the anti-activin A/B antibody could specifically inhibit the activity of both human activin A and activin B in a CAGA<sub>12</sub>-luciferase assay in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C, D</xref>). Consistent with high conservation between human and mouse activins (100% and 97% identify for activin A and B, respectively), the antibody could also effectively block the activity of the mouse ligands as it inhibited the ability of activin A and B secreted by mouse CAFs to activate the phosphorylation of SMAD2 in HaCaT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). As a comparator for our in vivo assays, we also produced a high affinity anti-activin A antibody in the same IgG1 format as our anti-activin A/B antibody, using the variable regions of garetosmab <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. This antibody was specific for activin A only and had a higher affinity for activin A (~8.7 pM, measured by surface plasmon resonance) compared with the anti-Activin A/B antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A, D and G</xref>). In addition, we checked the specificity of these anti-activin antibodies against other TGF-β family ligands. Neither antibody exhibited any affinity for TGF-β3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C, F, I</xref>). The dual specificity anti-activin A/B antibody showed a very weak affinity for BMP2 (K<sub>D</sub> = 0.102 μM) which was approximately 500 times weaker than its affinity for activin A in the same assay (K<sub>D</sub> = 0.254 nM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B, H</xref>), and much weaker than the affinity of BMP2 for its cognate type I receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. The garetosmab-like anti-activin A antibody showed no detectable binding to BMP2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To determine how the anti-activin A/B antibody bound to activin A we generated a complex of the Fab fragments of this antibody with mature activin A for cryo-EM analysis. Structural characterization of the complex was hampered by the structural heterogeneity of the activin A dimer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. We were therefore able only to generate a map at 5.4 Å resolution, which nevertheless shows a clear V-shaped structure, consistent with Fab fragments binding to the so-called knuckle epitopes where the activin type II receptors bind. To gain further insight, we generated structural models of anti-activin A/B Fab fragments in complex with mature activin A and activin B using the AlphaFold3 server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alphafoldserver.com">https://alphafoldserver.com</ext-link>). All models generated for each complex by AlphaFold3 were fully consistent with each other (data not shown), as were the models using either activin A or activin B as the ligand. The activin A:anti-activin A/B Fab models showed a perfect fit to the cryo-EM map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>).

In the breast cancer model, we have correlated this with an upregulation of the chemokine CXCL10 expression following activin inhibition. This has also recently been reported in mouse models of melanoma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.

Infiltration of T cells into the tumours may also be a result of a breakdown of the stromal fortress around the tumour, as inhibiting activin signalling results in a loss of collagen deposition in the breast cancer model, which would make the tumour more porous.</p><p id="P31">Consistent with an additional tumour suppressive role for activin, we have shown that in breast tumours containing wildtype SMAD4, neutralization of activin results in a small increase in tumour size. This appears to result from a decrease in apoptosis of tumour cells, as opposed to an increase in proliferation. We hypothesized that this could be due to a direct effect of activin signalling in the tumour cells, mediated via the canonical activin pathway via SMAD4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. However, deletion of SMAD4 in the D2A1-m2 breast cancer cells did not abolish the small increase in tumour size that we detected upon inhibition of activin signalling suggesting that it was not mediated by a direct effect on the tumour cells themselves.

Strikingly, in this model, we were able to disentangle the tumour suppressive and tumour promoting effects of activin.

This suggests that activin expressed in the TME normally constrains tumour growth, and loss of SMAD4 releases these constraints, allowing activin to act as a tumour promoter via its activity on stromal cells. We hypothesize that one of the main tumour-promoting functions of activin in this context is immune suppression, excluding cytotoxic T cells from the tumour.

In these experiments, the anti-activin therapy increases the size of the tumours, meaning that the therapeutic window is short. Thus, the effects of the anti-PD-L1 therapy may not have been realised before the mice needed to be culled due to tumour burden. Another possibility is that the numbers of T cells accumulating may be insufficient for effective killing of tumour cells.

In future work it will be important to investigate whether there is any added advantage of targeting activin B. From our RNAScope analyses, activin B appears more broadly expressed in breast and PDAC tumours than activin A, but at lower levels, as evidenced by our scRNA-seq analyses. Activin B also exhibits a distinct receptor repertoire, being able to signal through ACVR1C as well as ACVR1B, whilst activin A is specific for ACVR1B, which might influence their functions in the tumour <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P36">In terms of the potential of anti-activin therapy for solid cancers, our results indicate that patients with PDAC tumours that have lost SMAD4 or acquired loss-of-function SMAD4 mutations would be the most likely to benefit.

For image analysis of DAB IHC where multiple fields of view (FOV) were taken within a tumour, annotations were placed randomly throughout the tumour to ensure wide tumour coverage, with either 10, 20 or 40 FOV per tumour, depending on the heterogeneity of the signal. The annotations measured 832 μm width and 666 μm height. Where core and boundary were analysed, core FOVs were placed within the centre of the tumour, avoiding necrotic areas, and boundary FOVs were placed at the outer edge of the tumour, with the entire annotation always within 1 mm of the edge of the tumour. A positive cell or nucleus detection was performed to capture positive cellular staining, with the threshold adjusted using relevant positive controls per experiment. Where entire tumour sections were analysed, a thresholder was used to create a pixel classifier to automate identification of tumour sections. For pSMAD2 immunofluorescence quantification, the positive cell detection settings were set to allow for detection of cells that were mildly, moderately or strongly positive. Measurement map ranges within QuPath were analysed to determine the settings for these 3 categories. The Histoscore was calculated within QuPath using the formula: HistoScore = ((1 × % mildly stained cells) + (2 × % moderately stained cells) + (3 × % strongly stained cells)). To quantitate RNAScope staining, a classifier was used to train QuPath to detect positive, negative and ignore areas based upon the positive and negative controls. The ‘ignore’ areas were necrotic tissue. To measure internuclear distances, a workflow was developed in Qupath to measure the distance between a cell nucleus and its closest neighbouring cell within a tumour.</p></sec><sec id="S50"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P83">Unless otherwise stated above, statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 10.
