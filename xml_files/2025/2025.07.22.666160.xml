The herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 protein pUL21 binds PP1 via the TROPPO motif, which lacks sequence similarity to canonical PP1-binding SLiMs. Here, we combine structure prediction, mutagenesis, and biophysical assays to elucidate the molecular basis of this interaction. AlphaFold2-Multimer structural models suggest that the TROPPO motifs of pUL21 and of pORF38, the varicella-zoster virus homologue of pUL21, bind the same hydrophobic groove on PP1 as RVxF and ϕϕ[xF] motifs, forming an extended β-sheet that bridges PP1 and the N-terminal domain of pUL21 or pORF38. Site-directed mutagenesis of both pUL21 and PP1 confirms key predicted interactions. Competition fluorescence polarisation confirms that pUL21 competes directly with cellular PP1 RvXF motifs for PP1 binding, albeit with lower affinity. Substituting key residues of the pUL21 TROPPO motif to resemble a canonical RVxF sequence increases PP1 binding, suggesting that alphaherpesviruses have evolved suboptimal motifs to fine-tune phosphatase recruitment that may balance viral kinase and phosphatase activities during infection. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of PP1 recruitment by viral proteins and suggest that many other PP1 regulators may possess non-canonical binding motifs and thus remain undiscovered.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>VZV</kwd><kwd>RIPPO</kwd><kwd>PIP</kwd><kwd>regulatory subunit</kwd><kwd>PPP1R15A</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Phosphorylation is critical to the control of most cellular processes. Viruses have learnt to exploit this, encoding kinases that regulate cell cycle progression, modify gene expression, overcome innate immune restriction and prevent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Similarly, multiple viruses modulate the dephosphorylation of both cellular and viral target proteins within infected cells. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 protein ICP34.5 (a.k.a. γ134.5) counteracts the antiviral innate immune response by stimulating dephosphorylation of eIF2α to relieve host transcriptional shutdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The HIV Tat protein interacts with the cellular enzyme protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to promote viral gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Additionally, the measles virus V protein suppresses innate immune signalling by sequestering PP1, thereby preventing dephosphorylation of the cytosolic RNA sensor MDA5 that is required for its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Given the multitude of cellular signalling pathways that are regulated by protein phosphorylation, interfering with virus-mediated protein dephosphorylation represents a promising new avenue for the development of potent antiviral therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>).</p><p id="P4">PP1 is a highly abundant cellular serine/threonine phosphatase. PP1 has low intrinsic specificity and it recruits its substrates via regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), also known as adaptor proteins, PP1 Interacting Proteins (PIPs) or Regulators of Protein Phosphatase One (RIPPOs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). These regulatory proteins utilise small linear motifs (SLiMs) to bind different surfaces of PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The most abundant and well characterised of these is the RVxF motif, which binds to a hydrophobic groove on the surface of PP1. Over 90% of cellular PP1 adaptors have an RVxF motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), which has the consensus sequence [KR][KR][VI]ψ[FW], where ψ is any amino acid except FIMYDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Many PP1 regulatory proteins possess more than one PP1-interacting SLiM (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>)) allowing combinatorial control of PP1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). One example of an ‘accessory’ SLiM is the ϕϕ[xF] motif, first identified via structural characterisation of PP1 in complex with spinophilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), which lies approximately 6–8 residues downstream of the RVxF motif and is present alongside the RVxF motif in most PP1 regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Like their cellular counterparts, viral PP1 regulatory proteins commonly contain an RVxF motif that is critical for PP1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), but the presence of additional SLIMs in these adaptors is less well explored.</p><p id="P5">HSV-1 pUL21 was recently identified as a novel viral PP1 regulatory protein that promotes virus replication and spread. HSV-1 pUL21 and its homologues across the alphaherpesviruses comprise two folded domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) that are linked by a flexible linker domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). PP1 binds pUL21 via a novel short linear motif, termed the Twenty-one Recruitment Of Protein Phosphatase One (TROPPO) motif, that is present in the linker region and is conserved across alphaherpesviruses. Mutation of the TROPPO motif abolishes the ability of either HSV-1 pUL21 or the Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) homologue (pORF38) to bind PP1. Loss of PP1 binding results in hyperphosphorylation of multiple proteins, both viral and cellular, in HSV-1 infected cells. pUL21 binding to PP1 regulates phosphorylation of components of the viral nuclear egress complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), which remodels the nuclear membrane to support virus maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). The pUL21:PP1 interaction also leads to dephosphorylation and thus hyperactivation of the ceramide transport protein CERT, altering sphingolipid metabolism in infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). This TROPPO motif does not bear obvious relation to known PP1 interacting motifs and pUL21 does not have any other known PP1 binding motifs such as an RVxF motif. The molecular basis of pUL21 binding to PP1 was thus unclear.</p><p id="P6">While inhibition of the ubiquitous and highly active enzyme PP1 is toxic, disrupting specific PP1 activities via blocking of specific interactions is a promising avenue for the design of new therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). The lack of homology with ‘RVxF’ motifs used by cellular PP1-binders suggested that the viral TROPPO motif might bind a novel surface on PP1 and thus could be specifically targeted by compounds that would inhibit virus replication and spread with minimal side-effects, as cellular functions of PP1 would remain uninhibited. We thus sought to determine how the TROPPO motif of HSV-1 pUL21 and its homologues bind PP1.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Plasmids</title><p id="P7">Bacterial expression plasmids encoding the mouse PP1γ catalytic domain (residues 7–300)-H<sub>6</sub> and pUL21-H<sub>6</sub>, and mammalian expression vectors encoding pUL21(FV242AA)-GFP, pORF38-GFP and pORF38(FV255AA)-GFP, was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).

Neither TROPPO-containing peptide was able to displace the GADD34 peptide, even when present at over 1000-fold molar excess (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). This suggested that either the TROPPO motifs do not bind PP1, or they bind a different site on the PP1 surface that does not overlap with the RVxF binding groove. ITC was employed to distinguish between these possibilities.

Strikingly, the region of the linker between the TROPPO motif and the C-terminal domain is significantly longer in HSV-1 and HSV-2 pUL21 than in other herpesviruses such as VZV, the pUL21 homologue of which (pORF38) is also capable of binding PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To probe the contribution of the linker region outside the TROPPO motif to PP1 binding, deletion mutants of HSV-1 pUL21 were designed lacking linker residues that precede the TROPPO motif (residues 216–237; pUL21ΔL), linker residues that follow the TROPPO motif (residues 257–276; pUL21ΔR), or both flanking regions (pUL21ΔLR).

As previously reported, pUL21 and pORF38 efficiently precipitate endogenous PP1α and the interaction is disrupted by mutation of the TROPPO motif (pUL21-FV242AA and pORF38-FV255AA). Strikingly, removal of the N-terminal region of the pUL21 linker (pUL21ΔL or pUL21ΔLR) completely abolishes PP1α binding, whereas binding is retained when the C-terminal region of the pUL21 linker is removed (pUL21ΔR).

In the predicted complex, N-terminal domain residues 209–212 and residues 242–248 of the TROPPO motif are predicted to become ordered, forming two strands of anti-parallel beta sheet that serve as a bridge between the three-stranded pUL21-N upper outer sheet and the final β-sheet of the PP1 catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Residues 221-223 of the Linker (L) region are also predicted to become ordered, forming a short β-strand that extends the pUL21-N inner sheet. We note that these newly-formed sheets are proximal to the amino terminus of pUL21, consistent with an inability of N-terminally GFP-tagged pUL21-N-plus-linker to bind PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p><p id="P21">All residues of the pUL21 TROPPO motif (<sub>239</sub>VSFVQVKHI<sub>248</sub>) are predicted to be in close association with PP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Surprisingly, the TROPPO motif is predicted to bind at the same surface hydrophobic groove as cellular RVxF-containing peptides, adopting a similar loop-plus-sheet conformation as GADD34 residues 553–568 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). The first residue of the TROPPO and the three preceding (<sub>236</sub>RATV<sub>239</sub>) of pUL21 align structurally with residues <sub>555</sub>KVRF<sub>558</sub> of the GADD34 RVxF motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>), with pUL21 A237 and V239 predicted to bind the PP1 hydrophobic pockets occupied by GADD34 V556 and F558 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Most cellular regulatory proteins that bind PP1 possess a second PP1-binding SLiM, ϕϕ[xF], that is C-terminal to the RVxF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). In the predicted complex, residues <sub>244</sub>VKHI<sub>247</sub> of the pUL21 TROPPO adopt a similar conformation to the GADD34 ϕϕ[xF] residues <sub>564</sub>VHFL<sub>567</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>).</p><p id="P22">We previously showed that pUL21 mutations F242E or V243D are sufficient to abolish PP1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). The severity of the V243D mutation is readily explained by the complex prediction, this residue is predicted to interact with hydrophobic residues on the surface of PP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1</xref>) and there is a valine at the equivalent position in GADD34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). The severity of the F242E mutation is less obvious when considering only the TROPPO motif, as the side chain is predicted to point away from PP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). However, it becomes clearer when one considers the context of pUL21-N and the residues of the linker that are predicted to become ordered. The side chain of F242 is predicted to be largely buried, interacting with hydrophobic side chains of pUL21 A48 and F50, plus the hydrophobic face of the R24 guanidyl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>). Mutation to a charged residue would be predicted to disrupt this packing. The TROPPO motif of pORF38 forms very similar interactions with both the pORF38 N-terminal domain and PP1 in the model of the pORF38:PP1 complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1</xref>). Loss of hydrophobic interactions would thus similarly explain why the FV255AA mutations abolished binding to PP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Site-directed mutagenesis confirms the predictive power of the pUL21:PP1 model</title><p id="P23">While the models of pUL21 and pORF38 in complex with PP1 were compellingly consistent with both each other and with previous results, structurally informed mutagenesis is required to rigorously test their predictive power. To this end, single amino acids mutations were introduced in both PP1 and pUL21, and their ability to interact in cells was probed by coIP.</p><p id="P24">For PP1, we utilised three published mutations that have all been show to severely decrease PP1 regulatory protein binding: F257A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), which is at the RVxF hydrophobic pocket into which the side chain of pUL21 V239 is predicted to bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>); and L289R or C291R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), which are on the final β-sheet of the PP1 catalytic domain and contribute to the RVxF hydrophobic surface with which pUL21 A237 is predicted to associate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). HEK293T cells were co-transfected with pUL21-GFP and WT or mutant Myc-PP1, and lysates were subjected to GFP affinity capture before SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The coIP of all three mutants was profoundly less efficient than for WT Myc-PP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, we consistently observed lower abundance of these mutants in the cell lysates used for IP analysis, suggesting lower expression or increased turnover in transfected cells. To account for this, the amount of input and bound Myc-PP1 was quantified and the ratio of bound:input was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), confirming that all three mutations significantly disrupt binding to pUL21-GFP.</p><p id="P25">For pUL21, a panel of mutations were designed to probe the predicted interactions of residues at the interface with both PP1 and pUL21-N. Five mutations were designed to disrupt the interaction: Q174R, which would replace a buried residue on pUL21-N sheet β14 that contacts Q244 of the TROPPO motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>); T209R, which would replace a small buried side chain that contacts pUL21-N with a large charged side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>); VV211AA, where two hydrophobic side chains (including one that is buried) in the sheet that bridges the TROPPO motif and pUL21-N β1 are removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>); A218E, where a small hydrophobic residue that interacts with a surface hydrophobic patch on PP1 is replaced with a charged residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>); and R250E, where the charge of a side chain that interacts with the PP1 D277 side chain is inverted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Three mutations were designed to enhance PP1 binding: A237V, substituting alanine for the canonical RVxF valine residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>); V239F, substituting valine for the canonical RVxF phenylalanine residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>); and H247F, substituting for the equivalent residue in GADD34 where the larger hydrophobic side chain could make more extensive interactions with the aryl portion of the PP1 K297 side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). A control mutation A232K was also introduced, as substitution of a small hydrophobic side chain for a large charged one on a mobile surface-exposed loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) would be predicted to leave PP1 binding unaltered.</p><p id="P26">HEK293T cells were transfected with WT or mutant pUL21-GFP and the coIP of endogenous PP1α was monitored by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Pleasingly, all designed mutations had the predicted effect: PP1α coIP was abolished by the Q174R, T209A, VV211AA and A218E substitutions, in addition to the control FV242AA mutation, and the R250E substitutions dramatically reduced binding. All proteins were present at similar abundance in the input samples and all retained binding to CERT, confirming their correct folding. As predicted, the surface-loop substitution A232K did not dramatically alter PP1α coIP. The A237V, V239F and H247F mutants all co-precipitated more PP1α than did WT pUL21-GFP, suggesting that all three have higher affinity for the PP1 catalytic subunit. Taken together, these mutagenesis results strongly support the predicted structure of the pUL21:PP1 complex.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Alphaherpesvirus proteins compete directly with cellular regulatory proteins for PP1 binding</title><p>Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the predictive power of the pUL21:PP1 complex, but the affinity of the interaction between PP1 and alphaherpesvirus pUL21 homologues remained unknown. Attempts to perform ITC using recombinant full-length pUL21 and PP1 catalytic domain were unsuccessful as neither protein could be concentrated sufficiently to serve as titrant in the syringe. Similarly, attempts to purify full-length pORF38 following recombinant expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> were frustrated by low protein expression and solubility. As the R region of the linker and C-terminal domain are dispensable for PP1 binding, we designed expression constructs encoding the pUL21 and pORF38 N-terminal domains plus the Linker region up to the end of the TROPPO motif (the NLT region) with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The pORF38-NLT construct was readily expressed and purified to concentrations suitable for ITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). ITC titration of pORF38-NLT into PP1 showed that the proteins form a 1:1 complex with affinity of 497 ± 143 nM (mean ± SEM, three independent experiments) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). This is substantially weaker binding than observed for the GADD34 peptide binding PP1 via fluorescence anisotropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) or ITC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>).</p><p id="P27">To definitively test whether pORF38 binds the same hydrophobic groove as cellular RVxF motifs, competition fluorescence anisotropy was performed via titration of pORF38-NLT into a pre-formed complex of PP1 plus the fluorescent GADD34 peptide.

Full-length pUL21 is unable to out-compete GADD34 for binding to PP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>), suggesting that the affinity of PP1 for full-length pUL21 is lower than for pORF38 – consistent with the observation that PP1α is consistently co-immunoprecipitated more efficiently by pORF38-GFP than by pUL21-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref> of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>)).

We previously identified HSV-1 pUL21 as a PP1 regulatory protein and that it contained a novel SLiM required for PP1 binding, the TROPPO motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). The absence of identifiable sequence homology with other known PP1-associated SLiMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) raised the tantalising possibility that the TROPPO motif binds PP1 via a novel surface that could be targeted for the development of antiviral compounds. Combining structure prediction, site-directed mutagenesis, immunoprecipitation and biophysical characterisation, we now show that the TROPPO motif binds the same hydrophobic surface of PP1 as cellular RVxF and ϕϕ[xF] SLiMs. Competition fluorescence anisotropy confirms that TROPPO-containing proteins compete directly with cellular RVxF and ϕϕ[xF] motifs for binding to PP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p id="P30">PP1 catalytic domains are unlikely to exist in their <italic>apo</italic> form within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) and, as such, pUL21 and pORF38 must compete with cellular regulatory proteins to access PP1 in infected cells. There are over 200 mammalian PP1 regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) and their affinities for PP1 range from ~10 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) to ~1 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Given the competition for binding, it is puzzling that pORF38 has evolved to bind PP1 with only modest affinity (~500 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). The PP1-binding of pUL21 must be even lower, as unlike pOPF38-NLT wild-type pUL21 cannot displace a GADD34 RVxF- and ϕϕ[xF]-containing peptide from PP1. One striking feature of the predicted pUL21:PP1 complex is that the TROPPO motif containing the ϕϕ[xF] motif lies sandwiched between PP1 and the pUL21-N, forming part of an extended β-sheet that bridges core β-sheets across the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). While the structure of regulatory protein spinophilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) showed a sheet-turn-sheet binding PP1 at the ϕϕ[xF] interacting region, adding two strands to the PP1 core β-sheet, we are unaware of any examples where the RVxF and ϕϕ[xF] form a structured bridge between PP1 and another folded domain. The formation of this extended sheet, with concomitant burial of hydrophobic residues like F242 into a newly-extended hydrophobic core of pUL21-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>), would stabilise the interaction between pUL21 and PP1 once formed. Such cooperativity would restrain the TROPPO motif in the correct conformation for PP1 binding despite the modest affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Published RVxF consensus sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) invariably have a valine or isoleucine and phenylalanine or tryptophan in the second and fourth position, respectively, whereas in pUL21 and pORF38 the equivalent residues are alanine and valine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). It is not clear that there are structural constraints preventing the virus from evolving an optimal RVxF motif since, like most regulatory protein regions that bind PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), the linker region of pUL21 is intrinsically disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Mutation of A237 to valine or V239 to phenylalanine enhances the coIP of PP1α by pUL21 in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>) and the A237V+V239R double substitution gives pUL21-RVxF the ability to compete with the GADD34 peptide for PP1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). HSV-1 encodes a second PP1 regulatory protein, ICP34.5, that has high sequence homology to GADD34 and binds PP1 via a canonical RVxF motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). There is thus nothing to prevent HSV-1 encoding a protein with a <italic>bona fide</italic> RVxF motif, and we hypothesise that selective pressure related to the molecular function of pUL21 has driven it to retain a suboptimal RVxF motif. Given the high degree of TROPPO sequence conservation across pUL21 homologues and corresponding absence of canonical RVxF motifs, we conclude that this evolutionary constraint must be common to all alphaherpesviruses.</p><p id="P32">What might drive these viruses to maintain a low-affinity PP1 recruitment domain? One clue comes from <italic>in vitro</italic> evolution experiments, where serial passage of HSV-1 encoding pUL21 mutated to prevent PP1 binding led to compensatory mutations in the virus-encoded kinase pUS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). These two proteins have overlapping substrates, with pUL21-mediated dephosphorylation directly antagonising pUS3 kinase activity. A balance of activity is clearly critical for the virus: abolishing expression of either pUS3 or pUL21 severely diminishes virus replication in cultured keratinocytes, as does removal of pUL21 PP1 binding, but passage of the PP1-binding pUL21 mutants led to rapid accumulation of mutations that lowered pUS3 kinase activity and restored virus fitness. The peak of pUL21 expression is at late times (18 hours) post-infection in cultured keratinocytes, whereas pUS3 abundance peaks at 6 hours post-infection and then declines slightly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). We hypothesise that the PP1-binding motif of pUL21 is specifically tuned to prevent effective PP1 binding at early times post-infection, when pUS3 activity is presumably pro-viral. Instead, the presence of a suboptimal PP1 interaction motif would allow pUL21 to effectively compete for PP1 binding only at late times post infection and in specific subcellular locations, for example the nuclear envelope, where the protein is highly abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). This fine-tuning of activity would be especially important for a multi-functional protein like pUL21, with roles cell-to-cell spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), preventing futile genome release by nascent viral capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) and virus assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>), in addition to its role in regulating viral nuclear egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). High affinity binding to PP1 could recruit phosphatase activity to the wrong cellular or viral complexes, or it could inappropriately sequester PP1 and thereby prevent other PP1-mediated dephosphorylation events within the cell that promote virus replication. Similar fine-tuning of PP1 recruitment has been observed for HIV, where mutation of the suboptimal QVCF motif to RVCF enhanced PP1 binding but reduced the ability of Tat to stimulate HIV transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P33">In conclusion, we show that the alphaherpesvirus pUL21 homologues bind the same PP1 hydrophobic surface groove as cellular RVxF and ϕϕ[xF] motifs. Extensive site-directed mutagenesis supports a predicted structure of the pUL21:PP1 complex where intrinsically disordered regions of the pUL21 linker fold into an extended β-sheet that bridges the cores of PP1 and the pUL21 N-terminal domain. The conservation of suboptimal binding residues within the region structurally equivalent to the cellular RVxF implies that the viruses have deliberately regulated PP1 binding affinity to support optimal virus replication. This highlights the careful regulation of kinase and phosphatase activity required to support efficient virus replication and spread. Our work also highlights how PP1 can be recruited by proteins lacking any identifiable PP1-binding SLiM, suggesting that the pool of viral and cellular PP1 regulatory proteins may be larger than previously imagined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Table S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS207603-supplement-Table_S1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d10aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS207603-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d10aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Owen Tutt (University of Cambridge) for technical assistance.
