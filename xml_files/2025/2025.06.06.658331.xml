However, pharmacological inhibition of the pathway is not uniformly effective across cancer types, or even within a single tumour. In this study, we leverage oblique plane microscopy (OPM) of breast cancer organoids containing molecular biosensors and lineage tracing approaches to uncover a source of heterogeneity in response to AKT inhibition. We find that organoids expressing <italic>KRT14</italic>, a marker of basal cells in the normal breast epithelium, are resistant to AKT inhibition. Furthermore, the master transcription factor of basal cell state, ΔNp63α, is sufficient to confer resistance to AKT kinase inhibition in human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) organoids. Our studies indicate that cells can transition between cell states within four weeks. This property means that AKT inhibition only delays tumour growth, with fully resistant tumours rich in KRT14+ cells resulting. Thus, resistance to AKT inhibition in TNBC exploits a repertoire of cell states and switching mechanisms inherent to the biology of the breast.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Heterogeneity between cancer cells can undermine the efficacy of therapy, with non-genetic and genetic mechanisms generating diversity in cancer cell states. In some cases, resistant cells arise after exposure to therapy, with cells entering a persister cell state prior to transitioning to a resistant state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">França et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>). In other cases, tumours contain a subset of cells that are therapy resistant before treatment, despite these mutations being truncal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Beumers et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Oren et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Russo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The PI3K pathway is activated in the majority of cancers, with mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>AKT</italic>, and <italic>PTEN</italic> observed in over half of all solid tumours, leading to increased glucose uptake as well as increased mTOR, and S6 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Fabrice et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Juric et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Koboldt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Mayer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Sanchez-Vega et al., 2018</xref>). These changes ultimately lead to increased glycolysis and protein synthesis, enabling tumour growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bosch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fruman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Le et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Leroy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Simond et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Varkaris, Pazolli, et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Vasan et al., 2019</xref>). The frequent activation of PI3K/AKT signalling in tumours and its central role in cell growth have led to development and clinical implementation of PI3K and AKT inhibitors. Pharmacological inhibition of either PI3K or AKT provides clinical benefit in certain contexts, although durable responses are rare with reactivation of mTOR and S6 kinase frequently observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Elkabets et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gris-Oliver et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Juric et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Schmid et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Turner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Varkaris, Fece de la Cruz, et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Intriguingly, not all tumour types with activation of PI3 kinase signalling benefit from therapies that target the pathway. AKT inhibition is a novel strategy in the United Kingdom to treat advanced ESR1+ breast cancer with abnormal <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>AKT1</italic> or <italic>PTEN</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Turner et al., 2023</xref>), but does not provide overall survival benefit in triple-negative disease despite frequent mutational activation of PI3 kinase signalling. Therefore, mutations alone are not sufficient to explain which tumours respond to inhibition of the pathway, nor are they sufficient to explain resistance. Recent work has suggested that tumour regression through Akt inhibition requires adoption of luminal-like features, supporting a role for non-genetic heterogeneity in cell states for resistance to AKT inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Schade et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Linking heterogeneity in cell state to dynamic changes such as cell signalling, cell metabolism, and ultimately cell fate following therapeutic intervention is challenging. Firstly, conventional cell culture models fail to recapitulate the cell states observed in patients. This can be overcome through the use of patient-derived xenografts and patient-derived organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Drost &amp; Clevers, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Grasset et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Guillen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Krieger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">LeSavage et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Roerink et al., 2018</xref>). Secondly, the majority of single-cell analysis technologies used to study inter-cellular variation are destructive, hence are not able to capture a cell’s history or future trajectory. Barcoding and lineage tracing strategies have been developed to overcome this problem, but these still struggle to capture the spatial context of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Goyal et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Weinreb et al., 2020</xref>). Live imaging approaches are well-suited to recording longitudinal data before and after therapeutic challenge and the spatial context of cells, with biosensors being deployed to reveal information about cell signalling and state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Conway et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hirata et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kondo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Le Marois et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Madsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Nguyen et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Ponsioen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Sparks et al., 2018</xref>). The advent of light-sheet imaging has transformed our ability to image three-dimensional models that closely recapitulate the biology of tumours, such as organoids and tissue explants. In particular, the development of light-sheet fluorescence microscope systems is beginning to enable large numbers of 3D structures to be imaged in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Beghin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">de Medeiros et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Maioli et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P6">We leverage several complementary experimental approaches to address the resistance of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to AKT inhibition in organoid and <italic>in vivo</italic> models. These analyses identify a subset of TNBC organoids that exhibit a signature positive for KRT14, a marker of basal cells in the normal breast, that resist a bottleneck selection pressure imposed by AKT inhibition. The resistant cell state is reversible and can be driven by ΔNp63α overexpression. Therefore, we propose that resistance to AKT inhibition in TNBC exploits a repertoire of cell states and reversible switching mechanisms inherent to the biology of the breast.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Recapitulation of heterogeneous breast tumour cell states</title><p id="P7">To investigate the phenotypic heterogeneity of triple negative breast cancer, we employed patient-derived xenograft organoids (PDXOs). GCRC1915, recapitulates histological and molecular features frequently observed in TNBC, including genetic alterations such as <italic>TP53</italic> mutation, gain of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and low expression of PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Savage et al., 2020</xref>). The heterogeneity of cell states in organoids and transitions between them was interrogated by combined single-cell sequencing with the LARRY barcode labelling strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Weinreb et al., 2020</xref>). For brevity, we termed this framework <bold>L</bold>arry <bold>B</bold>arcoding <bold>E</bold>xpansion and <bold>T</bold>reatment with <bold>O</bold>rganoid <bold>S</bold>orting and <bold>S</bold>equencing (LBETROSS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 1a</xref>). GCRC1915 organoids were dissociated, single cells transduced with lentivirus that expressed GFP with a barcode in the 3’ UTR sequence, seeded as single cells and grown for 7 days to allow organoid regrowth. GFP+ organoids were enriched and ultimately sequenced.</p><p id="P8">To apply this approach in tumours we made use of a custom-built organoid sampling platform coupled to live-cell microscopy, termed VISIBLE for GFP+ organoid enrichment, and then injected these into mice, where tumours formed and were harvested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 1a</xref> – left branch) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Joshi et al., 2025</xref>). Dissociated human cells were then processed for single-cell RNA sequencing and analysed. To assess how this model might relate to human breast cancer, we mapped onto this dataset 7 single-cell gene modules (GMs) previously described in a human breast cancer single-cell atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Distinct UMAP regions enriched for GM1, 2, 3, 6 and 7, and to a lesser extent GM4, were identifiable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 1b</xref>). Unsupervised cluster detection identified 3 cell clusters (Clusters I, II and III) that were enriched for specific gene modules, demonstrating that this model recapitulates gene expression profiles previously observed in human patients and encompasses heterogeneous phenotypic space to interrogate clonal dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We performed lineage analysis of cells expressing the ectopic GFP transcript that includes a unique barcode. Barcodes were detected in 5% of cells and 60 clonal groups with 4 or more cells were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Intriguingly, clonal groups were scattered between clusters with binomial testing revealing that 95% of these were present in multiple clusters, supporting that this model recapitulates non-genetic phenotypic heterogeneity that is a feature of TNBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c &amp; dd</xref>). These data also indicate that cells transition between phenotypic states within a six-week timeframe.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Non-genetic heterogeneity in response to AKT inhibition</title><p id="P10">Next, we investigated the relevance of this pre-existing heterogeneity on treatment response. Endpoint assays have recently been used to interrogate drug response in TNBC organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Guillen et al., 2022</xref>), however, we rationalised that treating them with varying concentrations of the Akt inhibitor, Capivasertib, for 4 days and performing timelapse imaging would be informative. We used a pre-trained neural network for object identification, followed by tracking, to derive growth rates for individual organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Ershov et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Pachitariu &amp; Stringer, 2022</xref>). For comparison, we treated the organoids with three other classes of cancer therapy; the microtubule stabiliser Paclitaxel, the platinum-based Cisplatin and the CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib. Resistance to Cisplatin, observed in the GCRC1915 PDX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Savage et al., 2020</xref>), was recapitulated by the organoid model, along with sensitivity to Paclitaxel. The organoids were also sensitive to Palbociclib. Intriguingly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref> shows that response to Capivasertib diverged from those of the other cytotoxic drugs. In particular, the Capivasertib dose-response had a shallower slope and there was a greater proportion of organoids that maintained a moderate growth rate even at high doses of the drug. This heterogeneity was clearly evident in the timelapse movies, with some organoids continuing to grow while others of similar size and in the same field of view did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Movie 1</xref>). Comparable results were obtained with the AKT inhibitor Ipatasertib, indicating that the variable response is not specific to Capivasertib (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">b</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">c</xref>). Analysis of PI3K inhibitors, an mTOR inhibitor, and a Cytohesin inhibitor suggested that PIK3CA was likely to be the key isoform acting upstream of AKT, and that mTOR was a critical downstream effector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 2d</xref>).</p><p id="P11">The heterogeneity in response to AKTi suggested that there may be a pre-existing resistant population of cells within the PDXO culture. To explore if this might be underpinned by a genetic subclone within GCRC1915, we isolated single cell-derived sub-lines of the PDXO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>). A power calculation based on the proportion of organoids that continued growing in the presence of Capivasertib indicated that 18 sub-lines would be sufficient to determine if a pre-existing resistant sub-clone was present with a significance level of &lt;0.05. The sub-lines were then tested for their response to Capivasertib. Of note, all 18 sub-lines of GCRC1915 were sensitive to Capivasertib and none grew in the presence of Capivasertib at the same rate as DMSO-treated controls, arguing against a genetic or at least phenotypically stable population of cells resistant to AKT inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Simultaneous evaluation of AKT activity, glucose metabolism, and organoid growth</title><p id="P12">The failure to respond to a therapy could reflect ineffective inhibition of the target, the lack of coupling between the target and key biological processes, or the lack of dependence of the resistant cells on the biological process regulated by the drug target. We sought to resolve these differing scenarios by measuring both single-cell AKT activity and glucose metabolism, along with whole-organoid features. We leveraged a custom-built dual-view oblique plane microscope (dOPM) to perform multi-dimensional live-cell imaging compatible with a multi-well plate format (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). GCRC1915 organoids were transduced using a piggyBac system to express a modified segment of the AKT substrate FOXO1 (FOXO1<sub>10A3D</sub>-mRuby2) that accumulates in the cytoplasm when phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gross et al., 2019</xref>), a glucose biosensor that reports on glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kondo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Takanaga et al., 2008</xref>), and a nuclear label for image processing purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Oliinyk et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b &amp; c</xref>). A bespoke pipeline was set up to analyse AKT activity and glucose levels in every cell of every organoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). Individual organoids were assigned a unique identity, and all cell metrics were linked to the organoid identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). Within the organoids, nuclei were segmented in 3D based on the H2B-miRFP670nano signal. This was used to generate both a nuclear mask and a perinuclear mask, encompassing a one-micron thick shell immediately outside the nucleus. This enabled us to determine the number of nuclei per organoid and derive an organoid growth metric. AKT activity was determined by dividing the FOXO1<sub>10A3D</sub>-mRuby2 signal in the perinuclear mask by the sum of the nuclear mask and the perinuclear mask, with higher values indicating greater AKT activity. Intracellular glucose levels were determined by ratiometric analysis of the Citrine sensitised emission and eCFP signals. Control experiments using Koningic acid and glucose-free media confirmed the fidelity of the glucose sensor, and additionally revealed an up-regulation of AKT activity when glucose was absent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 3a</xref>). Thus, we established methodology enabling direct <italic>in situ</italic> assessment of drug efficacy, the coupling of AKT to glycolysis, and organoid growth at scale.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Differential dynamics of AKT regulation and coupling to glucose distinguish organoids resistant to AKT inhibition</title><p id="P13">GRC1915 organoids were imaged immediately prior to the administration of drug, 24 hours later, and 96 hours later. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref> shows 50 representative DMSO and Capivasertib-treated organoids from one of 4 experimental replicates.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) incorporating both biosensor and morphological metrics were used to explore the diversity of cell states in the organoids. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref> shows changing cell metrics upon treatment. Cells treated with Koningic acid showed uniform changes. In contrast, Capivasertib-treated cells showed divergent responses with two distinct populations emerging at 96 hours. A similar divergence was observed when the response to Capivasertib was analysed at the organoid level, suggesting the majority of cells within an organoid respond in a similar manner to the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2g</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2h</xref> confirms that cell states in any given organoid group together 96 hours after drug treatment. Thus, our imaging platform reveals divergence in response to AKT inhibition at the organoid level.</p><p id="P14">We next interrogated how organoid metrics relate to their growth rate. Overlaying the growth rates indicated that the cluster containing the majority of the control organoids had a high growth rate, while the Capivasertib-treated organoids were split between the high growth rate cluster and a low growth rate cluster, thus confirming the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 3a</xref>). To gain further insights, we investigated correlations between metrics and replotted the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). Here, each column represents an organoid, and the columns are ranked based on growth rate (shown in the upper panel). The central and lower panels indicate the glucose sensor FRET signal and AKT activity at 96 hours, respectively. Every cell in an organoid is represented as a thin horizontal bar contributing to the height of the column, with taller columns indicating more cells in the organoid, and the cells are ranked in order of increasing glucose sensor FRET signal. These analyses reveal multiple aspects of the relationship between AKT, glucose levels, and growth in the presence or absence of AKT inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Firstly, control DMSO-treated organoids with higher baseline AKT signalling and glucose levels grew slightly faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). As expected, AKT inhibition reduced AKT activity and median glucose levels in organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 4a</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">b</xref>). Moreover, consistent with the premise that all cells within an organoid respond similarly, the standard deviation of the glucose FRET signal across all cells (DMSO-0.6864 and Capivasertib-0.8016) was greater than that within organoids (DMSO-0.4856 and Capivasertib-0.4560). However, not all organoids responded in the same way, with the fastest 15% Capivasertib-treated organoids in our dataset continuing to grow faster than the DMSO median (0.018 1/hour), and these maintained their glucose levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a.vi</xref> – note colour uniformity of columns).</p><p id="P16">The growth rate following AKT inhibition did not correlate with the magnitude of reduction in AKT activity in the 24 hours after drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b &amp; c</xref>). Therefore, the heterogeneity in organoid response is not due to some variability in the initial ability of Capivasertib to inhibit its target. Pre-treatment features of the organoids, such as glucose levels or size, did not predict coupling between AKT signalling and resistance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 4c</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">d</xref>). However, there was a subtle, but statistically significant, relationship between the growth rate following AKT inhibition and the change in glucose sensor signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 4e</xref>). This suggests that a subset of organoids has slightly weaker coupling between AKT activity and glucose levels.</p><p id="P17">Our longitudinal tracking of organoids to 96 hours enabled us to explore whether the durability of response to Capivasertib varied between organoids, and if this related to the efficacy of the drug in stopping organoid growth. Organoids that showed an increase in AKT activity between 24 - 96 hours had an increase in glucose levels during the same time window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). Crucially, these were the organoids that continued to grow in the presence of drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>). These data establish a clear link between heterogeneity in the durability of AKT inhibition and the downstream consequences of glucose regulation and cell growth. Moreover, because the organoids shared common media, we can exclude the possibility of differences in drug exposure. These data argue for inter-organoid heterogeneity in the wiring of AKT signalling feedback, with AKTi resistant organoids having a faster restoration of glucose levels following AKT inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Drug refractory organoids arise from pre-existing cells in a basal state</title><p id="P18">The diversity in the dependency of glucose levels on AKT in our model might reflect heterogeneity in cell state. Therefore, we sought to obtain a better understanding of the diversity of cell states both between organoids and within organoids. To this end, we leveraged the LBETROSS pipeline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 1a</xref> – right branch). Organoids were dissociated, single cells transduced with lentivirus that expressed GFP with a barcode in the 3’ UTR sequence, seeded as single cells and grown for 3 days. The organoids were then grown in the presence of either DMSO or Capivasertib for 4 days, and the resulting intact organoids were sorted for GFP expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">c</xref>). Flow cell imaging and subsequent size analysis confirmed our ability to sort organoids from both DMSO and Capivasertib-treated conditions and fluorescently labelled subsets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 5d</xref>). Subsequently, we analysed single cells by RNA sequencing.</p><p id="P19">UMAP analysis of 6623 cells revealed three major clusters, numbered 1-3, and two minor clusters, numbered 4 &amp; 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). All clusters were represented in both the control DMSO and Capivasertib-treated conditions, indicating that the cell states resistant to the drug are present in the drug naïve context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). No single marker perfectly delineated the different clusters. For example, <italic>KRT14</italic> is higher in cluster 2 and 3, but also present in a subset of cluster 1 and 5 cells, whereas <italic>SOX2</italic> only delineated a subset of cluster 2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). However, analysis of cell cycle phase revealed that clusters 1, 4, and 5 had a higher proportion of cells in G1 following AKT inhibition, whereas clusters 2 and 3 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>). Additionally, clusters 2 and 3 made up an increased proportion of total cells under Capivasertib-treated conditions, supporting a model where clusters 2 and 3 represent drug-resistant populations. Of note, these clusters were enriched for genes associated with basal-like breast cancer and mammary stem cells, including <italic>SOX2, CD44, KRT14, KRT5</italic> and <italic>TP63</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><p id="P20">The LBETROSS pipeline enables lineage analysis of cells and, consequently, the identification of cell states that contribute to the make-up of a given organoid. Barcodes could be detected in 37 to 54% of cells. A mean of 314 clonal identities could be detected per sample, with clone sizes ranging from 1 to 29 cells and an average of about 2 to 3 cells within each clonal group. A model favouring higher inter-organoid heterogeneity would be supported if cells from a given clonal barcode or organoid would predominantly map within one cluster. We restricted our analysis to clonal groups that contained at least 4 cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref> shows the five largest clonal groups from each condition overlayed onto UMAP space where we find that differences in gene expression within a given organoid is limited, with almost no barcodes being present in more than one cluster. Indeed, single cluster-contained clonal groups are the three most common distributions of clonal groups amongst gene expression clusters and binomial testing reveals that &gt;96% of clonal groups confidently belong to a single cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4f &amp; g</xref>). These data enable us to determine that switching between clusters requires more than seven days, which is the time between barcode introduction and transcriptomic analysis.</p><p id="P21">Together, these data support the idea that inter-organoid heterogeneity arises from the heterogeneity in the state of the individual cells that seed the organoid; for example, some are more basal and other more luminal, with the former being resistant to AKT inhibition. Within the time frame of the experiment, cells do not transition between states and, therefore, all cells within an organoid are in a similar state and show a similar response to AKT inhibition. Thus, intra-organoid heterogeneity in drug response is much less than inter-organoid heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Long-term resistance to AKT inhibition is linked to a basal cell state</title><p id="P22">We set out to determine if the traits associated with short-term AKTi resistance were similar to those in organoids exposed to drug for many weeks. Organoids were treated and passaged with Capivasertib for four weeks to generate a population of uniformly resistant organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>). Metabolomic characterisation confirmed that AKT inhibition had a greatly reduced impact on glucose-derived pyruvate and lactate in the resistant organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>). These organoids also had increased glucose-derived <sup>13</sup>C into the TCA cycle intermediates citrate, glutamate, fumarate, aspartate and malate. These data are consistent with data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, showing that the organoids capable of growth in the presence of Capivasertib have maintained their glucose levels. Similarly, the resistant organoids had slightly elevated levels of pS6 compared to parental organoids in the presence of Capivasertib (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 7a</xref>). However, the organoids had not entered a broadly drug-resistant cell state since sensitivity to Paclitaxel was not affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 7b</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">c</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Data presented thus far support a model where resistance to Capivasertib is driven by cell states underpinned by inter-organoid heterogeneity. Crucially, cessation of Capivasertib treatment led to a reversion to drug sensitivity within 4-6 weeks, further emphasising the non-genetic nature of the AKTi-resistant state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>).</p><p id="P24">The long-term Capivasertib-resistant organoids were next analysed by bulk RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>), and the results were cross-referenced with the single-cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>). There was a highly significant overlap between the genes up-regulated in resistant cell populations after 4 days and long-term drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>). Moreover, the genes up-regulated in the long-term drug-treated cells mapped to clusters 2 and 3 identified by LBETROSS. Analysis of genes concordantly regulated in both data sets revealed that resistant cells had a transcription profile with strong similarity to basal cells of the breast, notably high expression of <italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>KRT5</italic>, <italic>KRT14</italic>, and <italic>ITGA6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5e</xref>).</p><p id="P25">OPM imaging-based analysis confirmed that resistant organoids were highly enriched for KRT14 and that this state was reversible since Capivasertib-rested organoids appeared more similar to parental. There was no difference in organoid size between DMSO, resistant or capivasertib-rested organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 7d</xref>). KRT14 staining in DMSO-treated conditions also did not associate with organoid size, suggesting that both KRT14- and KRT14+ organoids are capable of growing and contributing to the population under standard growth conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 7e</xref>). Higher levels of ITGA6 and KRT14 in resistant organoids were confirmed by flow cytometry, with lower levels of EPCAM observed in resistant organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 7f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">g</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">h</xref>). Re-emergence of a ITGA6 low population occurred at 3 weeks after removal of Capivasertib from resistant organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 7i</xref>) and rested organoids displayed ITGA6, KRT14, and EPCAM levels similar to drug naïve organoids, confirming the reversibility of the resistant phenotype.</p><p id="P26">Having established that AKT inhibition selects for cells in a basal state, we sought to test if cells in a basal state were intrinsically resistant to AKT inhibition. Drug-naïve cells in more basal states were sorted on the basis of ITGA6 expression and subjected to AKT inhibition. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 7j</xref> shows that ITGA6 high basal drug-naïve cells are enriched for cells that grow under AKT inhibition, whereas ITGA6 low luminal cells were predominantly drug sensitive. Altogether, these data support a model whereby a pre-existing cell state with features of normal breast basal cells is resistant to AKT kinase inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>ΔNp63 is sufficient to confer resistance to AKT inhibition</title><p id="P27">We sought to identify the critical cell state regulators driving the transition into the basal drug resistant state. Using ChEA3, we compared transcription factor targets and genes enriched in Capivasertib-resistant organoids that overlapped with either cluster 2 or 3 from the LBETROSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Keenan et al., 2019</xref>). This revealed a strong overlap with TP63 target genes. The transcription factor ΔNp63α is an established regulator of the basal cell lineage in the mammary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Wuidart et al., 2018</xref>). Overexpression of ΔNp63α, promoted elevated expression of basal cell markers ITGA6 and KRT14 and reduced levels of EPCAM, whereas the effect was comparatively more attenuated when overexpressing a DNA-binding domain mutant (R304W) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 7k</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">l</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">m</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">n</xref>). More strikingly, ΔNp63α overexpression also rendered organoids insensitive to Capivasertib, whereas organoids expressing the R304W mutant were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5g</xref>). Thus, the drug resistant state arises as a result of the endogenous program that determines basal cell identity.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>A basal-like cell state is enriched in Capivasertib-treated tumours</title><p id="P28">To directly test whether a Capivasertib-resistant state might make up a significant portion of a pre-established tumour we used a 106-gene signature, which we name CaRe63, made up of ΔNp63α targets that were upregulated in Capivasertib-resistant organoids. We interrogated our scRNA sequencing dataset of LARRY-labelled tumours with this approach and identified a subpopulation of cells that mapped to Cluster II and another that mapped to Cluster III, which was also characterised by upregulation of KRT14 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a and b</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis of Cluster III markers identified gene sets for basal-like breast cancer, many of which were also identified in Capivasertib-resistant clusters <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c</xref>). Therefore, multiple pre-existing cell states might provide the phenotypic landscape required for a tumour to quickly escape therapeutic intervention.</p><p id="P29">To test this hypothesis, we generated vehicle-treated and Capivasertib-resistant tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d and e</xref>). Capivasertib significantly impaired tumour growth, however the tumour endpoint was only delayed and endpoint was reached 3 weeks after vehicle control tumours. Multiplexed immunostaining confirmed the presence of heterogeneous cell states in control tumours. Concordant with scRNA sequencing analysis, control tumours contained a mixture of KRT14 positive and negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6f</xref>). KRT14 positive cells were typically located near laminin, which denoted blood vessels and the edge of tumour cell nests. These KRT14 positive cells had higher pS6 and Ki67 staining indicating that they are likely to be responsible for continued tumour growth. Capivasertib-treated tumours exhibited less heterogeneity and were dominated by KRT14 positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6g</xref>). Although we observed a decrease in phospho-S6 levels following AKT inhibition, it was above the levels in KRT14 negative cells in control tumours and Ki67 levels were maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6h</xref>), suggesting sufficient pathway activity for cell growth. Interestingly, KRT14 positive cells were no longer confined to regions surrounding laminin staining but were uniformly distributed. These data establish that within 2-3 weeks Capivasertib treatment leads to the dominance of more basal KRT14 positive breast cancer cells.</p><p id="P30">Finally, we sought to relate our observations to patient data. We used the CaRe63 signature to interrogate both inter-patient and intra-patient heterogeneity amongst human breast cancer described in Wu et al. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6i</xref>, shows that some patients were uniformly low for CaRe63 (CID4495 &amp; CID44971), while others exhibited intra-tumour heterogeneity similar to that observed in our experiments (CID4513, CID4515 &amp; CID4523). We propose that the former patients would benefit from Capivasertib, while the latter would not. Together, these analyses demonstrate that AKT inhibitor resistance is linked to the inherent biology of the breast, with basal cells exhibiting reduced coupling of AKT to S6 and regulation of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6j</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">The high frequency of mutations in <italic>PI3K</italic> isoforms, <italic>PTEN</italic>, and <italic>AKT</italic> make the pathway an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. However, not all tumours respond and responses are not always durable. Phase III clinical trials demonstrated overall efficacy of AKT inhibition using Capivasertib in ER+ disease, but not TNBC. Using a 3D culture system of human TNBC organoids we have uncovered a non-genetic resistant cell state driven by ΔNp63α. We have used orthogonal approaches including a modified Luria-Delbruck assay, LBETROSS, metabolomics and more conventional molecular biology techniques. However, live imaging has the key advantage of being non-destructive and enabling varying cell states to be unambiguously and directly linked to different cell fates, such as cell proliferation or cell death. Capturing the intra-tumour heterogeneity recapitulated by 3D organoids requires microscopes with high resolution in all spatial dimensions that can operate at light levels that are not damaging to cells. In principle, conventional light-sheet microscopy is well suited for organoid imaging, but the requirement for orthogonal objectives makes sample preparation and mounting very challenging, especially if many hundreds of organoids are to be imaged in parallel. Therefore, technological limitations may restrict lines of inquiry relating to biological variability in therapeutic responses. To overcome this challenge, we implemented dual-view OPM that uses only a single objective and is compatible with a wide range of multi-well plate formats enabling multi-channel imaging of organoids structures up to ~200 µm in size. In this work, we have imaged 1530 organoids with single-cell resolution across conditions that included both live cell and fixed cells. This throughput allowed us to understand a subset of TNBC organoids that are refractory to AKT inhibition.</p><p id="P32">The observed resistant state exhibited poor coupling between glucose metabolism with AKT activity and these organoids exhibited enhanced shunting of glucose-derived carbon to citric acid cycle intermediates. This cell state is likely to pre-exist in many TNBC cases and our analysis indicates that cells can transition in and out of this state on a timescale of between one and four weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cheung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Khalil et al., 2024</xref>). Over time, epigenetic modifiers may drive TNBC cells towards what are normally rare or sporadic cell states that, when combined with AKT inhibition, trigger a cell death program with similarities to involution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Marsolier et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Schade et al., 2024</xref>). Together, this may reflect differing requirements for extracellular cues in secretory luminal cells or contractile basal cells. Supporting this hypothesis, different metabolic sensitivities have been described for the normal breast epithelial cell subtypes, suggesting that normal epithelial programs are contributing to resistance to Akt inhibition in what has been described to be a heterogeneous tumour type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Mahendralingam et al., 2021</xref>). In our model, this was recapitulated by the observed inter-organoid heterogeneity. Hence, this work offers an explanation for the differing success of AKT inhibition in ER+ breast cancer, which is more luminal in its cell states, and TNBC, which exhibits basal-like characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Organoid lines, plasmids and compounds</title><p id="P33">GCRC1915 PDXO parental organoid lines were generated from the GCRC1915Tc PDX (Savage et al.).

This system is described in detail elsewhere (CITATION) but briefly, the robotic manipulation consists of an XY gantry with tool-head and its motion is controlled by 2 stepper motors (Bipolar Hybrid Stepper Motor Nema 17) arranged in a core XY coordination. For motion control in Z axis, a customized in-house developed screw rail-based mechanism is employed with a stepper motor (Bipolar Hybrid Stepper Motor Nema 11). Mechanical limit switches are installed for homing the axes. Stepper motors and limit switches are controlled with firmware installed on Smothieboard V2.

After 3 days, media was removed, cells lysed and mRNA isolated according to manufacturer’s instructions, including on column Dnase digest (QIAGEN Rneasy mini kit).</p><p id="P69">Sequencing libraries were prepared using the KAPA mRNA HyperPrep Kit (Roche, kit code KK8581) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, samples were normalised to 50 ng of RNA in a final volume of 50 µl. PolyA-tailed RNA was captured with 50 ul of capture beads at 65 °C for 2 min and 20 °C for 5 min. Beads were washed to remove other RNA species and RNA was eluted from the beads in 50 ul of RNase free water by incubating at 70 °C for 2 min and 20 °C for 5 min. A second capture of PolyA-tailed RNA was performed by adding 50 µl of bead binding buffer and the sample incubated for 5min at 20 °C. Beads were washed to remove other RNA species and eluted in 20 µl of Fragment, Prime and Elute Buffer. The fragmentation reaction was run for 6 min at 94 °C for a library insert size of 200-300 bp. Fragmented RNA underwent first and second strand cDNA synthesis according to manufacturer instructions. The KAPA Unique Dual-Indexed Adapters Kit (15μM) (Roche-KK8727) stock was diluted to 1.5 µM as recommended by the manufacturer for a total RNA input of 50 ng. The adaptor ligation was carried out by adding 5 µl of diluted adaptor and 45 µl of ligation mix (50 µl of ligation buffer + 10 µl of DNA ligase) to 60 µl of cDNA. The ligation reaction was run for 15 mins at 20 °C. To remove short fragments such as adapter dimers, two SPRISelect bead clean-ups were done (0.63x SPRI and 0.7x SPRI). To amplify the library, 25 µl of Kapa HiFi HotStart PCR master mix plus 5 µl of Library Amplification Primer mix was added to 20 µl cDNA and 14 PCR cycles were performed as recommended by the manufacturer for a total RNA input of 50 ng. Amplified libraries were purified via a SPRISelect 1x bead cleanup.</p><p id="P70">The quality and fragment size distributions of the purified libraries was assessed by a 4200 TapeStation Instrument (Agilent Technologies). An average of 25 million paired end reads per library (PE100) were generated on a NovaSeq6000 (Illumina). All samples were processed using the nf-core RNAseq pipeline (v.3.10.1) operating on Nextflow (v.22.10.3) (68, 69). Settings for individual tools were left as standard for this workflow version unless otherwise specified. Alignment to GRCm38 (release 95) was performed using STAR (v2.7.10a) (64), followed by quantification using RSEM (v1.3.1) (63). Results were further processed in R (version 4.2.0) (67). Outputs of the RNAseq pipeline were assessed for quality using the metrics provided by the pipeline's inbuilt quality control packages, PCA (package stats v4.2.0), and correlation analyses between samples (package stats v4.2.0). Differential expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 (v1.38.3) (66), using a model accounting for differences in replicate and treatment (~ replicate + treatment). The significance threshold for the identification of differentially expressed genes was set as an adjusted P value ≤0.05, where P values were adjusted for false discovery rates according to the Independent Hypothesis Weighting method (package IHW, v1.26.0) (70, 71).
