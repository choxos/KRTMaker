While the inter- and transgenerational effects of fasting are increasingly studied, they remain poorly understood in species with unconventional reproductive roles. Investigating such effects in these systems is crucial, as the evolutionary trade-offs between somatic maintenance and reproductive investment may differ from those in species with conventional reproductive roles. In this study, we investigated the effects of intermittent fasting (IF) in a species with male pregnancy, <italic>Syngnathus typhle,</italic> by exposing mothers and fathers to either IF or ad libitum (AL) feeding before mating. Upon transfer of maternal eggs to paternal brood pouches, males remained on their assigned diets throughout pregnancy. Offspring from all parental diet combinations AL(p)xAL(m), IF(p)xIF(m), AL(p)xIF(m), IF(p)xAL(m) were analyzed at birth before first feeding alongside parents for morphology, immune and epigenetic candidate gene expression, and gut microbiota composition. Mothers under IF showed greater condition loss, leading to reduced offspring condition regardless of paternal diet, highlighting the importance of maternal provisioning through eggs. However, IF fathers exhibited increased immune activation and microbiome shifts that were mirrored in offspring, suggesting paternal priming via epigenetic and microbial inheritance. Offspring from mismatched parental diets showed disrupted immune-microbiome correlations, indicating that aligned parental cues support more stable offspring development. These findings highlight how parental nutritional history shapes offspring resilience and emphasize the value of studying species with diverse reproductive strategies and life histories to understand the full spectrum of trans-generational plasticity in nature.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">An organism’s traits are shaped not only by the genes it inherits, but also by non-genetic influences from the environment (within-generational phenotypic plasticity, WGP), as well as the conditions the parents experienced (trans-generational plasticity, TGP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). DNA-independent inheritance can occur through multiple, often overlapping, routes including reproductive elements such as eggs (and to a lesser extent sperm), as well as through parental care, feeding, or other forms of close contact. These routes transmit a diverse array of information: for instance, eggs may carry maternal hormones and metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), epigenetic marks shaped by parental life history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), immunological components such as antibodies (i.e., transgenerational immune priming - TGIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), and even vertically inherited microbial communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). In contrast, postnatal influences such as parental care or feeding may shape offspring phenotype through continued microbial transfer, behavioral imprinting, or immune priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Understanding the relative contributions of these factors to the expression of offspring phenotypes and ultimately their fitness, and how they change over time, is crucial for predicting how organisms acclimatize, and ultimately adapt, to new and changing environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). While plasticity, including TGP, can buffer organisms against stress in the short term, it can also generate phenotypic variation, some of which may confer a fitness advantage under novel conditions and thus be favored by selection, potentially buying time for genetic changes to follow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p><p id="P3">When mothers experience changes in their environment, this can alter offspring development via maternal effects, even in the absence of direct exposure during the offspring’s own early experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). For example, a child may grow up in a food-rich environment but exhibit traits shaped by maternal exposure to food scarcity (e.g., increased fat deposition). These traits could become beneficial if the child later encounters similar conditions. Since the mother has already navigated a famine or nutrient scarcity, she may pass down helpful cues to prepare her offspring for similar challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). In some cases, phenotypic adjustment in response to current environmental cues (WGP) may offer a better match to local conditions than relying on parental cues. However, when rapid or early-life responses are required, offspring may benefit from parental pre-conditioning via TGP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). A well-documented example of the phenomenon of gestational programming is the development of a “thrifty phenotype” in offspring of mothers who faced nutritional constraints during pregnancy. Offspring of mothers with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) often have low birth weight and are predisposed to metabolic diseases like obesity, hypertension, and diabetes later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). These offspring are programmed to efficiently acquire and use nutrients, a trait advantageous in environments with scarce food. However, in nutrient-rich settings, such acclimatization can lead to negative maladaptive outcomes like obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Across some mammalian species, including rats and sheep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), studies have shown similar links between maternal nutrient deficiencies during pregnancy and adult health issues in the offspring, further highlighting the broad impact of maternal experiences on offspring development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Paternal effects are often overlooked in transgenerational research, partly because fathers do not gestate offspring and may have limited parental involvement. However, growing evidence suggests that fathers play a significant role in inheritance beyond genetics, particularly through sperm-mediated effects such as epigenetic modifications and small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Advances in epigenetics are shifting the research landscape to recognize these paternal contributions. In parallel, genetic factors such as increased germline mutations with paternal age can also affect offspring health and lifespan by reducing sperm quality and integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Age-related changes can also affect resource allocation to ejaculate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), and in some species, offspring of older fathers have shorter lifespans and a higher incidence of chronic illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), likely resulting from a combination of genetic and phenotypic changes associated with aging and cumulative environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Beyond age, paternal diet can also shape offspring health, influencing metabolic function and early developmental outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Studies have shown that exposure to a high-fat diet before mating can alter offspring traits, including body weight and metabolic parameters, though these effects vary across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). These findings underscore the importance of considering paternal trans-generational plastic effects in shaping offspring development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Although parental effects have been studied across diverse taxa, including insect and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), many models of trans-generational plasticity focus on species with conventional reproductive roles, where females typically both gestate and provide the majority of parental care. As a result, we still lack a clear understanding of how both parents’ environmental experiences - before and during reproduction - contribute to offspring phenotype, particularly in species with unconventional reproductive strategies. Teleost fish exhibit a remarkable range of variation in parental care strategies. Among those species that do exhibit parental care, approximately half provide exclusive paternal care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). In particular, the Syngnathidae family is renowned for its exceptionally dedicated male parental care, having evolved a range of male brooding forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).</p><p id="P6">These adaptations span from the simple attachment of eggs to the male’s ventral surface (e.g., <italic>Nerophis ophidion</italic>) to the development of highly specialized brooding structures (e.g., <italic>Hippocampus erectus).</italic> These brooding structures are analogous to those found in eutherian mammals, and they can provide the developing embryos with protection, nutrients, oxygen, and immunological components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Furthermore, they can mediate transgenerational effects in response to environmental conditions such as salinity levels affecting offspring gene expression and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), and shape the external juvenile microbiome through paternal provisioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Remarkably, the phenomenon of male pregnancy has its origins in a single evolutionary event, which then gave rise to approximately 300 distinct species of syngnathid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). The Syngnathidae family can be found in a broad range of temperate and tropical environments, including rocky and coral reefs, mangrove forests, seagrass beds, estuaries, and rivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Species like the broadnosed pipefish (<italic>Syngnathus typhle</italic>), with their reversed reproductive roles and male pregnancy, offer a unique opportunity to disentangle the contributions of maternal egg production from the physiological changes associated with paternal pregnancy (e.g., body reshaping and energy allocation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). In this pipefish species, females typically produce on average more eggs than males can brood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>), making males the more reproductively constrained sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Due to their polygamous mating system and the males’ limited reproductive capacity, males become the more choosy sex, often preferring larger females, while females exhibit ornamentation and actively court males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). This species’ non-conventional mating system and male pregnancy make it an ideal model for studying how parental effects and resource allocation are shaped by sex-specific reproductive strategies. It allows for a more nuanced understanding of how males and females may influence offspring development differently, especially when disentangling gestational vs. sex-specific effects on offspring phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>).</p><p id="P8">In this study we examined the influence of dietary restriction in <italic>Syngnathus typhle</italic> by subjecting both males and females to intermittent fasting (IF) for a month prior to reproduction. Specifically, the experimental conditions included a twice-daily feeding schedule with live food for ad libitum (AL) conditions, or IF with a feeding day followed by two fasting days. Individuals were then mated following various dietary combinations, with paternal (p) vs. maternal (m) combinations, hereafter abbreviated as AL (p) x AL (m), IF (p) x IF (m), AL (p) x IF (m), and IF (p) x AL (m). The IF treatment was continued for males throughout their pregnancy. After offspring birth, the young were sacrificed before first feeding alongside their parents to assess morphological characteristics, immune- and epigenetic-related gene expression, and gut microbiota composition through 16S rRNA sequencing. We hypothesized that offspring from IF parents would be morphologically smaller than those from AL parents, due to limited parental resource availability. Because males gestate the offspring in <italic>Syngnathus typhle</italic>, we expect paternal diet to have a stronger influence on offspring traits. In particular, that the offspring’s gut microbiota and immune-related gene expression would reflect paternal feeding conditions, consistent with transgenerational plasticity mediated by male pregnancy.</p><p id="P9">Our findings open new avenues to explore how parental diet and sex-specific reproductive roles influence offspring development, particularly in species with reversed reproductive roles and male pregnancy. This study provides critical insights into transgenerational effects, gestational influences, and the role of the microbiome in offspring health, while challenging existing paradigms by considering both maternal and paternal effects in shaping offspring phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Study species and collection area</title><p id="P10"><italic>Syngnathus typhle</italic> were caught in the southwest Baltic Sea on the island Fehrman at the bay of Orth (54° 272 N, 11° 32 O) late April of 2022, using snorkelling gear and hand nets. The broadnosed pipefish were then transported back to Kiel University in appropriate containers connected to air stones filled with Baltic Sea Water from the field. At the institute, they were divided into sex-aggregated quarantine tanks maintained at 18 ppt salinity and 12°C. To prevent the introduction of harmful parasites into the aquaria, the fish received three, one-hour anti-parasite treatments using a 37% formalin solution at a 1:8000 concentration. Subsequently, the fish were allocated to sex-disaggregated 100-liter tanks (50Lx40Wx51D), where they were gradually acclimated over two weeks to their new environment. During this period, they were transitioned from live food to frozen mysids. The final water temperature was maintained at 18 °C, and fish were kept under a simulated day-night light cycle (i.e., 14L:10D).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2.2</label><title>Experimental design</title><p id="P11">Pipefish were tagged with elastomer implants in red, blue, or orange, by lightly sedating them with 0.02% Tricaine mesylate (MS-222, Sigma-Aldrich).

During this brief procedure, the fish were also measured for size and weight.</p><p id="P12">The tagged fish were then sorted into groups of three (one red, one blue, and one orange), separated by sex, and housed in 28 aquaria. Each aquarium was randomly assigned to either ad libitum (AL) food or intermittent fasting (IF) treatment (total n = 84: 21 AL males, 21 AL females, 21 IF males, 21 IF females). Fish in the AL treatment were fed defrosted mysids twice daily (8 a.m. and 4 p.m.), while those in the IF treatment were fed every third day, leading to two consecutive days of fasting. Given that <italic>Syngnathus typhle</italic> lack stomachs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>), overfeeding was unlikely; thus, the fasting group experienced a caloric reduction. To ensure observed effects were due to fasting and not nutrient deficiencies, both groups received enriched mysids every 6th day. The food was supplemented with multivitamins (15 μL of JBL Atvitol) and fatty acids (Omega-3 1000 capsules), allowed to absorb into the thawed mysids for 2-3 minutes. The feeding regime lasted 30 days, during which the water temperature was gradually increased by 1°C every five days to reach 18°C, simulating the natural conditions of the Baltic Sea known to trigger optimal mating behaviour in pipefish.</p><p id="P13">After the month-long treatment, the pipefish were removed from their respective aquaria and paired for mating, creating the following crosses (each replicated 7 times): AL (p) × AL (m), IF (p) × IF (m), AL (p) × IF (m), and IF (p) × AL (m). A mating window of 24-48 hours was provided, which is typically sufficient for successful mating, as both sexes had been separated for a month and were primed to mate at 18°C. Pregnant males were returned to their treatment tanks, while females were euthanized with an overdose of MS-222 (500 mg/L), measured for total body length and weight, and dissected for further analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The pregnant males were kept on their AL or IF diet and approximately one month later, they gave birth. At the time of birth, five offspring (or as many as were present) were collected from each male. Both the fathers and offspring were euthanized, measured, and dissected. The initial tagging and tank assignments allowed for accurate matching of each fish to its initial size and weight measurements.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.3</label><title>Sample collection</title><p id="P14">After euthanasia, parental pipefish were dissected to remove the head kidney and liver, which were placed into 2 mL Eppendorf tubes containing RNAlater.

Reproductive strategies might profoundly influence non-genetic inheritance, i.e., parental care might enhance the opportunity for sex-specific trans-generational transfer fostered by intimate contact of one parent to the offspring. The timepoint of transfer of parental experience, e.g., whether during the fusion of egg and sperm, or, alternatively, during pre- or postnatal parental care, transfer of parental experience occurs, might additionally shape the outcome and role of non-genetic inheritance in offspring life. To gain a comprehensive understanding of how parental experiences shape subsequent generations, we must expand our perspective beyond the familiar and explore systems where the functions of sex, care, and gestation are dissociated.</p><p id="P51">The broadnosed pipefish, with its reversed sex roles and male pregnancy, presents a rare opportunity to disentangle the effects of maternal provisioning from the physiological impacts of gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). This species’ exceptional reproductive strategy makes it an ideal model for exploring how sex-specific parental environmental stressors shape offspring phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>). By leveraging this distinct reproductive system, our study aimed to disentangle the relative contributions of maternal provisioning and the paternal gestational environment to offspring development, offering novel insights into how sex-specific and gestational effects interact under nutritional stress. In the present study, we examined the influence of parental diet on offspring development by exposing both male and female <italic>S. typhle</italic> to either intermittent fasting (IF) or ad libitum (AL) feeding prior to mating, and continuing the IF regime during male pregnancy. We then assessed morphological traits, immune and epigenetic gene expression, and gut microbiota composition in both parents and their offspring. While our design captures both maternal and paternal contributions, including paternal care via male pregnancy, it is possible that some of the observed offspring effects stem from early, pre-fertilization influences such as epigenetic modifications in gametes. Distinguishing between such pre- and post-fertilization mechanisms is a key future goal which requires comparative experimental approaches between closely related species along a parental care gradient. This study provides a first stepping stone toward disentangling the relative roles of gametic programming and parental provisioning in shaping offspring phenotype.</p><p id="P52">The IF regime imposed a clear energetic cost, as evidenced by reduced growth in length and weight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3a&amp;b</xref>), and declines in Fulton’s condition index (K) in both sexes over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). Notably, only IF females were in a weaker endpoint condition compared to their AL counterparts (P &lt; 0.03), despite males also exhibiting fat loss (P = 0.009, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>) and suppressed growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). This is particularly striking given that males were subjected to the IF regime for twice as long as females. Females showed no reduction in fat content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>), suggesting that the decline in K may reflect loss of lean tissue such as muscle. This female-specific sensitivity is striking, particularly given that males where fasted for twice as long. A similar pattern has been reported in <italic>Hippocampus erectus</italic>, where caloric restriction affected condition in females but not males, and was linked to female-biased metabolism and fat storage strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). Such sex-specific responses are conserved across taxa: in mice, for instance, males tend to preserve muscle and bone by mobilizing fat stores, while females resist fat loss and instead catabolize lean mass, often alongside reproductive suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>). Our findings suggest that female pipefish may similarly be more vulnerable to fasting, possibly due to sex-specific energy allocation strategies. Alternatively, males may have compensated for long-term restriction through physiological or behavioural adjustments.</p><p id="P53">Although offspring morphology was only marginally affected by parental dietary treatment - mean lengths across groups were fairly similar (~21–23 mm), and IF(p)xIF(m) offspring trended towards lower weight - we detected a significant difference in offspring condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Specifically, offspring from AL(p)xIF(m) crosses had a lower condition index compared to those from AL(p)xAL(m) crosses (Dunn test, P = 0.048; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Since juveniles were measured immediately after birth, it is possible that latent or delayed morphological effects could emerge later in development (e.g., in growth rate, behaviour, or survival). Nonetheless, these findings indicate that maternal physiological state or egg provisioning plays a crucial role in shaping early juvenile condition, even in a species that exclusively relies on post-fertilization paternal care. A well-fed father (AL) was unable to fully buffer against the consequences of reduced maternal input (IF), while offspring from fasted fathers and well-fed mothers (IF(p)xAL(m)) showed no such deficit, even though paternal feeding conditions remained throughout pregnancy. This asymmetry highlights the central role of maternal investment in early development in fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>). While males in <italic>S. typhle</italic> contribute significantly through gestation, egg quality remains a limiting factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>). Our results suggest that maternal provisioning can more effectively compensate for suboptimal paternal condition than vice versa, possibly because females are able to prioritize and sustain ovarian function even under IF - drawing on somatic reserves at the expense of body condition -while incurring a lower energetic cost than males investing in pregnancy.</p><p id="P54">Principal component analysis of gene expression profiles showed that variation was predominantly structured by life stage (offspring vs. parents), with only subtle effects of dietary treatment emerging on PC3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4a-c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). In females, <italic>DnMt3A</italic> - a key regulator of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>)-was the only gene to surpass both the significance threshold and a logFC of 0.5 under IF treatment. All adult fish were sampled immediately after completing their respective reproductive investment (i.e., egg production in females, pregnancy in males) to capture gene expression signatures at the biologically relevant endpoint of parental allocation. The modest transcriptional response in females may reflect a combination of shorter IF exposure and sex-specific physiological strategies. Indeed, this limited change aligns with our phenotypic observations, where females exhibited reduced condition but no measurable fat loss, suggesting distinct energy mobilization and possibly constrained regulatory flexibility under dietary stress. In contrast, IF males exhibited a broader molecular shift with pronounced upregulation of genes associated with the adaptive immune response, including <italic>AIF, CD45, TAP,</italic> and <italic>IgM.1c,</italic> alongside elevated expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (<italic>IL10</italic> and <italic>int1</italic>) and a downregulation of the complement component <italic>C1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This transcriptional profile is consistent with established immunological responses to intermittent fasting. IF is known to enhance autophagy, a cellular process that facilitates the clearance of intracellular pathogens and damaged components, while reducing oxidative stress through decreased ROS levels and increased SIRT1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>). Furthermore, the observed downregulation of <italic>C1,</italic> a component of the classical complement pathway, aligns with the shift toward an anti-inflammatory and possibly more immune-tolerant state under energetic constraint. The upregulation of CD45 - a pan-leukocyte marker critical for T and B cell receptor signalling - further suggests that fasting stimulates immune cell viability and activity, possibly through autophagy-mediated pathways. In mammals, short-term intensive fasting has been shown to enhance the survival and function of CD45+ leukocytes by reducing apoptosis and promoting cytokine secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>), a mechanism that may be evolutionarily conserved and similarly activated in <italic>S. typhle.</italic> These findings suggest that male pipefish adjust their immune expression more readily than females under nutritional stress, perhaps reflecting the physiological demands of male pregnancy. Under nutritional stress, this balance might shift -forcing the immune system to compensate more strongly to maintain both pouch health and self-protection. Reduced investment in growth or fat stores under IF allows reallocation of limited resources to immune defence, especially in pregnant males.</p><p id="P55">The upregulation of immune-related genes in IF males coincided with significant shifts in gut microbial composition, suggesting a potential link between microbial signals and host immune modulation. Specifically, IF males showed increased abundance of <italic>Pseudoalteromonas,</italic> a genus within Proteobacteria also found to dominate in calorie-restricted seahorses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> are known to support gut health by promoting epithelial integrity and facilitating colonization by strict anaerobes, while also influencing mucosal immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>). In contrast, AL-fed males displayed higher levels of <italic>Brevinema,</italic> a genus previously associated with fish mucus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>) and notably implicated in paternal-specific microbial transmission in Syngnathids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). This microbial shift may reflect not only differences in dietary input, but also immunological state, as <italic>Brevinema</italic> dominance in AL males was paralleled by reduced expression of immune genes relative to the more activated immune profile of IF males. Given that IF has been shown to enhance epithelial barrier function and modulate immune responses through microbiota-driven mechanisms, it is plausible that the microbial changes observed here contribute to the transcriptional immune shifts in IF males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>). Moreover, the reduction in <italic>Brevinema</italic> under IF may indicate a disruption in paternal microbial transfer potential, possibly linked to altered immune signalling or reduced capacity for microbial hosting during reproduction.</p><p id="P56">Gene expression analyses in pipefish offspring revealed nuanced yet meaningful immunological and regulatory responses to parental dietary history. These effects were not uniform across gene types or treatment combinations, but instead appeared to reflect parent-specific transmission of dietary stress signals, with IF(p)xAL(m) and IF(p)xIF(m) offspring showing the strongest expression shifts. The consistent upregulation of chromatin remodelling and transcriptional regulatory genes (e.g., <italic>HDAC3, JmjC-PHD, MYST1, BROMO, NO66;</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S5c-g</xref>) in offspring of IF-fed males suggests that paternal nutritional stress may prime offspring for broader developmental plasticity or environmental responsiveness, perhaps via epigenetic reprogramming. This is consistent with findings in other taxa where paternal diet has been shown to influence offspring metabolism, behaviour, and disease susceptibility through modifications such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>). Although genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming occurs post-fertilization, certain epigenetic marks can be maintained across generations - particularly at imprinted loci or other regulatory hotspots - allowing paternal nutritional experiences to influence early developmental trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>). This could enable the transmission of anticipatory cues to offspring, potentially shaping their metabolic or immune responsiveness in environments predicted to be resource-limited. Additionally, both <italic>Bcell.rap31</italic> – essential for B cell development and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>) – and <italic>Hsp60</italic> - a mitochondrial stress-related gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>) - showed increased expression in offspring when fathers were IF, regardless of maternal diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4b and f</xref>). <italic>Hsp60</italic> functions primarily as a mitochondrial chaperone but also contributes to broader cellular processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and immune regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>). The simultaneous upregulation of these genes suggests that paternal fasting may act as a cue, priming offspring for anticipated physiological stress by enhancing immune readiness. This points to a form of intergenerational plasticity, where paternal nutritional status modulates offspring physiology through inherited immunological components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>).</p><p id="P57">Rather than enhancing offspring immune preparedness, maternal IF appeared to dampen innate immune gene expression in the next generation. Offspring of IF-fed mothers showed consistent downregulation of key innate immune genes such as <italic>lectpt1, lectpt2,</italic> and <italic>intf</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5a–b</xref>), regardless of paternal diet. Additionally, <italic>ik.cytokine</italic> was upregulated in these same offspring (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5b</xref>), a gene associated with the suppression of IFN-gamma, potentially through downregulation of MHC class I expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>). This pattern suggests that maternal fasting may constrain investment in early immune programming, possibly due to energetic limitations during oogenesis. This interpretation is supported by other findings in <italic>S. typhle</italic> showing that environmental stressors like elevated temperatures can erase transgenerational immune priming, likely reflecting trade-offs between survival and immune investment when resources are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). Our results may reflect a similar mechanism, where maternal stress cues lead to reduced immune provisioning as an adaptive reallocation of resources under caloric constraint.</p><p id="P58">Parental dietary treatment not only shaped offspring gene expression but also influenced their gut microbial composition. Taxonomically, offspring microbiomes differed markedly from those of adults, with genera like <italic>Vicingus, Spongiivirga,</italic> and <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> (taxa associated with marine environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>)) abundant in parents but nearly absent in offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5b-c</xref>). It is crucial to highlight that these differences may not solely reflect parental dietary influences, juveniles naturally consume a very different diet at birth (e.g., copepods), whereas adults feed on larger invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>). As such, developmental dietary divergence likely contributes to these microbial shifts. Conversely, <italic>Pseudoalteromonas, Kordia,</italic> and <italic>Aliikangiella</italic> were more prevalent in juveniles, with <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> particularly enriched in offspring of fasting parents, mirroring IF parents and suggesting a microbial legacy of parental nutritional state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5b-c</xref>). This genus includes marine species known for a wide range of functions, such as antibacterial, algicidal, and antiviral activities, as well as specific strains that prevent the settlement of common fouling organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>).</p><p id="P59">Nonetheless, PCA and beta diversity analyses revealed that offspring microbiomes clustered by parental diet combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a–b</xref>). Offspring from mixed-diet crosses (AL×IF, IF×AL) harboured increased levels of <italic>Marinomonas</italic>, whereas those from matched parental diets (AL×AL and IF×IF) showed higher relative abundances of <italic>Dokdonia, Kiloniella</italic>, and <italic>Porticoccus</italic>. Correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) further indicated that <italic>Marinomonas</italic> was positively associated with the stress-responsive gene <italic>Hsp60</italic> only in AL×IF offspring, but negatively associated in both matched-diet groups. Meanwhile, <italic>Porticoccus</italic> was strongly positively correlated with innate immune genes <italic>lectp1</italic> and <italic>lectp2</italic> in AL×AL offspring, and similarly (though not significantly) in IF×IF, but not in offspring from mixed-diet crosses. Likewise, <italic>Dokdonia</italic> showed positive associations with immune markers <italic>AIF</italic> and <italic>intf</italic> in IF×IF, AL×AL, and (non-significantly) AL(p)xIF(m) offspring, but this association reversed in IF(p)xAL(m) offspring – where the father experienced IF. This reversal could imply that paternal fasting, when not mirrored by the mother, disrupts coordinated immune-microbiome interactions, potentially altering offspring gut environment. In a species like <italic>S. typhle</italic>, where both mothers and brooding fathers contribute to the microbial inoculum - via eggs and brood pouch environments - matched parental diets may support the maintenance or co-transfer of a similar microbial community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>). Furthermore, when diets match, parental epigenetic and physiological cues (e.g., immune tolerance, gut pH/mucosal environment, antimicrobial peptides) may be aligned, producing a gut environment in the offspring that selects for a consistent microbial community. With mismatched diets, the offspring may receive conflicting cues - say, maternal tolerance toward one microbial profile and paternal priming toward another - leading to disrupted or restructured microbiome assembly.</p></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P60">Our study revealed how parental nutritional stress shapes offspring phenotype through sex-specific and asymmetric pathways in the sex-role reversed pipefish <italic>Syngnathus typhle.</italic> By manipulating maternal and paternal diets, we demonstrate that maternal provisioning plays a dominant role in determining offspring condition, while paternal effects emerge more clearly in immune gene expression and microbiota composition. This highlights the importance of considering both maternal and paternal contributions—especially in systems where traditional sex roles are decoupled.</p><p id="P61">Notably, females experienced greater decline in condition index under IF, which translated into lower offspring condition, regardless of paternal diet. In contrast, offspring of IF males and well-fed females showed no such deficit, underlining the critical role of maternal provisioning in early development. However, IF fathers did not remain passive contributors; they exhibited strong immune activation and altered microbiomes, both of which were reflected in offspring gene expression and microbial profiles. These findings suggest that paternal nutritional stress can prime offspring immune function, likely through epigenetic and microbial inheritance mechanisms. Importantly, mismatched parental diets disrupted expected immune-microbiome correlations in offspring, indicating that coordinated parental cues may be essential for stable microbial and physiological development. Such interactions between diet, immunity, and microbiota underscore the ecological relevance of parental environmental history in shaping offspring resilience.</p><p id="P62">This research leverages the unique reproductive biology of <italic>Syngnathus typhle</italic> to disentangle the often-confounded effects of maternal provisioning and gestational environment under nutritional stress.
