Mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics is widely used for system-wide characterization of phosphorylation events. However, traditional methods struggle with accurate phosphorylated site localization, complex search spaces, and detecting sequences outside the reference database. Advances in <italic>de novo</italic> peptide sequencing offer opportunities to address these limitations, but have yet to become integrated and adapted for phosphoproteomics datasets. Here, we present InstaNovo-P, a phosphorylation specific version of our transformer-based InstaNovo model, fine-tuned on extensive phosphoproteomics datasets. InstaNovo-P significantly surpasses existing methods in phosphorylated peptide detection and phosphorylated site localization accuracy across multiple datasets, including complex experimental scenarios. Our model robustly identifies peptides with single and multiple phosphorylated sites, effectively localizing phosphorylation events on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. We experimentally validate our model predictions by studying FGFR2 signaling, further demonstrating that InstaNovo-P uncovers phosphorylated sites previously missed by traditional database searches. These predictions align with critical biological processes, confirming the model’s capacity to yield valuable biological insights. InstaNovo-P adds value to phosphoproteomics experiments by effectively identifying biologically relevant phosphorylation events without prior information, providing a powerful analytical tool for the dissection of signaling pathways.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Phosphorylation is a widespread protein post-translational modification (PTM) and the most abundant PTM in eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.

Consequently, detection of phosphorylation events is imperative for dissecting cellular pathways and describing disease states.

The traditional approach for identifying phosphorylated peptides involves database searches based on the mass shift induced by phosphorylation in the sequence search space. However, this method has inherent limitations in modification localization ambiguity, and significantly expands the search space, search time and costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Additionally, target-decoy methods cannot detect non-canonical protein sequences or protein isoforms that are not included in the database search, restricting analysis to only known reference proteomes.</p><p id="P5">Recent advances in <italic>de novo</italic> peptide sequencing using machine learning approaches have shown impressive performance in peptide detection, including peptides with modifications such as N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. These methods have the potential to address the shortcomings of database searches, provide complementary information, and be integrated into hybrid approaches to maximize insights into phosphorylation in investigated proteomes. Despite the abundance of publicly available PTM proteomics datasets, <italic>de novo</italic> peptide sequencing approaches have not been extensively adapted for PTM identification.</p><p id="P6">Previous transformer-based methods for <italic>de novo</italic> peptide sequencing, including InstaNovo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, predominantly utilize auto-regressive architectures, predicting amino acids sequentially. Recently, Xia et al. developed AdaNovo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, incorporating conditional mutual information between spectra and peptides, successfully identifying amino acids carrying PTMs on benchmark datasets, however without including phosphorylation. PrimeNovo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, a model using non-autoregressive prediction, is currently the best model that supports detection of phosphorylated peptides.</p><p id="P7">Here, we introduce the first application of a <italic>de novo</italic> peptide sequencing model that is trained on an extensive number of phosphoproteomic datasets and is exclusively adapted for phosphorylated peptide detection. We reprocess numerous phosphoproteomics experiments available in the PRIDE database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> to make a fine-tuned, phosphorylation-specific version of InstaNovo, achieving substantial improvements in phosphorylated peptide identification accuracy. We validate the performance of our fine-tuned model across multiple datasets, and confirm its predictions with targeted proteomics. Lastly, we provide for the first time experimental validation of phoshorylated peptide predictions that went undetected by conventional database searches.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>InstaNovo-P is a phosphorylation-specific de novo sequencing model</title><p id="P8">We utilized our previously developed <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing model, InstaNovo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, and adapted it to the task of phosphorylated peptide detection. InstaNovo is an autoregressive transformer model with an encoder-decoder architecture, trained on the ProteomeTools dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. During inference, InstaNovo interprets an MS/MS spectrum by translating it to the peptide sequence that produced the spectrum. To fine-tune InstaNovo for phosphorylated peptide prediction (i.e., to further train and adapt our model for the specific task of phosphorylated peptide sequencing), we curated a set of 29 reprocessed phosphoproteomics projects from Scop3P<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for complete list of projects). After filtering for high localization probability (&gt;0.80), our training dataset consisted of 2,760,939 PSMs mapping to 74,686 unique peptides. Three projects made up more than half of the PSMs with PXD000612 alone containing 837,540 or 31% of the PSMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). When accounting for unique peptides per project, the analysed dataset was also dominated by a few large projects, although the distribution is slightly more even (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The distribution of phosphorylated amino acids is dominated by serine (S), making up 84.5%, while threonine (T) and tyrosine (Y) make up 12.0% and 3.4%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). To minimize data leakage, the dataset was split using GraphPart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> into a train-valid-test split of 70-10-20%.</p><p id="P9">We used the InstaNovo model architecture with two modifications. The sequence embedding layer and the linear head of the model had to be extended to accommodate three extra tokens for the possible phosphorylated residues of serine, threonine, and tyrosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). To fine-tune, we utilized gradual unfreezing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> of the model layers starting with the head and sequence embedding for 1 epoch. Then, instead of unfreezing the decoder, we gradually unfroze the encoder layers. Finally, the decoder layers were also gradually unfrozen, reducing the learning rate with increasing number of training steps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). Interestingly, the model reached good validation performance after only fine-tuning the head, sequence embedding and encoder, but the decoder is also fine-tuned for the last performance gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref> for further details).</p><p id="P10">To assess the model performance on phosphorylated peptides, we used 3 evaluation datasets: the test set made from the split of the curated projects, here referred to as “Test”, a subset of project PXD009449<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, here referred to as “21PTM”, and a dataset from an in-house experiment using T47D breast cancer cell line expressing or not Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2) upon growth factor treatment, here referred to as “FGFR2”. The three evaluation datasets contained different distributions of non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides as well as different residue types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1B and S1C</xref>). In addition to the evaluation on phosphorylated datasets, we also evaluate the model on 2 datasets of unmodified peptides: The original test set used by the base model, here referred to as “AC-PT”, and the unmodified version of 21PTM, here referred to as “21PTM-unmod”.</p><p id="P11">In summary, we extended the InstaNovo transformer by adding three phosphorylation-specific tokens and fine-tuned on a 2.76 million PSM phosphoproteomics corpus, achieving strong validation performance using an encoder-first gradual unfreezing schedule.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>InstaNovo-P assigns phosphorylation events with high accuracy and precision</title><p id="P12">We compared the performance of our model with the base InstaNovo model (version 0.1.4) on unmodified peptides from the AC-PT dataset (ProteomeTools Parts I-III)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and the 21PTM dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. InstaNovo-P increases peptide recall from 64.0% to 68.1% and from 70.0% to 71.4% for the AC-PT test set and 21PTM dataset (taking into account only unmodified peptides), respectively, compared to the base InstaNovo model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This surprising observation indicates that the fine-tuning effort did not constrain the model to the detection of phosphorylated peptides only, but also improved the general performance. In other words, the model did not experience catastrophic forgetting even without mixing training data from target and source domain (i.e., unmodified vs modified peptides).</p><p id="P13">We then evaluated the performance on phosphorylated peptides of the 21PTM dataset. InstaNovo-P achieved a peptide recall of 81.4% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). In comparison, PrimeNovo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> reported a peptide recall of 68% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This increase of 13.4% compared to PrimeNovo indicates an excellent generalization to unseen phosphorylated peptides. Moreover, PrimeNovo was fine-tuned specifically on 21PTM, whereas InstaNovo-P evaluated 21PTM entirely as a holdout dataset.</p><p id="P14">Next, we evaluated the performance of our model in relation to the number of phosphorylated sites present on phosphorylated peptides. Our evaluation datasets contain unmodified peptides, as well as peptides with 1, 2, or more phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). As expected, we see decreasing peptide recall with the increased number of phosphorylated sites in each peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Unsurprisingly, we also observed a correlation of peptide recall with the composition of our training dataset. The highest recall was seen in serine phosphorylation events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), which were also the most abundant events in our training dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The highest recall was seen for the 21PTM dataset, which contained only phosphorylated tyrosines. We speculate that the reason is due to high intensity signal, the nature of the synthetic peptides, and lower sample complexity.</p><p id="P16">Limiting and estimating the number of false positives in proteomics searches is imperative for utility in biological studies and downstream validations. We therefore evaluated the model confidence threshold needed for different values of false discovery rate (FDR, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>). The confidence range distribution of predictions for all evaluation datasets was similar to the base model, and indicates that the model can inherently distinguish between correct and incorrect assignments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). We observed highly diminishing peptide recall at 1% FDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus the best threshold that balanced recall and by extension identification performance with a satisfactory FDR was 5%. We also observed the same trend based on residue phosphorylation type. Peptide recall on the FGFR2 dataset by type of phosphorylated residue at 5% FDR was 44.4%, 30.2% and 22.6% for S, T and Y, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Altogether, these data indicate that InstaNovo-P generalizes well to phosphorylated peptides without catastrophic forgetting, while the predicted confidence scores effectively discriminate correct assignments, with a 5% FDR threshold offering the optimal trade-off between recall and reliability.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>InstaNovo-P performance is dependent on peptide properties</title><p id="P18">We next evaluated the precision and recall of peptide predictions on the three different test datasets. As previously observed for our base InstaNovo model, we saw highly variable performance depending on the dataset evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). InstaNovo-P achieved the best performance on 21PTM, which was composed of synthetic peptides. We recorded lower recall in our test and FGFR2 dataset, which originated from other projects with endogenous peptides. We noted that performance was dependent on to peptide length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). InstaNovo-P exhibited lower peptide recall with increasing peptide length, which affected the dataset total recall. Even though the overall recall for 21PTM was higher than that of the test set and FGFR2 dataset, we found that the recall for shorter peptides (under 15 amino acids) was almost identical across datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P19">The FGFR2 dataset included both a phospho-enriched and an unmodified version of several peptides. In addition to those two, we also took the phospho-enriched FGFR2 and “de-modified” it (changing the phosphorylated sites to their non-modified version). A prediction would usually contain a phosphorylated site, but by de-modifying it, we could infer the added difficulty of phosphorylation localization alone. We found that InstaNovo-P performed well across all three types, however phosphorylated peptide identification was more difficult than for unmodified peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). For longer peptides, the recall performance was noticeably higher for the FGFR2 dataset when compared to the two other evaluation datasets, with recall also showing dependence on the number of phosphorylated sites for each peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p id="P20">In sum, InstaNovo-P performance varied markedly by dataset and peptide characteristics, while recall also trended downward as the number of phosphorylation sites per peptide increased. Our results suggest that our recall differences between the three evaluated datasets were predominantly due to differences in peptide attributes.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>InstaNovo-P is a robust tool for proteome-wide identification of phosphorylation events</title><p id="P21">We used our FGFR2 dataset to map our model’s predictions to the proteome, providing another validation for our predictions, given the very low likelihood of an incorrect prediction mapping to the proteome. We also compared our results to database search results using MaxQuant. We assessed our false discovery rate using the database search identifications in the labeled space (scans in common with database results) or the full search space (all scans in the dataset). We noticed that InstaNovo-P predicted substantially more phosphorylated peptides at 5% FDR when evaluated in the full search space rather than the labeled space alone, and that the gains are similar across different perturbations and time points in our experiments. Overall, InstaNovo-P detected 97.1% more peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). On average, InstaNovo-P detected 3,068(±495) peptides, which was expanded to 5,436(±770) peptides when expanding our search to the full search space, i.e., also scans that the database did not identify (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). We mapped these peptides to 21.6% more proteins in the proteome compared to the database search in the same dataset (4B). The identified peptides mapped to 1,331(±209) proteins on average in the labeled space, which increased to 1,544(±239) proteins in the full search space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p id="P22">The localisation accuracy of InstaNovo-P, as assessed by recall, indicated that the model is adept at recognizing and predicting phosphorylation events for peptides containing multiple potential phosphorylation sites. The recall observed, as well as the recall at an estimated 5% FDR, positively correlated with database localization certainty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, peptides with low localization certainty included in the database search results might contain incorrect localization certainty that negatively affects peptide recall. This is substantiated by the trend of database localization probability as a function of correct and incorrect assignments by InstaNovo-P in the same dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p id="P23">We then turned our attention to a number of specific phosphorylation sites in proteins that are critical components of the cell cycle. We first investigated phosphorylated peptide predictions for sites in the protein TP53, an important cell cycle checkpoint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. InstaNovo-P predicted 35 phosphorylated sites in total, of which 4 contain phosphorylation sites in TP53 that went undetected in the database search space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>).

Each of these conditions contained only phospho-enriched samples, eluted in 2 separate fractions per column. We mapped InstaNovo-P predictions from these experimental files in the human proteome, and assessed their presence in the labeled space. InstaNovo-P identified 86.75% more peptides that contained phosphorylated sites compared to the labeled space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The distribution of these peptides matched well with the standard peptide distribution of human peptides in MS data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and the database search space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).

These peptides may represent the core of F7-FGFR2 signaling in our experimental model as they were found in the WT but not in the KO cells. Out of these, 153 were not found in the database search space, with 138 of them found only in this condition and timepoint. Importantly, 10 out of 10 of these novel top predicted phosphorylated sites, when ranked by number of PSMs, represented known phosphorylated sites in PhosphoSitePlus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. As an example, we identified a phosphorylation site at S402, in the C-terminal peptide of SAC31, a protein predicted to be involved in centrosome duplication and mitotic progression (the most commonly phosphorylated residue in this protein according to experiments integrated in PhosphoSitePlus). This suggests that our model is able to identify known and validated phosphorylated peptides, providing complementary information and substantially improving phosphoproteomics searches.</p><p id="P28">The comparison between F7-treated vs untreated WT cells revealed 2,340 phosphorylated peptides unique for the treated samples, with 417 identified only by InstaNovo-P, and 368 of these identified only in that condition. Similarly to the WT versus KO comparison, all 10 top ranked novel peptides contained phosphorylated sites present in PhosphoSitePlus. Three of these 10 peptides mapped to nucleophosmin (NPM1), and contain the same phosphorylated site at position S125, possibly phosphorylated by the kinases Aurora A or B. This site is the most frequent phosphorylation event in NPM1, and mutations in this position show mitotic defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. This phosphorylation event causes the protein to shift to a monomeric state instead of a pentameric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, and re-localize from the nucleolus to midbody<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. However, as none of these peptides identified on NPM1 are tryptic, they would not have been identified with the standard database search settings. These peptides differed by one residue at the N-terminus (starting with GSGPVHISGQHIVAVEEDAES(+79.97)EDEEEEDVK), with several cleavage events downstream of this peptide, hinting at aminopeptidase degradation of the protein in a sequential way. Quantification of these peptides corroborated this observation, with the truncated peptidoforms found in increasing or diminishing abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Although caspases -3, -7 and -8 can cleave NPM1 during apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, no cleavage or aminopeptidase activity has been reported for that protein region. We also observed an unmodified, cleaved product in the acidic region of NPM1 (161-188) with cleavage at position 180. This suggests that InstaNovo-P can detect modified, non-tryptic peptides and provide another layer of information in proteomics searches.</p><p id="P29">We further scrutinized the novel predictions in these two experimental conditions, by performing gene enrichment analysis for the proteins that the novel phosphorylated peptides map to with Metascape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> and default settings with human background. This analysis revealed expected processes significantly enriched in these conditions such as regulation of the cell cycle and RHO GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that our model successfully predicted phosphorylated peptides that recapitulate the known biological processes downstream of F7-FGFR2 signaling in T47D cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P30">To confirm our observations, we validated the predicted phosphorylated serine residue on kinectin-1 (KTN1) at position 75 with targeted proteomics in newly collected samples for the same conditions.

We find InstaNovo-P to increase performance of the base model, InstaNovo, in unmodified peptides in the AC-PT test set and 21PTM-unmod dataset. This indicates that catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning was mitigated as the model not only maintains, but improves performance in the source domain. We believe that the encoder-first gradual unfreezing schedule contributed to this effect. By unfreezing the encoder layers before the decoder, we allowed the model to adapt to phosphorylation-specific features while preserving generalisable representations from the base model. This strategy may have helped avoid catastrophic forgetting, as reflected in improved recall on both phosphorylated and unmodified peptides. Further, our model was not only successful at improving detection of phosphorylated peptides, but also improving general sequencing performance. We speculate that this performance gain stems from InstaNovo not having achieved ceiling performance and benefitting from further training. It is also possible that seeing examples of modified peptides, or data from diverse origins, improves learning of unmodified peptide representations.</p><p id="P33">InstaNovo-P delivered state-of-the-art recall on phosphorylated peptide PSMs. InstaNovo-P was able to detect novel peptides with high confidence, thus discovering phosphorylated peptides not detected by database search. Importantly, these phosphorylation events have been detected in previous proteomics experiments, validating our approach and findings. However, database search still identifies a substantial number of peptides not detected with InstaNovo-P, at least not as the top prediction. This is potentially due to lack of a complete fragment ion series, low fragment ion signal, chimeric spectra, or single residue errors in the peptide predictions. Overall, we believe that InstaNovo-P can be used in tandem with database searches to increase phosphorylated peptide identification.</p><p id="P34">We also find a substantial number of InstaNovo-P predictions that map to proteins in the reference proteome while not present in database results, further validating our predictions. Additionally, its confidence scores correlate with true FDR and database localization certainty, offering a powerful complementary layer of site-localization information. We observed several instances of our model disagreeing with database localization assignment, and validating these cases will be part of future work. We believe that tighter integration with database search engines, where InstaNovo-P could rescue ambiguous or unassigned spectra, will maximize phosphoproteome coverage and accelerate biological discovery.</p><p id="P35">InstaNovo-P shows diminished performance in peptides with more than one phosphorylation sites. Similarly, we see a correlation between peptide recall and peptide length. Longer sequences tend to result in increased sequence complexity and ambiguity, as well as potential missed cleavages, which make them harder to identify. Additionally, longer peptides often suffer from lower ionization efficiency, making them more difficult to detect in mass spectrometry. Unsurprisingly, we observe best performance on phosphorylation events in serine residues and worst performance on tyrosine phosphorylation events, reflecting our training data composition. This bias, where performance drops for peptides with more phosphorylation sites and less abundant phosphorylation events, can be explained by the increased complexity of the task and imbalance of data. We expect that our performance in threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation events will catch up once the model has been trained with adequate data for these residues.</p><p id="P36">InstaNovo-P exhibits its highest recall on the 21PTM test set, potentially because it is synthetic peptides closely resembling our training dataset for the base model. Admittedly, it is challenging to compare models trained on different datasets with potential for data leakage. In this work, we have implemented a strict homology based split to control data leakage.</p><p id="P37">InstaNovo-P has fixed inference, in contrast to database search were the space increases with addition of modifications. This might be beneficial for computational costs and search times, especially when large reference proteomics and additional modifications are considered. InstaNovo-P is only compatible with data dependent acquisition, as it relies on additional information about precursor mass and charge. Adapting the model, or preprocessing data independent acquisition spectra to be compatible with the model will be part of future directions. Similarly, we expect part of future work to be the interpretation of InstaNovo-P weights and attention, that can possibly inform on fragmentation events and ions that enable the model to accurately predict phosphorylated peptides.</p><p id="P38">Finally, in this study we describe a reproducible framework providing a blueprint for model fine-tuning for different modifications or application domains with substantial biological utility, thus facilitating broader advancements within proteomics research.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Data preprocessing</title><p id="P39">For a description of the All-Confidence ProteomeTools (AC-PT) dataset used to train the base model, see the InstaNovo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> paper.

We also explored other methods of fine-tuning, including full-model whereby the entire model is unfrozen from the start, head-only where only the final classifier layer is unfrozen and head-then-full where once the head has converged, the remainder of the model is unfrozen. When applying head-only fine-tuning, we also had to reinitialise the sequence embedding layer due to the different vocabulary sizes of the fine-tuning dataset and the dataset the base model was trained on.

The mass list for the reference heavy peptides is DINNIDYYK (583,284402 m/z), DINNIDYYK (389,192027 m/z), DINNIDYYK (292,145839 m/z), DINNIDY[+80]Y[+80]K (663,250733 m/z), DINNIDY[+80]Y[+80]K (442,502914 m/z), DINNIDY[+80]Y[+80]K (332,129005 m/z), EIQNGNLHESDSESVPR (960,949709 m/z), EIQNGNLHESDSESVPR (640,968898 m/z), EIQNGNL-HESDSESVPR (480,978493 m/z), EIQNGNLHES[+80]DSESVPR (1000,932875 m/z), EIQNGNLHES[+80]DSESVPR (667,624342 m/z), EIQNGNLHES[+80]DSESVPR (500,970075 m/z), GISSLPR (370,220455 m/z), GISSLPR (247,149395 m/z), GISSLPR (185,613865 m/z), GISS[+80]LPR (410,20362 m/z), GISS[+80]LPR (273,804839 m/z), GISS[+80]LPR (205,605448 m/z). The scans were unscheduled and a dependent scan was performed on the most intense ion if no target was found. For MS1, resolution was set to 120000 with an AGC target of 300% or 3×10e6 and a maximum fill time of 50 ms over a scan range of 300-1500 m/z. For MS2 resolution was set to 7500, isolation window was set to 1 m/z, normalized collision energy was set to 30% over a scan range of 150-1700 m/z and the AGC target was 1000% or 1×10e6 and a maximum fill time of 10 ms.</p><p id="P56">Following the DDA scan the peptides were acquired using a unscheduled parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) strategy within the biological matrix to obtain retention times, using the following mass list for endogenous and reference heavy peptides: DINNIDY[+80]Y[+80]K (659.243634 m/z), DINNIDY[+80]Y[+80]K[+8] (663.250733 m/z), DINNIDYYK (579.277303 m/z), DINNIDYYK[+8] (583.284402 m/z), EIQNGNLHES[+80]DSESVPR (995.92874 m/z), EIQNGNL-HES[+80]DSESVPR[+10] (1000.932875 m/z), EIQNGNLHESDSESVPR (955.945575 m/z), EIQNGNLHESDSESVPR[+10] (960.949709 m/z), GISSLPR (365.21632 m/z), GISSLPR[+10] (370.220455 m/z), GISS[+80]LPR (405.199486 m/z), and GISS[+80]LPR[+10] (410.20362 m/z). For MS1, resolution was set to 120000 with an AGC target of 300% or 3×10e6 and a maximum fill time of 246 ms over a scan range of 300-1500 m/z. For MS2 resolution was set to 7500, isolation window was set to 1 m/z, normalized collision energy was set to 27% over a scan range of 150-1700 m/z and the AGC target was 1000% or 1×10e6 and a maximum fill time was set to auto.</p><p id="P57">Raw data were analyzed via Skyline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> (Version 24.1.0.414, Seattle, WA). The DDA survey run was imported and converted into a spectral library. The spectral library was built using the directed DDA runs, including following modifications, Carbamidomethyl (C), phosphorylation (STY) and isotope modifcations at the C-terminus (13C(6)15N(4) (C-term R) and 13C(6)15N(2) (C-term K)). Light and heavy peptides were included and unscheduled runs were used to detect retention times that were exported and used for scheduled PRM runs. MS1 filtering was performed by including a minimum of 20% of the base peak at 10 ppm accuracy. MS2 filtering was set to PRM as acquisition method.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS205659-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d35aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>K.K. is supported by a Novo Nordisk Foundation Young Investigator Award (grant no.
