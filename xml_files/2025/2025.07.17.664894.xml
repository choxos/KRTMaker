However, mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics has traditionally been limited by high input requirements, extensive sample manipulation, and expensive reagents. To overcome these challenges, we developed MHC1-TIP: a scalable, single-tube and cost-effective workflow to enable robust MHC-I ligandome recovery from cell lines, patient-derived organoids, and sub-milligram amounts of clinical tissues. Moreover, MHC1-TIP also preserves compatibility with additional omics profiling technologies and we demonstrate its capacity for quantitative and multimodal profiling of the proteome and immunopeptidome from the same sample to enable integrated analyses of protein expression and antigen presentation. Application of MHC1-TIP to primary renal cell carcinoma fragments revealed extensive intratumoral heterogeneity in antigen presentation that was poorly correlated with source protein expression. MHC1-TIP represents a broadly applicable and sensitive approach for low-input, multimodal immunopeptidomics with clinical and translational relevance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Immunopeptidomics</kwd><kwd>Proteomics</kwd><kwd>Heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>Multi-omics Profiling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Antigen presentation is a critical process that enables the immune system to monitor the proteomic state of cells. In the context of cancer, for instance, T cells can target and eliminate malignant cells by recognizing neoantigens arising from somatic mutations, or self-antigens that reflect aberrant proteomic states characteristic of tumor cells. Accurate measurement of the antigen repertoire is therefore essential for understanding anti-tumor adaptive immunity and prioritizing candidate targets for immunotherapies. However, profiling the immunopeptidome in tissues with limited sample availability remains challenging. Due to technical limitations and low quantities of presented antigens, immunopeptidomics workflows have generally required hundreds of millions of cells, making them poorly scalable and inapplicable to low-input clinical samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Moreover, immunopeptidomics methods tend to use large amounts of pan-MHC class I antibodies for immunoprecipitation of peptide-MHC complexes after cell lysis, rendering them too expensive for routine use.</p><p id="P3">The lack of scalable, low-input methods for immunopeptidomics is even more of a challenge given that protein expression can be heterogeneous within tumors. If this heterogeneity is reflected within the global antigen repertoire, the associated spatial (and potentially subclonal) variation in antigen presentation may have important implications for immune recognition and the efficacy of antigen-targeted therapies. Understanding how subclonal and topological proteomic differences affect antigen processing and presentation, and how this in turn regionally shapes the antigen repertoire is therefore necessary and requires quantitative, scalable, cost-effective and low-input methods for immunopeptidome profiling. Here, measuring the proteomic, genomic or transcriptomic landscape underlying the antigen repertoire is key for gaining a fundamental understanding of the regulatory mechanisms governing antigen presentation that underpin intratumoral heterogeneity. However, traditional immunopeptidomic workflows do not easily allow for profiling additional modalities as cells are typically lost during sample preparation. This limits the feasibility of performing multi-modal immunopeptidome profiling on small clinical tissue samples. Therefore, methods that enable direct and unbiased measurement of regional variation in antigen presentation in a multi-modal manner need to be developed to study the existence, regulation and implications of intratumoral heterogeneity in antigen presentation.</p><p id="P4">Apart from the antibody-based workflows, mild acid elution-based immunopeptidomics methods have also been employed for MHC-I ligandome profiling. This method involves treating cells with a mild acid at pH 3 to 3.3, which causes peptides bound to MHC-I molecules on the cell surface to dissociate from the complex and elute. However, previous studies using this method have required large amounts of cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This method also suffers from a large proportion of co-eluting non-antigen peptides that interfere with data acquisition in the mass spectrometer with the classical data-dependent acquisition mode (DDA). In recent years, mass spectrometers have become significantly more sensitive to accurately detect and identify lowly abundant peptides. Hand-in-hand with technological advancement in instrumentation, the proteomics field has begun to more widely adopt data-independent acquisition (DIA) strategies to overcome the limitations of the gold-standard DDA mode. In light of these developments, we sought to leverage the technical advances in mass analyzers, DIA and computational algorithms, and optimize a mild acid elution-based immunopeptidomics experimental workflow for low input samples. Moreover, mild acid elution does not involve sample lysis, making it – in principle – suitable for subsequent multi-omic profiling from the same sample. This resulted in a rapid and scalable workflow, termed MHC1-TIP (<bold>MHC</bold>I <bold>1-T</bold>ube <bold>I</bold>mmuno<bold>p</bold>eptidomics), which involves minimal sample manipulation, is applicable to cell lines as well as more complex 3D cultures and clinical tissue samples, and can be performed in a single-tube configuration while fitting into a multi-omics pipeline.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>MHC1-TIP enables scalable and cost-effective immunopeptidomics</title><p id="P5">To perform immunopeptidomics in a scalable, low-input and cost-effective manner, we first investigated if we could produce a streamlined mild acid elution workflow. Since mild acid elution functions via a single incubation step that specifically elutes MHC-I antigens from the cell surface, we hypothesised that this approach would be uniquely suitable to capture eluted antigens with minimal handling steps. We first evaluated whether mild acid elution indeed represents a suitable method for comprehensive antigen recovery by measuring how much of the MHC-I complexes on the cell surface switch to an open conformation upon mild acid treatment. After a three-minute incubation in the pH 3.3 mild acid elution buffer (adapted from Sturm et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>), we stained cells with an anti-HLA-A2 and an anti-pan-HLA-I antibody and measured the signal with flow cytometry in A375 melanoma cells. We found that the mild acid treatment indeed resulted in a strong loss of antibody binding, indicating a loss of intact MHC-I complexes and bound epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). As a negative control we generated a matched β2-microglobulin (B2M) knock-out line from A375 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). Without B2M, the MHC class I complex cannot stably fold and load antigens, leading to a total loss in antigen presentation on the cell surface. The signal from the treated cells overlapped with that of the B2M knock-out line, confirming that mild acid elution leads to near-complete loss of surface HLA-I complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>) and is appropriate for comprehensive and unbiased peptide recovery. This is consistent with a previously published paper wherein no intact HLA-I complexes were detected by immunofluorescence after mild acid elution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Next, to adapt the mild acid elution method into a single-reaction and a one-tube immunopeptidomics workflow, we coupled a 10 kDa size exclusion filter to a custom-made 1 mL StageTip (Stop and Go Extraction Tips)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> containing a C18 resin plug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). This system combined the observed near-complete antigen elution upon mild acid treatment, with size exclusion filtration to remove cell debris and intact proteins, along with desalting and peptide capture from solution, within a single reaction and pipetting step, enabling an efficient, inexpensive and quick immunopeptidomics workflow that is suitable for low-input samples and does not necessitate any specialised laboratory equipment.</p><p id="P6">To test whether our workflow, which we termed <bold>MHC</bold>I <bold>1-T</bold>ube <bold>I</bold>mmuno<bold>P</bold>eptidomics (MHC1-TIP), is indeed capable of capturing immunopeptidomes, we investigated the amino acid sequence composition of peptides eluted from the A375 melanoma cell line, measured using data-dependent acquisition. The peptides recovered exhibit features consistent with bona fide antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), including an enrichment of peptides with a length of 9 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) and the presence of characteristic anchor residues at position 2 and position 9. To further validate that the peptide characteristics we observed were indeed true antigens dependent on MHC-I antigen presentation, we looked into peptides eluted from B2M knock-out cells. Reassuringly, the amino acid sequences of peptides eluted from B2M knock-out cells did not display the typical immunopeptidome motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that the MHC1-TIP workflow is indeed capable of capturing a true immunopeptidome.</p><p id="P7">Next, to leverage the sensitivity of DIA to enhance the depth of MHC-1TIP, we used the MSFragger-powered FragPipe computational platform to generate a deep spectral library using triplicates of 100 million A375 cells with an immunoprecipitation (IP)-based immunopeptidomics workflow, measured using DDA. This spectral library was then used to search all subsequent immunopeptidomes from the A375 cell line. We then tested the ability of MHC1-TIP to capture quantitative changes in antigen presentation, by treating the melanoma A375 cell line with a series of interferon gamma (IFNy) doses ranging from 5 to 100 ng/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). IFNy is known to both stimulate the production of antigens by activating the immunoproteasome, and increase the amount of presented antigens on the cell surface by upregulating HLA genes and other genes involved in antigen presentation. We observed a dosage-dependent increase in detected immunopeptides, plateauing after 25 ng/mL of IFNy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), highlighting the ability to detect immunopeptidome dynamics.</p><p id="P8">To further test the performance of MHC1-TIP in comparison to the IP-based workflow, considered the standard in the field, we compared the two methods on samples with varying input amounts, with DIA using the above-mentioned experimental spectral library. Reassuringly, we observe a strong overlap in the antigen repertoire detected by both methods. Using MHC1-TIP, we detected more than 500 antigens at the lowest input of 100,000 cells, while 5 and 10 million cells yielded more than 5000 antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). This is in stark contrast to published work where typical input amounts required 100 million cells or more to detect similar amounts of peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. We noted that – when combined with our optimized workflows – we were able to identify similar numbers of peptides with IP-based immunopeptidomics as with MHC1-TIP. While an IP-based workflow carries greater risk of biases and sample losses, recent work has indeed shown that yields can be similar to those of workflows based on mild acid elution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. We next compared the peptide repertoire obtained with both methods and their abundances. With the 5 million cell samples, we observed that 6443 peptides were detected in both the methods, while 803 peptides were found uniquely in the IP method and 171 peptides in MHC1-TIP samples alone. We also observed that intensities of peptides identified with both methods correlate strongly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>), indicating that MHC1-TIP is a quantitative approach for detecting antigen abundances that is on par with IP-based immunopeptidomics, while being more scalable, accessible, quick and inexpensive.</p><p id="P9">Considering that classical IP-based immunopeptidomics involves cell lysis prior to peptide-MHC capture, we wondered whether these immunopeptidomes included intracellular peptides loaded on MHC complexes that still reside in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, in addition to mature antigens presented on the cell surface. The capture of both surface-presented antigens and the pool of intracellular antigens could increase the total yield of IP-based immunopeptidomics, but potentially bias the detected antigen repertoire towards transient and less stable antigens. To test this, we first eluted B2M and MHC-I loaded antigens from the cell surface using mild acid treatment, followed by lysis and IP of MHC-I complexes. Presuming that the acid causes all MHC-I complexes on the surface to lose their conformation, we expected that only intracellular complexes would be pulled down by IP. Indeed, we identified more than 1500 peptides from the IP after mild acid treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>), confirming our hypothesis. This suggests that identifications from the IP method can also include antigens that are not (yet) presented on the cell surface.</p><p id="P10">Mild acid elution has – to the best of our knowledge – thus far only been applied to cells cultured in 2D or suspension, presumably because of difficulties isolating large numbers of viable cells from complex 3D culture models and tissues. This has limited the implementation of mild acid elution in studies that use clinical material, or 3D cell culture models such as patient-derived organoids that more closely resemble tissues. To test if our newly developed MHC1-TIP approach is suitable for such samples, we used three colorectal cancer patient-derived organoid (PDO) lines with known HLA haplotypes. These experiments revealed that MHC1-TIP is indeed capable of profiling organoid-derived immunopeptidomes, identifying up to 1000 peptides from individual wells from a 6-well culture plate, which further increased to &gt;1500 peptides when the organoids cultures were stimulated with IFNy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). Reassuringly, the amino acid sequence motif from each organoid line closely matched that of the HLA haplotype that was determined for each patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>), based on the MHC Motif Atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Of note, we observed that the use of dispase to dissociate organoid cultures introduced technical artifacts containing the N-terminal cleavage pattern of dispase, likely to be dispase-cleaved peptides; we therefore advise against the use of proteases when harvesting organoids for immunopeptidomics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1E</xref>). These results demonstrate that mild acid elution, and specifically MHC1-TIP, offers a scalable alternative to IP-based immunopeptidome profiling in complex samples.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>MHC1-TIP enables multi-omics profiling from low-input samples</title><p id="P11">Since MHC1-TIP leaves cells intact while eluting and capturing antigens, we hypothesised that this method would be uniquely suitable for integration with other downstream workflows without compatibility issues, to probe additional layers of information from the same samples in a multi-omics profiling approach. Being able to obtain multimodal omics data is especially important when samples are precious, scarce, limited, or are difficult to culture and expand into sufficient quantities, such as organoids, biopsies and tissue samples. Moreover, matched datasets from exactly the same samples allow more comprehensive integration of modalities while eliminating batch effects and specimen-to-specimen variability. To verify that cells indeed remain viable for downstream workflows, we investigated the effect of mild acid treatment on the cells’ proteomes. Reassuringly, treating A375 cells with mild acid did not lead to major changes to the proteome, where we observed only 8 proteins to significantly change upon mild acid treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). We also observed a significant depletion of B2M, as expected after mild acid elution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To test if MHC1-TIP is suitable for profiling additional modalities in addition to the immunopeptidome, we performed proteomics on the above-mentioned patient-derived organoid lines with the cells that were retained after antigen elution. We could identify and quantify more than 8000 proteins, underscoring the ability to obtain deep insights into protein expression dynamics in conjunction with the MHC1-TIP workflow. These results also uniquely enabled integrative analyses between protein expression and antigen presentation dynamics. For example, we observed that PDO-3 had significantly lower expression of antigen presentation-related proteins such as the HLA proteins, which coincided with significantly lower amounts of immunopeptides detected in the matched immunopeptidomes. We also observed differences in how the respective lines responded to IFNy. For instance, IRF1 was mainly induced in PDO-2 while the IRF3/6 expression was seen in PDO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). These results highlight the need for multimodal profiling in combination with immunopeptidomics in patient-derived low-input samples with clinical translatability, to gain insights into antigen presentation from a system biology perspective.</p><p id="P13">Multimodal proteome-immunopeptidome profiling uniquely enables the investigation of how protein abundance relates to the amount of antigen presented from that protein. To explore how changes in protein expression would reflect in the immunopeptidome, we treated the A375 melanoma cell line with tumour growth factor beta (TGFβ) for 18 hours and profiled the induced proteomic and immunopeptidomic dynamics. Treated cells showed an upregulation of several proteins involved in TGFβ signalling such as TGFBI, FN1, CCN2 and SMURF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), as well as the epithelial mesenchymal transition and TGF beta signaling gene signatures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>). On the immunopeptidomic level, we also observed significant changes in the presentation of several peptides after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, while 81 proteins were significantly differentially expressed and antigens with changes in presentation were derived from 85 source proteins, we detected very limited overlap between these two modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). This reveals that most of the significant changes in the immunopeptidome were not driven by changes in the proteome, and indicates that antigen repertoire dynamics are independently regulated, underscoring the need for multi-omic immunopeptidome profiling.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Immunopeptidome-proteome profiling from low-input primary patient tissues with MHC1-TIP</title><p id="P14">Finally, we sought to apply the multi-omic MHC1-TIP approach in a clinical setting by profiling antigen presentation in primary tumour tissues. Mild acid elution has thus far not been used on primary human tissues, presumably because it requires live cells in suspension, and is incompatible with freezing. To ensure cell viability and circumvent this limitation, we used a previously published <italic>ex vivo</italic> tumour fragment culture method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> to revitalize cells for one day from cryopreserved tissue fragments of a renal cell carcinoma tumour. Moreover, we reasoned that if tissue fragments were small enough (~1mm<sup>3</sup>), mild acid should result in the elution of immunopeptides without the need for dissociation of the tissue into a single-cell suspension. Indeed, a five-minute incubation of intact tissue fragments in mild acid resulted in elution of peptides that contained sequence motifs characteristic of the patient’s HLA supertypes (HLA-A*03; HLA-B*07, HLA-B*08; HLA-C*07) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) and also displayed an enrichment of peptides of length 9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). This shows, for the first time, that mild acid elution can be used for reliable and rapid immunopeptidome profiling from primary tissues. Notably, dissociation of the fragments using collagenase, hyaluronidase and DNase into a single-cell suspension introduced technical artefacts and yielded peptides that appeared to be digestion products, again underscoring the incompatibility of enzymatic dissociation methods with mild acid elution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We hypothesised that the compatibility with low input samples and the scalability of MHC1-TIP would make it uniquely suitable for measuring immunopeptidome profiles across different sites within the same tumour. The biobanked tissue fragments that we utilized for this study were resected from different topological regions of the same tumour, and thus suitable to evaluate intratumoural heterogeneity. While heterogeneity in global amounts of MHC class I and the expression of individual tumor antigens within the same tumour has been studied and proposed to contribute to immune evasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, the heterogeneous presentation of (tumour) antigens in an unbiased immunopeptidome-wide manner has not yet been explored, likely because of scalability, cost-effectiveness and the amount of sample required for immunopeptidomics workflows in the past. We were able to quantify more than 8000 proteins and a wide range immunopeptides of length 9 from the equivalent of half a tissue fragment (&lt; 1mm<sup>3</sup>; estimated to contain &lt; 10,000 to 50,000 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>), which alluded to differences in antigen presentation across different regions of the tumour. This highlights the sensitivity and scalability of the MHC1-TIP workflow in capturing antigens from extremely low-input clinical samples and presents a unique dataset with the opportunity to explore immunopeptidomic and proteomic heterogeneity in parallel.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Data independent acquisition and B2M based normalisation enables quantitative interrogation of tissue samples</title><p id="P16">In addition to the new experimental workflow that MHC1-TIP represents, we also sought to improve downstream mass spectrometry measurement and quantification. In particular, we investigated if data acquisition, processing and analysis could be optimized to maximize the quantity and quality of antigens identified in low-input and precious clinical samples. While mass spectra for immunopeptidomics have traditionally been collected through data-dependent acquisition (DDA), we explored whether the recent advances in data-independent acquisition (DIA) for proteomics and narrow window selection in conjunction with the ASTRAL mass analyzer could be leveraged to apply DIA on immunopeptidomics. DIA immunopeptidomics data has so far mainly been analysed using DDA-generated spectral libraries from matched samples. While this approach is useful when studying antigen presentation with immortalized cell lines, it is often not possible to generate an experimental spectral library when sample availability is limited. To overcome this limitation, we explored the direct DIA approach, first proposed in Tsou et al. 2015<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and further advanced in the MSFragger-DIA search engine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> in the FragPipe computational platform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> to analyse DIA immunopeptidomes without a pre-existing spectral library. To this end, we measured the immunopeptides eluted from the 15 fragments in both DDA and DIA mode to test if the direct DIA analysis workflow could improve the detection and quantification of antigens in our tumor fragment samples. This revealed a striking improvement in data completeness across the tumor fragments in DIA measurements compared to conventional DDA-based immunopeptidomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 3C</xref>), highlighting the capabilities of DIA coupled with the FragPipe platform in generating deep datasets suitable for quantitative studies with limited sample availability.</p><p id="P17">We next sought to improve the normalization of immunopeptide ion intensities for quantitative comparisons of antigen abundance across the different fragments. We observed a high degree of variability in the sizes of the tumour fragments and, thereby, the number of cancer cells they contain which inevitably biased ion intensities and hindered quantitative comparisons between fragments. To address this, we first normalized antigen intensities by calculating each antigen’s fractional contribution to the total signal of all peptides within a sample, preserving stoichiometric relationships while correcting for unequal cell inputs. Next, to estimate antigen copy numbers per cell, we scaled these fractions by the average number of β2-microglobulin (B2M) molecules per cell measured in the matched proteomes of each fragment, based on the assumption that stable surface expression of HLA complexes depends on the availability of B2M molecules, which therefore should be directly proportional to the total number of antigen-HLA molecules presented on the cell surface. To estimate B2M copy numbers, we used the 'proteomic ruler' approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, which infers absolute protein abundances from histone MS signals by leveraging the known DNA content per diploid cell. Applying this method allowed us to derive absolute antigen pseudocounts per cell, removing the bias introduced by variable sample inputs. To validate our approach, we calculated the pseudocounts of antigens quantified in the untreated samples from the TGFβ-perturbation experiment and compared our results to published absolute antigen counts in A375 cells by Stopfer et al. (2022)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Among the 11 antigens they quantified using hipMHC spike-ins, 5 overlapped with our dataset. Our calculated pseudocounts strongly correlated and were in agreement with their measured values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 3D</xref>), supporting the quantitative power and accuracy of our absolute antigen normalisation method.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Tumour fragment immunopeptidomics reveals intratumoral heterogeneity in antigen presentation</title><p id="P18">Next, we set out to leverage this unique, quantitative integrated immunopeptidome and proteome dataset of patient-derived tumour fragments from different regions of one renal cell carcinoma tumor generated with MHC1-TIP to measure intratumoral heterogeneity in antigen presentation. Clustering peptides by sequence (using the GibbsCluster tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>) and selecting biologically relevant MHC-I antigens revealed extensive variation in total antigen abundance. For instance, tumor fragment 5 exhibited the highest levels of presented antigens, whereas tumor fragment 15 displayed minimal presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>), suggesting spatial and potentially subclonal differences in antigen processing. To identify antigens that were heterogeneously presented across the tumor, we quantified variability in antigen presentation by calculating the interquartile range (IQR) scaled to the mean abundance of each antigen. This highlighted highly variable antigens, including several peptides derived from TPP1 and CTSD, enzymes involved in extracellular matrix degradation and known to be upregulated in several tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). Interestingly, variation in antigen presentation was poorly correlated with the variability in expression of their source proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>), and this correlation between protein and antigen abundance varied across fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>). This suggests that intratumoral heterogeneity in antigen abundances and repertoire is not explained by underlying variation in protein expression, and that antigen processing and presentation might be independently regulated. This could have important translational implications, for example, when selecting tumor antigens for inclusion in cancer vaccines that are currently selected based on expression levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. In addition, the extensive observed heterogeneity indicates that not all (tumor) antigens are suitable for effective clearance of the entire tumor.</p><p id="P19">Finally, we used the matched protein expression data that multi-omics MHC1-TIP provides to investigate whether the expression of antigen presentation machinery correlated with immune infiltration markers and with immunogenicity of each fragment. Hierarchical clustering based on HLA protein expression, immune infiltration markers, and antigen processing components revealed distinct immunological profiles across fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>). Tumor fragment 5 stood out as the most “immune-hot” region, with elevated expression of B2M, HLA-I/II, TAP1/2, and markers of CD8/CD4 T cell infiltration, which in turn correlated with its high antigen abundances. Tumor fragments 1 and 3 also showed relatively higher HLA-I expression and corresponding antigen presentation, although the relatively low expression of B2M in tumor fragment 1 may explain its lower antigen display. Markers of T-cell activation (e.g., CD44, granzymes), exhaustion (LAG3), and immune evasion (PD-L1) were also detected. In contrast, fragment 15 had high immune cell content (CD45) and MHC-II expression, coinciding with high CD4 but not CD8 expression, which could suggest the T cell response is skewed towards the CD4+ subtypes. Notably, LAG3 was highly expressed in both antigen-high (fragment 5 and 7) and antigen-low (fragment 1) regions, suggesting complex regulatory dynamics. Strikingly, fragments categorized as immune-cold (tumor fragments 11 and 12) also clustered together based on their immunopeptidomes, underscoring the sensitivity of our assay in capturing meaningful biological variation from low-input clinical samples.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">We present MHC1-TIP, a novel workflow for multimodal immunopeptidomics that offers a reliable, efficient, cost-effective and quick alternative to conventional methods that involve extensive sample processing steps, necessitate large sample inputs and require expensive reagents such as columns and large amounts of antibody and beads. Recent reports have also successfully miniaturized antibody-based immunopeptidomics using microfluidic devices, thereby significantly reducing sample and reagent requirements, however they require specialized equipment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. MHC1-TIP is a simplified method, based on mild acid elution that is capable of capturing antigens from as low as &lt; 1 mg of tissue containing around 10-50 x 10<sup>3</sup> cells at a much reduced cost.</p><p id="P21">To the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate for the first time that mild acid elution-based immunopeptidomics can be applied to complex samples such as organoids and tissues. Previous implementation of mild acid elution has possibly been hampered by coelution of contaminant biomolecules that interfere with the identification of relevant antigens and the requirement of large amounts of live cells deterred its application to samples beyond 2D cell lines. We showcase how these limitations can be surpassed through miniaturisation, leveraging data-independent acquisition, and the elimination of enzymatic digestion. While we used tumor fragments that were placed in overnight <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture to enable the use of cryopreserved and frozen tissues, we expect that MHC1-TIP is equally compatible with fresh tissues. Additionally, we also showcase how data-independent acquisition for immunopeptidomics can result in more complete data from minimal sample input even without a pre-built experimental spectral library, which improves the sensitivity of MHC-I antigen profiling for clinical applications. Moreover, we also highlight how samples including patient tissues, after stripping away antigens, still remain suitable to measure additional modalities in a multi-omics setting. In our study, we exemplify a number of applications of proteomic profiling in combination with immunopeptidomics, and we expect that this can be extended to parallel genomics and transcriptomics profiling, linking DNA aberrations or transcriptional and translational dynamics with antigen presentation.</p><p id="P22">We observed an unexpected discordance between immunopeptidome dynamics and changes in protein expression of their respective source proteins, both in experimental perturbations and in the context of observed variability across a tumor. The poor correlation between proteomic and immunopeptidomic changes indicates that expression profiling could be a poor predictor for antigen presentation, and that additional layers of regulation dictate the composition of the presented antigen repertoire. Antigens presented on the cell surface come from a pool of proteasomal degradation products that are transported into the ER and loaded onto MHC-I complexes. Increased presentation of an antigen could therefore be regulated by increasing degradation of a protein without altering the steady state abundance of this protein.</p><p id="P23">MHC1-TIP uniquely enabled the deep interrogation of immunopeptidomic intratumoral antigen presentation dynamics. This revealed unexpected intratumoral heterogeneity in the composition and presentation of the antigen repertoire across different topological domains of a single tumor. The presence of a subset of antigens, which includes tumor antigens, that are not homogeneously presented across a tumor has important immunological implications for the targetability of the tumor by T cells. This suggests that taking antigen presentation heterogeneity into account is important for the prioritization of candidate tumor antigens selected as therapeutic targets in personalized immunotherapies, such as cancer vaccines. Importantly, observed heterogeneity could not be explained by changes in protein expression, further indicating that expression profiling may not be sufficient for selecting targetable antigens. MHC1-TIP offers a scalable and cost-effective immunopeptidomics workflow, suitable for routine clinical implementation, to profile MHC-I antigens from clinical samples and surpass these limitations in prioritizing candidate antigens for targeted immunotherapies.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="P24">All chemicals used were analytical grade, obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, unless mentioned otherwise.

Precursors isolated in the quadrupole within a 1.2 m/z isolation window were fragmented with a normalized HCD collision energy of 25% and MS2 spectra were acquired in the Astral analyzer with scan range 120-1800 m/z, 200% normalized AGC target and a 30 ms maximum injection time.</p><p id="P46">For DIA spectral library generation, DDA immunopeptidomics data was created using our default LCMS/MS setup for immunopeptidomics. Immunoprecipitated peptides were reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid and analyzed on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 Mass spectrometer connected to an Evosep One LC system (Evosep Biotechnology, Odense, Denmark). Peptides were eluted from Evotip Pure™ (Evosep) tips directly on-column and separated using the pre-programmed “Extended Method” (88 min gradient) on an EV1137 (Evosep) column with an EV1086 (Evosep) emitter. Nanospray was achieved using the Easy-Spray NG Ion Source (Thermo Scientific). On the Exploris 480, data-dependent acquisition was performed as follows. Full scan MS was acquired at resolution 60,000 in the orbitrap with MS1 mass range 350-1700 m/z, normalized AGC target was set to 100% and maximum injection time was 50 ms. Dynamic exclusion was set to 10 sec. and MS2 spectra were acquired at 15,000 resolution. The top 10 precursors per cycle were HCD fragmented when their charge states were 2-4, whereas the top 5 precursors per cycle were subjected to HCD fragmentation if they were singly charged. MS2 isolation window was 1.1 m/z, the normalized collision energy was 30, the normalized AGC target was set to 50% and the maximum injection time was 100 ms.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="S23"><title>Analysis of DIA immunopeptidomes with a DDA-based spectral library using FragPipe and DIANN</title><p id="P47">For all the cell line experiments presented in this paper, quantification from DIA raw files was extracted using a spectral library generated from DDA data. Immunopeptides were obtained from three replicates of 10<sup>8</sup> A375 cells each using the immunoprecipitation method and were measured in DDA mode on the Orbitrap Exploris. The spectral library was generated from these DDA files using FragPipe (v21) using the built-in ‘nonspecific-HLA-C57’ workflow with all preset parameters. MS data was searched using MSFragger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The initial precursor and fragment mass tolerances were set to 20 ppm. Spectrum deisotoping, mass calibration, and parameter optimization were enabled. The isotope error was set to “0/1”. The reviewed Homo sapiens protein sequence database obtained from UniProt (downloaded on 18 December 2024), appended with common contaminants and decoys, was used in the search. The enzyme cleavage was set to “nonspecific” and the peptide length was restricted to 7–25. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification. Cysteinylation, oxidation of methionine, N-terminal acetylation, and Pyro-glu from E and Q were set as variable modifications. The maximum number of variable modifications for each peptide was set to 3. MSBooster and Percolator were used to predict the RT and MS/MS spectra, and to rescore PSMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. FDR filtering was performed using Philosopher<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and the final FDR-filtered PSMs and the raw DDA spectral files were used by EasyPQP to generate the spectral library, filtered to 1% peptide-level false discovery rate (FDR). This DDA-based library.tsv file built by FragPipe was then passed to DIA-NN (v2.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> for extraction of quantification from DIA data, along with the human proteome reference fasta file (UP000005640) for library annotation. Mass accuracy was set to 10.0 and MS1 accuracy to 4.0. To determine the appropriate scan window, representative raw files from the experiment were first analyzed as ‘Unrelated runs’ and the DIA-NN suggested scan window radius was used for a subsequent full analysis. Match between runs (MBR) was enabled for all experiments, with the exception of the comparison between MHC-1TIP and IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E-F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Analysis of Astral DIA immunopeptidomes using MSFragger-DIA and FragPipe</title><p id="P48">For direct DIA data analysis of the patient-derived tumour fragments, we used the ‘Nonspecific-HLA-DIA-Astral’ workflow in FragPipe with all built-in settings. Astral narrow-window DIA MS data was searched using MSFragger-DIA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. The initial precursor and fragment mass tolerances were set to 10 and 20 ppm, respectively. Spectrum deisotoping, mass calibration, and parameter optimization were enabled. The same reviewed protein sequence database was used as above. The enzyme cleavage was set to “nonspecific” and the peptide length was restricted to 7–15. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification. Cysteinylation, oxidation of methionine, and N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications. To ensure the highest quality of the resulting spectral library, MSfragger-DIA options were set to filter out PSMs with no precursor ion feature detected in the MS1 data or having less than 5 fragments matched in a single MS/MS scan. The rest of the analysis (rescoring with MSBooster and Percolator, FDR filtering with Philosopher, and spectral library building with EasyPQP) was performed as described above. The resulting library.tsv file built by FragPipe was used to extract quantification from the same DIA files using DIA-NN version 1.8.2 integrated in the FragPipe computational platform.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Proteomics data analysis</title><p id="P49">Proteomics data was analyzed with DIA-NN as described above, without the immunopeptidome spectral library.

Missing values were imputed using the k-nearest neighbours method implemented in DEP. For absolute protein copy numbers, proteomic ruler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> method was applied in R, using MS1 intensities in the report file from DIA-NN, filtered to include only precursors with a global protein group q-value &lt; 0.01.

Gene set enrichment analyses were carried out using ‘fgsea’ with Hallmark gene sets downloaded from MSigDB.</p><p id="P51">For immunopeptidomics data, quantitative differential presentation analyses were performed using DEP with peptide intensities reported in the precursor matrix from DIA-NN. Intensities from different versions of the same precursor, such as with different modifications or charges were summed up. Peptides with missing values in all replicates of a condition were imputed by random draws from a left-censored distribution while random missing values were imputed using a k-nearest neighbour approach. For the tumour fragment immunopeptidomes, intensities from the precursor matrix were further normalized by calculating the fraction that a peptide contributes to the summed total intensity of all peptides quantified in that sample. The fractions were further scaled by B2M copy numbers per cell computed using the ‘proteomic ruler’ method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS207376-supplement-Supplementary_figure_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d26aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary figure 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS207376-supplement-Supplementary_figure_2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d26aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary figure 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS207376-supplement-Supplementary_figure_3.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d26aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary figure 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS207376-supplement-Supplementary_figure_4.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d26aAcEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>K.K.D. was supported by an NWO/ZonMW Veni fellowship under project number 09150162210100.
