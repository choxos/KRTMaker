It is characterized by an enduring predisposition to epileptic seizures and by cognitive, psychological, and social comorbidities that impose a significant burden on individuals and healthcare systems. Among those affected, a substantial subset of patients suffers from drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), a form that proves resistant to conventional treatments such as antiseizure drugs. Approximately 30% of epilepsy patients with DRE continue to experience seizures despite treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. For these patients, epilepsy remains a debilitating disease with few effective solutions, often leading to a lower quality of life due to the ongoing unpredictability of seizure events and associated risks such as injury and deterioration of mental health.</p><p id="P6">To better understand the mechanisms underlying seizures and explore new treatment strategies, computational modeling has emerged as a valuable tool in epilepsy research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. These models have been applied in various contexts, including i) the identification of the epileptogenic (EZ) and propagation zones (PZ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], ii) the prediction of surgical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], iii) the interpretation of intracranial and scalp EEG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], and iv) the design of neurostimulation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Depending on the specific goal of the study, different modeling approaches have been adopted, each with distinct trade-offs between physiological interpretability and phenomenological accuracy.</p><p id="P7">For instance, phenomenological models (such as the Epileptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]) have been widely used to replicate seizure dynamics observed in electrophysiological recordings, particularly for applications related to surgical planning and the identification of regions generating and propagating seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. These models are designed to capture key features of seizure transitions with relatively few parameters, allowing for efficient personalization and large-scale simulations. However, their abstraction from the underlying physiology limits their use in studies requiring neurobiologically-based interpretations, such as the simulation of pharmacological effects or electrical stimulation.</p><p id="P8">In contrast, neural mass models (NMMs) operate at the mesoscale and offer a richer neuro-physiological interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. These models describe the average activity of interconnected neuronal populations and include parameters related to synaptic dynamics, membrane potentials, and firing rate transformations. Due to their structure, NMMs are particularly suited for simulating interventions that depend on physiological detail, such as neuromodulation or pharmacology, and have also been used to investigate the propagation of seizures and evaluate surgical strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Other studies have explored even simpler frameworks, such as bistable models[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], theta models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], or Wilson-Cowan formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], which offer a compromise between computational efficiency and biological realism. Building on previous work on neural mass modeling in epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], we have recently developed a novel neural mass that generates realistic transitions from pre-ictal to ictal state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. We have also introduced a framework for the integration of NMMs in a layered physical model of a cortical column [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], as well as a physical model for the simulation of SEEG signals from neural masses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Those developments are crucial for the design of the model personalization pipeline presented in the current work.</p><p id="P9">Although computational models offer insight into the mechanisms of the generation and spread of seizures, their potential extends beyond understanding the pathology. One of their most promising applications is in the simulation and optimization of therapeutic strategies. Among these, brain stimulation and neuromodulation have emerged as key candidates for intervention, particularly in patients who do not respond to conventional pharmacological treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has attracted attention for its safety profile, ease of use, and ability to modulate neuronal excitability with minimal discomfort (VNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], in contrast to more invasive techniques such as Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) or Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS). tDCS operates through the application of a low-intensity, constant current delivered directly to the brain areas via electrodes positioned on the scalp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. In previous work, we have demonstrated the efficacy of tDCS in refractory focal epilepsy by targeting the epileptogenic focus with multichannel montages, optimized using personalized biophysical head models of the patients, which included anatomical data and simulation of the head tissues and conductivities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>].</p><p id="P10">Building on this, we aim to leverage personalized, whole-brain computational models that include not only biophysical but also physiological information about the patient’s brain, such as electroencephalography (EEG) or stereo-EEG (SEEG). Indeed, whole-brain computational models represent a transformative approach to epilepsy treatment, providing <italic>in silico</italic> replication of a patient’s neural activity and mechanistic insight into the network dynamics and pathophysiological processes underlying epileptic seizures. Our vision is that such models can be effectively used to simulate and predict the outcomes of various treatment scenarios, including surgery and stimulation therapies, improving the results achieved to date using personalized biophysical models.</p><p id="P11">In this paper, we present a method for personalizing whole-brain computational models in epilepsy by integrating SEEG, anatomical MRI, and diffusion MRI (dMRI) data. Unlike many existing approaches that aim to localize the seizure onset zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], our focus is not on identifying the epileptogenic focus itself. Instead, we rely on the clinician’s identification of an epileptogenic network and attempt to construct a mechanistic model that captures how seizures propagate from this network to the rest of the brain. To do so, we incorporate both structural connectivity, derived from patient-specific dMRI, and functional information extracted from SEEG recordings using amplitude envelope correlations. This integration allows us to personalize the excitability of different brain areas and capture early seizure propagation patterns in a data-driven manner.</p><p id="P12">The motivation for this approach stems from a clinical challenge: interventions such as surgery or non-invasive stimulation often target the presumed seizure onset zone but do not always lead to improved outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. This suggests that seizure spread, and not just seizure initiation, plays a critical role in treatment response. By modeling the dynamics of seizure propagation, we aim to identify additional targets that contribute to seizure spread and may be amenable to therapeutic modulation. Ultimately, our goal is to provide personalized models that can inform interventions aimed at reducing both seizure frequency and spatial extent. This is particularly relevant in cases where the seizure onset zone is located in deep brain structures that are difficult to reach with surgery or non-invasive techniques like tDCS, making it essential to consider propagation targets that are more accessible.</p><p id="P13">In the following sections, we detail the modeling pipeline and demonstrate how it can reproduce the empirical seizure propagation observed in SEEG data. We also show that the resulting models can simulate and compare the effects of various interventions on seizure dynamics in a patient-specific manner.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><label>2.1</label><title>Overview</title><p id="P14">First, we present an overview of the full personalization pipeline (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The inputs to the pipeline are the SEEG data during a seizure, the subject’s MRI and dMRI, the locations of the SEEG contacts in the Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP) parcellation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>], and the clinician’s hypothesis of the EZ location. The processed data is used to build the patient’s whole-brain model, and the model parameters are personalized using an evolutionary algorithm that maximizes the correlation between the empirical and synthetic functional connectivity (FC) matrices. The output is the set of optimized model parameters, which define the personalized whole-brain model of the patient. After model personalization, the validity of the model can be assessed by comparing the seizure propagation pattern in the data and the model. The model can then be used to predict the effects of therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><label>2.2</label><title>Patient data and data processing</title><sec id="S9"><label>2.2.1</label><title>Clinical data</title><p id="P15">The patients included in this study required SEEG as part of their routine clinical care. Clinical information about the patients can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. In all cases, multiple intracerebral electrodes were placed in different brain regions of the patient based on the clinician’s hypotheses about the location of the epileptogenic zone.</p><p id="P16">The data used in this study is part of the Galvani project (ERC Synergy Grant 855109). Patients 4 and 5 participated in a pilot study conducted within the framework of this project to evaluate the impact of tDCS on SEEG recordings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], and Patient 6 was included in a separate pilot study also related to the project to assess the efficacy of tDCS in DRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. For this work, we selected all patients for whom the complete dataset was available, including SEEG recordings during seizures, diffusion MRI (dMRI), and anatomical MRI.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><label>2.2.2</label><title>SEEG data and contact selection</title><p id="P17">SEEG recordings were obtained using intracerebral multiple-contact electrodes with a 154-channel Deltamed system. Contacts were classified by the clinician according to their epileptogenicity into three distinct networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]: <list list-type="bullet" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P18">Epileptogenic Zone (EZ): the network responsible for the generation of seizures.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P19">Propagation Zone (PZ): a less epileptogenic network that propagates seizures but does not initiate them.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P20">Non-involved zone (NIZ): areas of the cortex not belonging to the EZ or PZ.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="P21">The contact locations in the VEP parcellation atlas were obtained using the GARDEL software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. The VEP atlas has been shown to provide an effective balance between anatomical resolution and computational feasibility for modeling SEEG data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Bipolar derivations were obtained from neighbor contact subtraction for each electrode. A parcel was assigned to each bipolar pair based on the individual contact locations. In the case where the contacts used for bipolar derivation were assigned to different parcels, we chose the parcel of the first contact in alphabetical/numerical order. Bipolar pairs where neither contact belonged to the grey matter were discarded.</p><p id="P22">The empirical FC computation for the modeling pipeline required a single SEEG bipolar signal for each parcel (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Section 2.2.4</xref>). Since several contacts could be assigned to the same parcel, we defined a method for selecting one bipolar signal for each parcel sampled by SEEG, inspired by the method used in Olmi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] to identify the propagation zone: <list list-type="order" id="L2"><list-item><p id="P23">Filter each bipolar signal between 1-50 Hz using a Butterworth band-pass filter.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P24">Compute the <italic>energy ratio</italic> of each contact pair as the ratio between the signal energy during the seizure period (marked by the clinician) and the baseline signal energy (one minute before and one minute after the seizure).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P25">Identify which contacts belong to the EZ or PZ according to the clinician.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P26">Select one contact pair per parcel by choosing the most epileptogenic pair (EZ before PZ before NIZ), and in the cases where several pairs had the same epileptogenicity level, choose the contact pair with the highest mean energy ratio (average over seizures).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="P27">This method ensured that we included in the FC computation the maximum number of EZ and PZ contacts possible, and that the contacts selected were the ones with the highest energy in the seizure period relative to baseline. This change in energy is intended to capture the potential changes in amplitude due to seizure propagation, which is a key feature in the computation of the empirical FC (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Section 2.2.4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><label>2.2.3</label><title>Structural connectivity</title><p id="P28">The individual structural connectivity of each patient was generated from diffusion MRI scans and T1-weighted images acquired on 3T MR scanners. Each MRI was segmented into 162 cortical regions according to the VEP atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] using FreeSurfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>] and custom Python scripts. This volumetric image served as the basis for processing dMRI data.</p><p id="P29">Diffusion MRI data were acquired using different acquisition protocols depending on the scanner model and imaging guidelines in place at the time of each patient’s screening. Although all protocols included single-shell acquisitions with b = 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup> and at least 64 diffusion directions, parameters such as echo spacing, readout time, and phase encoding directions varied between sessions. Some patients were scanned with both anterior-posterior (AP) and posterior-anterior (PA) phase encoding directions to enable distortion correction, while others had only a single direction available. More details about the acquisition parameters are provided in the Supplementary Information.</p><p id="P30">Preprocessing steps for diffusion MRI included denoising, artifact correction (e.g., eddy currents), and fiber orientation density estimation using constrained spherical deconvolution. Probabilistic tractography was then performed using MRtrix3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], generating 20 million streamlines constrained to start and terminate in gray matter parcels defined by the MRI parcellation. The resulting structural connectome matrix quantified the number of streamlines (fiber tracts) connecting each pair of parcels and was normalized by the total number of fibers divided by the number of parcels to generate a connectivity matrix for the subject.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><label>2.2.4</label><title>Empirical FC computation</title><p id="P31">Detecting the presence or absence of seizures in SEEG data is a complex problem, and several methods have been recently proposed for that purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Rather than trying to determine whether or not a given SEEG channel displays seizure, we have decided to use functional connectivity (FC) between signals to capture the pattern of seizure propagation in empirical data. Other studies have also used functional connectivity between SEEG signals for seizure onset localization or as markers of epileptogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>].</p><p id="P32">In the current pipeline, we computed the FC as the correlation between the amplitude envelopes of signal pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. This choice is based on the assumption that nodes involved in seizure propagation show pronounced amplitude increases that are temporally correlated across regions. In contrast, regions not participating in the propagation are expected to show irregular or low-amplitude fluctuations, resulting in quasi-random amplitude envelopes with low correlation to other signals. The use of amplitude envelopes for the fitting of model parameters has been employed in other studies of whole-brain model personalization in epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. It is worth mentioning that our FC computation method assumes that the SEEG electrodes capture a pronounced amplitude increase at seizure onset, which has some limitations that we discuss in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S38">Section 4.1</xref>.</p><sec id="S13"><title>Amplitude envelope computation</title><p id="P33">For the computation of the amplitude envelope correlation, we selected for each seizure a time window spanning from 10 seconds before the start of the clonic phase activity to 20 seconds after the start of the clonic phase, similarly to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. This window is intended to capture the early propagation of the seizure, which is the period relevant for the design of interventions aimed at reducing seizure spread (since targeting the earliest propagating nodes is expected to yield better outcomes in reducing seizure spread).</p><p id="P34">The initial estimation of the clonic phase onset was made by visual inspection of SEEG signals recorded from the EZ contacts specified by the clinician. We identified the point at which the signal began to show an increase in amplitude along with emerging rhythmic activity, consistent with typical clonic phase characteristics described in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. To minimize variability introduced by manual selection, we explored a window from –10 to +10 seconds around the visually identified time point, in 1-second steps. For each candidate time point, we computed the corresponding FC matrix using the method described below and calculated the total node strength of EZ nodes as the sum of their connectivity values. The final clonic phase onset was defined as the time point that yielded the maximum EZ node strength, under the assumption that connectivity between EZ nodes peaks during early seizure propagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>].</p><p id="P35">We first band-pass filtered each signal between 0.5 Hz and the Nyquist frequency (half the sampling rate), then computed the amplitude envelope of each signal as the absolute value of its Hilbert transform, and finally low-pass filtered the result below 1 Hz to smooth the envelope. The low-pass filtering of the amplitude envelope below 1 Hz helps emphasize slow fluctuations in signal power in the delta frequency band, which are more likely to reflect sustained, functionally relevant interactions between regions, rather than transient, high-frequency fluctuations or noise. We removed the first and last seconds of the signal to avoid the transients appearing after the Hilbert transform. The amplitude envelope was then normalized to its standard deviation and demeaned. This allowed us to capture amplitude increases in the SEEG signals independently of the absolute differences in signal intensity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>FC matrix computation</title><p id="P36">Finally, the FC of each pair of signals was computed as the maximum of the absolute value of the cross-correlation between the amplitude envelopes of the two signals. Using the maximum value allowed us to account for time delays, which are likely to occur due to delays in seizure propagation. Estimating and fitting these delays would make the personalization process significantly more complex, so we left this for future work.</p><p id="P37">For patients with multiple seizures available, we obtained the FC matrix for each seizure and then computed the average empirical FC as the mean over all seizures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> displays the empirical functional connectivity for the three seizures of Patient 2 together with the SEEG signals selected for each parcel and their amplitude envelope. The amplitude envelope captures the increase in amplitude at seizure onset in the channels with seizure propagation, and the pattern of seizure propagation observed in the empirical SEEG data can be seen in the FC matrix. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, the first two seizures display a similar propagation pattern, whereas the third seizure exhibits some differences. Averaging the FC matrices across seizures helps smooth out these variations, capturing the common features of seizure propagation, as shown in the mean FC matrix in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S15"><label>2.3</label><title>Whole-brain model personalization</title><sec id="S16"><label>2.3.1</label><title>NMM description</title><p id="P38">The personalization pipeline uses one NMM in each node of the network to reproduce the whole-brain dynamics. We have implemented two types of NMM, one for nodes identified by the clinician as belonging to the EZ and another for PZ and NIZ nodes.</p><p id="P39">In the EZ nodes, located in the parcels indicated by the clinician, we used seizure-generating nodes based on the NMM presented in Lopez-Sola et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], which includes ion dynamics to mimic the transition from the pre-ictal phase to the fast onset phase, and then to the clonic phase. An external input of 110 Hz arriving at the main pyramidal population at 15 seconds forces the model to initiate the seizure at that time point (in contrast to the original work, where the seizures were non-deterministic and depended on the stochastic fluctuations of an external input). The membrane potential, spectral profile, and description of the NMM used in EZ nodes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, and the model parameters are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table A1</xref>.</p><p id="P40">In the PZ and NIZ nodes, a Wendling-class model is used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. The specific parameters of the model are taken from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], as these parameters produce clear transitions from non-seizure to seizure dynamics, with large changes in amplitude when the saddle-node bifurcation is crossed. As will become apparent in the following sections, these amplitude changes are crucial for the current pipeline. The model parameters are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table A1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> displays the bifurcation diagram of the PZ/NIZ NMM for different values of the excitatory synaptic gain <italic>W</italic><sub>exc</sub> and external input <italic>µ</italic>.</p><p id="P41">When the PZ and NIZ nodes, initially displaying low-voltage non-oscillatory dynamics, receive sufficient input, and depending on the value of the <italic>W</italic><sub>exc</sub> parameter, they may cross a saddle-node bifurcation and generate high-amplitude periodic spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).

While the effect is generally smaller compared to removing EZ nodes, in some cases, it is still substantial. For instance, in Patient 2, removal of nodes 67 and 68, which are not part of the EZ, led to a noticeable decrease in seizure spread. These nodes showed seizure activity both in the model and in the empirical SEEG data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that they may play a secondary but functionally relevant role in the propagation network.</p><p id="P86">We also observe variability across patients in the number and type of critical nodes, reflecting differences in individual network organization and seizure dynamics. In some patients, multiple nodes significantly contribute to seizure propagation (e.g., Patient 3), while in others (e.g., Patient 4), seizure spread appears to depend on a single dominant node. This highlights the importance of personalized modeling for identifying optimal intervention targets, which may not always coincide with the clinically defined EZ.</p><p id="P87">To further explore the relationship between the critical nodes predicted by the model and the EZ regions identified clinically, we examined the anatomical locations of the most impactful nodes for selected patients. In Patient 1, the EZ was located in the right supramarginal gyrus (anterior) and the right planum temporale (T1), and the non-EZ node that led to the greatest seizure reduction was the right insula (gyri longi), a region anatomically adjacent to the supramarginal and posterior temporal areas. In Patient 2, the EZ involved the left occipital pole and left anterior occipital sulcus, and the most critical non-EZ nodes were located in adjacent visual areas, including left O2 and O1, reflecting anatomical and functional continuity within the occipital lobe. In Patient 3, the EZ included mesial temporal lobe structures such as the left amygdala and hippocampus. The top non-EZ critical nodes were in the T2-posterior and T3-posterior regions, located in the posterior inferior temporal cortex. These regions are anatomically connected to the mesial temporal lobe and represent typical pathways of seizure propagation in temporal lobe epilepsy, supporting the relevance of the targets predicted by the model. These examples suggest that the model tends to identify critical regions that are closely related to the EZ regions defined clinically in terms of anatomical proximity and known propagation routes.</p><p id="P88">It is important to note that while some model predictions suggest almost complete seizure suppression following the removal of specific nodes (including PZ and NIZ nodes in Patients 4, 5, and 6), we do not interpret these results literally. It is, in practice, unlikely that removing a single node, particularly one outside the EZ, would completely eliminate seizure initiation. This outcome arises in the model because seizure activity is driven by interactions across the network: disrupting key propagation pathways can, in some cases, prevent other nodes from reaching the threshold for seizure propagation. Therefore, while these predictions of seizure suppression should be interpreted cautiously, the analysis still provides valuable insights into the relative importance of different nodes in the propagation network and can help identify secondary targets whose modulation may reduce seizure spread.</p></sec><sec id="S36"><label>3.3</label><title>Simulation of pharmacological interventions</title><p id="P89">We studied the effect of different pharmacological interventions on network seizures in the models. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> shows the impact of the three treatments tested.</p><p id="P90">The personalized whole-brain models predict varying patient responses to pharmacological interventions, highlighting the importance of individual variability in treatment efficacy. While most patients show a dose-dependent reduction in seizure spread, the degree and nature of the response differ across drugs and individuals. For instance, Patient 3 displays a strong response to stiripentol (a GABAergic modulator), suggesting that enhancing inhibitory tone is particularly effective in this case. In contrast, Patient 5 responds more markedly to felbamate, an NMDA receptor antagonist, indicating a possibly dominant role of excitatory drive in seizure propagation for this patient.</p><p id="P91">Interestingly, for some individuals (e.g., Patient 1), the models suggest that multiple drug classes could lead to seizure suppression, albeit to different extents. In others (e.g., Patient 6), the response is robust across all drugs at higher doses, but limited at lower concentrations, possibly reflecting a higher excitability threshold for pharmacological modulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S37" sec-type="discussion"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="P92">Our results demonstrate that it is possible to successfully personalize whole-brain computational models using patient-specific structural and functional data, resulting in individualized simulations that replicate observed seizure propagation patterns. Importantly, these personalized models yield distinct responses to virtual interventions (both surgical, pharmacological, or resulting from local brain stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]), highlighting their potential for guiding patient-specific treatment strategies. While these findings are promising, the translation to clinical application will require thorough validation of this pipeline. A natural next step would be a retrospective analysis of surgical cases, comparing model predictions regarding critical propagation nodes with actual surgical resections and outcomes. Such validation could help assess the predictive power of the models and their potential role in pre-surgical planning or intervention design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>].</p><p id="P93">The dynamics of seizure initiation and propagation in our models can be interpreted using bifurcation theory: each node operates near a threshold where changes in excitability or input can trigger seizure activity. Excitability, modulated by <italic>W</italic><sub>exc</sub>, interacts with incoming network input to determine a node’s state. During personalization, <italic>W</italic><sub>exc</sub> is tuned so that the network reproduces the empirically observed propagation pattern. Crucially, a node’s seizure state depends not only on its local properties but also on inputs from other regions. This explains why removing a single node can prevent downstream regions from seizing. While predictions of seizure suppression from PZ or NIZ nodes may seem overly optimistic compared to clinical observations, they reveal hidden hubs in the propagation network and suggest indirect targets for intervention. Further validation with additional data (such as scalp EEG) and clinical outcomes will be key to confirming these predictions.</p><p id="P94">Unlike more abstract models such as the Epileptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], which are tailored to capture the dynamics of seizure initiation and termination but lack a clear link to the underlying physiology, our neural mass modeling approach enables the simulation of diverse interventions within a unified framework. This is due to the model’s explicit physiological parameters, such as excitatory synaptic gain and receptor-specific conductances, which can be directly manipulated to mimic the effects of pharmacological treatments or neuromodulation. The results presented here illustrate this capability: we simulated both node removal (as a proxy for surgical intervention or stimulation) and drug modulation by altering specific biophysical parameters, and observed how these interventions affected seizure dynamics across patients. The fact that distinct patterns of response emerged across interventions and individuals underscores the versatility of our approach and supports its use as a tool for exploring treatment strategies beyond seizure localization.</p><p id="P95">Although all patients included in this study are clinically classified as drug-resistant, our models still predict responses to certain pharmacological interventions. This is not necessarily inconsistent: drug resistance is typically defined after failure of two or more appropriately chosen and dosed medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], but does not imply that all potential drug combinations or concentrations have been tested. While we did not have access to detailed records of the medications each patient received, limiting direct comparison with clinical outcomes, our framework provides a mechanistic way to explore alternative pharmacological or combined strategies that might be effective but were not considered or optimized in clinical practice. As such, it may help refine drug selection or dosing in a personalized manner, potentially discovering treatment options that would otherwise be overlooked.</p><sec id="S38"><label>4.1</label><title>Limitations</title><p id="P96">A key limitation of the current modeling pipeline is that the fitting process relies exclusively on SEEG data, which samples only a limited portion of the brain. Although the personalized models can make predictions about seizure propagation beyond the regions directly observed with SEEG, the accuracy of these predictions is constrained by the sparse and potentially biased spatial sampling. To address this limitation and improve model personalization, future work will integrate scalp EEG data, which offers broader coverage of cortical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. The combination of SEEG and EEG will enable us to better constrain the model dynamics in both deeply and superficially located brain regions, ultimately enhancing the robustness and generalizability of the personalized models.</p><p id="P97">Another limitation of the current pipeline is that model personalization relies on the average of empirical functional connectivity (FC) matrices across seizures. While this approach is effective in patients with consistent seizure propagation patterns, it may fail to capture the full variability present in cases where seizures follow distinct propagation routes. In such scenarios, the averaged FC matrix may obscure critical features of individual seizure dynamics, potentially leading to a misrepresentation of the true underlying propagation network. As a result, the personalized model might reproduce a generalized propagation pattern that includes all regions involved across seizures, but not necessarily the specific dynamics of any single event. Although this can still be valuable for identifying common targets for intervention, it may limit the precision of predictions in patients with high seizure heterogeneity.</p><p id="P98">It is worth mentioning that most epilepsy patients, but not all, display seizure onset patterns that include a clonic phase characterized by an amplitude increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. In our case, all patients studied presented this characteristic. Nevertheless, it is possible that the current pipeline could still perform reasonably well in cases without such a pronounced amplitude increase at the onset of the seizure. For instance, many cases include pre-ictal discharges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>], and those can be captured by the amplitude envelope method used to compute the FC. In such cases, the pattern of correlation shown in the FC matrix could correspond to the propagation of the pre-ictal spikes, which are thought to be generated by mechanisms related to epileptogenesis, distinct from those generating inter-ictal discharges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. In the rare cases where both the amplitude increase of the clonic phase and the pre-ictal discharges are absent, the personalization algorithm presented here might fail to capture the propagation of seizure dynamics. An alternative approach in such cases could involve identifying fast-onset activity patterns, which have been proposed as reliable markers of seizure onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>].</p><p id="P99">Another limitation of the current approach is the assumption that drug effects are applied uniformly across all brain regions. While this simplifies model implementation, it may overlook the spatial heterogeneity arising from factors such as regional differences in receptor density or pharmacokinetics. Although the receptors targeted by the drugs modeled in this work (GABA and NMDA receptors) tend to have relatively widespread distributions, future work could explore whether incorporating spatially varying drug effects improves prediction accuracy or alters intervention outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="S39"><label>4.2</label><title>Future work</title><p id="P100">In future work, we aim to extend the model validation beyond ictal activity by evaluating how the personalized models reproduce the interictal state. While seizure data provides critical information for identifying seizure propagation pathways, interictal SEEG recordings are more abundant and can offer valuable insights into the underlying network dynamics in the absence of seizures. By comparing model-generated activity with interictal SEEG data, particularly in terms of spatial distribution of interictal discharges, we can further assess the physiological plausibility and stability of the personalized models. This will also help determine whether seizure-prone regions exhibit aberrant dynamics even in the interictal period, potentially enhancing the models’ predictive power. As discussed, we also plan to incorporate scalp EEG data into the pipeline to improve spatial coverage and further constrain model dynamics.</p><p id="P101">Another promising direction for future work involves the development of more sophisticated algorithms for therapeutic intervention planning. In this study, we explored the effects of individual node removal to simulate surgical resection and understand the influence of specific regions on seizure propagation. We focused on single-node interventions due to the computational cost of simulating all possible combinations, but expanding the model to include multi-site resection or stimulation could reveal synergistic effects and support the design of more effective and minimally invasive strategies.</p><p id="P102">Furthermore, the current approach does not capture the full potential of neuromodulation strategies such as tDCS or DBS, which can dynamically modulate activity without permanently altering brain structure. For instance, DBS may suppress seizures by disrupting pathological synchronization across distributed regions, while tDCS can influence a broader spatial extent through diffuse electric fields. We are currently developing optimization algorithms that can identify optimal stimulation targets and protocols, such as multi-channel tDCS, to better reduce seizure propagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>]. Incorporating plasticity mechanisms is also essential to capture the long-term reorganization effects of such treatments and better understand their sustained therapeutic impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="S40" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P103">In this study, we showed that personalized whole-brain models could reproduce patient-specific seizure propagation patterns using SEEG, MRI, and dMRI data. These models were able to match the seizure propagation observed in SEEG data, as captured by the functional connectivity between SEEG signals. The personalized models provided maps of excitability that varied across brain regions and predicted propagation of seizures in areas not sampled by SEEG electrodes. We also demonstrated how these models can be used to simulate different types of interventions, including surgery, tDCS, and pharmacological treatments. These findings support the use of personalized whole-brain modeling as a framework for understanding seizure propagation and exploring treatment options in refractory epilepsy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Appendix</label><media xlink:href="EMS205709-supplement-Appendix.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d5aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S41"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant Agreement No. 855109; ERCSyG 2019) and from FET under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant Agreement No. 101017716).</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="con"><p id="P104"><bold>Author contribution</bold></p><p id="P105">E.
