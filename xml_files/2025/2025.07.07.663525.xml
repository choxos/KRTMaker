Available therapies, aimed at increasing SMN protein levels, can only partially halt motor neuron (MN) degeneration in a select number of patients, reinforcing the need for combinatorial treatments to improve clinical outcomes. We previously showed that mTORC1 overactivation and impaired autophagosome clearance in SMA MNs lead to the accumulation of protein aggregates, contributing to MN degeneration. However, the mechanistic link between SMN protein deficiency and autophagy-lysosomal dysfunction remained unknown. Here, using patient iPSC-derived MNs along with isogenic and healthy controls, we show that SMA MNs exhibit reduced lysosome numbers and impaired functionality. Furthermore, the master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, TFEB, is downregulated, and its nuclear translocation compromised upon SMN deficiency. We further propose the upregulation of the mTORC1 positive modulator TPT1 as contributor to TFEB dysregulation. Notably, TFEB overexpression ameliorates protein aggregate accumulation in SMA MNs and enhances MN survival both in vitro and in a zebrafish SMA model. Our findings identify lysosomal dysfunction as a key player in SMA pathology and highlight TFEB activation as a potential therapeutic strategy for SMA treatment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease and the leading monogenetic cause of infant mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). It is caused by homozygous mutations or deletions in the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene, which encodes the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein. The resulting reduction in SMN protein levels leads to motor neuron (MN) degeneration in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, severe muscle weakness, and often premature death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). In 1995, researchers identified the genetic cause of SMA, which is the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene (telomeric) and its paralogue <italic>SMN2</italic> (centromeric), located to chromosome 5q11.1-13.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). This discovery was pivotal in understanding SMA pathogenesis. Both <italic>SMN</italic> genes are constitutively transcriptionally active and almost identical, with a critical difference within exon 7 in a single translationally silent coding variant, c.840C&gt;T. This small but significant change alters the splicing of <italic>SMN2</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). The protein produced from those transcripts, termed SMNΔ7, is truncated and quickly degraded. Importantly, exon 7 is retained in about 10% of <italic>SMN2</italic> transcripts which therefore produce small amounts of full length, functional SMN protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Because of the small production of full length SMN, <italic>SMN2</italic> is the main SMA disease modifier. Humans naturally have between 0 to 5 copies of the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Minor full length SMN production from <italic>SMN2</italic> makes <italic>SMN2</italic> copy number a critical determinant for disease severity, wherein a higher copy number equals higher full length SMN amount and results in a less severe presentation of SMA. Full-length SMN protein is ubiquitously expressed and essential for the survival of organisms across the animal kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Its critical role underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function and organismal viability. Even though SMN has been linked to many cellular homeostasis pathways, the first role of SMN discovered, and best characterized, is its chaperone function in the assembly of the spliceosome by aiding the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). More roles of SMN have been described in cellular housekeeping processes, such as mRNA transport, protein translation, cytoskeletal dynamics, bioenergetics pathways, stress granule formation, endocytosis and protein homeostasis pathways, including the UPS and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), but some of these are mechanistically less understood.</p><p id="P3">Alterations in autophagy are associated with a wide range of adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and certain neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, microcephaly, Vici syndrome, hereditary spastic paraplegia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In fact, the buildup of neurotoxic protein aggregates in the cytosol is a hallmark shared by numerous NDs. Notably, individuals with certain hereditary neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental conditions often carry loss-of-function mutations or polymorphisms in core autophagy-related genes (ATGs) or genes encoding proteins crucial for autophagosome (AP) trafficking, maturation, and lysosomal fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Additionally, the early stages of sporadic NDs are often marked by the convergence of age-associated neuroinflammation and disruptions in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). However, the precise connections between autophagy and the development of NDs have yet to be fully clarified. Even though a dysregulation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) has been proven a critical factor in almost all NDs, including other motor neuron diseases (MNDs), such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Charcot-Marie-Tooth, the role it plays in SMA has been neglected. The common ground of the few available studies is the accumulation of APs accompanied by increased levels of autophagy cargo and selective adaptor p62 and a defective autophagy flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Additionally, we and others reported an abnormal overactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as a potential cause of these ALP alterations in SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), however, the molecular underpinnings of the autophagy dysregulation and how exactly SMN regulates this process are still unanswered questions.</p><p id="P4">In this study, we used type 2 and type 1 SMA hiPSC lines, along with their recently generated genome-engineered isogenic controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and an additional healthy hiPSC line, to investigate how ALP dysregulations contribute to SMA pathophysiology. Our findings reveal that MNs derived from the SMA hiPSC lines exhibit reduced numbers of lysosomes and autolysosomes, accompanied by diminished autophagy-lysosome-mediated proteostasis capacity and clear signs of intracellular protein aggregation. We found that these defects are likely due to a dysregulation of TFEB nuclear translocation originated from increased TPT1-mTORC1 activity levels. These phenomena seemed specific to MNs as no similar decrease in survival or appearance of lysosomal defects were observed in SMA cortical neurons differentiated from the same patient-derived hiPSCs and could at least partially explain the observed selective vulnerability of spinal MNs in SMA patients. Importantly, overexpression of TFEB in vitro and in a zebrafish model of SMA rescued the protein aggregation phenotype and MN death. This study highlights the importance of this catabolic axis in the pathophysiology of SMA MNs, and thus suggests that boosting lysosomal/autophagy functionality could constitute a promising new strategy to use in combination with the current SMN-increasing therapies.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>SMA patient hiPSC-derived motor neurons have less lysosomes than the isogenic control and healthy motor neurons</title><p id="P5">Previous studies have reported that SMN-deficient cells show defects in the endosomal-lysosomal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) and an accumulation of autophagy substrates, ubiquitinated proteins and undegraded autophagosomes (APs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). However, the mechanism connecting SMN loss to these alterations in the ALP is still unknown. The fact that APs still form properly but accumulate in SMN-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) suggests a failure in the final step of the autophagy flux, specifically in the lysosome-mediated degradation of APs. Therefore, we explored whether an SMN reduction could lead to decreased lysosome biogenesis, potentially causing the aberrant accumulation of APs. First, we used a HEK293T cell line stably expressing a doxycycline inducible shRNA against SMN and observed that SMN knockdown (KD) resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 LAMP1 and the lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin B (CTSB) at the proteins levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A-E</xref>), which suggested a reduced number of lysosomes in the SMN-depleted cells. Next, we explored whether a SMN reduction caused similar lysosomal changes in human MNs. We applied a well-established protocol to differentiate hiPSCs into spinal MNs following specific developmental programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) on a SMA hiPSC isogenic model that we recently developed, composed of a mild SMA type 2 line, a severe SMA type 1 line and one isogenic healthy clone for each line generated by genome-editing mediated conversion of one <italic>SMN2</italic> gene into <italic>SMN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). As additional control to help determine a non-disease baseline, a healthy hiPSC line (WT) reported in numerous studies before, was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). First, to confirm that our model recapitulated the major SMA disease hallmark, increased MN death over healthy controls, we measured the survival of these hiPSC-derived MNs via longitudinal time-laps over a 10-days period and observed an initial phase of acute cell death (first 4 days in vitro post EB dissociation and MN plating), followed by a second phase of more steadily decline in survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-C</xref>). These results align with the bi-phasic MN degeneration profile that has been described in patients affected by severe forms of SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). MN survival over time matched the severity of the disease lines and was significantly ameliorated in the isogenic controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-C</xref>). Interestingly, unbiased automated single-cell quantification of SMN protein levels in the individual MNs at an early (DIV2) and late (DIV10) time-point in culture revealed that the long-living MNs harboured significantly higher SMN levels than the ones present in the early cultures, independent of their disease or healthy genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). In addition, DIV10 SMA type 2 and 1 MNs showed on average similar SMN protein levels to DIV2 healthy MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results confirm our previous study on the heterogeneity of SMN protein levels that individual MNs express and how this inter-MN variability determines their probability of survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). These data suggest that healthy and SMA early MN cultures are composed by a heterogeneous mixture of high- (“resistant”) and low-SMN (“vulnerable”) pools of MNs and the late cultures primarily contain the surviving high-SMN MNs.</p><p id="P6">To determine if lysosomal numbers were altered in SMA MNs, quantification of the amount of LAMP1<sup>+</sup> and CTSB<sup>+</sup> puncta was performed in DIV2 and DIV10 ISL1<sup>+</sup> MNs. A significant decrease in the number of LAMP1<sup>+</sup> lysosomes in both DIV2 SMA type 2 and type 1 MNs compared to their respective isogenic controls and to the WT was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-G</xref>), and, interestingly, no longer detected in the DIV10-surviving MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E, H-I</xref>). The analysis of the number of CTSB<sup>+</sup> puncta per ISL1<sup>+</sup> MNs confirmed these findings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A-E</xref>). We also quantified individual lysosome size and observed that lysosomes are smaller in SMA type 2 and 1 MNs than in the controls, specifically in the early cultures composed by vulnerable and resistant MNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3F-I</xref>). Taken together, these data shows that the most vulnerable SMA MNs, dying faster in culture, contain a reduced number of lysosomes and lysosomal hydrolases than the isogenic and healthy controls and the more resilient SMA MNs. These findings thus support a previously unknown function of SMN in the regulation of lysosomal biology.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Lysosomes in SMA MNs show an increased acidity and CTSB activity</title><p id="P7">The lysosome is a critical organelle for maintaining protein homeostasis by degrading cellular components via proteases that reside within its lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Lysosomes have a characteristic acidic pH of 4-5, which is essential for protease activity, fusion with autophagosomes and the effective clearance of macromolecules and whole organelles, such as mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Lysosomal pH is maintained by v-ATPases, transmembrane proton pumps localized in lysosomes, endosomes and secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). A previously published RNAseq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) revealed that several subunits of the v-ATPase were increased in SMA type 1 MNs compared to WT MNs (ATP6V1A, ATP6V1E1, ATP6V0E1, ATP6V1C1 and ATP6V1G1). Furthermore, ATP6V0E1 and ATP6V1G1 also appeared significantly upregulated in a single-cell RNAseq study on neuromuscular organoids developed from SMA versus isogenic control and healthy hiPSCs that we recently published (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3J</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Since pH is a key parameter for the proper functioning of lysosomes, we questioned whether the previously observed increase in v-ATPase subunits in SMA MNs translated to an abnormal lysosomal acidity. DIV2 and DIV10 MN cultures were stained with the live dyes LysoSensor or LysoTracker (LTR) to label acidic vesicles. LysoSensor, an acidotropic molecule that accumulates in a broad range of acidic vesicles with pH 4.5-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), was used in combination with the live dye CalceinRed to stain the somas of living cells. Automated image-based analysis of the fluorescence intensity distribution of all LysoSensor<sup>+</sup> puncta per cell revealed that the severe SMA type 1 MNs show an increased acidic level of vesicles compared to healthy controls, both at DIV2 and DIV10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). As the LysoSensor dye exhibits a pH-dependent increase in fluorescence signal, this suggests that, in agreement with the mentioned RNAseq study, SMA type 1 MNs present increased vesicle acidification compared to type 2 and control MNs.</p><p id="P8">LysoSensor accumulates in a large variety of acidic vesicles, with a pH ranging from 4.5-6, including not only lysosomes but also amphisomes, late endosomes and various transport vesicles involved in the lysosomal maturation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). To confirm that the enhanced acidic pH values detected in SMA type 1 MNs with Lysosensor was specific to lysosomes, we next used LTR, which stains vesicles with a pH of 4.5-5, in combination with LAMP1 immunostaining. Quantification of the number of LTR<sup>+</sup>;LAMP1<sup>+</sup> puncta per individual MN revealed that both SMA type 2 and type 1 MNs displayed a significant increase compared to their isogenic control pair and the WT MNs at the early time-point studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D-F</xref>). This increase in acidic lysosomes was no longer present at the late time-point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G-H</xref>). We next sought to examine whether the observed increased lysosomal acidification in the most vulnerable SMA MNs would translate into higher lysosomal degradative capacity, as an enhanced acidity is often associated with higher protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). We utilized the MagicRed assay to measure CTSB activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) in living cultures and observed that SMA type 2 MNs presented a mild but significant increase in CTSB activity compared to isogenic and WT controls, which was more marked in the type 1 MN cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I-K</xref>). CTSB is regulated by CTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) and, interestingly, CTSD has been recently identified as a biomarker in SMA, as it was also reported for Alzheimer’s (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) and ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). CTSD levels declined in the cerebrospinal fluid of SMA patients “responders" to nusinersen treatment compared to “non-responders” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Together, these data suggest that while lysosomal numbers are reduced in SMA MNs, their acidification and the activity of pH-dependent hydrolases appeared increased, particularly in the MN subpopulation that degenerates fast in culture. This raises the question of whether these abnormal acidity and protease activity in SMA MNs are due to a defective fusion of lysosomes with APs or, alternatively, whether such phenotypes are caused by a compensatory cellular mechanism attempting to overcome the dysfunctional ALP activity.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>AP-lysosome fusion is compromised in SMA MNs, however lysosomal axonal transport is not impaired</title><p id="P9">Decreased lysosomal numbers and increased lysosomal enzymatic activity are observations that, at first glance, seem counterintuitive. To shed light on this apparent conundrum, we next explored whether the overall autophagy flux is reduced in SMA MNs due to diminished lysosomal numbers, which should therefore eventually result in the formation of intracellular aggregates, or whether the increase in protease activity compensates for it and preserves proteostasis.</p><p id="P10">While we and others have previously reported an enhanced number of APs in several SMA models and human cells, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), and interestingly, mRNA levels of <italic>MAP1LC3B</italic>, <italic>UVRAG</italic> and <italic>GARABAP</italic>, all key players in AP initiation, nucleation, maturation and fusion steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) appeared upregulated in both SMA types 2 and 1 neuromuscular organoids compared to their isogenic controls in our recent scRNAseq study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3J</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), AP clearance has been found impaired. However, a molecular explanation for the malfunctioning AP clearance is still missing. Taking advantage of our human SMA isogenic model, we measured autophagy flux using a lentivirus (LV) carrying a mCherry-GFP-LC3 tandem reporter (LC3-TR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Using this tool, APs are visualized as both mCherry<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>+</sup> puncta, and therefore detected as yellow dots. Due to the sensitivity of GFP to acidic pH levels, the GFP signal is quenched upon AP fusion with acidic lysosomes. This allows autophagy flux to be monitored by quantifying the percentage of autophagic vesicles before (yellow APs = mCh<sup>+</sup>/GFP<sup>+</sup> puncta) and after fusion with lysosomes (red APLs = mCh<sup>+</sup>/GFP<sup>-</sup> puncta) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-B</xref>). MNs were transduced with the LC3-TR LV and the percentage of APLys was quantified 9 days after transduction. SMA type 2 MNs showed a marked decreased in the percentage of APLys (out of the total number of autophagic vesicles) when compared to its isogenic control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, C</xref>), and a significant reduction in APLs was observed in type 1 MNs compared to both healthy MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, D</xref>). This is the first time that an impaired autophagic flux in SMA MNs is reported in a human isogenic model, which also proves SMN causality. It is noteworthy that, due to the lentiviral approach required to label the autophagic vesicles and the time window required for the construct to be expressed, these results correspond to DIV10 MNs, and hence it is possible that a more severe phenotype is unnoticed by the loss of the most vulnerable MNs at this stage. To assess whether the reduced APLys formation was due to a deficient AP-lysosome fusion, we next combined the LC3-TR labelling with immunostaining against the lysosomal CTSB. SMA type 2 MNs showed a significant decrease in the percentage of APLs positive for CTSB compared to their isogenic control and the WT MNs, while SMA type 1 MNs showed a similar significant decrease compared to the WT and a trend for the same pattern in comparison to their isogenic control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E-F</xref>). This indicates that, in addition to a reduced number of APLs per MN, a fusion defect between APs and lysosomes could be present in SMA MNs.</p><p id="P11">The maturation of APs along the axon involves several vesicle fusion processes. APs fuse with increasingly acidic vesicles that contain lysosomal hydrolases and other proteins and eventually with mature lysosomes in the soma to form actively degrading APLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). In addition, because neuronal APs form predominantly in the distal axon, they must undergo retrograde transport towards the cell body to fuse with lysosomes for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). The retrograde transport of APs is mediated by the dynein-dynactin motor complex, which is recruited to APs via the Ras-related protein 7 (RAB7) along microtubules. The same complex also regulates the retrograde transport of late endosomes, lysosomes and other autophagy-related vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Mitochondrial axonal transport has been reported reduced in primary SMA mouse MNs and SMA hiPSC-derived MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Similarly, the levels of several subunits of the dynein complex were found significantly altered in an RNAseq study on hiPSC-derived purified SMA type 1 MNs compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) as well as in SMA types 2 and 1 neuromuscular organoids compared to their isogenic controls in our recent scRNAseq study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3J</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Together, these evidence supports a dysregulation of axonal organelle transport in SMA MNs. As the direct measurement of AP-lysosome fusion is notoriously challenging, we next sought to explore whether SMA MNs were affected by a general lysosome transport defect. WT, SMA, and isogenic corrected MNs were seeded into microfluidic devices for individual LTR-labelled lysosome trafficking analysis within the motor axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). These devices are composed of a somatic and an axonal compartment connected by microchannels through which the motor axons migrate. As previous studies have described that the microchannel section proximal to the soma compartment (“entry”) can contain both dendrites and axons, whereas the most distal section (900 μm distance from entry) contains exclusively axons (“exit”) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>), lysosomal transport was analysed in both regions. The tracked lysosomes were classified, based on their movement, as retrograde, bi-directional, anterograde and stationary. Analysis revealed clear differences between SMA MNs and controls. Both SMA MN types showed a marked increase in retrogradely transported lysosomes compared to isogenic and healthy control MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H-I</xref>). This was accompanied by a reduction in the percentage of stationary lysosomes, with type 1 MNs showing the most profound decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H-I</xref>). This increase in the percentage of moving lysosomes correlated with the reduction in lysosomes pause duration, especially in the “exit” axonal section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J-K</xref>). Mean velocities remained comparable across all MN genotypes (data not shown). Together, these findings indicate enhanced lysosomal trafficking from the axon terminals towards the cell bodies in SMA MNs. This suggests that the reduced AP-lysosome fusion, evidenced by decreased APLys and CTSB<sup>+</sup> APLys percentages, is likely not caused by impaired lysosome transport. While this data clearly demonstrate altered lysosomal dynamics in SMA MNs compared to healthy MNs, two possible interpretations emerge: the increased transport could either represent a compensatory response to impaired degradative capacity, or it might indicate dysregulation of controlled lysosome trafficking. This distinction needs to be explored further since lysosomal pauses along the microtubules are critical for fusion between lysosomes and APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Lysosomal defects upon SMN deficiency are specific to MNs and not present in cortical neurons</title><p id="P12">It is known that most neurodegenerative diseases, like AD, Parkinson’s (PD), Huntington’s (HD) and ALS, exhibit a pathology that selectively targets defined subsets of neurons. While this effect is well documented, the mechanistic origin of this selective neuronal vulnerability is still not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). This phenomenon also occurs in SMA, where spinal MNs are the primary pathological target of SMN deficiency, while other neuronal types, like cortical neurons, remain mostly unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). Furthermore, in a previous study we discovered a second level of selective vulnerability as, within the spinal MNs, the ones harbouring intrinsically low SMN protein levels died significantly faster in culture than the ones expressing higher amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). In contrast, cortical neurons (CxNs) derived from the same SMA hiPSC lines, despite having analogous SMN protein deficiency and presenting similar cellular heterogeneity in SMN protein, did not show SMN-dependent death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To explore whether the discovered ALP axis defects in SMA were specific to MNs and not present in other neuronal types, which could argue for an underlying cause of their selective vulnerability, we investigated several lysosomal parameters in CxNs. Our isogenic cohort of hiPSCs was subjected to a well-established protocol for CxN generation based on the inducible overexpression of <italic>NGN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). CxN differentiation was confirmed by immunostaining of the CxN-specific marker BRN2 (POU3F2) together with the pan-neuronal marker microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2). No difference in the CxN differentiation capacity between the hiPSC lines was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-C</xref>). First, longitudinal quantification of neuronal survival over two weeks in culture revealed that while MN death correlated with disease severity (SMA type 1 MNs survived worse in culture than type 2 and these worse than healthy controls), and was fully rescued in the isogenic controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>), SMA CxN survival was similar to that of isogenic and healthy controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A, C</xref>). After confirming the selective vulnerability of MNs and the resilience of CxNs to SMN deficiency, we next quantified the number of lysosomes per individual CxN using LAMP1 immunostaining and LTR labelling. Neither the lysosomal numbers nor lysosomal acidification were altered in SMA type 2 or type 1 CxNs compared to their isogenic pairs or healthy control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-H</xref>). Altogether, these data show that, despite carrying the same SMA-causing mutations and having the same genetic background, while MNs exhibit a SMN-dependent death and defective lysosomal biology, lysosomal numbers and acidification in CxNs, as well as their general health remained unaffected. These findings indicate that the lysosomal faults detected upon SMN protein deficiency affect specifically MNs and thus could contribute to their selective degeneration in the patients.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>SMN deficiency results in the formation of protein aggregates</title><p id="P14">A hallmark of many NDs is the presence and accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates that contribute to the collapse of protein homeostasis, ultimately leading to cellular toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). The class of aggregating protein is often specific to each disease, especially if this is caused by a mutation that alters the turnover, conformation, subcellular localization or distribution of the resulting protein, such as extracellular amyloid beta plaques and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau tangles in AD, α-synuclein<sup>+</sup> Lewy bodies in PD, mutated huntingtin deposits in HD, or TDP-43, SOD1 or FUS in ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). In contrast, SMA is not caused by the accumulation of a mutated protein but instead by the deficient levels of a protein essential for MN survival, the SMN protein. Nevertheless, in our previous study we found both p62 and ubiquitinated proteins, main components of protein aggregate structures, accumulated in SMA MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), mutations in <italic>UBA1</italic> cause X-linked SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>) and widespread perturbations in ubiquitin homeostasis have been also described in SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>), matching the largely increased levels of the ubiquitin gene expression (<italic>UBC</italic>) in SMA neuromuscular organoids found through our recent scRNAseq data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3J</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). It is well known that in NDs aberrant protein aggregation often correlates with dysfunction of the ALP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>). Given the lysosomal and autophagy defects that we have identified in SMA MNs in this study, we explored whether SMN deficiency could result in an aberrant protein aggregation phenotype. First, as lysosomal dysfunction upon SMN downregulation was observed in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>), similar cells were used to perform differential solubility assays to separate proteins into soluble and insoluble (aggregate-containing) fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Immunoblot analysis of these fractions confirmed that SMN protein is not enriched in the insoluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B-C</xref>), and uncovered that both the autophagy substrate and receptor and aggregation marker p62/sequestosome-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>) and the aggresome cage protein vimentin (Morrow et al. 2020) were significantly enriched in the insoluble fractions upon SMN knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B, D-E</xref>). This result aligns with previous studies showing that p62 levels are increased in SMA in vitro and in vivo models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). Next, these aggregation markers were measured by western blot in WT and SMA MNs. Both SMA type 2 and type 1 MNs showed increased levels of p62 and vimentin in a disease severity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F-H</xref>). Aiming to validate these results using a second approach, vimentin immunostaining was performed in early and late MN cultures. Quantification of vimentin<sup>+</sup> puncta per MN at DIV2 showed a significant increase in SMA compared to WT MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I-K</xref>), and was not detected in the longer-surviving MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5L-M</xref>). Finally, as further confirmation of the presence of protein aggregates, Proteostat, an assay to detect and measure denatured proteins within aggresomes and aggresome-like inclusion bodies in fixed cells (Vasudevan et al. 2024) was utilized. The number of Proteostat<sup>+</sup> puncta per MN was significantly increased in SMA MNs, specifically at DIV2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5N-P</xref>) and not in DIV10 MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5Q-R</xref>). Additionally, the results showed that both the number of vimentin<sup>+</sup> and Proteostat<sup>+</sup> puncta generally increased in MNs of all genotypes at DIV10 compared to DIV2. This indicates that MNs accumulate undegraded protein aggregates as they survive longer periods of time, probably due to the intrinsic stressful conditions of in vitro culture, mimicking the in vivo scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), however, a clear increase of these aggregates is only observed in SMA MNs relative to healthy controls while both vulnerable and resistant populations are still present in the culture.</p><p id="P15">We and others have previously reported dysregulation of mTOR activity in SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>). Given mTOR’s critical role in protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>), to rule out that the increased levels of the protein aggregation markers detected in SMA MNs were due to an abnormally increased protein synthesis, which could saturate the neurons’ proteostasis pathways and lead to protein aggregation, we measured nascent protein biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>) in SMA MNs. Using this method, the results showed that overall protein synthesis is partially reduced in SMA MNs compared to healthy control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>), which is consistent with previous studies revealing a depletion of ribosomes and protein translation upon SMN loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>). These findings demonstrate that SMN deficiency causes a protein aggregation phenotype in vulnerable SMA MNs, which may have been previously overlooked due to the early death of these MNs.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>TFEB is dysregulated in SMN deficient cells and its overexpression ameliorates MN degeneration in vitro and in vivo</title><p id="P16">One way through which mTORC1 negatively regulates autophagy functionality is via the phosphorylation of the transcription factor TFEB, which determines its subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>). TFEB is the main regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, lysosomal acidification and fusion with APs, and hence it increases autophagy flux, and it is conserved through evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>). mTORC1 is the main negative regulator of TFEB activity and when activated it phosphorylates TFEB at least at three serine residues (S122, S142, and S211). This promotes TFEB nuclear export or prevents it from being transported into the nucleus and retained in the cytoplasm, where it can no longer promote the expression of the CLEAR (Coordinated Lysosomal Expression and Regulation) gene network, a large cohort of lysosomal and autophagic genes crucial for the de novo formation of lysosomes and APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>). Based on our results, we questioned whether the overactivated mTORC1 in SMA MNs could lead to reduced activity of TFEB and this to the observed defects in the ALP axis. To test this hypothesis, we first knocked down SMN in a HEK293T line stably expressing an inducible shRNA and measured TFEB levels in cytoplasmic and nuclear cellular fractionations. Western blot analysis revealed that SMN KD did reduce the nuclear:cytoplasmic TFEB ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-C</xref>). This data indicates that SMN deficiency impedes TFEB’s nuclear translocation, which could then lead to the observed reduction in lysosomal markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>).</p><p id="P17">It has been shown in the context of several NDs that TFEB dysregulation can act as a driver of autophagy dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>) and that TFEB overexpression (OE) can prevent or ameliorate neurodegeneration in different model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>). Therefore, we next examined whether TFEB could constitute a potential therapeutic target in SMA, which remained unexplored. First, mRNA levels of TFEB and multiple CLEAR genes were significantly increased in HEK293T cells transduced with a TFEB overexpressing lentivirus (TFEB LV) compared to a scramble overexpressing control (sscr LV) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A-B</xref>). Similarly, WT MNs transduced with the TFEB LV showed an enhanced number of LAMP1<sup>+</sup> puncta per MN by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6C</xref>). This data confirmed that LV-mediated TFEB OE increased TFEB mRNA levels and expression of its target genes. Next, to test whether TFEB OE would ameliorate the observed lysosomal/autophagy pathological phenotypes in SMA MNs and enhance their survival, WT and SMA MNs were transduced with either the sscr or TFEB LVs. MN survival was determined by quantifying the number of ISL1<sup>+</sup> MNs alive after 10 days in culture compared to those detected after plating (2 days in culture). Both WT and SMA type 2 MNs showed a significant increase in survival upon TFEB OE compared to the MNs transduced with the control virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E-F</xref>). MN axonal growth, pathfinding, and target innervation defects have been reported in different SMA models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>). Therefore, neurite length was also measured and normalized by cell count in SMA type 2 MNs. These results revealed a significant increase in neurite length per cell upon TFEB OE specifically in the SMA MNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6D-E</xref>). No effect on survival was detected in the severe SMA type 1 condition, potentially because these MNs undergo a significantly more pronounced cell death over the first week in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) that cannot be rescued due to the temporal window required for TFEB levels to raise after LV transduction. These data therefore shows that the positive effect of TFEB OE is not limited to diseased MNs but can also boost the survival of WT MNs. This aligns with our observation that WT MNs also display a heterogeneity of SMN levels that determines their probability of survival upon stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), and that improving ALP functionality can promote neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>) and constitutes a pro-survival mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To test whether TFEB activation would also improve SMA disease phenotypes in vivo, we overexpressed it in an SMA zebrafish model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>), a malleable system to determine the effects of genetic manipulations on MN health. Five different experimental conditions were tested: zebrafish embryos of the tg(mnx1:GFP) line in which MNs and axons are fluorescently labelled were (1) left uninjected as controls, (2) injected with a morpholino against smn (smnMO), (3) smnMO plus wild-type TFEB (WT TFEB), (4) smnMO plus TFEB in which serine 211 was mutated to an alanine (TFEB S211A) to prevent mTOR-mediated phosphorylation and therefore induce TFEB translocation to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>), and (5) smnMO plus a truncated version of TFEB that renders it constitutively active (c.a. TFEB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>). All TFEB constructs were cloned under the <italic>mnx1</italic> MN specific promoter and were N-terminally tagged with FLAG. At 26-28 hours post-fertilization (hpf), the effect of TFEB overexpression was measured by analyzing the survival of spinal caudal primary (CaP) MNs. The quantifications showed that SMN KD, as reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>), decreased the number of MNs, while overexpression of all three TFEB constructs significantly rescued this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H-I</xref>). In addition, immunostaining analysis demonstrated that all three TFEB constructs localized to the cell body of MNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6F</xref>). It has been previously published that SMN downregulation in zebrafish also results in the aberrant ramification of spinal MN axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>). An abnormally high presence of MNs with aberrant axonal branching was observed upon SMN KD compared to uninjected controls, which was significantly ameliorated in all three overexpressed TFEB conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6G-H</xref>). Importantly, the overexpression of a TFEB construct lacking the DNA-binding domain did not ameliorate the pathological MN axonal branching in the SMA zebrafish, which indicates that TFEB transcriptional activity is essential for its cytoprotective function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6I-J</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the induction of lysosome/autophagy functionality through TFEB overexpression not only increases the survival of MNs in our human <italic>in vitro</italic> model but also improves MN health <italic>in vivo</italic> in an SMA Zebrafish model.</p><p id="P19">As our data showed that SMN MNs undergo the accumulation of undegraded protein aggregates, which are widely linked to neuronal death in virtually all neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>), likely caused by the impaired APLys functionality, we next investigated whether TFEB overexpression could also ameliorate this common neurodegeneration hallmark. To increase the window of time of enhanced TFEB levels and thus the probability of it exerting its cytoprotective role before the most vulnerable MNs were lost, next we overexpressed TFEB on day 9 EBs, when MNs start to differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), and fixed them on day 15. High-content imaging and automated quantification of Proteostat<sup>+</sup> protein aggregates in EB cryosections showed that SMA type 1 EBs had a greater amount than their isogenic control and than SMA type 2 and healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6J, L</xref>), confirming our results on dissociated MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7N-R</xref>). In addition, TFEB OE significantly reduced the number of Proteostat<sup>+</sup> puncta compared to the EBs transduced with the sscr-control LV, especially in SMA type 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6J, L</xref>). This reduction in the abundance of protein aggregates mediated by TFEB OE was accompanied by a notable increase in the number of ISL1+ MNs in the SMA type 1 and type 2 EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6K-L</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Lastly, we explored whether a combinatorial treatment approach composed of a SMN-increasing compound together with TFEB OE, would lead to an improved outcome on SMA MN survival. We thus treated SMA type 2 MNs simultaneously with risdiplam, one of the three approved treatments for SMA patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>) and our TFEB OE LV for 9 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7A-B</xref>). Unexpectedly, while risdiplam (75-600 nM) alone did increase average SMN levels by 30-40% compared to control-treated SMA type 2 MNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7C</xref>), it reduced their survival by 20% in all the concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7D</xref>). The same toxic effect was observed in MNs treated with risdiplam and TFEB OE simultaneously; however, even under these unfavourable conditions, TFEB OE prevented MN death compared to the sscr LV-treated MNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7E</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate that dysregulation of TFEB localization triggered by deficient SMN protein levels could constitute the underlying cause for the impaired ALP in SMA MNs. Our results thus also suggest that increasing TFEB levels has the potential to slow down or even prevent SMA MN degeneration and loss.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>TPT1 upregulation as a potential link between reduced SMN levels and mTORC1 activation in SMA</title><p id="P21">We next decided to search for a mechanistic link between SMN protein deficiency and mTOR overactivation, causing the TFEB dysregulation and ALP failure that we have discovered in SMA MNs. A promising candidate was identified from our RNAseq on FACS-purified SMA type 1 vs healthy control MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), <italic>TPT1</italic> (Tumour Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1). <italic>TPT1</italic> is a ubiquitously expressed gene which encoded protein regulates cellular growth, protein synthesis, cell proliferation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>). Although little is known about the functionality of this protein, a study identified a role for TPT1 in the regulation of autophagy by activating mTOR, as the reduction of TPT1 levels led to the induction of autophagy flux via mTOR inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>). TPT1 appeared significantly increased in SMA type 1 MNs compared to healthy controls in our RNAseq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) and, importantly, also significantly upregulated in the MN clusters from our recent scRNAseq on SMA type 2 and type 1 neuromuscular organoids compared to their isogenic controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3J</xref>). We thus hypothesized that an increased TPT1 expression could be at least partially responsible for the mTOR overactivation observed in SMA MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), resulting in the cytoplasmic sequestration and inactivation of TFEB that led to the impaired lysosomal function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Should TPT1 constitute the missing mechanistic link between pathologically low SMN protein levels and ALP malfunctioning, <italic>TPT1</italic> knockdown should restore the defective autophagy flux and increase SMA MN survival. To test this possibility, we reduced either <italic>SMN, TPT1</italic> or both simultaneously via an RNAi approach on a stable HEK293T cell line expressing the LC3-TR. Three days after RNAi transfection, cells were analyzed by FACS to measure APLs mCherry fluorescence intensity as a proxy for autophagy flux efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). mCherry signal was reduced to 50% in SMN KD cells, matching our automated image-based APLs quantification in SMA type 1 MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-F</xref>), while TPT1 KD alone only reduced mCherry fluorescence by 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Importantly, simultaneous knockdown of both SMN and TPT1 showed a significant 20% increase in APLys mCherry signal compared to SMN KD alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). This indicates that lowering TPT1 levels partially ameliorates the reduction in APLs formation caused by SMN deficiency. To confirm these results, automated imaging and quantification of autophagic vesicles on similar cell conditions was conducted. The analysis validated an increase in the number of APs and a reduction in the percentage of APLs upon SMN KD, indicative of defective autophagy flux, both of which were rescued to control levels upon additional TPT1 downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D-E</xref>). TPT1 KD did not alter SMN mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8A</xref>) and, in addition, while SMN KD cells showed reduced <italic>LAMP1</italic>, <italic>CTSB</italic> and <italic>TFEB</italic> gene expression levels, TPT1 downregulation drastically corrected those changes back to control levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8B-E</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Finally, we sought to determine whether TPT1 KD would have a similar positive effect on SMA MNs. SMA type 2 MNs showed increased phosphorylated levels of the mTORC1 downstream targets S6K1 and S6 when compared to their isogenic control and healthy control MNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8F-I</xref>) and SMA MNs transduced with a LV carrying a shRNA against TPT1 displayed notably reduced levels of p-S6K1 protein compared to sscr-LV treated cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8G-H</xref>).

We then quantified survival of the TPT1 KD MNs over the ones exposed to the sscr LV in healthy, SMA type 2 and type 1 cultures. Although the TPT1 shRNA-LV used did not contain any reporter or selection cassette to enable determining the percentage of neurons transduced with the construct, and in addition, a large fraction of the most vulnerable MNs could die before TPT1 expression is reduced, live imaging and automated quantification showed that while WT TPT1 KD MNs displayed a minor decrease in survival compared to the sscr-treated ones, both SMA MN types showed a mild yet significant increase upon TPT1 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7 H-I</xref>). Overall, these data shows that an increase in TPT1 levels induced by the loss of SMN constitutes a highly interesting target for further studies, as TPT1 downregulation ameliorates ALP alterations and enhances SMA MN survival.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">This study provides empirical support for the hypothesis that SMN protein regulates the functionality of the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP). SMN deficiency impairs the nuclear translocation of TFEB, the master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. As a result, neurotoxic protein aggregates build up, contributing to MN degeneration in SMA. Using a hiPSC isogenic model that we recently generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) composed of one SMA type 2, one SMA type 1 patient-derived iPSC line and their corresponding isogenic corrected control, and an additional healthy control hiPSC line to generate spinal MNs, we show that SMA MNs contain a reduced number of lysosomes and autolysosomes compared to their isogenic and healthy controls. Surprisingly, the remaining lysosomes displayed increased acidity and hydrolase activity, likely as a compensatory mechanism to cope with defective AP clearance. These phenotypes are accompanied by protein aggregates, hallmark of late-onset NDs. Interestingly, these features are only present in early MN cultures that we demonstrate contain low-SMN expressing MNs, prone to die a few days after being plated (“vulnerable”), and not in high-SMN expressing ones that survive for significantly longer periods of time (“resistant”) and phenotypically resemble the isogenic and healthy control MNs. Furthermore, these disease phenotypes were absent in cortical neurons generated from the same disease hiPSCs, suggesting that ALP dysfunction contributes specifically to MN degeneration in SMA. To explore therapeutic avenues complementary to current SMN-increasing treatments, we found that lentiviral-mediated TFEB overexpression in 2D human MN cultures or spinal cord spheres significantly reduced protein aggregates and rescued MN death, especially in the severe SMA type 1 condition. Importantly, this cytoprotective effect was replicated in a zebrafish SMA model. There, we demonstrated that preventing TFEB’s DNA-binding capability abolished its rescue effect on MN axonal defects and MN survival, reinforcing its role in mediating CLEAR gene expression and lysosomal biogenesis. Furthermore, we propose the upregulation of TPT1 in SMA MNs, a positive mTORC1 regulator primarily linked to cancer, as a key link between deficient SMN protein levels and mTORC1 overactivation, resulting in reduced TFEB activity, insufficient lysosomal biogenesis and faulty ALP functionality contributing to MN death in SMA.</p><p id="P24">SMA differs from classic proteinopathies, such as AD, HD and PD, which are characterized by neurotoxic aggregates like Aβ, Tau, or mutant huntingtin in that SMA’s pathophysiology is caused by the lack of a protein, SMN, rather than by toxic protein accumulation. Additionally, as an early-onset disease, it was expected that SMA’s vulnerable MNs would succumb long before accumulating undegraded material. Consequently, proteostasis, specially the ALP, has been largely overlooked in SMA research. However, studies using mouse ESC-derived, human iPSC-derived, and SMA mouse MNs have revealed impaired AP clearance due to defective autophagy flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), a common ND feature. In addition, we and others reported hyperactivated mTORC1 signaling, increased p62 levels -which selectively targets SMN protein for autophagic degradation- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), and direct involvement of SMN in stress granule degradation via autophagy, in coordination with C9ORF72 and p62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>). These findings highlight the complex interplay between SMN protein and ALP functionality.</p><p id="P25">Lysosomes are central hubs for degrading autophagic and endocytic components, preserving neuronal survival and function. While many NDs exhibit defects in early ALP stages -such as AP formation and cargo recognition in ALS/FTD, cargo capture and degradation in PD, and AP maturation in AD- defects in later stages, including AP-lysosome fusion and lysosome acidification, are primarily linked to PD and AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref>). In this study, we have discovered that in SMA, despite having completely different early-onset etiology and clinical manifestations to PD or AD, MNs displayed impaired AP clearance due to defective lysosomal biogenesis, mediated by a dysfunctional TPT1-mTOR-TFEB axis. This unexpected similarity suggests that SMA may share systemic characteristics with late-onset NDs. Such finding is supported by recent evidence where proteomic analyses of SMA mouse spinal cords identified APP, PSEN1, HTT, MTOR, SOD1 or TDP-43 as upstream regulators of dysregulated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref>), all key players in NDs.</p><p id="P26">TFEB dysregulation has been proposed as a driver of ALP dysfunction across several NDs, including PD, AD, HD and SBMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">103</xref>). Under basal conditions, TFEB resides in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>). SMA’s lysosomal stress mechanism, neglected until now, may involve neuron-specific post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein-protein interactions that hinder TFEB’s ALP activation. Phosphorylation by mTOR is a key regulatory mechanism keeping TFEB cytoplasmic, but other kinases, such as ERK2, AKT and GSK3β, are also involved. Consistent with this, we and others have reported that SMA MNs exhibit mTORC1 overactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) and dysregulated ERK2, AKT and GSK3β activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">104</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">106</xref>). Intriguingly, mTORC1’s activity in SMA appears tissue-specific - low in skeletal muscle but high in MNs- mirroring observations in other NDs like SBMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">107</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">108</xref>). Although the three approved SMN-increasing therapies (nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec, risdiplam) have transformed SMA prognosis, these remain lifelong treatments instead of cures, with variable efficacy and potential severe adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">109</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R110">110</xref>). Additionally, prenatal treatment might be required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">111</xref>). This underscores the need for ongoing research to develop safer, more universally effective combinatorial treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R112">112</xref>). Numerous studies have reported that TFEB overexpression or activation prevents the selective loss of neuronal populations in NDs by enhancing the autophagic clearance of toxic protein aggregates and improving the ALP functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R113">113</xref>). It is worth noting, though, that autophagy activation is not universally neuroprotective. In diseases with lysosomal dysfunction, inducing AP formation may worsen phenotypes by exacerbating intracellular traffic jams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">102</xref>). In SMA, it was proposed that autophagy causes MN death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R114">114</xref>). In that study, autophagy inhibition via 3-MA in SMA mouse neonates ameliorated disease phenotypes. These results, however, align with our findings on an impaired ALP functionality, in which case slowing down AP formation might indeed have some beneficial effect. Clinical trials exploring TFEB activation in NDs (via AAV vectors, trehalose, or metformin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R115">115</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R116">116</xref>) and our findings on human MNs and a zebrafish SMA model further support TFEB activation as an emerging therapeutic target to prevent MN axon degeneration and MN death in SMA.</p><p id="P27">Although the origin of the selective MN death that characterizes SMA is still a matter of intense investigation, it likely arises from splicing defects in mRNAs critical for MN survival and neuromuscular junction maintenance due to SMN loss. For example, Pellizzoni’s team demonstrated that SMN deficiency disrupts <italic>MDM2/MDM4</italic> splicing, critical repressors of p53, leading to p53-mediated MN death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R117">117</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R119">119</xref>). Non-splicing functions of SMN, including actin binding (associated to neurite outgrowth, axonal pathfinding and synapse formation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R120">120</xref>) and ribosome-associated transcription modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>) have also been proposed.

Yet, its role in SMA remains understudied. Further investigation is needed to determine the reliance of MNs on ALP, disease-stage-specific autophagy dysfunction, and the pathological cascade following ALP disruption.

On the next day the membrane was washed 4 times with 1X TBST for 7min each before the secondary antibody diluted in 5% non-fat milk (PanReac AplliChem ITW, A0830) in PBS was added for 1h at RT. After another step of washing 4 times with 1X TBST for 7min each the signal was developed using western blot substrate PICO or DURA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34580), X-Ray Films (Fuji, 4741019289), and the Cawomat 2000 IR X-Ray developer. Densitometric analysis was performed on scanned X-Ray films using the Quantity One software (Bio-RAD).</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Microfluidic device (MFD) production &amp; imaging procedure</title><p id="P41">MFDs were produced at the Microstructure Facility (MSF, CRTD) based on a previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Briefly, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was used to form a negative imprint of a photoresist master template that contains the structures for wells and micro-channels of the MFD. After coating of glass coverslips with polyethylene-alt-maleic anhydride PEMA, the PDMS replica was placed on the PEMA-coated coverslips and bonding induced by placing a weight on top of the PDMS replica for 2h at 120°C. The result of this bonding step is the finished MFD with PDMS wells, connected by 100 micro-channels, placed on a glass coverslip. Before the PDL coating, MFDs were treated with air plasma to hydrophilize the micro-channels (plasma time: 4min, Gas stb time: 50s, Power setpoint: 50W, Gas1(Air) setpoint 0%, Gas2 (O2) setpoint: 60%, base vacuum: 0.5mbar), for subsequent PLO coating. MFDs were incubated with a 30% PLO (Sigma Aldrich, 27378-49-0) solution in PBS, using 50μL per well, overnight at 37°C. On the following day wells were washed with 1X PBS 3times for 30 minutes each. During the last washing step MFDs were placed under UV at RT to ensure sterility. Next 25μg/mL laminin diluted in PBS were incubated in the wells overnight at 37°C. Before cells were seeded into the wells at a density of 7.5*104 wells were incubated with medium for 30min. On the day of live imaging cells were stained with LTR as explained above for 1h, by adding the dye to both compartments of the well. Imaging took place in a Zeiss Spinning Disk microscope equipped with a cage incubator, CO2 incubation and heating at 37°C. The 40x/0.95 Plan-Apochromat, Air was used for image acquisition together with the ZenBlue software (Zeiss). Videos were acquired with frames taken every 1s for a total duration of 120s. A minimum of 6 fields (each containing 8 channels) were imaged per cell line.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Lysosomal trafficking analysis</title><p id="P42">Acquired movies were bleach corrected using the “histogram” method in FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R125">125</xref>). Lysosomes were tracked within the micro-channels, using the MATLAB based software “Fluorescence Image Evaluation Software for Tracking and Analysis” (FIESTA) with parameters specified in Supplemental Table 2. All automatically generated tracks were manually verified, and faulty tracks were either corrected or excluded. The tracks were then parsed into phases of positive, negative and stationary segments, using python-based segmentation algorithm. Briefly, the original data was approximated by a cubic spline (weighted least square interpolation from python package scipy.interpolate) over a three-point window (measurement interval = 1 s) to calculate the velocity at each data point. Data points were given either of two states - paused (velocity &lt; 100 nm/s) or running (velocity ≥ 100 nm/s). To reduce noise, isolated single state points were eliminated by converting them to match their neighbouring states, after which adjacent regions of the same state were combined into segments. Runs were characterized as positive (soma to axon) or negative (axon to soma). Based on the composition of runs for each track they were classified as either anterograde (only positive runs), retrograde (only negative runs), or bi-directional (at least one positive and one negative run). If a vesicle moved less than 2.3 μm over the total 120 s imaging period, they were classified as stationary.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Zebrafish experiments</title><p id="P43">Zebrafish were kept and bred according to standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R126">126</xref>).

Two independent observers analyzed the morphology of the CaP axons. During all analyses the observers were blinded to the treatments (randomization and encryption of file was done using the Blind analysis Tool v1.0 plugin in Fiji software). For the analysis of the number of motor neurons a region of interest (ROI) was defined at the level of the spinal cord with dimensions of: width = 200 um, height = 50 um and depth = 10 um.
