In this study, we examined whether these measures dissociate different perceptual states during an auditory attention task. Participants (Main and Control experiments; N = 34 and 27, both sexes) listened to tone sequences designated as ‘Target’, ‘Distractor’, and ‘Probe’, designed to isolate active attention from suppression of irrelevant input.</p><p id="P2">We focused on four physiological signals: pupil diameter (PD), pupil dilation rate (PDR), blink rate, and microsaccades (MS). Compared to a control condition, both Target and Probe intervals elicited sustained PD increases, blink suppression, and prolonged MS inhibition indicating extended attentional engagement. Interestingly, the Distractor interval also showed prolonged blink suppression and elevated PDR, suggesting active arousal to suppress irrelevant input. However, MS dynamics during Distractors were indistinguishable from control, implying that attention was not allocated to the distractors despite the heightened arousal. This dissociation supports the interpretation that MS is specifically modulated by attentional allocation, while PD and blinks also reflect general arousal or suppressive mechanisms.</p><p id="P3">Overall, these findings reveal that PD, MS, and blinking capture distinct aspects of cognitive control. Together, they offer a multidimensional framework for studying selective attention and distractor suppression in complex tasks.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Auditory selective attention</kwd><kwd>Working memory</kwd><kwd>Eye tracking</kwd><kwd>Listening effort</kwd><kwd>Blink</kwd><kwd>Multi-sensory</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Successful listening in busy acoustic environments requires dynamic engagement of arousal and attention.

This pattern reflects attentional gating - suppression of saccades and blinks during cognitively demanding tasks helps conserve processing resources by minimizing the disruptive effects of visual transients. As such, ocular behavior serves as a sensitive indicator of moment-to-moment cognitive and perceptual states. Among these behaviors, microsaccades (MS) - small, involuntary fixational eye movements occurring at approximately 1–2 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Rolfs, 2009</xref>) - are particularly relevant. Because MS are compatible with pupillometry, which requires sustained fixation, they offer a valuable metric in contexts that preclude free-viewing paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cui &amp; Hermann, 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The MS generation network - comprising the superior colliculus (SC), frontal eye fields (FEF), and visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Munoz &amp; Istvan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hafed et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Rucci &amp; Victor, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hsu et al., 2021</xref>) - is thought to underly automatic visual sampling.

MSI likely reflects rapid suppression of continuous sampling activity in response to attention-demanding input. Ongoing MS activity is further modulated by task load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dalmaso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lange et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Xue et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Badde et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kadosh et al., 2024</xref>).

The Distractor sequence was composed of the same 10 frequencies as the Target, but shuffled in order. The Probe sequence was either identical to the Target (No Change), or contained a switch in position of 5 randomly selected tones (but never the first or the last tone in the sequences to avoid primacy/recency effects). That the ‘Distractor’ sequence was comprised of the same tones as the Target and Probe increased the difficulty of the task and encouraged participants to ignore the Distractor sequence to avoid interference in memory.</p><p id="P16">This design resulted in each trial’s stimulus presentation phase lasting for 4 seconds in total, followed by a self-paced keypress response period. Brief visual feedback on accuracy and reaction time was provided on the screen after each trial.

The Target and Distractor sequences were generated in the same manner as previously described. The final sequence (Probe) was either a standard tone sequence (80% of trials) or a single, repeated tone lasting 500 ms (20% of trials). Participants were instructed to press a key whenever they detected the repeated tone. As such, attention was required only for the Probe sequence, and the task itself was perceptually simple and did not involve memory. The task was designed to maintain general engagement with the auditory stimuli without inducing significant cognitive load.

Ocular data were recorded from an infrared eye-tracking camera (Eyelink 1000 Desktop Mount, 1000Hz sampling rate; SR Research Ltd.) placed below the monitor at a horizontal distance of 62 cm. Auditory stimuli were presented binaurally through a Roland Tri-capture 24-bit 96 kHz soundcard connected to a pair of Sennheiser HD558 headphones, with volume levels adjusted to a comfortable level for each participant. The standard eye-tracking five-point calibration procedure was conducted before each experimental block. During the experiment, participants were instructed to fixate their eye gaze on a black cross in the middle of the screen, against a grey background. Gaze fixation was checked following each trial, and if fixation was detected correctly the next trial began after a 2-second inter-trial interval.</p><p id="P22">A practice block was run before the main task for all participants, all with the same practice stimulus set, which was different from the individual stimulus sets used in the experimental blocks.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Data preprocessing and analysis</title><sec id="S11"><title>Pupillometry</title><p id="P23">Pupil data from the left eye were analyzed.

Outlier trials (trials with &gt;50% data points 3 standard deviations away from the mean across trials) were also excluded. Less than 1 outlier trial per participant per block were excluded on average.

Correct and incorrect trials were also extracted based on the behavioral outcomes of each trial: for each subject, we selected the 30 correct trials with the fastest reaction times and 30 random incorrect (both “miss” and “false alarm” trials; on average, participants produced 45 incorrect trials overall, ranging from 25 to 68 trials). In cases where the number of incorrect trials was less than 30, the number of correct trials was directly matched to the subject’s total number of incorrect trials. The correct trials were selected by sorted reaction time to reduce the effect of chance on the selection of correct trials, as trials which participants were less certain of or were selected by guessing would likely have longer reaction times, compared to trials which they were more confident with their answers (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">results</xref>). The pupillometry and MS data were then computed separately for the correct and incorrect trials and compared using a nonparametric bootstrapping test (1000 iterations with replacement; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Efron and Tibshirani, 1994</xref>). At each timepoint differences between the two experiments were deemed significant if the proportion of bootstrap iterations that fell above or below zero was &gt;95% (p&lt;.05). A permutation analysis was performed to correct for multiple comparisons. For each comparison, all datasets from both conditions (main vs. control experiment) were pooled and randomly reassigned into two new groups, each containing an equal number of trials drawn from both original conditions. These permuted groups were then compared on a sample-by-sample (timepoint-by-timepoint) basis using the same statistical test as in the original analysis. For each timepoint, a binary outcome was recorded: 1 if the test yielded a significant difference (p &lt; .05), and 0 otherwise. This permutation procedure was repeated 100 times. The proportion of permutations yielding significant results at each timepoint was used to estimate the False Discovery Rate (FDR). Timepoints in the actual data were considered to show reliable effects if the observed p-value was below .05 and the corresponding FDR estimate was below the threshold of .05.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S17"><title>Control experiment</title><p id="P33"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the performance in the control experiment (mean accuracy = 0.997, SD=0.005).

A similar MSI and rapid rebound pattern was also shown following the Distractor but was overall smaller. After remaining around baseline level, the MS rates then started rapidly dropping prior to the onset of the Probe, reached its largest trough during presentation of the Probe, and gradually restored to baseline towards the end of the trial time course. Taken together, MS rates demonstrated a robust rapid MSI followed by rebound pattern reflecting immediate attentional draw and release in response to irrelevant sound stimulus onset, while MSI response to relevant and attentionally demanding stimulus was more enhanced and prolonged.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Main experiment</title><p id="P37"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> displays the results of the behavioral pilot experiment where trials with and without a distractor were compared.

A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test showed that the distributions of RTs within correct and incorrect trials were different (D = 0.047, p =.026), consistent with a slight leftward shift (towards faster RT) for correct trials.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Pupil size dynamics track the processing of tone sequences</title><p id="P40">Pupil responses in the main experiment are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, shown against the data from the control experiment. Overall, PD in the main experiment exhibited larger deflections than those in the control experiment, specifically following the Target and preceding and following the Probe. This pattern aligns with the notion that heightened arousal was necessary at those time points – to process and encode the Target, and thereafter to prepare for the processing of the Probe. The latter being particularly demanding because it requires comparing the Probe to the memory trace of the Target, making a decision, etc. Interestingly, the PD data do not show any differences between the Control and Main experiment during or immediately following the Distractor sequence.</p><p id="P41">PDR, as a measure of instantaneous arousal, revealed differences following each of the sequences with slower decrease in PDR following the Target, Distractor and Probe in the main experiment relative to the control experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). This is consistent with participants maintaining instantaneous arousal longer following the three sequences in the main experiment. Notably this effect was most pronounced following the distractor sequence, suggesting increased instantaneous arousal during this period in the main experiment relative to the control.</p><p id="P42"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4(C,D)</xref> plot PD and PDR data separately during correct vs. incorrect trials (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">methods</xref>).

This is consistent with the behavioral RT data (slightly faster in correct trials, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). For PDR, whilst noisy, the data indicate somewhat increased PDR across the whole trial duration during correct relative to incorrect trials, suggesting that (ultimately) correct responses are associated with increased instantaneous arousal.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Demands on attention are associated with prolonged microsaccadic inhibition (MSI)</title><p id="P43"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> present MS dynamics in the Main experiment, against the data from the control experiment. The two conditions are characterized by a similar initial MSI response to Target onset. However, whilst the Control condition exhibits a subsequent rebound, in the Main experiment MS rate remains low for the sequence duration (500ms). Thereafter it returns to baseline, but remains lower than that in the control experiment, consistent with increased attentional load in the main task. A pattern similar to that observed during the Target is also then seen during the Probe sequence – a similar initial MSI is followed by sustained MS rate reduction in the main experiment, consistent with the enhanced attentional demands during that interval. Overall MS rates in the main experiment are lower than in the control.</p><p id="P44"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> compares MS rates from correct and incorrect trials in the main experiment along with the MS rates (across all trials) in the control experiment.

The plotted MS amplitudes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref> were extracted from 300 - 500ms of sound onset across trials. This time period was selected as a sample for this analysis as it corresponds to an interval where MSI dynamics in the main experiment differ substantially from those in the control. However following a KS test, no significant differences were found in the distributions of MS amplitudes between main and control experiment within this epoch (p = 0.13). This suggests that the experimental context of the main experiment did not elicit a distinct pattern of MS amplitude relative to the control condition.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Blinks dynamics reflect attentional engagement</title><p id="P46">Blinks during the experiment were identified as events and extracted to produce a measure of blink rates throughout the trial time course. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>, in both the control, and main experiment blink rates increased shortly after the presentation of each sequence, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Fukuda, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Oh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bonneh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kobald et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Brych &amp; Händel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Murali &amp; Händel, 2021</xref>). These increases were earlier, and larger, in the control experiment in alignment with previous observations that blink incidence and timing are affected by the participants’ engagement with the task - blink rates only increased in the main experiment after the full duration of each sound sequence, especially for the Probe, where blinks were almost entirely suppressed until 500ms, after the end of the sequence presentation.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Sequence-locked responses reveal distinct PDR/MS/Blink response patterns to the Distractor</title><p id="P47"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> focuses on sequence-locked responses, baseline corrected over 100ms prior to each sequence onset. As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref> top, increased PDR are seen in the main experiment following each of the 3 trial sequences. The most pronounced effect in terms of amplitude and extent is observed during the Distractor sequence. For the Target and Probe sequences, differences were primarily found during the post-sequence periods. As shown in the corresponding Difference plot, the differences during the distractor were largest, specifically during the presentation of the sequence (between 200-400ms). To assess potential latency differences between conditions, we performed a bootstrap-based analysis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Methods</xref>), iterated 100 times, to estimate the distribution of divergence latencies across condition pairs (Main vs. Control) during the Target, Distractor, and Probe intervals. For each iteration, we calculated the latency at which the two conditions began to diverge significantly. The resulting distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) revealed that the earliest divergence occurred during the Distractor interval—approximately 200ms before significant differences were observed during the Target and Probe periods.</p><p id="P48"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>, middle, focuses on MS data. During the Target interval, the control experiment exhibited an MSI response with a trough at 200ms, followed by an immediate rebound, MS rate in the main experiment remained suppressed for the duration of the sequence (500ms), returning to baseline thereafter. A similar pattern was observed following the Probe, with a more extended suppression of MS consistent with the increased demands on attention during that period (encoding the Probe and retrieving memory of the Target). Notably, no differences between the control and Main experiment were observed during the Distractor sequence.</p><p id="P49"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>, bottom, focuses on blink rate data. In general, blinks were more suppressed in the main compared to the control experiment in all three time windows, especially during the stimulus presentation phases (0-500ms) where blink rates in the main experiment were close to baseline. Greatest differences in terms of both magnitude and latency were observed following the Probe sequence, where blinks in the main experiment were largely inhibited throughout the whole sequence epoch, consistent with highest time-locked demands on arousal.</p><p id="P50"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> illustrates sequence-locked PDR, MS, and blink rate comparisons between correct and incorrect trials in the main experiment. The data from the Control experiment (all trials) are also plotted for comparison. For PDR, differences between correct and incorrect trials were predominantly present during the Probe period, where (ultimately) correct trials were associated with increased instantaneous arousal. As for MS rates, significant differences between correct and incorrect trials were only observed during the Target sequence interval, where (ultimately) correct trials showed more enhanced MSI following sound onset. Blink dynamics did not differ between correct and incorrect trials across any of the analyzed intervals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P51">Ocular dynamics are increasingly recognized as valuable physiological proxies for task engagement, including in the auditory domain. Pupil diameter (PD) has consistently been linked to arousal and cognitive load (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Beatty, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Wang &amp; Munoz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">McGarrigle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">van der Wel &amp; van Steenbergen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Zekveld et al., 2018</xref>), while emerging evidence suggests that changes in eye movement dynamics, including saccades and blinks, reflect the instantaneous availability of attentional resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kobald et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Contadini-Wright et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cui &amp; Herrmann, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Herrmann &amp; Ryan, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Herrmann et al., 2025</xref>). These findings align with the shared-resource framework, whereby the brain dynamically reallocates limited attentional and sensory resources across modalities in a push-pull fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Lavie, 2005</xref>): when task demands increase in the auditory domain, the visual system may be downregulated to reduce interference, including by suppressing saccadic eye movements and minimizing blinks, which introduce transient visual input that imposes additional processing demands. However, the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie such cross-modal suppression remain obscure. Clarifying these processes is essential if ocular metrics are to be reliably used to assess auditory attention or to inform interventions.</p><p id="P52">We developed an auditory task designed to engage mechanisms of attentional allocation and distractor suppression. Our objective was to investigate how ocular indices reflect these cognitive demands during task performance. We focused on four physiological measures: pupil diameter (PD), pupil dilation rate (PDR) - as a temporally sensitive index of phasic arousal - blinks, and microsaccades (MS).</p><p id="P53">Our results show that PD, blinks, and MS display distinct patterns during distractor suppression.</p><sec id="S24"><title>Top-down attention is associated with increased pupil dilation rate and prolonged suppression of microsaccades and blinks</title><p id="P54">Using data from a control experiment as a baseline, we demonstrate that attended sequences - specifically, the <italic>Target</italic> and <italic>Probe</italic> intervals - are associated with prolonged active processing. This is reflected in an enhanced and sustained phasic PD response, prolonged blink suppression, and an extended duration of MSI that persists throughout the entire sequence (500 ms). These observations are consistent with prior work in both visual and auditory domains. In the auditory domain, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Widmann et al.

Furthermore, although noisy, comparisons of correct vs. incorrect trials suggest that successful performance is linked to increased PDR and reduced MS rates.</p><p id="P56">However, a critical question remains: Is MS (and blink) suppression specific to attention, or do eye movements generally decrease in response to any situation that demands allocation of processing resources?

The Dp is situated within broader theoretical frameworks suggesting that top-down attentional control operates through distinct facilitation and inhibition mechanisms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bidet-Caulet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gaspelin &amp; Luck, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">2019</xref>). While salient stimuli naturally capture attention, such capture can be prevented by proactively engaging suppression before attention is allocated. Converging evidence for these suppression mechanisms has emerged across multiple domains, including psychophysics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gaspelin et al., 2015</xref>), eye-tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Adams et al., 2023</xref>), and brain imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bidet-Caulet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Feldmann-Wüstefeld &amp; Vogel, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gaspelin &amp; Luck, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gaspelin et al., 2023</xref>), although this research has primarily focused on the visual modality.</p><p id="P59">A central question in the current study was whether ocular dynamics would show distinctive signatures of active distractor suppression. Specifically, given prior findings implicating MS rate reduction during periods of heightened attentional load, we asked whether MSI during the distractor period would be reduced, consistent with attention being successfully withheld, or potentially enhanced (i.e. resulting in a larger MS rate reduction), reflecting the possibility that MS-related circuits are not exclusively tied to attention per se, but also sensitive to resource availability due to the activation of top-down suppression mechanisms.</p><p id="P60">Using data from the control experiment, which required minimal attentional engagement, as a benchmark, we observed that blink suppression during the Distractor was prolonged, mirroring the pattern observed for the Target. Moreover, PDR was significantly increased during the Distractor period. This increase, quantified as the difference between the control and main experimental conditions, was in fact larger and earlier for the Distractor than for either the Target or the Probe. This pattern is consistent with a process of increased active arousal allocation, and suggests that the brain may engage in heightened suppressive mechanisms during the Distractor in order to protect task-relevant processing.</p><p id="P61">In contrast, MS dynamics during the Distractor period did not differ from those observed in the control condition; both exhibited a characteristic early MS inhibition (MSI) in response to sequence onset, followed by a rebound in MS rate. This pattern is consistent with attention being withdrawn from the Distractor and supports the view that MS dynamics are selectively modulated by attentional allocation, rather than by general arousal or non-specific cognitive effort.</p><p id="P62">Taken together, these findings suggests that the ocular metrics explored reflect different aspects of cognitive control, in line with the signal suppression proposal (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Sawaki &amp; Luck, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gaspelin &amp; Luck, 2018</xref>). The increased PDR and prolonged blink suppression observed during the Distractor phase may reflect mechanisms of active suppression, potentially serving to prevent interference with working memory encoding.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Significance statement</title></caption><p>Understanding an individual’s moment-to-moment state during demanding attention tasks is crucial for identifying perceptual challenges, explaining inter-individual variability, and diagnosing difficulties in special populations. Ocular measures, such as pupil size, blinks, and microsaccades, are gaining traction as objective, non-invasive indicators of perceptual and cognitive states. In this study, we demonstrate that, during a challenging auditory task requiring selective attention and active ignoring, different eye-related signals capture distinct aspects of listener state. Specifically, the dynamics observed during active attention differ systematically from those during active distractor suppression. These findings highlight the value of ocular metrics for assessment of cognitive performance and for disentangling the contributions of arousal and attention during complex tasks.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Stimulus structure (main and control experiment). The general trial structure (schematized in the bottom of the figure) consisted of a stimulus presentation phase, followed by a response phase (self-paced) where participants pressed one of two keyboard buttons to indicate their response, then a fixation check and an ITI of 2000ms. The stimulus period (lasting 4000ms) consisted of the successive presentation of a Target, Distractor and Probe sequence separated by silent intervals. In the Main experiment, participants determined whether the Probe was identical to the Target (50% of trials). In the Control Experiment, participants responded when the ‘Probe’ sequence consisted of a single repeating tone pip (20% of trials).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS205737-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Control experiment results.</title><p><bold>A</bold>: Behavioral performance (accuracy) in the control task.
