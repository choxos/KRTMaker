However, their functional roles remain poorly understood, largely due to limited knowledge of their genomic distribution.

This disease is classified as one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), significantly affecting impoverished populations in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. An estimated 55 million people in 36 sub-Saharan African countries are at risk, with approximately 1,000 cases reported annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The disease often progresses to late-stage infections that affect the central nervous system causing neurological damage and is fatal without timely treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Current treatments for African trypanosomiasis present significant challenges, including toxicity, complex administration, and the need for hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The emergence of drug-resistant strains poses further risks, especially in rural areas where access to healthcare is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Fexinidazole, introduced in 2019 as an oral treatment marked a significant advancement in simplifying treatment protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P4">However, its efficacy in advanced-stage disease, as well as in children below a certain age and weight, pregnant women, and breastfeeding mothers remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p><p id="P5">The impact of African trypanosomiasis extends beyond human health, affecting agriculture and economic stability across the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Animal trypanosomiasis, known as Nagana, has severe consequences for the livestock industry, particularly cattle, where weight loss, reduced productivity, and high mortality, leads to economic losses in agriculture exceeding $1 billion annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. These growing concerns highlight the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Identifying new molecular targets is therefore essential to addressing these challenges and advancing the development of safer, more effective treatments against drug-resistant strains.</p><p id="P6">G-quadruplexes (G4s) are DNA secondary structures formed in guanine-rich sequences through self-assembly mediated by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. These structures consist of stacked guanine tetrads, which are stabilised by the presence of central monovalent cations such as K<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. G4 formation is typically observed in genomic sequences containing at least three guanine tetrads separated by loops of up to seven nucleotides (GGG-N<sub>1-7</sub>-GGG-N<sub>1-7</sub>-GGG-N<sub>1-7</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. However, recent experimental evidence has revealed that sequences deviating from this general consensus motif can also form stable G4s under physiological conditions, which are often referred as non-canonical G4s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. G4s are non-randomly distributed across the genomes of all eukaryotic organisms. In humans, predictive algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] and next-generation sequencing techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] have revealed enrichment of G4s in regulatory regions, such as telomeres and promoters of proto-oncogenes (i.e., <italic>c-MYC</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] and <italic>c-KIT</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]). These findings underscore the potential relevance of G4s in key cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, replication, and genome stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. The development of genome-wide mapping strategies to underpin the distribution of G4s in chromatin have further revealed how the formation of these structures has a direct impact in promoting transcription, especially when formed at promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. More recently, we identified that clusters of G4s formed at intergenic and intronic regions can act as super enhancers (super-G4s), further highlighting a potential role of G4s as epigenetic marker for transcriptional control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Based on these observations, significant efforts have been made in the development of G4-targeting drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], with two candidates – CX-5461 and QN-302 – progressing through clinical trials for the treatment of tumour malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], underscoring the translational impact of G4-targeting therapeutic approaches. This has promoted the investigation of G4-targeting beyond cancer treatment and across various organisms, including pathogens (e.g., viruses, bacteria, parasites) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], and others (e.g., yeasts, helminths, plants) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. For example, in protozoan parasites such as <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (the causative agent of malaria) and <italic>T. brucei</italic>, putative G4s have been identified in the surrounding regions of virulence genes and trypanosomatid-specific epigenetic modifications (i.e., <italic>base J</italic>) linked to parasite antigenic variation and survival in their hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. This has prompted the development of a series of new G4-ligands with anti-proliferative effects in <italic>T. brucei</italic> cells, highlighting the potential of G4s as therapeutic targets against <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. Despite these promising findings, underpinning the molecular mechanism that justify the effectiveness of G4-ligands to treat <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> infections remains challenging due to the absence of a reliable genomic map of G4 distribution in this parasite. This limits our ability to fully harness the therapeutic potential of these DNA structures for treating sleeping sickness and other trypanosomatid infections.</p><p id="P7">In this study, we present the first genome-wide mapping of G-quadruplex (G4) structures in <italic>T. brucei</italic> chromatin and explore their functional relevance. Through G4-targeting chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (G4 ChIP-Seq) and transcriptomic profiling, we reveal that G4s are widely distributed across the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome, with a notable enrichment in coding sequences (CDSs)—a localisation that diverges from the promoter-centric distribution seen in mammals. Functional assays using the G4-stabilising ligand PhenDC3 showed selective upregulation of G4-containing genes, particularly within CDSs, suggesting a distinct mechanism of G4-mediated gene regulation in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. These findings underscore the potential of targeting G4 structures to perturb essential gene networks in trypanosomes and inform novel strategies for therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>In silico</italic> bioinformatic analyses</title><p id="P8"><italic>Genome sequences</italic>.

The G4Hunter algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>] was used to identify putative G-quadruplex sequences (PQSs) across multiple genomes. A custom Python script was developed to automate the predictive analysis in iterative loops. The analysis utilized two key input parameters: window size and threshold. The window size defines the length of DNA fragments analysed, while the threshold determines the propensity of a sequence to form a G4 structure. Unless otherwise specified, the default G4Hunter settings of 25-nucleotide window size and a threshold of 1.2 were used, as these parameters have been previously validated to achieve a balance between minimizing false positives and false negatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. To further refine the analysis, additional evaluations were conducted at higher thresholds of 1.5, 1.8, and 2.0. The frequency of PQSs per 1000 base pairs for each species was determined by diving the number of PQSs identified using G4Hunter by the corresponding genome length, and multiplying the result by 1000.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cell cultures</title><p id="P10"><italic>Trypanosoma brucei.

This comprehensive approach allows for a broader investigation of G4 distribution within the trypanosomatid family and can be leveraged to highlight changes in their prevalence across different species. For comparative analyses, we also included two <italic>Schistosoma</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>] genomes and the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>] genome, as representatives of other parasitic and mammalian organisms. The length of trypanosomatid genomes selected for the analyses varied from approximately 17 Mb (<italic>Phytomonas francai</italic>, smallest) to 89 Mb (<italic>T. cruzi</italic>, biggest), as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. In contrast, the genome of schistosomes and humans is approximately 4–35 times larger (400 Mb, and 3.1 Gb, respectively). As displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, we observed high variability in PQS prevalence across genera, with <italic>Herpetomonas</italic> and <italic>Leishmania</italic> species exhibiting the highest G4-frequencies and <italic>Schistosoma</italic> showing comparatively the lowest G4-prevalence. Specifically, the highest frequency of G4s (as number of PQSs per kbp) was found in <italic>Herpetomonas tarakana</italic>, which exhibited a 27-fold higher abundance of G4s (frequency of 5.63) compared to <italic>Schistosoma japonicum</italic> (frequency of 0.22) and a six-fold higher abundance than in humans (frequency of 0.93, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The PQS abundance observed in trypanosomatids compared to schistosomes and humans could, in part, be explained by their higher GC content (average GC% = 52.9%) relative to <italic>Schistosoma</italic> (average GC% = 32.9%) and humans (GC% = 37.8), and therefore a higher propensity to form G4 structures. Visualising the GC content against the frequency of PQSs revealed distinct patterns across genera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), showing a near linear relationship between GC richness of a given genome and its G4 prevalence (R squared value of 0.709).</p><p id="P27">Interestingly, <italic>Leishmania</italic> species exhibited little variation in G4 prevalence across all evaluated species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting potential evolutionary conservation of G4s within this genus that may reflect their relevance to the biology of the parasite. In contrast, <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> species showed greater variability in G4 frequencies (inset zoom in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting potential differences in the biological and therapeutic significance of G4s across these species. The variation in G4 density observed within the <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> genus suggests that G4 prevalence does not always correlate with the GC richness of these parasites, supporting the notion of a potential need of these structures for the biology of certain species. For example, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and <italic>T. rangeli</italic> have comparable GC content (51.55% and 51.52%, respectively), whilst displaying a 1.3-fold difference in G4 prevalence (<italic>i.e</italic>., 1.96 and 2.60 PQS frequency per kbp, respectively). The variability in G4 distribution detected suggests that the GC content alone cannot be used to reliably predict the abundance of G4s in each species, which might be determined by other factors. For example, while both species can infect humans, <italic>T. rangeli</italic> is non-pathogenic to mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>], suggesting that variations in G4 abundance may be linked to differences in their biological functions, potentially regulating pathogenic potential or disease-causing mechanisms.</p><p id="P28">To assess the propensity of DNA sequences to form G4 structures, we performed additional analyses by adjusting the threshold values in G4Hunter, which quantifies the likelihood of a DNA sequence to form a G4 structure based on its guanine content and arrangement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Higher G4Hunter threshold values correspond to sequences with a stronger likelihood of forming stable G4 structures; conversely, a lower threshold value predicts G4 structures that are, in general, less stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>].

To achieve this, we adapted an established G4-targeting Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation sequencing (G4 ChIP-Seq) protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>] to enable the first detection of G4s within the chromatin of bloodstream forms of <italic>T. brucei</italic> parasites. Briefly, chromatin was extracted from <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> cells following an established protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>] and crosslinked with formaldehyde to preserve its native architecture. The concentration of recombinant G4-selective antibody, BG4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>], was optimised empirically to enhance the enrichment of G4-containing chromatin fragments while minimising non-specific binding. Key refinements to the G4 ChIP-Seq protocol established for human chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>] included: adjustments to chromatin-to-antibody ratios (~ 5:1), chromatin pre-treatment with Triton X-100 (2% for 10 min), and optimisation of sonication cycles (i.e., 20 cycles at 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off) to achieve optimal chromatin fragmentation of 100–500 bp. Fine-tuning of these parameters was essential to successfully perform G4 ChIP-Seq on nanograms of trypanosome chromatin, which is imposed by the low <italic>T. brucei</italic> culture yields. Next, we assessed G4 ChIP quality by measuring the relative enrichment of predicted G4-positive <italic>versus</italic> G4-negative regions, which were identified through a pilot ChIP-Seq study (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Materials and Methods</xref>). These regions were located within the bloodstream expression site 1 (BES1), a telomeric locus in <italic>T. brucei</italic> that controls the expression of the active variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) gene, a key factor in immune evasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>]. Using our adapted G4 ChIP protocol for <italic>T. brucei</italic>, we observed approximately 6-fold enrichment of G4 containing regions relative to non-G4 controls, consistent with the ≥5-fold enrichment benchmark established for successful G4 immunoprecipitation in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>].

Our G4 ChIP-Seq analysis identified an average of 9,519 peaks in <italic>T. brucei</italic> chromatin across three technical replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), a number substantially lower than the ~30,000 PQSs predicted by computational analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. High reproducibility was observed, with 7,564 G4 peaks (79%) consistently shared across all three replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, 36% of the experimentally identified G4-peaks overlapped with PQSs predicted <italic>in silico</italic> by G4Hunter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). We then compared the genomic distribution of G4s revealed by our ChIP-Seq data to patterns previously reported previously in studies using <italic>in silico</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches. G4-seq performed by Marsico <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] on naked single-stranded DNA fragments of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome revealed a similar G4 distribution pattern between the human and the parasite genomes. In a subsequent <italic>in silico</italic> study, Puig Lombardi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>] intersected the G4 sequences identified by G4-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] with those predicted by G4Hunter, and annotated their genomic distribution. This study found a high prevalence of G4s in promoters (43%) and exons (32%) of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome, compared to the high enrichment in regulatory regions, such as promoters and introns, observed in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. Although previous studies provided valuable insights into the distribution of G4s in <italic>T. brucei</italic> and humans, direct comparison of genomic locations is challenging due to the unique genomic organisation of the parasites. The parasite’s genes are organised in long polycistronic transcription units (PTUs), containing dozens of functionally unrelated genes. Unlike many eukaryotes, <italic>T. brucei</italic> lacks classical promoters for individual genes; instead, transcription initiates at defined transcription start sites (TSS) located upstream of these PTUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>]. Furthermore, genome annotation uses coding DNA sequences (CDSs) rather than exons, as <italic>T. brucei</italic> does not possess the typical exon-intron gene structures common in other eukaryotes. This distinct genomic architecture requires a more rigorous and tailored approach to accurately locate G4s within the parasite’s genome based on the ChIP-Seq data. To enhance annotation accuracy, we employed a combined approach whereby ChIP-Seq peaks were initially annotated using the <italic>T. brucei</italic> Lister 427 genome 2018 assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>] (version 10, extracted from TriTrypDB) as reference, which includes protein coding regions, pseudogenes, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs).</p><p id="P32">Subsequently, transcription start sites (TSS) and transcription termination sites (TTS) from the most recent genome assembly (v12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>] were mapped onto the v10 assembly using <italic>Liftoff</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>]. Lastly, peaks that did not overlap any of the previously annotated gene features were classified as intergenic regions. Our analysis revealed a markedly different pattern of G4 distribution in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome compared to previous studies, suggesting that G4 formation in the living parasite might be driven by biological processes regulated by these structures. Notably, our data indicate that G4s are predominant within CDSs, accounting for 88% of detected peaks. This represents a substantially higher proportion than the 32% and the 2.1% reported by Puig Lombardi <italic>et al</italic>. in <italic>T. brucei</italic> and humans, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. We also observed a considerably lower number of G4s located at TSS and TTS, with only 4% of peaks localising to these regions each. This again contrasts with previous studies by Puig Lombardi <italic>et al</italic>., which reported 42% of potential G4-sequences at TSS and 17% at TTS in <italic>T. brucei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>].</p><p id="P33">To further investigate the enrichment pattern of G4 structures in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome, we quantified ChIP-Seq peak enrichment across annotated genomic features using a randomisation approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Specifically, we used <italic>bedtools shuffle</italic> to generate three independent sets of randomised peaks across the genome, aiming to preserve the number and length of original peaks but randomising their locations. By comparing the number of ChIP-Seq G4-peaks to random occurrence, we calculated fold-enrichment values for each genomic feature. Our analysis revealed the highest enrichment within coding regions, with approximately a 2-fold increase (1.90 ± 0.03), highlighting a potential functional role for G4 structures in regulating or interacting with protein-coding sequences in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome. The next most enriched features were TSS and TTS, exhibiting mean fold enrichments of 1.15 ± 0.03 and 1.13 ± 0.04, respectively. In contrast, intergenic regions, pseudogenes, and RNA genes showed little to no enrichment (fold enrichments of 0.05 ± 0.001, 0.15 ± 0.003, and 0.22 ± 0.08, respectively), suggesting these regions are less associated with detectable G4 formation.</p><p id="P34">These results suggest that biologically functional G4s in <italic>T. brucei</italic> might be primarily located within CDSs, as well as in TSS and TTS, with lower prevalence in intergenic regions and other genomic categories.

To achieve this, the relationship between G4 distribution and chromosome size in <italic>T. brucei</italic> was initially investigated using the set of 7,564 shared G4 peaks identified from ChIP-Seq data across three replicates. A radial plot revealed that the megabase chromosome core regions are densely packed with G4 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P36">Additionally, chromosome size was found to be proportional to the number of peaks found, with a high R-squared value of 0.859 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1, A</xref>). Considering that core regions of the megabase chromosomes are known to contain a higher number of gene clusters in comparison to subtelomeric regions, these findings suggest G4s may be relevant in <italic>T. brucei</italic> gene regulation. To rule out the possibility that the high frequency of G4s in the chromosome cores was due to differences in chromosome size or GC content, we normalised the number of G4 peaks for these two parameters. Specifically, the chromosome size (as number of bases) and GC content (as a percentage) were extracted from the FASTA file of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> reference genome using the ‘<italic>awk’</italic> command. Briefly, to normalise the data to the chromosome size (Snorm), we assigned the largest chromosome (i.e., chromosome 11) a size of 100 and normalised the other chromosome sizes relative to it (Snorm = [Size of chromosome / Size of largest chromosome] × 100). Then, the number of G4-peaks was divided by the normalised Snorm. The resulting values represent the number of peaks per normalised size unit, reflecting how densely distributed the G4-peaks are on the chromosome relative to its size. A similar normalization was applied for GC content, where an arbitrary value of 100 was assigned to the chromosome with the highest GC content (chromosome 10 core, with GC = 48.02%). The number of G4 peaks was then normalised to this GC content. This analysis revealed that G4s are more enriched in chromosome cores compared to subtelomeric and other chromosomal regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p><p id="P37">To infer functional roles of G4s in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, we analysed the most common gene functions associated with the 7,564 shared G4 peaks identified from ChIP-Seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The largest proportion of these G4 peaks (44%) mapped to hypothetical proteins, indicating that a substantial portion of the G4-enriched regions in <italic>T. brucei</italic> are associated with genes of unknown function. In addition, we observed G4 peaks associated with protein tyrosine kinase domain (2%) and DEAD/DEAH box helicase-containing (1%) proteins, suggesting potential roles for trypanosomal G4s in gene expression regulation and RNA metabolism. Other enriched categories include trypanosomal VSG domain-containing (1%) and WD domain G-beta repeat (0.9%) proteins, which may reflect the involvement of G4s in antigenic variation, a key process in trypanosome immune evasion. This observation is of particular interest, as it could rationalise the reported high potency of G4 ligands in treating trypanosomiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>].

Thus, we hypothesised that CX-5461 might act both as a G4 binder and as a RNA Pol I inhibitor, while PhenDC3 would provide a more G4-driven mechanistic view on the antiparasitic potential linked to G4 targeting ligands.</p><p id="P41">We confirmed that <italic>T. brucei</italic> is sensitive to G4s ligands. CX-5461 exhibited the most potent antiparasitic activity with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.15 + 0.01 μM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). However, it also exhibited significant cytotoxicity in human HeLa cells (CC<sub>50</sub> &lt;0.20 μM), resulting in a low selectivity index (S.I.) of below 1.3, which indicates poor selectivity for <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). The low selectivity shown by CX-5461 may be due to its dual mechanism of action, whereby it also inhibits RNA Pol I, leading to potential off-target effects and reduced selectivity in human cells. In contrast, PhenDC3, showed potent killing activity against the parasites with a favourable selectivity profile, yielding an improved S.I. of 150 (<italic>T. brucei</italic> EC<sub>50</sub>: 0.36 + 0.06 μM; HeLa CC<sub>50</sub>: 53 + 3 μM). This result indicated that the targeting of G4 structures may translate into selective <italic>T. brucei</italic> killing, making PhenDC3 a promising molecular scaffold for potential drug development.</p><p id="P42">Next, we aimed to determine whether the high selectivity displayed by PhenDC3 could be ascribed to changes in expression of genes containing G4s, as detected by ChIP-Seq. To investigate this, we performed RNA-seq and evaluated the transcriptional responses elicited by these ligands on the <italic>T. brucei</italic> transcriptome. Total RNA was extracted from <italic>T. brucei</italic> cells treated with either CX-5461 or PhenDC3 and compared to an untreated control. To disentangle between the transcriptional response mediated by CX-5461 as a G4-binder from RNA Pol I inhibition, a specific RNA Pol I inhibitor, BMH-21, was also included in our analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>PhenDC3 induces a distinct transcriptome profile compared to CX-5461 and BMH-21</title><p id="P43">RNA-seq was performed on <italic>T. brucei</italic> bloodstream form parasites after 4 hours treatment with PhenDC3, CX-5461 and BMH-21 at concentrations of 2 × EC<sub>50</sub>. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) analysis of RNA-seq replicates revealed clear clustering of samples according to treatment condition (control, CX-5461, PhenDC3, and BMH-21), indicating high reproducibility and data quality, as well as distinct transcriptome profile to each compound (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), as shown by samples forming well-separated clusters corresponding to their respective groups. Interestingly, a clear separation for the PhenDC3-treated samples from both the control and the other two treatments was observed, which indicates a difference in gene expression profile. This observation was confirmed by differential gene expression (DGE) analysis which revealed a distinct gene expression pattern for PhenDC3 compared to CX-5461 and BMH-2, as shown by the volcano plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). DGE analysis was performed using a stringent false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.05 and a log<sub>2</sub> Fold Change (FC) of ± 1 (equivalent to a 2-fold change). The FC threshold allowed the identification of a broad set of potentially relevant genes for downstream analysis, while the FDR cut-off of 0.05 provides rigorous control for multiple testing, minimising the likelihood of false positives. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B and C</xref> summarise the findings from the DGE analysis, which included all gene types (i.e., protein coding genes, pseudogenes, and ncRNAs). Overall, irrespective of the treatment, approximately 98% (~16,900 genes) of the total genes were not found to be differentially expressed compared to the untreated control. Among the differentially expressed genes, CX-5461 appeared to impact the highest number of genes (357), followed by PhenDC3 (294) and BMH-21 (289). Notably, PhenDC3 induced a nearly equal number of upregulated (139) and downregulated (155) genes, while CX-5461 and BMH-21 had a higher prevalence of downregulated genes, an effect that may be due to their inhibitory activity on the RNA Pol I function. Given the G4-targeting potential of PhenDC3, we investigated whether the involvement of G4-structures could explain the different expression profiles observed for this compound. To assess this, we intersected RNA-seq data with G4 ChIP-Seq data. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, PhenDC3 resulted in a higher overall number of G4-containing genes being differentially expressed (43 genes total, of which 33 upregulated and 10 downregulated), compared to BMH-21 (16 total) or CX-5461 (15 total). Furthermore, PhenDC3 induced the strongest gene upregulation overall, including among G4-containing genes (33 genes), suggesting a potential role for G4-associated regulation of gene expression. CX-5461 and BMH-21 triggered broader gene downregulation, with a low proportion of G4-containing genes among downregulated genes, suggesting lower selectivity in targeting of G4s. Furthermore, none of the fifteen genes impacted by all three compounds harboured G4s. We also investigated the genes differentially expressed in response to both PhenDC3 and CX-5461, given their shared potential for G4 targeting.</p><p id="P44">Among the 35 genes affected by both compounds, only one gene (<italic>Tb427_110072300</italic>) that contained a G4 motif and was upregulated in both treatments. This overlap, despite being limited to one gene, might reflect that CX-5461 can also act as a G4-ligand for certain targets. However, its global gene expression profile resembles more closely BMH-21, likely due to their shared mechanism of RNA Pol I inhibition. Given the distinct gene upregulation of G4-containing genes observed with PhenDC3, we examined the functional annotation of the 33 upregulated genes harbouring G4 motifs. While a large proportion of <italic>T. brucei</italic> genes are annotated as hypothetical proteins due to the lack of identifiable homologs in sequence databases, the methyltransferase domain annotation was unique to six G4-containing genes upregulated by PhenDC3. This domain was not found in any downregulated genes, nor in those up- or downregulated by CX-5461 or BMH-21. This points to a potential role of G4 structures in the regulation of methylation-related genes, something that has been previously reported in other eukaryotic organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>] and may suggest a regulatory mechanism involving epigenetic modulation mediated by G4s and perturbed upon PhenDC3 treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>G4-feature analysis revealed upregulation of G4-containing coding sequences to PhenDC3</title><p id="P45">Our DGE analysis highlighted a distinct gene expression pattern induced by the G4-ligand PhenDC3, compared to the RNA Pol I inhibitors CX5461 and BMH-21. Furthermore, a higher association between transcriptional dysregulation of genes harbouring G4s was observed for PhenDC3, suggesting a more specific G4-targeting mechanism.</p><p id="P46">To further evaluate the impact of each treatment on G4-associated genes, we specifically examined differences in gene expression induced by the three compounds on genes identified as carrying G4 motifs based on G4 ChIP-Seq data. Genes containing G4s were therefore analysed according to their genomic location, grouping them into: CDSs, CDSs overlapping either a TSS or TTS, pseudogenes, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, this analysis revealed that the highest differences in gene expression of G4-associated genes between compounds were observed particularly in CDSs and TSS regions, while a lower significance was observed in TTS, pseudogenes, and ncRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). This finding is in agreement with our ChIP-Seq data showing an enrichment of G4s particularly in CDSs and TTS amongst the other categories, which may reflect that PhenDC3 has a strongest effect where G4s are more prevalent.</p><p id="P47">To further investigate this hypothesis, we assessed the influence on global gene expression induced by each compound by stratifying genes that do and do not contain G4s. Specifically, we annotated the RNA-Seq genes using the same genomic features defined for G4 ChIP-Seq analysis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Material and Methods</xref>), categorising them into: CDSs, CDSs overlapping either a TSS or TTS, pseudogenes, and ncRNA. We then grouped the genes into three main categories: genes that do not contain G4s (<italic>without G4s</italic>), genes that contain or have proximal G4s (<italic>with proximal G4s</italic>, e.g., G4s in a near TSS/TTS), and genes that carry a G4 (<italic>with G4s</italic>).</p><p id="P48"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> shows fold changes in gene expression for genes associated in regions with and without G4s upon exposure to each treatment. Interestingly, we observed that PhenDC3 and CX-5461 exhibit a significant difference in expression between gene with and without G4s particularly in coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, BMH-21, does not show a significant difference in expression between genes with and without G4s in coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, while CX-5461 and BMH-21 induced an overall downregulation of genes (both without and with G4s), PhenDC3 induced an opposite effect, downregulating genes without G4s and upregulating genes carrying G4s. Notably, this effect induced by PhenDC3 was particularly significant in CDS regions, where G4s were found to be mostly enriched, while it was found to be less significant in other genomic locations, such as TSS, TTS, pseudogenes, and ncRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). This evidence further supports our hypothesis that G4s are enriched at CDSs in <italic>T. Brucei</italic> and that treatment with G4-ligands, such as PhenDC3, may act through a G4-mediated mechanism that alters preferentially genes carrying G4s. We also observed a consistent trend in the expression changes produced by PhenDC3 in the three categories, with the highest G4-enrichment as determined by G4 ChIP-Seq data (i.e., CDS, TSS, and TTS regions) corresponding to a significant upregulation of genes carrying G4s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>), while producing an overall downregulation in genomic locations where G4s are less prevalent (pseudogenes and ncRNAs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). In contrast, CX-5461 and BMH-21 showed a more variable effect on gene expression across the different genomic locations examined, which cannot be ascribed to G4-targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P49">Our study presents the first comprehensive analysis of G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures in trypanosomatid parasites, providing insights into G4’s potential as molecular targets to treat infections caused by these parasites.</p><p id="P50">Through whole-genome <italic>in silico</italic> analyses, we identified putative G4-quadruplex sequences (PQSs) across the genomes of 64 trypanosomatid species, revealing intriguing patterns of G4 richness that may reflect different biological functions mediated by G4s in different trypanosomatid species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). For instance, the 23 <italic>Leishmania</italic> species analysed exhibited a consistently high PQS frequency (with an average of 3.74), and a narrow frequency range of 2.52 – 4.57, suggesting that G4s might have conserved functional roles.</p><p id="P51">Conversely, the 23 <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> species examined showed a broader range of PQS frequencies ranging between 0.85 – 4.34 PQS/Kb. We observed a near-linear relationship between GC content and PQS frequency across genera, supporting the well-established notion that G4s are more likely to form in GC-rich regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. However, we identified a notable exception to this trend, which suggested that GC content alone does not fully explain the prevalence of predicted G4 structures. <italic>Porcisia</italic> species retained the largest proportion of PQSs at increasing G4Hunter thresholds, despite having a lower GC content compared to other related species, such as <italic>Leishmania</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). This suggests that other factors affect G4 prevalence in these organisms that go beyond GC richness. For example, <italic>Leishmania</italic> is a medically significant genus that infects both humans and animals, relying on a broad repertoire of cell surface proteins to facilitate the intracellular propagation of amastigotes within vertebrate macrophages—a critical adaptation for their survival and virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>Porcisia</italic> species, which infect porcupines, have a substantially reduced repertoire of such proteins and do not rely on macrophage infection for their lifecycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>]. The retention of PQSs in <italic>Porcisia</italic> despite lower GC content might reflect alternative mechanisms regulated by G4s that are tailored around the distinct ecological niche of these species.</p><p id="P52">To gain further insights on the potential physiological relevance of G4s in these organisms, we next applied G4 ChIP-Seq to map G4s in <italic>T. brucei</italic> chromatin, generating the first chromatin-based map of G4s in this parasite. G4 ChIP identified 7,564 G4-peaks consistent across 3 distinct replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), confirming the particularly dense distribution of G4 structures in <italic>T. brucei</italic> already predicted computationally. This is particularly relevant when considering the relatively small size of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome (26 Mb) compared to other species, such as humans (3.1 Gb). This further highlighted the potential for functional relevance of G4s in <italic>T. brucei</italic> and agrees with the established potential of G4 ligands in acting as antiparasitic agents. The genome-wide distribution of G4s detected by ChIP-Seq differs markedly from what has been observed in human, whereby G4s are predominantly observed in introns, intergenic, and promoter regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. In contrast to previous findings, our data reveal a striking enrichment of <italic>T. brucei</italic> G4s within coding sequences, with comparatively lower abundance at TSS, TTS and other regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). This distribution diverges from that reported by Marsico <italic>et al</italic>. using G4-seq, which showed a pattern more closely resembling the G4 landscape in human genomes when measured on naked single-stranded DNA (G4-Seq). These differences likely reflect the distinct experimental approaches employed. G4-seq is based on sequencing extracted genomic DNA under conditions that promote G4 formation (e.g., potassium ions and/or G4-stabilising ligands) and identifies G4s by detecting mismatches between sequencing reads generated under these conditions. Our ChIP-based approach, in contrast, captures G4s within native chromatin extracted directly from <italic>T. brucei</italic> parasites. As such, it may better reflect the physiological and dynamic nature of G4 formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, despite these methodological differences, the total number of G4s identified in our study (7,564 peaks) is broadly comparable to the range reported by Marsico <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. However, the genomic distribution of G4s in our ChIP-Seq data differs markedly from that observed in the G4-seq data., which may also result from differences in annotation strategies. While Marsico <italic>et al</italic>. applied a cross-species framework, our analysis was tailored to the unique genomic architecture of <italic>T. brucei</italic>, including its organisation into polycistronic transcription units.</p><p id="P53">Altogether, these observations underscore the influence of experimental context— particularly the chromatin state and genome annotation—on G4 detection. G4-seq, which uses naked single-stranded DNA, does not account for chromatin structure or other dynamic factors that may regulate G4 folding and stability in a cellular context. By contrast, ChIP-seq approaches preferentially capture G4s that are stably folded under physiological conditions, providing a potentially more biologically relevant snapshot of G4 dynamics in living cells.</p><p id="P54">The high density of G4s in coding sequences of chromosome cores of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome suggests that these structures might be involved in the regulation of key biological functions of the parasite, including transcriptional regulation of genes. Therefore, we investigated the effects of established G4-ligands on the transcriptional activity of the parasite. The sensitivity of <italic>T. brucei</italic> to G4-ligands highlights the therapeutic potential of these compounds in treating trypanosome infections, as also evidenced by the recent reports of various G4-ligands with anti-trypanosomal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). PhenDC3, exhibited potent antiparasitic activity with a favourable selectivity profile, making it a strong candidate for further development of antiparasitic drugs. In contrast, the dual G4-ligand and RNA Pol I inhibitor CX-5461 showed high anti-trypanosomal efficacy but low selectivity, which is in agreement with its use in humans as an anticancer agent. The distinct transcriptome profiles following PhenDC3, CX-5461, and BMH-21 exposure revealed by RNA-seq further supports their different modes of action. The ability of PhenDC3 to induce changes in the expression of G4-containing genes suggests a relevant role of G4s in regulating gene expression levels in <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), which is in agreement with what has been extensively reported in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>]. The significant enrichment of DGEs in coding sequences containing G4s, particularly upon PhenDC3 and CX-5461 treatment, further supports the hypothesis that G4s have a role as modulators of gene expression in trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Targeting G4 structures offers a promising strategy for perturbing gene expression homeostasis in pathogens like <italic>T. brucei</italic>, which can be potentially leveraged to overcome the increasing incidence of resistance against current therapeutic agents. We anticipate that this approach could also have broader applications in combating infectious diseases beyond parasites and might be explored in broader microbiology contexts.</p><p id="P55">The distinct upregulation of G4-containing genes observed following PhenDC3 treatment might be explained by the different genomic distribution of G4s in <italic>T. brucei</italic> compared to mammals. Additionally, this could also reflect different mechanisms of G4-protein recognition leveraged in <italic>T. brucei</italic> that might be enhanced in the presence of the ligand, leading to gene expression stimulation. This would be in line with our recent finding demonstrating that G4 ligands can act as molecular glues and increase G4-protein interactions at certain G4-sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>]. From a more functional perspective, the upregulation of methyltransferase domain-containing proteins, which is unique to PhenDC3 and absent for CX-5461 or BMH-21, warrants further investigation and highlights potential for epigenetic relevance in parasite biology. Methyltransferase-associated G4 peaks constitute a modest fraction of total G4 ChIP-Seq peaks (13 identified) and exhibit high peak scores, suggesting stable G4 formation at these <italic>loci</italic>. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis identified 10 methyltransferase genes harbouring G4 motifs that were specifically upregulated by PhenDC3 but remained largely unaffected by the other compounds. This confirms a link between G4 stabilization and epigenetic regulation mediated by methyltransferase activity, which has been previously described in other organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref>].</p><p id="P56">Overall, this study provided the first chromatin-based genome-wide map of G4s in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, highlighting species-specific distribution, transcriptional relevance, and therapeutic potential of G4s in trypanosomes. The distinct G4 enrichment pattern observed in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, compared to computation predictions and other mapping methods, reinforces the importance of experimental validation using physiologically relevant approaches when evaluating G4 prevalence—an observation previously made in human cells. Future studies should now focus on exploring the mechanistic roles of unknown proteins that have shown potential for gene expression modulation by means of G4-targeting, as this might lead to the rational design of a new generation of therapeutic agents. Additionally, further optimisation of current G4-ligands with improved selectivity profiles holds promise for the development of new targeted therapies against trypanosome infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS207492-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d86aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge Prof. Gloria Rudenko and her research group at Imperial College London for invaluable guidance through the initial phases of the study.</p><sec id="S19"><title>Funding</title><p>M.D.A. is supported by a Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) David Phillips Fellowship (BB/R011605/1) and is a Lister Institute Research Prize holder (2022).
