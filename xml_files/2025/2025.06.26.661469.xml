In <italic>Papaver rhoeas</italic>, SI is triggered by allele-specific interaction between the pollen and pistil <italic>S</italic>-determinants, activating a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signalling network that leads to rapid reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and eventual programmed cell death (PCD) in incompatible pollen tubes. Expression of the <italic>Papaver</italic> pollen <italic>S</italic>-determinant (PrpS) in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> recapitulates <italic>Papaver</italic> SI when challenged with the cognate pistil ligand (PrsS). Using roGFP2-Orp1, a genetically encoded hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) sensor, combined with measurements of mitochondrial metabolism we have revealed a complex SI response. Within minutes, elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>) and cytosolic acidification converge to trigger mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production (with consequent cytosolic and plastid H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increase), membrane depolarisation, decreased respiration rate, and ATP depletion. In parallel, oxidative inactivation of cytosolic GAPDH inhibits glycolytic flux, resulting in decreased TCA cycle intermediates and providing a feedback loop to enhance mitochondrial disruption. Preceding production of mitochondrially-sourced ROS, we show that SI rapidly arrests pollen tube growth <italic>via</italic> inactivation of plasma membrane localised NADPH oxidase (RBOH) mediated superoxide production. Our findings provide new insights into how different ROS signatures from NADPH oxidase and mitochondria drive distinct processes. We demonstrate that mitochondrial disruption is an early and central event in the SI-response, likely driven by positive feedback loops involving altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling, cytosolic pH and ROS. Our findings provide novel insights into how SI rapidly disrupts energy metabolism in pollen tubes through interconnected signalling networks centred on mitochondria prior to PCD.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Self-incompatibility (SI) is a pollen-pistil recognition system utilized by many flowering plants to prevent self-fertilization and maintain genetic diversity. This system is governed by tightly linked, polymorphic <italic>S</italic>-determinants expressed in the pollen and the pistil, which regulate mating compatibility and prevent inbreeding. In <italic>Papaver rhoeas</italic> (poppy), the <italic>S</italic>-determinants are the stigma-expressed S-protein (PrsS), which is secreted and acts as the ligand, and its pollen-specific transmembrane receptor (PrpS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Foote et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Wheeler et al., 2009</xref>). Interaction between these two proteins triggers a rapid growth arrest of incompatible pollen tubes mediated by a cytosolic free calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>)-dependent signalling network that includes increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytosolic acidification, and rapid ATP depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Wilkins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Wilkins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bosch and Franklin-Tong, 2024</xref>).

Understanding how these molecular and cellular events coordinate pollen compatibility and control cell survival or death provides key insights into plant reproductive regulation and offers broader implications for manipulating crop fertility and breeding strategies.</p><p id="P5">SI in <italic>Papaver</italic> stimulates dramatic increases in ROS levels throughout the entire pollen tube, as demonstrated by the non-specific ROS-sensitive probe chloromethyl-2’7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester (CM-H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Hempel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Wilkins et al., 2011</xref>). This distinctive pattern of ROS accumulation raises important questions - what are the sources and targets of ROS during SI? To investigate these questions, a means of measuring ROS with greater spatial and temporal resolution is required. Recent advances in fluorescent biosensors, such as the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-specific probe roGFP2-Orp1, now allow for precise and dynamic measurements of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nietzel et al., 2019</xref>). This sensor has been effectively used to study H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production during pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Arnaud et al., 2023</xref>) and mitochondrial retrograde signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Khan et al., 2024</xref>) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Notably, the <italic>Papaver</italic> SI system has been functionally transferred to <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">de Graaf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lin et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). This model system, utilizing pollen tubes expressing PrpS, combined with the genetically encoded fluorescent probe roGFP2-Orp1, offers a powerful platform to investigate SI-induced subcellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dynamics in greater depth using live-cell imaging approaches.</p><p id="P6">Pollen tube growth is an energy-intensive process, requiring high ATP levels to fuel the cellular machinery essential for tip growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Rounds et al., 2011</xref>). We recently established that SI triggers a rapid and dramatic reduction in ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Wang et al., 2022</xref>) and that SI-induced ROS triggers irreversible oxidation of multiple enzymes, including those involved in energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Haque et al., 2020</xref>). Reduced ATP synthesis implicates respiratory metabolism and mitochondria as early targets in the SI-induced PCD pathway. Supporting this, our previous studies revealed that SI triggers a rapid release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Thomas and Franklin-Tong, 2004</xref>) and leads to significant alterations in mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Geitmann et al., 2004</xref>) in <italic>Papaver</italic> pollen tubes.</p><p id="P7">Cytosolic pH ([pH]<sub>cyt</sub>) and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> also play crucial roles in pollen tube growth.

In plant cells that utilize polar growth, such as pollen tubes and root hairs, tip-localized superoxide production mediated by plasma membrane NADPH oxidases (RBOHs), is critical for sustained tip growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Foreman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Potocký et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kaya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Smirnoff and Arnaud, 2019</xref>).

Using the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-specific sensor roGFP2-Orp1, we demonstrate increases in probe oxidation in the cytosol, mitochondria and plastids. This reveals that ROS signals regulating growth and SI arise from distinct subcellular origins and exhibit unique spatial-temporal signatures. We also show that increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> and cytosolic acidification contribute to SI-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation. Moreover, SI triggers a collapse in mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to reduced respiration and decreased levels in TCA cycle and glycolysis intermediates.

Because SI causes increased ROS production in the pollen tube during SI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Wilkins et al., 2011</xref>), we measured production of tip-localised superoxide. Tip growth is dependent on ROS generated by NADPH oxidase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Potocký et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Boisson-Dernier 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lassig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kaya et al., 2015</xref>). Apoplastic superoxide production, driven by NADPH oxidases at the tip of growing pollen tubes, can be visualised by the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) to an insoluble blue formazan. NBT reduction is largely apoplastic and is abolished by knockdown of NADPH oxidase expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Potocký et al., 2007</xref>). In untreated Arabidopsis pollen tubes, tip-localised formazan staining was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating superoxide production at the tip. Following SI-induction, tip-localised superoxide production was rapidly disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>, supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Within 5 minutes, the intensity of formazan staining was significantly reduced, and this reduction plateaued by 10-15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). A similar response was observed in <italic>Papaver</italic> pollen tubes, where the basal level of apoplastic superoxide was higher, leading to a more pronounced decrease after SI induction (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Inactivation of NADPH oxidase corresponds to the rapid inhibition of tip growth during SI (<bold>Videos 1 and 2</bold>). To establish whether this disruption of NADPH oxidase activity was a consequence or cause of SI-induced growth inhibition, we treated pollen tubes with 500 μM GdCl<sub>3</sub> or 10 mM caffeine, which are known inhibitors of tip growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Pierson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Geitmann et al., 2000</xref>). Within two minutes of treatment, we observed significant decreases in NBT staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-D</xref>), confirming that inhibition of tip growth rapidly inhibits tip-localised NADPH oxidase activity. As NADPH oxidase activity is inhibited by SI, abolishing tip-localized ROS production, it is evident that superoxide produced by NADPH oxidase cannot be the source of the SI-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in incompatible pollen tubes.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Identifying the SI-induced intracellular ROS sources in pollen tubes</title><p id="P11">To investigate whether intracellular sources of ROS are involved in regulating SI, we examined ROS production in subcellular compartments during SI using transgenic Arabidopsis lines co-expressing PrpS<sub>1</sub> and roGFP2-Orp1. An Orp1 cysteine residue is oxidised by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> followed by a redox relay resulting in roGFP oxidation and a change in its fluorescence excitation spectrum, enabling ratiometric detection of its oxidation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nietzel et al., 2019</xref>). The roGFP2-Orp1 sensor, targeted to the cytosol, mitochondria, plastids, peroxisomes and nuclei, allowed compartment-specific H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> detection. Fluorescence imaging confirmed the subcellular localisation of the roGFP2-Orp1 sensor in growing pollen tubes (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). The oxidation of roGFP2-Orp1 by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, measured ratiometrically as R<sub>405/488</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nietzel et al., 2019</xref>), provides a quantitative readout of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dynamics. In untreated (UT) pollen tubes, roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation was relatively higher in mitochondria and peroxisomes, while the sensor was more reduced in the nuclei compared to the cytosol and plastids (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). The dynamic range (δ) of oxidation and reduction of roGFP2-Orp1 for each subcellular localisation was assessed by treating pollen tubes with 15 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT; Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C-G</xref>). The response of roGFP2-Orp1 to pollen tubes treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was more pronounced in the cytosol and mitochondria, while DTT treatment resulted in a greater reduction in plastids and peroxisomes compared to cytosol, mitochondria and nuclei. Despite nuclei (δ = 2.71) and peroxisomes (δ = 2.49) displaying a narrower dynamic range of roGFP2-Orp1 compared to the cytosol (δ = 3.65), mitochondria (δ = 5.09) and plastids (δ = 5.70), the probe characteristics are similar to previous reports and suitable for detecting changes in oxidation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nietzel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Ugalde et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Arnaud et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To examine the changes in oxidation state across various subcellular compartments following SI induction, we performed ratio-imaging of roGFP2-Orp1 by sampling populations of pollen tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Probe oxidation is detected as an increase in the fluorescence excitation ratio (R<sub>405/488</sub>). We observed rapid increases in cytosolic and mitochondrial roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation, demonstrating an elevation in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In the cytosol, a significant increase in roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation was detectable as early as 10 minutes after SI induction compared to untreated pollen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). At 60 minutes, increases in roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation became more pronounced, increasing further to 2.3-fold by 2 hours after the SI induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). In mitochondria, a significant increase in probe oxidation was also observed as early as 10 minutes after SI induction reaching 3.0-fold at 120 min after SI induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In plastids, significant increases in roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation state were detected from 5 minutes after SI induction onwards increasing by 2.2-fold 1 hour after the SI induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). This demonstrates that SI stimulates increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidation in the cytosol, mitochondria and plastids. SI did not stimulate roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation in all organelles; no significant alterations in R<sub>405/488</sub> were measured in peroxisomes or nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D-E</xref>). To obtain further information on early increases in roGFP2-Orp1 in the cytosol, mitochondria and plastids following the SI induction, we tracked multiple individual pollen tubes over a 20-minute period. While control pollen tubes treated with growth medium maintained a steady R<sub>405/488</sub>, the kinetics of R<sub>405/488</sub> increases in SI-induced pollen tubes varied, but all increased within 10 minutes after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F-H</xref>). In untreated growing pollen tubes, representative time-lapse images showed that in the cytosol, roGFP2-Orp1 was more reduced in the tip region than in the shank and no major changes in oxidation state were observed during growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>, <bold>Video 1</bold>). After SI induction, this tip-to-shank difference rapidly disappeared, with a relatively uniform increase in roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation observed throughout the pollen tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-F</xref>, <bold>Video 2</bold>). This oxidation occurred shortly after the inhibition of tip growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, <bold>Video 2)</bold>. SI induction also triggered a general increase in roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation in mitochondria and plastids, although no distinct spatial features were observed in these organelles in either growing or SI-induced pollen tubes (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To examine whether the SI-induced oxidation of roGFP2-Orp1 was solely due to increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production or also involved impaired reduction capacity of the sensor due to other SI-induced event, we measured roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation following treatment with 2.5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, with or without a preceding SI induction. No significant differences in roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation were observed in the cytosol or mitochondria after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, regardless of SI induction (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A-B</xref>). However, in the plastids, roGFP2-Orp1 was significantly more oxidised when H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment followed SI induction, compared to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment alone (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>). These results suggest that the increases in roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation in the cytosol and mitochondria after SI induction are due to elevated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. In contrast, the rise in roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation in plastids might be partly due to a compromised plastid reduction capacity following SI induction.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The electron transport chain contributes to SI-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> elevation in mitochondria</title><p id="P14">Mitochondrial ROS is generated as a by-product of the electron transport chain (ETC) during respiration. To investigate the contribution of the ETC to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production during SI in the pollen tube, we used antimycin A, an inhibitor of complex III, to disrupt the ETC during SI responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Wagner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Rattanawong et al., 2021</xref>).

Pharmacological and biosensor data suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction is both a source and a target of redox and pH perturbations, setting up a feedback loop that accelerates cellular shutdown.

Our results demonstrate that the ROS required for normal pollen tube tip growth, originating from NADPH oxidase activity, are functionally distinct from the mitochondrially produced ROS induced by SI.

Importantly, roGFP2-Orp1 remains functional at pH 5.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nietzel et al., 2019</xref>), so the measured oxidation state is unaffected by the cytosolic acidification induced by SI or treatment with propionic acid. Consistent with observations in leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Arnaud et al., 2023</xref>), peroxisomes exhibited the most oxidised redox state, followed by intermediate oxidation in mitochondria and plastids, and the most reduced state in the cytosol and nucleus. Initiation of SI caused oxidation of the biosensor in the cytosol, mitochondria, and plastids, but not in the nuclei and peroxisomes. Since roGFP2-Orp1 reports the redox balance between oxidation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and its reduction by the thiol system, the signal is to some extent a reflection of both processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nietzel et al., 2019</xref>).

However, the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor antimycin A, which inhibits complex III, prevented SI-induced roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation in mitochondria and cytosol. This suggests that SI-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production is dependent on mitochondrial electron transport. Although it is reported that antimycin A can increase ROS production, the effect is not always large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Maxwell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Moller, 2001</xref>) nor consistent.

Thus, our results strongly suggest that mitochondria are the primary source of SI-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, likely <italic>via</italic> residual electron transport, with ROS subsequently diffusing into the cytosol and plastids. It is also possible that the decreased cytosolic pH inhibits H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> scavenging enzymes such as ascorbate peroxidase and could contribute to SI-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation. In particular, the plastid form of ascorbate peroxidase has a steep decrease of activity below its pH 8.0 optimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Mittler and Zilinskas, 1991</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Overall, the results are consistent with SI causing a disruption in mitochondrial metabolism that results in oxygen reduction to superoxide and consequent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production.

Several lines of evidence point to disrupted metabolism, including decreased ATP, reduced GAPDH activity (affecting glycolysis in both cytosol and plastids), a decrease in some TCA cycle intermediates, and a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential. We previously identified redox-sensitive post-translational modifications in two glycolytic enzymes, GAPDH and enolase, following both SI and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment in <italic>Papaver</italic> pollen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Haque et al., 2020</xref>), implicating oxidative damage to these proteins. Here we show that some of these modifications have functional significance since we found that NAD-GAPDH activity is rapidly decreased during SI and following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. Crucially, this inactivation was reversed by DTT, indicating that reversible cysteine oxidation is involved. GADPH is well known to be under redox control, undergoing reversible oxidation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on a conserved cysteine residue (Cys155), resulting in inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Schneider et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dumont and Rivoal, 2019</xref>). As well as influencing glycolysis rate in the cytosol and plastids, the oxidised form of GADPH can translocate to the nucleus and may be involved redox signalling, while the reduced form associates with voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) on the outer mitochondrial membrane, possibly as part of a glycolytic complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dumont and Rivoal, 2019</xref>). The oxidative inactivation of glycolysis will impose a limitation on ATP generation by substrate level phosphorylation and decrease supply of pyruvate to the mitochondria. The latter will limit TCA cycle activity, as shown by the decrease in TCA cycle intermediates beyond citrate/isocitrate. Moreover, given that SI triggers a decrease in glycolysis, the possibility of ATP generation by fermentation as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Wang et al. (2022)</xref> is unlikely. This conclusion is reinforced for Arabidopsis, whose pollen has a low fermentation capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). In support of an early impact on metabolism, previous work in <italic>Papaver</italic> has shown that soluble inorganic pyrophosphatases (sPPases), which are essential for biosynthetic reactions, become phosphorylated and inactivated within minutes of SI induction (Rudd et al., 1996; de Graaf et al., 2006), further illustrating the rapid shutdown of key metabolic processes following SI. Together, our data establish a direct mechanistic link between SI-induced ROS and impaired metabolism <italic>via</italic> redox regulation of GAPDH and suggest that oxidative modifications of other glycolytic enzymes may also contribute. While some studies, such as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Obermeyer et al., 2013</xref>), have inferred changes in pollen metabolism in response to mitochondrial dysfunction using proteomic data, to date direct evidence for ROS-mediated inactivation remains scarce in plants.

Elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> is the earliest detectable change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bosch and Franklin-Tong, 2024</xref>). Pharmacological manipulation using Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers and ionophores indicate that several key events, including decrease in Δψ<sub>m</sub>, increased roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation (reflecting H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production), decreased ATP levels, and cytosolic acidification, are downstream of the initial influx and subsequent increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>. Furthermore, manipulation of [pH]<sub>cyt</sub> shows that acidification increases H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and decreases Δψ<sub>m</sub> while these SI-induced events are blocked by maintaining neutral [pH]<sub>cyt</sub>. Acidification may therefore act as a direct and early effector in the SI response. To our knowledge, this represents one of the first demonstrations in plants that cytosolic acidification can directly impair mitochondrial function. While the importance of pH homeostasis for mitochondrial activity is well recognized, direct evidence linking cytosolic acidification to mitochondrial dysfunction is a physiological context has been lacking. We propose/hypothesize that SI triggers a combined disruption of Δψ<sub>m</sub>, most likely <italic>via</italic> inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport, alongside oxidative inhibition of glycolysis and TCA cycle. Together, these effects would lead to decreased respiration and ATP production.

This early release could contribute to a decrease in electron transport rate. The resulting drop in ATP may, in turn, potentiate cytosolic acidification, at least in part <italic>via</italic> decreased plasma membrane and/or vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. However, this alone is unlikely to account for the dramatic acidification observed following SI, suggesting that addition mechanisms must be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). A recent characterisation of the pollen mitochondrial proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Boussardon et al., 2025</xref>) has revealed unique features associated with high respiration rates needed for rapid pollen tube tip growth including high abundance of TCA cycle enzymes, electron transport complexes and Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and a deficiency of transcriptional and translational machinery. These specialised features may render pollen highly susceptible to the kind of disruption observed during SI. Collectively, these findings support a model in which mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic inhibition form a self-reinforcing feedback loop, amplifying cellular disruption.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Linking early mitochondrial disruption to PCD</title><p id="P30">SI triggers PCD downstream of early signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Thomas and Franklin-Tong, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bosch and Franklin-Tong, 2024</xref>). Although the current study did not directly examine PCD, several of the rapid events triggered by SI, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS production, and ATP depletion, have previously been associated with PCD in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Xie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Van Aken and Van Breusegem, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). While the role of mitochondria in plant PCD remains rather contentious and an area of ongoing debate, it has been suggested that they can act as early integrators of PCD signalling in certain systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Curtis and Wolpert, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Mur et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Moller et al., 2021</xref>). Our previous studies on <italic>Papaver</italic> have shown that SI induces the release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> within 10 minutes, followed by dramatic morphological changes, including swelling and loss of cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Geitmann, et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Thomas and Franklin-Tong, 2004</xref>). These alterations resemble mitochondrial changes associated with apoptosis in animal cells, and similar mitochondrial morphology transitions have also been linked to PCD in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Scott and Logan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Ocampo-Hernández et al., 2022</xref>). Combined with our findings of ATP depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction, this demonstrates that mitochondria are early targets of SI-induced signalling to PCD.</p><p id="P31">Studies to date suggest that many plant PCD processes, such as those in the stigma, tapetum or hypersensitive response, involve vacuolar rupture and NADPH oxidase-derived ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Franklin-Tong and Bosch, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kacprzyk et al., 2024</xref>). However, our findings here demonstrate that mitochondrially-derived ROS contributes to metabolic dysfunction that underpins PCD in the SI system. This, together with previous data, clearly implicates very early mitochondrial alterations observed within minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Thomas and Franklin-Tong, 2004</xref>) as being involved as a causal event upstream of PCD (and not just a marker of dying cells). Consistent with this, recent work in Arabidopsis root cap cells showed that mitochondrial disruption, including the release of matrix proteins, is one of the earliest detectable events during developmental cell death, preceding the breakdown of other organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Wang et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, there are clearly distinct signals and outputs that are responsible for PCD, underlining the diversity of plant PCD systems.</p><p id="P32">Establishing how rapid changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2</sup>+, pH, and redox state influence the downstream commitment to PCD remains a key challenge for the field.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Evidence for ROS signatures</title><p id="P33">We have provided a clear demonstration that spatially and temporally distinct ROS (and Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signals can serve as intracellular signatures that allow for functionally divergent roles within the pollen tube, essentially a single cell type, resulting in distinct cellular responses and cell fates: tip growth or SI. While the concept and evidence for distinct spatial-temporal Ca<sup>2+</sup> “ signatures” are well-established, very few ROS signatures within single cell types have been identified in plants. It is known that different ROS sources can give rise to different responses.

This triggers a rapid influx of Ca<sup>2</sup>+, resulting in elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2</sup>+ concentration ([Ca<sup>2</sup>+]<sub>cyt</sub>), disruption of the tip-focused Ca<sup>2</sup>+ gradient and arrest of pollen tube tip growth. Downstream of the [Ca<sup>2</sup>+]<sub>cyt</sub> increase, a network of intracellular responses is rapidly triggered (within 10-20 min). including cytosolic acidification and decreased ATP concentration.</p><p>In this study, we show that tip-localised NADPH oxidase is inactivated, resulting in the inhibition of apical ROS production. SI triggers increased roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation in the cytosol and mitochondria. Mitochondria appear to be the primary source of SI induced increases in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated here subsequently diffuses into the cytosol, leading to the large increases in cytosolic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> observed in incompatible pollen tubes. This demonstrates that spatially and temporally distinct ROS signals can serve as intracellular signatures that allow for functionally divergent roles within the pollen tube.</p><p>Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) decreases, concomitant with decreased ATP concentration. As manipulation of [pH]<sub>cyt</sub> shows that acidification is sufficient to decrease ΔΨm and elevate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and maintaining neutral cytosolic pH prevents these effects, this suggests that cytosolic acidification acts as a direct and early effector in this SI response.</p><p>SI also results in rapidly reduced levels of antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH), demonstrating that redox homeostasis is further compromised. In addition, SI triggers oxidative inactivation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a glycolytic enzyme. This will limit glycolytic flux and reduce pyruvate availability for mitochondrial respiration, contributing to decreased tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity thereby reducing ATP production in incompatible pollen tubes further. These findings provide insights into how redox signalling can modulate energy metabolism.</p><p>Decreased ATP may itself exacerbate cytosolic acidification <italic>via</italic> inhibition of ATP-dependent H+-ATPases at the plasma membrane and/or vacuole. We propose a model whereby these early SI-induced events establish a positive feedback loop in which SI-induced Ca<sup>2</sup>+ and pH changes disrupt mitochondrial function, which in turn generates further ROS and suppresses energy metabolism, amplifying intracellular disruption.</p><p><italic>Colour and symbol key:</italic> Blue structure, mitochondrion.
