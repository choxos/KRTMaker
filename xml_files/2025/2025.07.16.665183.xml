To address this need we extended the AbSplice framework to incorporate splicing dynamics across developmental stages. Moreover, we introduced several improvements including a refined ground truth from the aberrant splicing caller FRASER2, a continuous representation of splice site usage, and integration of the rich set of predictions from the sequence-based model Pangolin. These advances double the precision and recall of the original model at predicting aberrant splicing events and enable predictions across embryonic, childhood, and adult tissues. Genome-wide scores for all single-nucleotide variants and a web interface to score indels are available to facilitate the exploration of the predictions. Our genome-wide predictions reveal a class of variants with splicing-disruptive effects confined to early development, particularly abundant in the brain (&gt;18,000 variants). Analysis of genomes of individuals with a suspected Mendelian disorder from Genomics England’s National Genomics Research Library identified 26 unique variants in disease-linked genes, with stronger predicted effects during development than in adulthood, including a candidate new diagnosis in the gene <italic>FGFR1</italic>. Altogether, these results improve the accuracy of splice-disruptive variant prediction and provide developmental context to aid interpretation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Aberrant splicing can disrupt gene function by altering RNA isoforms, leading to outcomes such as frameshifts, transcript degradation, or the loss of critical protein domains. If a variant strongly affects splicing isoform choice, the remaining abundance of functional RNA isoforms may be insufficient to maintain normal cellular function of the gene. Predicting such splicing aberrations is therefore critical for variant interpretation, particularly in the context of rare disease diagnostics and oncology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Aberrant splicing events are rare large alterations of splice isoform usage and can be detected from RNA-seq data from human tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Recently, we introduced AbSplice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, a model to predict the probability that a rare variant leads to aberrant splicing in a specific human tissue. AbSplice was trained on rare variants associated with aberrant splicing events for 49 tissues from the GTEx dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The model combines tissue-agnostic sequence-based variant effect predictions from state-of-the art deep learning models with tissue-specific SpliceMaps derived from RNA-seq data quantifying splice site usage. Notably, SpliceMaps can be generated from healthy and cancerous tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and can be obtained from a handful of RNA-seq samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, highlighting the framework’s adaptability. Aberrant splicing predictions from AbSplice are valuable not only in isolation but also as input for downstream tasks such as aberrant gene expression prediction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and rare variant association testing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The initial implementation of AbSplice used aberrant splicing events detected by FRASER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> as its ground truth for model training and evaluation. However, the more recently developed FRASER2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, based on a more robust intron-centric metric, offers a more accurate ground truth by reducing false-positive calls, enabling a more reliable assessment of model performance.</p><p id="P5">Advances in deep learning models for splicing prediction have further refined our ability to predict and interpret splicing alterations caused by variants (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>). For instance, Pangolin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> shares the same context window and model architecture as SpliceAI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> yet demonstrated superior performance due to enhancements in both the quantity and quality of its training data. Specifically, Pangolin incorporates splicing quantifications derived from RNA-seq data across four tissues (heart, liver, brain, testis) and four mammalian species (human, rhesus macaque, mouse, rat). In contrast, SpliceAI was trained on binary labels of splice sites derived from the human standard genome annotation GENCODE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> as well as novel splice junctions commonly observed in the GTEx cohort. The initial implementation of AbSplice did not include Pangolin as the two tools were developed in parallel.</p><p id="P6">During organ development, splicing events can undergo dynamic changes in inclusion levels, with brain and testis showing up to 20% of cassette exons being developmentally regulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Developmental alternative splicing events are highly conserved across evolution, underscoring their functional significance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Variants impacting splicing at developmentally regulated sites may cause developmental disorders. However, their effects on splicing may be limited to specific stages, such as embryogenesis, and not manifest in adults. Since current splicing annotations, including the SpliceMaps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> used in the AbSplice model, are derived from adult RNA-seq data, the impact of variants on developmentally regulated splicing events is potentially underestimated. Thus, integrating developmental splicing dynamics into splicing prediction models should be considered to accurately assess variant effects across the full spectrum of an organism’s life stages.</p><p id="P7">Here, we present an enhanced version of AbSplice (referred to as AbSplice2) that addresses these issues. We leverage the improved ground truth from FRASER2, integrate state-of-the-art splicing predictions from Pangolin and extend our analyses to include developmental splicing dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Together, this led to improved detection of aberrant splicing causing variants while providing developmental and tissue-specific context.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>An improved ground truth of aberrantly spliced events leads to a 2-fold improvement in recall</title><p id="P8">AbSplice was originally trained and evaluated using the aberrant splicing caller FRASER applied to the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. FRASER2, a refined version of FRASER, was shown to reduce false positives in outlier detection by about one order of magnitude at minimal loss of sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The AbSplice pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> had already incorporated a rare-variant-based post-filter to suppress likely false positive outliers from the original FRASER. Nonetheless, using FRASER2 outliers as ground truth in our benchmark led to a 2-fold improvement in recall for AbSplice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). This improvement was independent of retraining the AbSplice model with the FRASER2 outlier labels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 1</xref>). While a reduction of false outlier labels directly improved the recall of the model it had a minor effect on the learned feature contributions which were nearly identical for an AbSplice model trained on FRASER compared to FRASER2 outlier labels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Replacing SpliceAI with Pangolin leads to improved precision</title><p id="P9">AbSplice1 was based on variant effect predictions of the tissue-agnostic deep learning models MMSplice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and SpliceAI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> which were combined with tissue-specific splicing annotations (SpliceMaps)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Pangolin is a deep learning model that uses a similar model architecture as SpliceAI. While SpliceAI was purely trained on genomic annotations, Pangolin additionally used quantitative usage levels of splicing in 4 different tissues and was trained across 4 mammalian species. Pangolin’s additional training data led to a better predictive performance than SpliceAI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Both SpliceAI and Pangolin provide scores for splice site usage increase and decrease. We had originally used the absolute maximum variant effect score of SpliceAI. However, the direction of change in splicing could also be informative (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 2</xref>) as it enhances the model’s ability to learn interactions among other signed feature scores, such as the predicted variant effect of MMSplice, providing a more reliable basis for predictions when models agree on the direction of change. Indeed, replacing the maximum Delta Score of SpliceAI with the four predicted scores for acceptor gain, acceptor loss, donor gain, and donor loss improved the average precision by about 12% (<italic>P</italic> = 3.3×10<sup>-6</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 2</xref>). Furthermore, replacing SpliceAI with Pangolin and using its two predicted scores of splice site usage gain and loss led to an additional improvement in average precision by about 9% (<italic>P</italic> = 1.3×10<sup>-8</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Continuous splice site usage levels lead to improvements in precision compared to binarized splice site usage</title><p id="P10">To discriminate between genuine splicing events and splicing noise, we had previously employed a binary threshold on the median number of split reads supporting a splice site across samples capturing splice site usage. However, thresholding can be highly sensitive to small variations in the data near the threshold and lead to drastically distinct predictions and misleading interpretations. By learning a continuous sigmoid-shaped effect of splice site usage instead of a binary threshold, we achieved an improved average precision by about 41% (<italic>P</italic> = 1.8×10<sup>-15</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 3a,b</xref>). This adjustment reduced abrupt prediction shifts due to minor fluctuations in splice site usage, enhancing model reliability. The contribution scores on the plateaus were similar to what the binarized model had learned (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 3b</xref>), giving evidence for the robustness of the entire framework. Comparing model predictions from the binarized and continuous models showed that the improvement in precision was mostly due to a reranking of false positive variant predictions which were in the proximity of splice sites with intermediate usage values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 3c</xref>). While the two models gave similar predicted values to variants that disrupt highly expressed splice sites, the continuous model predicted a lower probability for variants disrupting splice sites with low or intermediate usage levels. Stratifying the benchmark to different levels of gene expression showed that the model trained on the continuous usage levels outperformed all other models (including a model trained on gene TPM values instead of splice site usage levels) in all analyzed gene expression regimes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Our final model led to a 2-fold improvement in precision compared to AbSplice1.

This reflects the clinical rare disease diagnostics use case in which RNA-seq could be collected from accessible tissues such as blood or skin fibroblasts, but not from the suspected disease tissue. AbSplice2-RNA further improved the average precision by about 21% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We provide genome-wide predictions for all possible single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in protein-coding genes for Pangolin and AbSplice2.

We applied AbSplice2 using the SpliceMap from GTEx brain frontal cortex. Aberrant splicing calls from FRASER2 were used to evaluate the predictions. While the model reached similar precision levels as in the corresponding GTEx tissue, the maximum recall of the models in BrainGVEx was reduced compared to GTEx, perhaps due to different sequencing quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2c</xref>). Nevertheless, the relative performance of all models was replicated, with AbSplice2 performing best.</p><p id="P15">In addition to aberrant splicing prediction, we evaluated our model predictions on the task of predicting aberrant gene underexpression in the GTEx dataset. Aberrant splicing often leads to the expression of isoforms containing premature termination codons which can be recognized by the nonsense-mediated decay machinery for degradation. As a result, aberrant splicing predictors are informative about aberrantly underexpressed genes. Therefore, we further evaluated the models at predicting aberrant underexpression, using a benchmark of expression outliers across GTEx that we established earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. We found that AbSplice2 led to a 2-fold improvement in average precision over AbSplice1. Consequently, replacing AbSplice1 with AbSplice2 in the input features of the aberrant gene underexpression predictor AbExp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> led to an improved average precision by about 7% (<italic>P</italic> = 9.3×10<sup>-4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Dynamically changing splice sites lead to changing predicted variant effects during development</title><p id="P16">Having established an improved AbSplice model, we next considered extending its application to developmental stages. To this end, we derived SpliceMaps for human RNA-seq data from 7 tissues (brain, cerebellum, heart, kidney, liver, ovary and testis) gathered from 15 different developmental stages spanning embryogenesis to the adult with the earliest recorded stage being 4 weeks post conception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. With 1 to 5 samples per tissue-time point pair, the sample size of the developmental dataset was strongly reduced compared to the average 331 samples per tissue in GTEx. Downsampling investigation of the GTEx dataset indicated that SpliceMaps largely agreeing with the original SpliceMaps could still be derived with as few as 4 samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 5a</xref>) and would not affect AbSplice performance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 5b</xref>). To reach a similar minimal sample size while preserving temporal resolution, we pooled data of each developmental time point and its adjacent time points. Moreover, we confirmed the agreement of the tissue-specific SpliceMaps between the adult stage of the developmental dataset and GTEx by comparing their SpliceMaps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 6c,d</xref>, Jaccard similarity typically above 0.75).</p><p id="P17">We computed AbSplice2 scores for all tissues and developmental stages for all possible SNVs within a 100-bp window of all 47,769 previously annotated developmental alternative splicing (devAS) sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. One such devAS site is visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, where exon 6 of the gene <italic>SSBP3</italic> which is known to play a role in embryonic stem cell differentiation and head development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, is included in an early developmental stage (4 weeks post conception) at a high inclusion level in the brain, but is removed from the spliced transcript at the point of birth and is subsequently missing in the adult brain. In the vicinity of the splice sites of <italic>SSBP3</italic> exon 6 we predicted a significant difference in variant effects between early and late stages of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). While there are variants with a high predicted probability to disrupt splicing in early stages, AbSplice2 predicted exclusively low variant impacts in adult stages. One example variant within this region is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>. While the deep learning models Pangolin and MMSplice provided a variant score that was independent of the developmental stage, the splicing metrics from the SpliceMaps captured how the usage of each splice junction changed during development. The drop in inclusion of <italic>SSBP3</italic> exon 6 was captured in the developmental SpliceMaps which was reflected in AbSplice2 predictions being strong in the early stages only. Moreover, the continuous representation of the median splice site usage as opposed to the binary representation used in AbSplice1 led to smoother and more robust predictions over development time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 6</xref> for an example).</p><p id="P18">We predicted for each tissue the number of variants genome-wide that led to a splice-disrupting effect in an early stage of development (from conception to toddler age) and no effect in the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 7</xref>). The brain, which is the tissue with most devAS events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> showed the highest number of such variants (N=18,206 which is 10% of all high impact variants in the brain across all developmental stages around devAS sites, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 7</xref>). This example showcases that while SpliceAI and Pangolin can capture variants affecting splicing, AbSplice2 adds the developmental and tissue context of these effects. These variants may be of clinical importance as developmentally changing splicing events were shown to be highly conserved across evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Fitting this hypothesis, these development-specific effect variants are enriched in loss-of-function (LoF) intolerant genes, with genes in the 10% most LoF-intolerant group being 6.8-fold more likely to harbor a development-specific effect variant compared to the 10% most LoF-tolerant genes (Fisher’s exact test <italic>P</italic> = 6.7×10<sup>-65</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Application to rare disease samples</title><p id="P19">To assess the clinical potential of predicting developmental aberrant splicing, we applied AbSplice2 to 64,736 rare disease participants from the UK National Genomics Research Library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> (NGRL). We focussed on variants located within 100 bp of devAS splice sites and for which AbSplice2 predicted an effect during early development (AbSplice2 score above the cutoff 0.05) that is stronger than in adult. We further restricted to variants in ‘Green’ genes confidently linked with genetic disorders from PanelApp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, identifying a total of 26 unique variants in 47 individuals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Table 1</xref>). One example is a splice acceptor variant in <italic>ARFGEF1</italic> (chr8:67203252:C&gt;T, NM_006421.5:c.4960-1G&gt;A) that had already been identified as the causal variant in an individual recruited with intellectual disability. This gene is associated with developmental delay, epilepsy, and intellectual disability. AbSplice2 predicted this variant to activate a cryptic splice site within the adjacent exon causing a frameshift with an effect that is strongest in the brain between 12 and 16 weeks post-conception (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 8a</xref>).

For <italic>NDUFS2</italic>, a mitochondrial complex 1 member associated with Leigh syndrome, the clinical relevance in the NGRL participant remains uncertain, as deleterious variants in this gene are typically associated with early-onset fatal outcomes in childhood, while this participant is an adult. It is possible that this variant may be a hypomorphic non-coding variant, and therefore result in a less severe phenotype, however we are unable to confirm this currently. All remaining variants did not represent good candidates for the individual’s disorder when mode of inheritance or phenotypic matching were considered, including 8 instances where the participants’ case had been solved, or partially solved with the causal variant being found in a different gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">Here, we have developed a model for tissue-specific aberrant splicing prediction across developmental stages. Thereby, our updated AbSplice predicts a class of variants whose effect on splicing changes over the course of development. Additionally, we improved on the previous AbSplice model by replacing SpliceAI with Pangolin, leveraging the directionality of predicted splicing changes as well as the predicted affected position, which led to improved precision. Second, we transitioned from a binary quantification of splice site usage to continuous usage levels which led to a two-fold improvement in the precision of AbSplice as well as providing more robust predictions. We demonstrated that these enhancements replicated in independent benchmarks. We provide the code and developmental SpliceMaps spanning stages from embryogenesis to adulthood. For convenience, we also provide precomputed scores for AbSplice2 and Pangolin for all possible SNVs.</p><p id="P23">In our previous publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> we used FRASER aberrant splicing calls as ground truth to train and evaluate AbSplice, as we found FRASER to be more robust and precise than other outlier callers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In this study we employed an improved ground truth based on FRASER2 and achieved a two-fold increase in recall without altering the model’s feature importance scores upon retraining. This suggests that the original model effectively captured the key signal from true positive outliers, even with a noisier ground truth. Importantly, these findings validate the reliability of the previously published AbSplice model.</p><p id="P24">The developmental predictions were based on SpliceMaps constructed from limited sample sizes and only for seven tissues. While we showed that the available sample sizes led to reasonably robust estimates, there are potential benefits of larger cohorts for more robust and comprehensive splicing quantifications. We anticipate that efforts such as the upcoming developmental data from GTEx will enable the construction of more reliable SpliceMaps and facilitate the detection of weakly spliced junctions, which are often present in only a few individuals, but can lead to drastic aberrant splicing events when activated by a variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Moreover, an update would only require computing SpliceMaps from such data owing to the modular structure of AbSplice. Our evaluations in this study and our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> showed that the AbSplice framework is very robust to changes in the SpliceMaps while keeping the model unchanged.</p><p id="P25">We applied AbSplice to rare disease participants from the UK National Genomics Research Library (NGRL) and prioritized variants predicted to have a developmental splicing effect, resulting in 26 candidate variants in known disease-associated genes. While AbSplice predicted developmental splicing disruptions, not all identified variants were in genes clearly related to the individual’s specific phenotypes. Many variants were heterozygous in genes that require a biallelic impact to cause disease. While these were not considered to be causal for the individual’s phenotypes, this does not imply that the underlying splicing predictions were incorrect. It remains possible that the predicted splicing alterations are real, but that disrupted splicing is not the primary mechanism underlying the observed phenotype — or that it contributes without being sufficient on its own. For some variants we observed evidence of weak splicing at the affected site exclusively in the developmental dataset, but not in adult GTEx tissues, demonstrating the importance of considering temporally dynamic regulatory patterns in variant interpretation. These findings underscore the added value of incorporating developmental context into variant interpretation.</p><p id="P26">AbSplice helps narrow down splicing-relevant variants to specific tissues and developmental stages for which SpliceMaps are available. Consequently, using the maximum score across all tissues is not the intended usage and leads to reduced precision in tissue-specific tasks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Fig. 9</xref>). Moreover, since not all tissues or developmental stages are covered, variants might still have effects in unobserved contexts. Therefore, we see AbSplice as a companion tool to link predicted variant effects to the observed phenotypes by analyzing the developmental and tissue-specific predictions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">One limitation of our approach is that it depends on the accuracy of the underlying deep learning model. If the model fails to predict a splicing event, even in regions where a tissue-specific splice site is annotated, our framework cannot recover the prediction, resulting in low model scores. This limitation is particularly problematic for tissue-specific splice sites, which may be underrepresented in models trained on standard genome annotations. Such models, like SpliceAI, are optimized for canonical splice sites used across multiple tissues but may inadequately capture truly tissue-specific events. While Pangolin was trained on RNA-seq data from four tissues, its training data was limited by small cohort sizes and did not leverage the full diversity of tissue types or developmental stages. This restricts its ability to accurately predict splicing events in tissues with high variability, such as the brain, or in developmental stages where splicing patterns differ significantly from those in adults. To this end, the combination of new modeling techniques, for instance building on self-supervised<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> or supervised<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> foundation models, along with expanded training datasets covering more tissues, cell types, and developmental stages could address these limitations and improve model performance.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Datasets</title><sec id="S13"><title>GTEx</title><p id="P28">We downloaded the RNA-seq read alignment files (BAM files) and the variant calling files (VCF files) from WGS from GTEx v8p (hg38) from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) (study accession: phs000424.v8.p2).
