Thus, a considerable proportion of organismal resources is directed towards supporting and nurturing germ cells. Much of this support is provided locally within the gonads by somatic gonadal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Messer et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">O'Donnell et al., 2022</xref>). In males, somatic gonadal cells establish a permeability barrier that isolates developing germ cells from blood circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Dym and Fawcett, 1970</xref>), suggesting that male germ cells depend on nutrients provided locally by the soma. Yet, whether and how somatic gonadal cells provide sustenance to the germline <italic>in vivo</italic> is unresolved.</p><p id="P3">We use the Drosophila testis as a tractable model to understand how somatic gonadal cells support germline metabolism. Similar to the mammalian testis, germ cells in the fly testis are enclosed by somatic cells called cyst cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hardy et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Messer et al., 2025</xref>). Germline stem cells (GSCs) produce daughters that are enclosed by two somatic cyst cells and subsequently undergo four incomplete and synchronised divisions to form 16 interconnected spermatogonial cells which then mature into meiotic spermatocytes. Around the 4 cell stage, cyst cells establish septate junctions with each other to form a permeability barrier which prevents the developing germ cell syncytium from accessing the external environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Fairchild et al., 2015</xref>). This conservation of male germ cell isolation highlights the importance of tightly controlling the extracellular environment perceived by developing spermatocytes and implies that cyst cells must provide nutrients to sustain germ cell development; yet it remains unknown how they support the germline.</p><p id="P4">Here we demonstrate metabolite exchange between somatic gonadal cells and germ cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. We show that lactate, a product of glycolysis in cyst cells, is shuttled to the germline to support its survival. Furthermore, we show that cyst cells compartmentalise their metabolism, ensuring that carbohydrates, through glycolysis, are dedicated to germline support, and that disrupting this allocation of resources in cyst cells impacts germ cell survival. Our work thus highlights the importance of somatic gonadal cells in ensuring that sufficient resources reach the germline, and demonstrates that metabolic compartmentalisation within cyst cells is crucial to their support function within the gonads.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Glycolysis is upregulated in differentiated somatic cells</title><p id="P5">Cyst cells are produced by cyst stem cells (CySCs), differentiating when two cyst cells enclose a germ cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gonczy and DiNardo, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hardy et al., 1979</xref>). We previously showed that differentiating cyst cells upregulate genes encoding many metabolic enzymes compared to CySCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Sainz de la Maza et al., 2022</xref>). We noted that many genes encoding glycolytic enzymes (see diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) were represented within the Gene Ontology (GO) terms most significantly enriched in differentiating cyst cells. In particular, Hexokina<italic>se-A (Hex-A), Phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi), Phosphofructokinase (Pfk), Triose phosphate isomerase (Tpi), Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (Gapdh1), Enolase (Eno)</italic> and <italic>Pyruvate kinase (Pyk)</italic> were upregulated more than 2-fold in cyst cells relative to CySCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Sainz de la Maza et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, we hypothesised that glycolysis is upregulated during cyst cell differentiation. We validated these findings by examining expression reporters for key enzymes. In Drosophila, the main circulating sugar is trehalose, which is imported into cells by the Trehalose transporter 1 (Tret1, also known as Tret1-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kanamori et al., 2010</xref>). A transgene expressing nuclear GFP under the control of the <italic>Tret1</italic> enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hertenstein et al., 2021</xref>) showed GFP expression in the testis, specifically in hub cells and in Eya-positive differentiating cyst cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), but was absent from Zfh1-positive CySCs and Vasa-positive germ cells. Similarly, a protein trap GFP fusion with Aldolase 1 (Aldo), the enzyme that splits the 6-carbon fructose 1,6 bisphosphate into two 3-carbon sugars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), was expressed highly in the cytoplasm of Eya-positive differentiated cyst cells and more weakly in Zfh1-positive CySCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Finally, we examined the expression of a tagged form of Pyruvate kinase (Pyk), which catalyses the final step in glycolysis, forming pyruvate and ATP. Pyk-HA was expressed in GSCs and early germ cells, but expression decreased in later stages of germ cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). By contrast, in the somatic lineage, HA staining was low in CySCs adjacent to the hub and increased in intensity as cyst cells differentiated. Analysis of the recent Fly Cell Atlas testis dataset of single-cell gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Raz et al., 2023</xref>) revealed a similar pattern. We compared gene expression of the clusters corresponding to spermatogonia and the cyst cells associated with spermatogonial stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A-C</xref>). GO analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that amino acid metabolism and carbon metabolism were enriched in cyst cells, but examination of the genes within these categories revealed overlapping genes including genes of the glycolysis pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>). Plotting expression of glycolytic genes showed that these were most highly expressed in differentiating somatic cells, increasing as cyst cells differentiated, while in germ cells, expression decreased during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Together, these data show that glycolytic gene expression increases in cyst cells as they differentiate, and suggest that cyst cells have higher glycolytic activity than germ cells.</p><p id="P6">To test whether glycolytic pathway activity was indeed higher in somatic cells, we used liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to compare levels of glucose and lactate between cyst and germ cells, which we sorted by FACS using <italic>traffic jam (tj)-Gal4</italic> to drive GFP expression in somatic cyst cells. Analysis of the mass spectrometry data by principal component analysis revealed that germ cells and cyst cells segregated reproducibly, suggesting different metabolic profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E</xref>) and indeed, we identified thousands of annotated peaks as differentially enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1F</xref>). Importantly, somatic cells had significantly higher levels of both glucose and lactate than germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Altogether, these data show that cyst cells have higher levels of glycolytic gene expression than germ cells, as well as higher amounts of glucose and of the glycolytic product lactate. Notably, the increase in gene expression occurs around the time or soon after the two cyst cells encapsulating a developing germ cell cyst form tight junctions, isolating the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Fairchild et al., 2015</xref>). Based on these observations, we hypothesised that cyst cells may upregulate glycolysis to provide the developing germline with glycolytic byproducts and sustain germ cell development.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Glycolytic enzymes in cyst cells non-autonomously maintain germ cell survival</title><p id="P7">To test this hypothesis, we sought to knock down glycolytic enzymes in somatic cyst cells and assess the effect of the knockdown on the germline. We expressed RNAi constructs that we previously validated for effectiveness (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S1</xref>) in the cyst lineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2A</xref>), using <italic>tj-Gal4</italic> together with <italic>hh-Gal80</italic> to prevent Gal4 activity in hub cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Herrera et al., 2021</xref>). Knockdown of enzymes involved in trehalose import or processing, or in glycolysis resulted in dying germ cells, as evident by the presence of rounded germ cell cysts, positive for the acidophilic dye Lysotracker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Yacobi-Sharon et al., 2013</xref>). Quantification of dying germ cell cysts per testis revealed a significant increase in most glycolytic knockdowns (<italic>Tret1, Trehalase (Treh), Pfk, Gapdh1, Eno, Pyk</italic>) compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>) and a trend towards increased numbers in others (<italic>Pgi</italic> and <italic>Phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (Pgam1)</italic>). Only <italic>Phosphoglycerate kinase</italic> (<italic>Pgk</italic>) knockdown appeared unchanged compared to control and this RNAi was an outlier in subsequent experiments, suggesting that this line may not effectively target <italic>pgk</italic>. Importantly, these knockdowns did not result in any noticeable changes in cell type composition in the testis: CySCs, identified as Zfh1-positive, Eya-negative cells were still present, as were Eya-positive cyst cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). Germ cell morphology, as assessed by Vasa staining, also appeared grossly normal with all stages present from germline stem cells (GSCs) adjacent to the hub to spermatogonial and spermatocyte cysts.</p><p id="P8">We showed that disrupting trehalose or glucose metabolism did not impact the self-renewal of CySCs or survival of cyst cells: we observed no significant changes in the number of CySCs (Zfh1-positive, Eya-negative cells) or of cyst cells staining positive for an antibody against the activated form of the effector caspase Death Caspase-1 (Dcp-1) upon knockdown of this pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2B,C</xref>). To validate these results independently, we generated CySCs and cyst cells homozygous mutant for an allele of Aldo, for which we did not have a functional RNAi. Lysotracker-positive germ cells were found adjacent to <italic>Aldo</italic> mutant cyst cells with a higher frequency compared to control clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D,E</xref>, arrowheads; 36% compared to 14% in controls, P &lt; 0.0001, Fisher’s exact test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>), indicating that <italic>Aldo</italic> loss in cyst cells non-autonomously reduces germline survival. <italic>Aldo</italic> mutant clones appeared indistinguishable from control clones, with several CySCs labelled, suggesting that the labelled cells were capable of proliferating and of producing other CySCs, despite a small but not significant reduction in <italic>Aldo</italic> mutant clone recovery compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2D</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that disrupting trehalose uptake or catabolism into pyruvate through glycolysis does not discernibly impact self-renewal, differentiation or survival of the cyst lineage, but non-autonomously results in germ cell death.</p><p id="P9">Next, we asked whether glycolytic enzymes were required autonomously in germ cells for their survival. We used nanos-Gal4 to drive expression in GSCs and early spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3A</xref>) and <italic>bam-Gal4</italic> to drive expression in late spermatogonia and spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3B</xref>). Knocking down glycolytic enzymes with either driver did not result in any increase in the number of Lysotracker-positive dying cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G,H</xref>). We confirmed that germline knockdown was effective by observing decreased expression of the Pyk-HA fusion protein with an anti-HA antibody upon knockdown of <italic>pyk</italic> with <italic>nanos-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3C,D</xref>). In sum, although knockdown of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes in the soma results in germ cell death, these genes appear to be dispensable in the germline itself, suggesting that germ cells depend on glycolysis in cyst cells to provide them with a critical metabolite, or metabolites, that they need to survive.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cyst cell-derived lactate is required for germ cell survival</title><p id="P10">Our results indicate that enzymes across the whole glycolytic pathway are required for germ cell survival, suggesting that the metabolite(s) produced in cyst cells that support the germline are likely pyruvate or a product of pyruvate metabolism. Cells can either transform pyruvate into lactate through the action of Lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh), or import pyruvate into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We first tested whether lactate production was required for germ cell survival by knocking down <italic>ldh</italic> in cyst cells. We used a genetically-encoded single fluorophore reporter for lactate, CanlonicSF, to measure lactate levels in cyst cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aburto et al., 2022</xref>). As expected, <italic>ldh</italic> knockdown resulted in significantly lower fluorescence of CanlonicSF compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-D</xref>). We measured germ cell death and found that somatic <italic>ldh</italic> knockdown resulted in a significant increase in the number of Lysotracker-positive dying germ cell cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Increased germ cell death upon <italic>ldh</italic> knockdown was a non-autonomous effect and not due to disruptions to cyst cell development as neither CySC numbers nor proliferation were affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4A,B</xref>). Next, we asked whether somatic <italic>ldh</italic> knockdown could induce germ cell death indirectly, since cyst cell death can induce germ cell death in starved animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Yang and Yamashita, 2015</xref>). We did not observe an increase in Dcp-1 positive cells upon <italic>ldh</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4C</xref>), suggesting that <italic>ldh</italic> is not necessary for cyst cell survival. To further validate that cyst cell death did not precede germ cell death, we inhibited apoptosis autonomously in cyst cells by over-expressing Death-associated inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (Diap1). Importantly, Diap1 expression did not prevent the increase in Lysotracker-positive cysts caused by <italic>ldh</italic> knockdown in cyst cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4D</xref>), indicating that germ cells do not die as a consequence of apoptosis in cyst cells.</p><p id="P11">Altogether, these results indicate that lactate production is necessary in cyst cells to non-autonomously prevent germ cell death, suggesting that lactate supports germ cell survival. However, knockdown of <italic>ldh</italic> may affect flux through glycolysis, such that other glycolytic metabolites would also be reduced by this manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hosios and Vander Heiden, 2018</xref>); therefore we sought to determine if <italic>ldh</italic> knockdown reduced glycolytic products. We examined pyruvate levels using PyronicSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arce-Molina et al., 2020</xref>). As a control, we knocked down <italic>pyk</italic>, the product of which catalyses pyruvate production, and observed a decrease in fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F,G</xref>). By contrast, knockdown of <italic>ldh</italic> resulted in increased fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F,H,I</xref>), suggesting that pyruvate accumulates in cyst cells. Since <italic>pyk</italic> and <italic>ldh</italic> knockdown both result in decreased lactate production and increased germ cell death but have opposite effects on pyruvate accumulation, it is likely that lactate, and not another glycolytic intermediate, is the key metabolite that supports germ cell survival.</p><p id="P12">Next, we expressed CanlonicSF under the control of a ubiquitous promoter to ask whether knocking down <italic>ldh</italic> in cyst cells non-autonomously affected lactate levels in the germline. Somatic knockdown of <italic>ldh</italic> resulted in decreased fluorescence, both autonomously in cyst cells, as above, and non-autonomously in germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J-M</xref>). This observation supports the idea that lactate is transferred from cyst cells to germ cells. If this is true, we hypothesised that to be utilized in germ cells, somatic-derived lactate would be transformed back into pyruvate by Ldh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), which can catalyse both reactions. Indeed, knockdown of <italic>ldh</italic> in germ cells using <italic>bam-Gal4</italic> resulted in increased CanlonicSF fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3N-P</xref>). Moreover, unlike in the case of glycolytic enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>), <italic>ldh</italic> knockdown in germ cells resulted in increased numbers of Lysotracker-positive cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3Q</xref>), indicating that Ldh-dependent conversion of lactate into pyruvate sustains germ cell survival. Altogether, our results show that glycolysis in cyst cells fuels the production of lactate, which is transferred to germ cells which consume lactate but do not produce it.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>An uncharacterised monocarboxylate transporter mediates lactate transport</title><p id="P13">Since our results indicated that lactate was transferred from cyst cells to the germline, we asked whether monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), which mediate transport of metabolites across cell membranes, were required for this transport. We focused on the Solute Carrier 16 (SLC16) family of MCTs, which has 16 members <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://flybase.org/reports/FBgg0000669">https://flybase.org/reports/FBgg0000669</ext-link>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Halestrap, 2013</xref>). Using the Fly Cell Atlas, we determined that 3 genes encoding MCTs were highly expressed in cyst cells: <italic>CG8034, CG13907</italic> and <italic>hermes</italic> (<italic>hrm</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S5A</xref>). We knocked down each of these in cyst cells and found that CG8034 knockdown resulted in increased numbers of Lysotracker-positive germ cell cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). To test whether the product of <italic>CG8034</italic> could indeed transport lactate, we examined fluorescence of the CanlonicSF reporter, and found that knockdown of <italic>CG8034</italic> resulted in accumulation of lactate in cyst cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B-D</xref>). Next, we used the ubiquitously-expressed CanlonicSF to ask whether knockdown of <italic>CG8034</italic> in cyst cells affected lactate levels in the germline and found that CanlonicSF fluorescence was significantly decreased in germ cells and concomitantly significantly increased in cyst cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E-H</xref>), consistent with reduced transport of lactate from cyst cells to the germline. Due to its role in delivering lactate to germ cells, we renamed <italic>CG8034,</italic> <italic>milkman (mlm)</italic>.</p><p id="P14">Similarly, to determine which MCTs were mediating lactate import into germ cells, we examined SLC16 family member expression in germ cell transcriptional clusters corresponding to spermatogonia and early spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S5B</xref>). <italic>hermes (hrm)</italic> was the most highly expressed MCT, but was previously shown to transport pyruvate and not lactate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Velentzas et al., 2018</xref>). Instead, we noted that <italic>mlm</italic> was also expressed in germ cells, so we tested whether knocking down <italic>mlm</italic> in germ cells affected their survival. Indeed, expressing <italic>mlm</italic> RNAi with <italic>bam-Gal4</italic> resulted in a significant increase in lysotracker-positive germ cell cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I</xref>). Consistently, <italic>mlm</italic> knockdown in germ cells led to an autonomous decrease in CanlonicSF fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4J-L</xref>), suggesting that Mlm mediates lactate import into germ cells.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Somatic cells compartmentalise their energetic metabolism to ensure lactate production</title><p id="P15">Since glycolysis in cyst cells is critical for germline survival, we asked how cyst cell metabolism was set up to satisfy both the needs of germ cells and of cyst cells themselves. In particular, we wondered whether the pyruvate produced by glycolysis was a limiting resource or whether it was used both for lactate production for germ cells and for autonomous energy production in cyst cell mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We reasoned that if glycolysis fuelled cyst cell mitochondrial metabolism, knockdown of glycolytic enzymes should result in reduced mitochondrial activity. We used the mitochondrial membrane potential-sensitive dye tetramethyl rhodamine, methyl ester (TMRM) as a readout of mitochondrial activity. Knockdown of either <italic>Pfk</italic> or <italic>Pyk</italic> had no effect on TMRM fluorescence intensity in cyst cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig. S6A,B</xref>). This suggested that glycolysis-derived pyruvate does not measurably contribute to cyst cell mitochondrial metabolism. To test whether mitochondrial consumption of pyruvate in cyst cells would result in reduced lactate production and germ cell support, we increased mitochondrial import of pyruvate in cyst cells by over-expressing the Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, Mpc1. This manipulation resulted in a significant increase in dying germ cell cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>), indicating that pyruvate levels in cyst cells are limiting and that autonomous mitochondrial usage comes at the expense of germ cell support.</p><p id="P16">We then asked what normally ensures that pyruvate usage is steered towards lactate production. One possibility is that Mpc1 itself regulates flux; however, knockdown of <italic>Mpc1</italic> in cyst cells had no effect on germ cell death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S6C</xref>). Therefore, we focused on regulation of the mitochondrial Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (Pdh), a 3-enzyme (E1-3) complex which decarboxylates pyruvate to produce acetyl-coA. Pdh can be phosphorylated by Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (Pdk), which inhibits its activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Using an antibody against phosphorylated Pdh, we observed staining in cyst cells in control testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>), indicating that Pdk is active in cyst cells. Indeed, knockdown of <italic>Pdk</italic> using <italic>tj-Gal4</italic> resulted in loss of somatic phospho-Pdh staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), suggesting that Pdk normally acts to restrain Pdh activity, and therefore pyruvate consumption, in cyst cells. Consistently, knocking down <italic>Pdk</italic> resulted in significantly increased numbers of Lysotracker-positive dying germ cell cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Thus, similar to the over-expression of Mpc1, manipulations that increase autonomous pyruvate consumption in cyst cells result in decreased germ cell survival. Finally, we tested the effect of knocking down the gene encoding the α subunit of PdhE1, <italic>Pdha1</italic>, in cyst cells, hypothesizing that preventing mitochondrial consumption would increase the flux of pyruvate towards lactate production. Strikingly, <italic>Pdha1</italic> knockdown in cyst cells resulted in significantly fewer Lysotracker-positive germ cell cysts compared to control testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>), indicating that preventing autonomous pyruvate usage in cyst cells is beneficial for germ cell survival. Together, these results show that cyst cell metabolism does not rely on pyruvate, and that phosphorylation of Pdh by Pdk is a key regulatory step that ensures that most pyruvate produced by glycolysis in cyst cells is steered towards the production of lactate to support the germline.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Male germ cells develop inside a specialised microenvironment as a result of a permeability barrier formed by gonadal somatic cells. How germ cell metabolism is sustained without access to circulating nutrients was unknown.

In germ cells, lactate consumption through conversion into pyruvate is essential for viability, demonstrating that one of the key functions of cyst cells is to support germline metabolism by providing trophic metabolites. Finally, our results show that manipulating cyst cell metabolism to increase or decrease autonomous pyruvate consumption in mitochondria results in converse changes in germ cell survival, emphasising the importance of ensuring proper resource allocation in cyst cells: glycolysis and its product lactate are dedicated to the support of germ cells. While direct <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence is lacking, several pieces of evidence suggest that lactate shuttling between somatic and germline cells is conserved. In mammals, Sertoli cells establish the blood-testis barrier, enclosing spermatocytes in the lumen of the testis tubules, away from the blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Dym and Fawcett, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Stanton, 2016</xref>). Although the testis as a whole depends on glucose metabolism, experiments using cultured cells suggest that germ cells themselves do not metabolise glucose, while Sertoli cells do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boussouar and Benahmed, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jutte et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Jutte et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mita and Hall, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Robinson and Fritz, 1981</xref>). Thus it seems likely that <italic>in vivo</italic>, Sertoli cells break down carbohydrates to produce lactate, which is secreted and used in germ cells for energy metabolism, similar to the compartmentalization of carbohydrate metabolism between neurons and glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Brooks, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Gladden, 2004</xref>).</p><sec id="S9"><title>Metabolic compartmentalization in somatic cells of the testis</title><p id="P19">Our findings highlight that cyst cells compartmentalize their metabolism. Despite a strong upregulation of glycolytic enzymes, glycolysis is not autonomously required in cyst cells and does not appreciably contribute to cyst cell fate or to their mitochondrial activity. This compartmentalisation appears to be conserved with mammals, as <italic>in vitro</italic> work indicates that although cultured Sertoli cells take up and metabolise glucose, only a small fraction of this glucose is consumed through oxidation in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Grootegoed et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Robinson and Fritz, 1981</xref>). Pdk plays a key role in cyst cell compartmentalisation but in cultured Sertoli cells treatment with a Pdk inhibitor prevents increases in lactate production upon stimulation with Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), but does not reduce basal lactate production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Regueira et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, lactate secretion by Sertoli cells may be both intrinsically and extrinsically regulated in mammals. Indeed, in Sertoli cells, the pituitary-derived follicle stimulating hormone and FGF, secreted by the germline, regulate expression of glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters, as well as expression and activity of Ldh, linking upregulation of lactate production to puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Galardo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mita et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Regueira et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Riera et al., 2002</xref>). In Drosophila cyst cells, it remains unknown what regulates Pdk expression and/or activity.</p><p id="P20">Notably, in previous work, we showed that cyst cell differentiation involves changes in mitochondrial morphology and activity, suggestive of increased metabolic requirements with differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Sainz de la Maza et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, multiple metabolic pathways change coordinately during cyst cell development, to allow for both autonomous needs in differentiation, and for non-autonomous support of the germline. Our results indicate clearly that glycolysis does not contribute to autonomous functions, and suggest that other, as yet unknown, metabolic pathways are upregulated to promote cyst cell differentiation autonomously. Thus, cyst cell metabolism is compartmentalised such that distinct metabolic pathways contribute to distinct functions in cyst cells, ensuring that sufficient resources are allocated both to autonomous needs and to non-autonomous support of the germline.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Lactate in the germline</title><p id="P21">Our data indicate that in the Drosophila testis, spermatogonia become dependent on lactate for survival. Indeed, preventing conversion of lactate into pyruvate in germ cells results in increased germ cell death, implying that germ cells consume lactate. Strikingly, the stage-specific dependence of male germline cells on lactate appears conserved in mammals: spermatocytes and round spermatids specifically depend on exogenous lactate when in culture and degenerate in its absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jutte et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mita and Hall, 1982</xref>). While best studied in rats, evidence also indicates that lactate suppresses apoptosis in cultured human testis sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Erkkila et al., 2002</xref>). The reasons for this lactate dependence in developing germ cells are still not fully understood, but in its absence, RNA and protein synthesis decreased, as did ATP levels, implicating lactate in energy production via mitochondrial oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Grootegoed et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jutte et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mita and Hall, 1982</xref>). One possibility is that the activity of Ldh tends to favour lactate production, resulting in the depletion of pyruvate in germ cells, such that high levels of lactate are required to allow germ cells to use pyruvate autonomously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Grootegoed et al., 1984</xref>). Intriguingly, in both flies and mammals, the lactate dependence of germ cells coincides with their isolation behind the barrier formed by somatic gonadal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Fairchild et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Stanton, 2016</xref>). Thus, it is possible that one reason for isolating germ cells is to create a tightly controlled environment in which lactate levels can be elevated locally, enabling pyruvate consumption in the germline.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Lactate as a key currency in intercellular metabolic exchange</title><p id="P22">Nonetheless, it is notable that cyst cells provide lactate and not another metabolite such as glucose or pyruvate to the germline. In addition to testes, metabolic exchange between cells in the same tissue has been described in several contexts. In particular, astrocytes provide lactate to neurons in flies and mammals, as do Paneth cells to intestinal stem cells in the mammalian gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Brooks, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Rodriguez-Colman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Volkenhoff et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, support cells in many different tissues appear to use lactate as a metabolic currency, suggesting that lactate, and therefore mitochondrial oxidation, is a preferred energy source in cells that depend on others for support. This dependence on lactate as a nutrient is especially striking in the case of both neurons and germ cells, two cell types that are long-lived and which need to protect their DNA from reactive oxygen species. Current models often suggest that proliferating cells depend on glycolysis to provide precursors for nucleotide synthesis while shunning oxidative phosphorylation to prevent DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>). However, in the Drosophila testis, spermatogonia are still proliferating when the surrounding cyst cells form tight junctions, such that the dependence on cyst cell-derived lactate does not correspond to the end of mitotic stages. Instead, one possibility is that since lactate conversion into pyruvate generates NADH, the key reason for reliance on lactate may be to regulate cellular redox, which would in turn have critical effects on energy generation, as well as macromolecule synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hosios and Vander Heiden, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Overall, our work sheds light on a key function of somatic support cells and raises the possibility that somatic metabolism may contribute to male infertility in humans. Our finding that lactate sustains germ cell metabolism will have important implications for the future development of in vitro culture protocols. Understanding not only germ cell metabolism, but the nature of the support provided by somatic gonadal cells will enable improved germ cell culture protocols which currently involve co-culture with Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Ishikura et al., 2021</xref>). By understanding how somatic cells support the germline, it may be possible to replace somatic cells in co-culture with liquid media, a crucial step towards clinical applications of <italic>in vitro</italic> gametogenesis for the treatment of infertility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Fly stocks and husbandry</title><p id="P24">Crosses were raised at room temperature.

1</label><caption><title>Glycolysis is upregulated in somatic cells.</title><p>(A) Diagram of the apical tip of a Drosophila testis. The stem cell niche, called hub (cyan), is a group of post-mitotic cells at the tip of the testis (top) which supports two stem cell populations, cyst stem cells (CySCs, magenta) and germline stem cells (GSCs) grey. GSCs divide to give rise to a gonialblast (grey) that is encapsulated by two CySC daughters called cyst cells. The gonialblast divides with incomplete cytokinesis within the envelope formed by the somatic cyst cells (cyan) to form a germ cell cyst of 2, 4, 8 (grey) and 16 (not shown) interconnected cells. Around the 4-cell stage, the two cyst cells form tight junctions (blue), isolating the germline from the external environment. (B) Diagram representing the glycolytic pathway. In flies, the major circulating sugar is trehalose, which is imported into cyst cells by the Trehalose transporter (Tret1) then cleaved into two molecules of glucose. Glucose is then broken down into pyruvate (Pyr) through glycolysis. Enzymes catalysing each step are indicated in red.

Lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) catalyses the transformation of pyruvate into lactate, which can be exported via a monocarboxylate transporter. Ldh can also catalyse the reverse reaction once lactate is imported into the germline. Alternatively, pyruvate can be imported into mitochondria via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (Mpc1), and decarboxylated into acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) by the Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (Pdh). Activity of Pdh is inhibited by the Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (Pdk).
