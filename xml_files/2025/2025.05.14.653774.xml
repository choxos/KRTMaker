Under ambient light, <italic>Rho<sup>M39R/+</sup></italic> KI mice exhibited impaired retinal function by ERG, with some defects in OS ultrastructure, but retained normal outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness. Repeated exposure to bright light led to photoreceptor loss.

In homozygous mice, a single bright light exposure significantly reduced ONL thickness within 48 h.

RP leads to the dysfunction and loss of rod photoreceptors followed by the dysfunction and loss of cone photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). In RP, pigment deposits accumulate initially in the peripheral area, while patients experience night blindness and tunnel vision. In later stages of the disease, the degeneration gradually spreads towards the centre of the retina leading to a progressive loss of vision and to legal blindness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The progression of the disease can be affected by both genetic and environmental factors, including the exposure of the retina to bright sources of light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P3"><italic>RHO</italic> was the first gene to be associated with RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). <italic>RHO</italic>-associated pathology is generally inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). <italic>RHO</italic> encodes for rhodopsin, the light-sensitive receptor protein of rod photoreceptor cells that plays a crucial role in the visual cycle and in phototransduction. Structurally, rhodopsin is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), consisting of an opsin protein bound to 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal, a derivative of vitamin A. When light is absorbed, 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal isomerizes to all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinal, and rhodopsin undergoes a conformational change that triggers the initiation of the phototransduction pathway essential for vision in scotopic (low-light) conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Over 200 <italic>RHO</italic> variants are associated with autosomal dominant forms of RP (adRP). <italic>RHO</italic> variants can be classified according to their biochemical and cellular consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). The best characterized is <italic>RHO<sup>P23H</sup>,</italic> a class 2 mutation that causes misfolding and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention of the rhodopsin protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). <italic>RHO<sup>P23H</sup></italic> is also the most frequent <italic>RHO</italic> variant in the US population, with a prevalence of 10-12% among all the adRP cases in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). A range of transgenic and knock-in (KI) models have been generated to investigate <italic>in vivo</italic> the role of <italic>Rho<sup>P23H</sup></italic> in the onset and progression of adRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In the UK population, however, <italic>RHO<sup>P23H</sup></italic> is much less frequently observed, while other less well studied <italic>RHO</italic> variants account for most rhodopsin adRP. One of the most common <italic>RHO</italic> variants in the UK population is <italic>RHO<sup>M39R</sup>. RHO<sup>M39R</sup></italic> is clinically associated with sector RP, a form of RP where light plays a key role. In sector RP, retinal degeneration initiates in the inferior retina that is more exposed to bright light from above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The biochemical and cellular effect of M39R on rhodopsin function was studied using heterologous expression, which showed that it was not retained in the ER and correctly trafficked to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). However, rhodopsin M39R was expressed at lower levels, and it showed a higher degree of chemical and thermal instability than WT rhodopsin. Interestingly, rhodopsin M39R caused a faster decay of meta-rhodopsin II and a faster rate of activation of transducin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Given these data, <italic>RHO<sup>M39R</sup></italic> was classified as a class 4 rhodopsin variant, with reduced stability of the rhodopsin protein, but the consequences <italic>in vivo</italic> have not been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To investigate the pathogenesis of rhodopsin M39R mediated sector RP, we generated and characterised a <italic>Rho<sup>M39R</sup></italic> KI mouse model, as a murine model for sector RP. Here we investigated the impact of manipulating light exposure on photoreceptor ultrastructure and survival in <italic>Rho<sup>M39R</sup></italic> KI mice. Transcriptomic analyses highlighted altered pathways for pharmacological targeting to reveal how molecular interventions can influence the progression of rhodopsin M39R-induced pathology and identify new potential therapeutic approaches.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Generation of <italic>Rho<sup>M39R</sup></italic> mice</title><p id="P7">The <italic>Rho<sup>M39R</sup></italic> KI mouse model was generated using homologous-directed repair (HDR) CRISPR/Cas9 technology by electroporating C57BL/6J mouse embryos with a guide RNA (gRNA) and a donor sequence containing nucleotide substitutions for the <italic>Rho</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).

Therefore, we investigated the ultrastructure of rod photoreceptor OS in <italic>Rho<sup>M39R</sup></italic> models by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) at 3 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). <italic>Rho<sup>M39R/+</sup></italic> rod OS were generally comprised of tightly packed discs, similar to <italic>Rho<sup>+/+</sup></italic> OS.

Therefore, we hypothesised that light could accelerate dysfunction and degeneration in <italic>Rho<sup>M39R</sup></italic> mice. In order to assess <italic>Rho<sup>M39R</sup></italic> photosensitivity, <italic>Rho<sup>M39R/+</sup></italic> mice were exposed to repeated ERG with a last step of light intensity set up to 30 k lux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The first ERG was performed on dark-adapted mice at 3 weeks of age and the ERG was repeated two and four weeks later on the same mice. The ONL thickness was measured by OCT as a marker of photoreceptor degeneration. Importantly, the photoreceptor layer was significantly thinner after each round of ERG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). After three ERGs, the ONL thickness of <italic>Rho<sup>M39R/+</sup></italic> mice reached 15-20μm, equivalent to a few layers of photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B, 2D</xref>).

Moreover, the repeated light exposure induced a further decline in photoreceptor function in <italic>Rho<sup>M39R/+</sup></italic> mice, as shown by reduced scotopic A wave amplitude compared to <italic>Rho<sup>M39R/+</sup></italic> mice reared in ambient light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). There was no change in ONL thickness and photoreceptor activity over 4 weeks in the ambient light only mice.

Initially, the first ERG was performed on mice at 3 weeks of age and repeated after a week. However, a week later, the photoreceptor layer was greatly reduced when imaged by OCT (data not shown). Therefore, a single ERG was performed, and the retinae were collected at 3, 6 and 24 h after the bright light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). No changes in the ONL thickness were observed by IHC 3 or 6 hours after bright light exposure. There was in increase in TUNEL reactivity after 3 or 6 h, but this was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-D</xref>). Whereas ultrastructural investigation by TEM showed that swollen mitochondria with disrupted cristae were present in the IS of photoreceptors from 3 h after bright light exposure. The alteration in mitochondrial morphology was exacerbated at 6 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Shorter OS full of vesicular structures were also observed in <italic>Rho<sup>M39R/M39R</sup></italic> mice retina after light exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, by 24 h after bright light ONL thickness had significantly reduced, together with a significant increase in TUNEL reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-D</xref>).

In heterozygous mice, where 50% of the rhodopsin protein is wild-type RHO, disc formation is similar to the control animals and the presence of rhodopsin M39R causes only a partial OS dysregulation, with vesicular structures intercalated in transversally oriented discs. In contrast, the OS structure changes completely when only rhodopsin M39R is expressed. The intrinsic instability of rhodopsin M39R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), in combination with the amino acid change occurring in the first transmembrane domain might affect the formation and stability of the discs and therefore lead to highly disorganised and shorter OS.
