Although self-touch attenuation is a well-documented effect, it remains unclear how prediction-related neural mechanisms drive the attenuation prior to the actual self-touch input. In this study, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to examine the neural correlates of self-touch prediction. Participants performed a self-touch task with two control conditions. In one control, the touch was externally generated without any movement. In the other, the moving and the touched hands were spatially misaligned, thereby disrupting the sensorimotor alignment of self-touch. Self-touch evoked weaker early somatosensory activity (M50 component) than both control conditions. A psychophysics task also mirrored the pattern of neural attenuation, as the perception of self-touch was attenuated compared to the two control conditions. To isolate predictive neural mechanisms from general movement-related activity, we subtracted activity from corresponding stimulus-absent trials. To further refine the signal specific to predictive processing in self-touch, we compared self-touch with misaligned touch, the two conditions that both involved voluntary movement but differed in their prediction of self-touch. This revealed greater pre-stimulus beta-band desynchronization and increased cerebellar-to-somatosensory connectivity prior to self-touch compared to misaligned touch. Our results provide the first evidence of predictive neural activity that shapes the sensory consequences of self-touch, offering insight into the mechanisms through which predictive models modulate somatosensory processing.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Classification</title><kwd>motor prediction</kwd><kwd>self-touch attenuation</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>self-touch</kwd><kwd>pre-stimulus connectivity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">For centuries, scientists have been intrigued by the question of why we cannot tickle ourselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kilteni, 2025</xref>). In <italic>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</italic>, Darwin (1872) suggested that self-tickling fails to produce the expected sensation because we cannot surprise ourselves with our own movements. Modern motor control theories have since formalized this idea, proposing that the brain uses a copy of the motor command (“efference copy”) to predict the sensory consequences of self-generated actions via an internal forward model that is thought to be implemented in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Blakemore et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kilteni &amp; Ehrsson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">McNamee &amp; Wolpert, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Miall &amp; Wolpert, 1996</xref>). These predictions attenuate the resulting sensory feedback, thereby reducing the surprise and salience of self-generated input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Blakemore et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Franklin &amp; Wolpert, 2011</xref>). As a result, self-touch feels less ticklish and less intense than identical touch caused by an external source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bays &amp; Wolpert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kilteni, 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Since the first formal experimental demonstration of self-touch attenuation in the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Weiskrantz et al., 1971</xref>), numerous psychophysical studies have replicated this effect when participants moved one hand to touch the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Asimakidou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bays et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Blakemore et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Cemeljic et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kilteni et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kilteni &amp; Ehrsson, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Shergill et al., 2003</xref>). Behavioral findings support a causal role of motor prediction in self-touch attenuation, showing that this also occurs for expected self-touch, even in the absence of physical contact between the hands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bays et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Job &amp; Kilteni, 2023</xref>), and that attenuation increases as the predicted time of self-touch approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bays et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Cemeljic et al., 2025</xref>). Recent computational modelling work has reinforced the motor prediction account by showing that variability in self-touch attenuation can be explained by noise in internal sensory predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Valè et al., 2025</xref>). Neuroimaging studies have further corroborated these behavioral self-touch attenuation effects by showing reduced activity elicited by self-touch in the primary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hesse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Kilteni et al., 2023</xref>) and secondary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Blakemore et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kilteni &amp; Ehrsson, 2020</xref>) somatosensory cortices, as well as in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Blakemore et al., 1998</xref>, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kilteni &amp; Ehrsson, 2020</xref>), compared to externally generated touch of identical intensity or delayed self-generated touch.</p><p id="P4">Theoretically, if the attenuation of self-touch is driven by motor prediction, then neural correlates of this predictive process should emerge <italic>before</italic> the sensory input, consistent with a forward model that anticipates the somatosensory consequences of action. However, evidence for such pre-stimulus predictive activity remains elusive. Previous neuroimaging studies have either focused exclusively on stimulus-evoked activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hesse et al., 2010</xref>), overlooking the pre-stimulus period, or have averaged neural activity across extended periods that include both the movement and the resulting touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Blakemore et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kilteni &amp; Ehrsson, 2020</xref>), making it difficult to isolate anticipatory signals from post-stimulus activity.</p><p id="P5">Two fMRI studies reported increased functional connectivity between the cerebellum (ipsilateral to the stimulated hand) and the contralateral somatosensory cortex during self-touch compared to external or delayed self-touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Kilteni et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kilteni &amp; Ehrsson, 2020</xref>). While this may reflect cerebellar predictions modulating somatosensory activity, these studies could not determine whether the increase in connectivity preceded the touch or not, nor could they establish directionality (i.e., from cerebellum to somatosensory cortex, indicating predictive modulation, or vice versa, reflecting feedback from sensory processing). Thus, the key theoretical assumption of the forward model framework – that the brain predicts the expected somatosensory reafference prior to the actual touch and uses this prediction to suppress the reafferent input – has not yet received support at the neural level.</p><p id="P6">To address this question, we recorded brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a task in which participants used their right index finger to produce touch on their left index finger (self-touch). Neural activity during self-touch was compared to a condition in which participants received identical touch on their left index finger without any movement (external touch). An additional control condition was included, in which participants performed the same right-hand movement and received the same touch on their left hand as in the self-touch condition, but with their two hands spatially misaligned, thus not mimicking self-touch. This control condition (misaligned touch) has been previously shown to significantly reduce or even abolish attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bays &amp; Wolpert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kilteni &amp; Ehrsson, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">2020</xref>), and was included to control for several differences between self-touch and external touch conditions, including: i) the presence of simultaneous movement and touch, ii) simultaneous tactile stimulation on both index fingers, iii) temporal predictability of touch, iv) divided attention between the two hands, v) feelings of agency, and vi) general anticipation of touch. Participants also completed blocks of the same three conditions but without receiving any touch on their left index finger to control for any differences in hand posture or peripheral visual input between conditions. Finally, to quantify self-touch attenuation under conditions matched to the MEG task, participants completed a well-established psychophysical force discrimination task after the MEG session, outside the scanner. This behavioural paradigm typically contrasts self-generated and externally generated touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kilteni, 2023</xref>), but here we extended it to also include a misaligned touch condition, thus mirroring the MEG task design.</p><p id="P7">We first hypothesized that self-touch would elicit less somatosensory-evoked activity compared to externally generated and misaligned touch. Second, we expected modulations of pre-stimulus beta oscillations to signal the brain’s prediction for self-touch. Beta-band (13-30 Hz) oscillations are closely linked to motor control and the top-down modulation of sensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Engel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Engel &amp; Fries, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Saleh et al., 2010</xref>) and have been shown to reflect tactile expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Andersen &amp; Dalal, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Andersen &amp; Lundqvist, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Kimura, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Kimura &amp; Katayama, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">van Ede et al., 2010</xref>, 2011). We therefore expected changes in pre-stimulus activity in the beta-band over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Third, we reasoned that if cerebellar activity underlies the predictive attenuation of self-touch, then connectivity in the beta band from the cerebellum to the somatosensory cortices may be increased prior to self-touch. We focused on left cerebellar lobule VI, based on earlier anatomical evidence that the cerebellum controls output to, and receives input from, the ipsilateral side of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Grodd et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Manni &amp; Petrosini, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Mottolese et al., 2013</xref>) and earlier fMRI evidence that this region is involved in self-touch attenuation when the right hand moves to touch the left hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kilteni &amp; Ehrsson, 2020</xref>). Although deeper structures like the cerebellum pose challenges for MEG recordings, recent simulations and empirical studies have demonstrated that cerebellar activity can be reliably detected with MEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Samuelsson et al., 2020</xref>). We tested all these hypotheses with MEG because its millisecond temporal resolution allows dissociation of pre- and post-stimulus neural activity, crucial for identifying predictive processes. Finally, we hypothesized that like the neural self-touch attenuation effects, self-touch would feel weaker compared to externally generated and misaligned touch on the perceptual, force discrimination task. We found support for all these hypotheses.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Decreased somatosensory cortical activity evoked by self-touch</title><p id="P8">We first investigated attenuation of somatosensory activity time-locked to the touch.

Critically, control analyses confirmed no significant differences in movement acceleration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>) or press intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>) between the self-touch and misaligned touch conditions, which was supported by a Bayesian analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Text S1, Figure S1</xref>). Therefore, any differences in brain activity between the movement conditions cannot be driven by variations in movement kinematics between conditions.</p><p id="P9">Event-related fields (ERFs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e-g</xref>) were computed by averaging trials in each of the three conditions and subtracting the stimulus-absent waveforms, minimising movement-related activity and any postural or visual differences (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref> – <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Stimulus-evoked activity</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>).

The M50 component was source localised to the right postcentral gyrus (i.e., primary somatosensory cortex contralateral to the stimulated finger) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h-j</xref>). The M100 component was localised to a broader area including bilateral sensorimotor areas and bilateral parietal operculum (i.e., bilateral secondary somatosensory cortices) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1k-m</xref>). Thus, the source localisation confirms previous findings that the M50 and M100 components reflect activity in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hesse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Yamashiro et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Cluster-based permutation tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Maris &amp; Oostenveld, 2007</xref>) showed a significant difference between the self-touch condition and the external touch condition (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1n</xref>).

Cluster-based permutation tests also showed a significant difference (<italic>p</italic> = 0.015) when comparing the self-touch with the misaligned touch condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1o</xref>), indicating lower amplitudes in the self-touch compared to the misaligned touch condition between 45 ms and 65 ms, corresponding to the M50 component.

Importantly, when comparing the self-touch and the misaligned touch conditions that differ only in the prediction of the sensory consequences of the movement (i.e., self-touch), the attenuation of somatosensory activity was specific to the earlier M50 component. Later components were similarly attenuated in the self-touch and misaligned touch conditions relative to the external touch condition, likely reflecting additional effects between movement and non-movement conditions, including temporal predictability of touch, feelings of agency, and general anticipation of touch.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Greater pre-stimulus beta desynchronization preceding self-touch</title><p id="P12">To avoid confounding movement-related activity with predictive effects, we focused our pre-stimulus analysis on the self-touch and misaligned touch conditions, excluding the external touch condition.

In a separate offline behavioural task, designed to mirror its key conditions, self-touch attenuation was similarly reduced when the spatial alignment of self-touch was disrupted. Importantly, control analyses confirmed no significant differences in the movement kinematics between the self-touch and misaligned touch conditions for the MEG and behavioural tasks, ruling out any motor confounds that could explain the observed effects. Crucially, attenuation of somatosensory evoked activity was preceded by reduced pre-stimulus beta oscillatory activity and increased beta-band connectivity from cerebellar lobule VI to the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Together, these findings provide evidence that self-touch attenuation is actively shaped by predictive processes and further indicate a cerebellar role in modulating self-generated somatosensory activity. Moreover, subtracting the activity from each condition’s stimulus-absent blocks minimised the influence of movement or posture-related signals and isolated predictive neural mechanisms from general movement-related activity. These controls strengthen the conclusion that the observed effects reflect predictive sensory processing of self-touch, rather than differences in sensory input, motor output or general task demands.</p><p id="P22">The major contribution of our study is the identification of activity that uniquely precedes the actual self-touch input. Beta-band desynchronisation is widely associated with motor preparation and the top-down modulation of sensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Engel &amp; Fries, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Fries, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Saleh et al., 2010</xref>). Beyond its role in maintaining ongoing cognitive states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Engel &amp; Fries, 2010</xref>), beta activity also appears to support the reactivation of task-relevant representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Spitzer &amp; Haegens, 2017</xref>), indicating a broader function in anticipatory neural dynamics. We observed reduced beta power in the self-touch condition relative to the spatially misaligned condition, despite matched motor demands. This finding shows that beta oscillations not only index motor preparation but also play a role in predicting sensory feedback during self-touch movements. Previous studies have reported reduced beta power prior to predictable tactile stimuli outside the motor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Forster et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Kimura, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Kimura &amp; Katayama, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">van Ede et al., 2010</xref>, 2011). Our findings extend this work by demonstrating that beta desynchronisation preceding self-touch encodes motor predictions about self-touch, likely modulating the flow of expected sensory input. These findings converge on the view that pre-stimulus beta modulations reflect a predictive neural state tailored to expected sensory events.</p><p id="P23">In addition to the decrease in beta-band amplitude, we found increased pre-stimulus connectivity within the beta range between the primary somatosensory cortex (contralateral to the upcoming touch) and the ipsilateral cerebellum in the self-touch condition compared to the spatially misaligned condition. Crucially, this effect was evident not only in terms of increased coherence but also enhanced directed connectivity, as shown by Granger causality analysis, indicating information flow from the left cerebellar lobule VI to the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex. These findings provide novel empirical support for the forward model framework, which posits that the cerebellum generates predictive signals to modulate the somatosensory cortex in anticipation of self-generated sensory input. Importantly, unlike previous neuroimaging studies that were limited to post-stimulus activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hesse et al., 2010</xref>), or averaged over pre- and post-stimulus activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Blakemore et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kilteni &amp; Ehrsson, 2020</xref>), our data reveal that this cerebellar-somatosensory connectivity occurs <italic>prior</italic> to the sensory event and is <italic>directed</italic> from the cerebellum to the somatosensory cortex, two criteria important for establishing the predictive nature of the effect. This influence from the cerebellum could be anatomically mediated via cerebello-thalamo-cortical projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Aoki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Keser et al., 2015</xref>), which include pathways from the cerebellum to the thalamus and onward to motor and somatosensory cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Andersen &amp; Dalal, 2024b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Bostan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Dum &amp; Strick, 2003</xref>). Such a route would allow the cerebellum to relay predicted sensory consequences to the cortex prior to the tactile input. Together, these results underscore the cerebellum’s role in predicting reafferent somatosensory input and support the notion that forward-model mechanisms generate sensory predictions in advance during voluntary actions.</p><p id="P24">In the psychophysical force discrimination task, participants perceived self-touch as weaker than externally generated touch, replicating previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Asimakidou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bays et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Blakemore et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Cemeljic et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Kilteni et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kilteni &amp; Ehrsson, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Shergill et al., 2003</xref>). Crucially, this attenuation effect was significantly reduced when the hands were spatially misaligned, indicating that the effect depends on the spatial correspondence between the movement and the tactile feedback. A parallel pattern was observed in the somatosensory evoked activity, which was attenuated as early as the M50 component (45-65 ms post-stimulus) for self-touch compared to externally generated touch, consistent with prior neuroimaging findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hesse et al., 2010</xref>). This attenuation of the M50 component was significantly diminished in the misaligned condition, suggesting that the early attenuation reflects the precision of motor predictions about self-touch rather than alternative non-predictive explanations. Such explanations include factors that differ between self-touch and external touch conditions, but are held constant in the misaligned condition, such as i) the co-occurrence of movement and touch, ii) bilateral stimulation (i.e. touch occurs on both fingers), iii) temporal predictability, iv) divided attention, v) agency, or vi) general expectation of touch. Notably, no significant difference was observed between self-touch and misaligned touch at the later M100 component, suggesting that spatial specificity of predictive attenuation may be limited to the early stages of somatosensory processing. Together, these converging behavioural and neural findings support the forward model framework, reinforcing the idea that attenuation depends on the correspondence between predicted and actual sensory feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bays &amp; Wolpert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Blakemore et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Wolpert &amp; Flanagan, 2001</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Our findings are consistent with animal studies showing reduced, or even cancelled, neural activity in response to self-generated stimuli, including vestibular input in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>), self-generated sounds in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Audette et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Schneider et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Singla et al., 2017</xref>), self-generated touch in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Gupta et al., 2023</xref>), and self-generated electro-sensory and mechanosensory signals in fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Perks et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Wallach &amp; Sawtell, 2023</xref>), compared to externally generated stimuli. Notably, some studies have also identified neural signals that precede and predict the expected sensory consequences of action. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Audette et al., (2022)</xref> demonstrated that neural activity in the mouse auditory cortex reflects the expected timing and identity of self-generated sounds even before they occur. Previous studies also implicate cerebellar or cerebellar-like structures in predictive sensory attenuation. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Brooks et al., (2015)</xref> demonstrated that the cerebellum suppresses vestibular reafference during active head movements in monkeys. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Singla et al., (2017)</xref> showed that a cerebellum-like circuit in mice (the dorsal cochlear nucleus) selectively cancels self-generated sounds via non-auditory signals conveyed by mossy fibers. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Wallach &amp; Sawtell (2023)</xref> described how a cerebellum-like circuit in weakly electric fish cancels predictable self-generated electrical signals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Perks et al., (2020)</xref> showed similar cerebellum-like effects for mechanosensory input caused by a fish’s own movements. These findings align with our observation of increased directed connectivity from the cerebellum to the primary somatosensory cortex in humans. Together, this suggests that a predictive cerebellar modulation of early sensory processing may be a conserved feature across species and sensory modalities.</p><p id="P26">Disruptions in the integration of predictive signals with sensory input have been central to neurobiological accounts of psychosis spectrum disorders including schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Blakemore et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Corlett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Shergill et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">2014</xref>) and schizotypy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Asimakidou et al., 2022</xref>). Individuals with schizophrenia exhibit reduced attenuation of self-generated stimuli, including less attenuation of self-generated auditory evoked activity in EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Whitford et al., 2011</xref>) and somatosensory activation in fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Shergill et al., 2014</xref>). These findings support the view that the symptoms of schizophrenia may arise from a deficit in predicting and processing self-generated sensations (C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Frith, 2005b</xref>; C. D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Frith, 2019</xref>). Impairments in these predictive mechanisms are thought to disrupt the distinction between self-generated and externally generated events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Fletcher &amp; Frith, 2009</xref>), weaken the sense of agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Leptourgos &amp; Corlett, 2020</xref>) and lead to perceptual disturbances such as delusions of control and hallucinations (C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Frith, 2005a</xref>; C.

However, most previous neuroimaging studies have focused on post-stimulus activity, leaving open the question of whether earlier predictive processes are also compromised. Our results reveal pre-stimulus beta-band desynchronization and directed connectivity from the cerebellum to the somatosensory cortex, neural markers that may reflect intact predictive processing of self-touch. Future studies should investigate whether these pre-stimulus effects are diminished or absent in individuals with schizophrenia or elevated schizotypal traits, potentially offering early indicators of disrupted sensory prediction in clinical populations.</p><p id="P27">Our study shows that self-touch is perceived as less intense, evokes weaker somatosensory activity, and is preceded by beta-band desynchronisation and enhanced directed cerebellar-to-somatosensory connectivity. Crucially, these predictive effects were reduced when the spatial alignment between movement and touch was disrupted, indicating that they depend on precise motor predictions. By isolating pre-stimulus activity and identifying the direction of information flow, from the cerebellum to the somatosensory cortex, our results extend previous work and provide a possible mechanism for how the brain anticipates self-generated tactile events. More broadly, predictive processes like those observed here may be fundamental to how the brain distinguishes self- from externally generated events. Given that these mechanisms are thought to be impaired in psychosis spectrum disorders, the pre-stimulus markers identified here offer promise for understanding disrupted sensory predictions in clinical populations.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P28">Twenty-four adults completed the experiment (aged 19-36 years, 12 female, 21 right-handed and 3 ambidextrous, <italic>M</italic> = 75.48, <italic>SD</italic> = 34.56).

After 1200 ms, the blink instruction was replaced with a fixation cross cue that appeared in the centre of the screen. After 500 ms, the tactile stimulus of 100 ms duration was delivered to the pulp of the left index finger. Following the stimulation, an inter-trial interval was presented, which randomly varied in duration between 800, 1000, and 1200 ms. The fixation cross remained on the screen for the duration of the inter-trial interval before it was replaced with the blink instruction of the following trial. The inter-stimulus interval was therefore 2800 ± 200 ms. Participants were instructed to rest both hands during the external touch block. The left hand rested palm-up and its position was fixed using a vacuum pillow (Germa Vaccum Pillow).</p><p id="P34">In the self-touch condition, the same blink instruction and fixation cross cue were presented on each trial. Participants were instructed to tap with their right index finger on a custom-made lever device placed directly above, but not in contact with, their left index finger when the fixation cross cue appeared. Participants had a maximum window of 3000 ms to press the lever. When the lever device was pressed with the right index finger, an optical fibre placed below the device detected the proximity of the finger, which triggered the onset of the tactile stimulus on the left index finger. The setup simulated pressing the left index finger with the right index finger through an object. Participants were instructed to keep their right index finger on a start position marker 5 cm from the lever device before and after the pressing action. The misaligned touch condition was identical to the self-touch condition, except that the device and start-position marker were placed 25 cm to the right of the left hand. Thus, the action of moving 5 cm to press the device in the self-touch and misaligned touch conditions was identical, but the spatial configuration no longer simulated touching one’s left index finger. The inter-stimulus interval did not significantly differ between conditions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Text S1</xref>).

Time-frequency representations (TFRs) of power and cross-spectral density were computed using multitaper convolution with a Hanning taper. Frequency-dependent time windows of 7 cycles per frequency were used. Coherence estimates were calculated for each condition in the beta band (13-30 Hz), separately for each time point in the pre-stimulus window (-1 to 0 seconds). For each condition, the stimulus-absent block was subtracted from the corresponding stimulus-present block to isolate stimulus-specific coherence.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Granger causality analysis</title><p id="P45">Directed connectivity between the virtual sensors was assessed using non-parametric Granger causality using FieldTrip’s <italic>ft_connectivityanalysis</italic> function with the ‘<italic>granger</italic>’ method and ‘<italic>bivariate</italic>’ spectral factorization. To improve signal stationarity, the analysis was confined to a 500 ms pre-stimulus interval (-0.5 to 0 ms) that was closest to stimulus onset. Frequency decomposition was performed using the multitaper method with ±2 Hz spectral smoothing. For each participant and condition, stimulus-present Granger causality values were expressed relative to stimulus-absent values (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Time-reversed trials were also analysed as a control to ensure directional asymmetries were not due to spurious temporal correlations or non-causal dependencies. Additional analyses of direction-reversed connectivity (from SI to the cerebellum) were conducted to assess the directional specificity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Behavioural force-discrimination task</title><p id="P46">Following MEG data collection, participants completed the force discrimination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kilteni, 2023</xref>). They rested their left hand, palm up, with their index finger placed on a moulded support (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). On each trial, a motor (Maxon EC Motor EC 90 flat; Switzerland) delivered two forces (the <italic>test</italic> force and the <italic>comparison</italic> force) on the pulp of the left index finger through a cylindrical probe (25 mm height) with a flat aluminium surface (20 mm diameter) attached to a lever on the motor. A force sensor (FSG15N1A, Honeywell Inc.; diameter, 5 mm; minimum resolution, 0.01 N; response time, 1 ms; measurement range, 0–15 N) within the probe recorded the forces applied on the left index finger. Following the presentation of the two forces, participants verbally reported which of the two forces felt stronger, the first or the second. A second identical force sensor within an identical cylindrical probe (“active force sensor”) was placed on top of, but not in contact with, the probe of the left index finger.</p><p id="P47">Participants judged the intensity of a <italic>test</italic> force and a <italic>comparison</italic> force (100 ms duration each) separated by a random interval between 800 ms and 1200 ms in a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) task. The intensity of the <italic>test</italic> force was 2 N, while the intensity of the <italic>comparison</italic> force was systematically varied among seven force levels (1, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, or 3 N). In all the conditions, the forces were delivered by the same motor, in order to precisely control their magnitude, however, the source of the force was manipulated across conditions such that the force was triggered by the participant’s contact with a force sensor (self-touch condition and misaligned touch condition) or automatically by the stimulus computer (external touch condition).</p><p id="P48">In the external touch condition, participants rested both hands and received the test and the comparison force on the left index finger. This external condition was used to assess somatosensory perception in the absence of any movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bays et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Kilteni et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">2020</xref>). Each trial began with an auditory cue (100 ms duration, 997 Hz) followed by the <italic>test</italic> force delivered to the participant’s left index finger 800 ms after the cue by the motor. The <italic>comparison</italic> force was then delivered at a random interval between 800 ms and 1200 ms after the <italic>test</italic> force.</p><p id="P49">In the self-touch condition, the same auditory cue was presented as in the external touch condition, but participants now actively tapped on the force sensor placed on top of, but not in contact with, the probe. The active tap on the force sensor triggered the motor to apply the <italic>test</italic> force on the left index finger (threshold 0.2 N). The tap of their right index finger triggered the <italic>test</italic> force on their left index finger with an intrinsic delay of 36 ms. The <italic>comparison</italic> force was then delivered at a random interval between 800ms and 1200ms after the <italic>test</italic> force. Participants were asked to tap, neither too weakly nor too strongly, with their right index finger, “as if tapping the screen of their smartphone”, as instructed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Asimakidou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Kilteni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kilteni &amp; Ehrsson, 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P50">The misaligned touch condition was identical to the self-touch condition, except that the force sensor that participants tapped to trigger the touch on their left index finger was placed 25 cm to the right of the left index finger, rather than directly above the left index finger. While previous studies investigating spatial manipulations of self-touch have used force-matching paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bays &amp; Wolpert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kilteni &amp; Ehrsson, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">2020</xref>). These typically involve sustained force stimuli lasting several seconds, unlike the brief tactile stimuli used in the MEG task. By contrast, the force discrimination task used stimuli of identical duration to those in the MEG task, enabling a more closely matched behavioural task. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a spatial manipulation of self-touch within the force discrimination task.</p><p id="P51">White noise was played throughout the task to mask any sounds made by the motor that could serve as a cue for the task. Each block consisted of 70 trials, resulting in 210 trials per participant.

For behavioural data generated from the force discrimination task (i.e. PSEs and JNDs), rmANOVA was used to compare the external touch, self-touch, and misaligned touch conditions. For the peak force exerted with the right index finger on the force sensor, a paired t-test was used to compare the self-touch and misaligned touch conditions. Significant main effects from the rmANOVAs were followed by Bonferroni-corrected post hoc comparisons. Effect sizes are reported as partial eta squared <inline-formula><mml:math id="M6"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>η</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>p</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for F-tests and Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> for t-tests. 95% confidence intervals (<italic>CI<sup>95</sup></italic>) are reported for each statistical test. Bayesian factor analyses using default Cauchy priors with a scale of 0.707 were performed for tests that led to statistically non-significant effects. This provided information about the level of support for the null hypothesis compared to the alternative hypothesis (<italic>BF<sub>01</sub></italic>) based on the data. We interpret a Bayes factor from 1 to 3 as providing ‘anecdotal’ support for the null hypothesis, a Bayes factor from 3 to 10 as providing ‘moderate’ support for the null hypothesis, and a Bayes factor above 10 as providing ‘strong’ support for the null hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Quintana &amp; Williams, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">van Doorn et al., 2021</xref>), indicating that support for either the preferred or null hypotheses is insufficient. All tests were two-tailed.</p><p id="P57">For stimulus-evoked activity, comparisons were made between the self-touch and external touch conditions, as well as self-touch and misaligned touch, and misaligned touch and external touch conditions. For pre-stimulus activity, only conditions that involved action were compared (i.e., self-touch and misaligned touch), given that comparisons between a condition that involves action and the external touch condition without action would likely reflect the presence of movement within the pre-stimulus window, or activity locked to the fixation cross cue. Non-parametric cluster permutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Maris &amp; Oostenveld, 2007</xref>) was used to compare the conditions. The following steps are taken for significance testing with cluster-based permutation tests: 1) perform mass-univariate dependent samples t-statistics comparing each condition for each of the samples in the multidimensional data structure; 2) neighbouring data points in the multidimensional data structure below a threshold of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 are summed to calculate the cluster level statistic; 3) the procedure is repeated for 2000 permutations with the condition labels shuffled on each permutation; 4) The maximum cluster statistic was evaluated under its permutation distribution (shuffled data). The cluster-level significance threshold was set at the two-tailed level of 0.025. For the analysis of stimulus-evoked activity, the test window spanned 0 to 400 ms post-stimulus. For the analysis of pre-stimulus oscillatory activity, the test window covered -1000 to 0 ms relative to stimulus onset and was restricted to the beta band (13-30 Hz).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary material</label><media xlink:href="EMS207686-supplement-Supplementary_material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d69aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Lili Timar for her assistance with collecting the behavioural data.

statement</title></caption><p>The brain is thought to predict and attenuate the sensory consequences of self-generated actions, but neural evidence for such prediction before sensation has been limited. Using magnetoencephalography, we show that self-touch attenuation is preceded by beta-band desynchronization and increased directed connectivity from the cerebellum to the primary somatosensory cortex. These effects cannot be attributed to movement, as they were not observed in a control condition with similar motor output but without predicted self-touch consequences, suggesting they reflect predictive processing. Our study provides the first neural evidence of cerebellar influence on cortical sensory areas before self-touch. These pre-stimulus effects strongly support predictive forward models of sensorimotor control and shed new light on how the brain anticipates and modulates upcoming sensory input.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>MEG stimulus-evoked results.</title><p><bold>(a)</bold> Illustration of the MEG setup, showing the custom device used for simulating self-generated touch.
