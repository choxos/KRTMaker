To address this, we developed iPSC-derived i<sup>3</sup>Neuron (i<sup>3</sup>N) lines expressing &gt;75% 4R tau, driven by FTD splice-shifting mutations (S305N or S305N/IVS10+3). These neurons develop hyperphosphorylated tau and demonstrate somatodendritic mis-localisation.

For scalable screening, we CRISPR-engineered a HiBiT luminescence tag at the endogenous <italic>MAPT</italic> locus into the S305N/IVS10+3 iPSC line, enabling precise quantification of tau levels and pharmacological responses.

These include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Pick’s disease, and frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In these diseases, tau aggregates into intracellular fibrils that interfere with neuronal function and viability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Tau exists in six isoforms in the adult human brain, produced by alternative splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10 of the <italic>MAPT</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. These isoforms differ in the number of N-terminal inserts and in the presence of either three (3R) or four (4R) microtubule-binding repeats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. During foetal development, the human brain predominantly expresses 3R tau,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> but in the healthy adult brain, the ratio of 3R:4R tau is balanced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Disruption of this balance, particularly an excess of 4R tau, is strongly associated with several tauopathies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons are a valuable tool to study early mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. However, using such human neuronal models to recapitulate 4R tau expression has historically been difficult as they typically express predominantly 0N3R tau, reflecting foetal-like tau splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Until recently, most of the iPSC-derived neuronal models that were able to induce moderate expression of 4R tau required prolonged and complicated culturing conditions to achieve a moderate increase in 4R tau expression or they relied on the insertion of multiple tau mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. An alternative neuronal model involves direct conversion of fibroblasts into induced neurons (miNs), which bypass the pluripotent state and retain age-associated epigenetic features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. We showed that miNs robustly express adult tau isoforms (including 4R tau) and they developed seed-competent aggregated tau<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. While direct conversion allows for the preservation of donor-related age and disease state, they are not suitable for drug discovery as: (i) availability of patient derived fibroblasts is limited; (ii) they cannot be maintained in culture indefinitely; (iii) the yield of neurons is typically low; (iv) and there are significant challenges in batch reproducibility.</p><p id="P4">The S305N mutation, located at the end of exon 10, causes excessive production of 4R tau and consequently leads to FTLD-MAPT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Postmortem brain tissue from S305N carriers exhibit 4R tau-positive inclusions, including neurofibrillary tangles and ring-like structures surrounding neuronal nuclei, reflecting severe tau pathology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. A recent study has shown that an isogenic set of iPSC lines derived from a S305N mutation carrier presents increased expression of 4R tau after a few months in culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. In the current study, we employ an i<sup>3</sup>Neuronal (i<sup>3</sup>N) version of the same isogenic S305N iPSC lines, as well as a novel CRISPR-Cas9-edited iPSC line where we introduced the S305N point mutation and the IVS10+3 intronic mutation to further enhance 4R levels. The IVS10+3 mutation is spliced out of the mature mRNA and the resulting protein only expresses the single mutation, at S305N. Elevated 4R tau resulted in tau hyperphosphorylation, changes in the cytoskeleton and, remarkably, endogenous seed-competent tau. Endogenous tau seeds have not been reported for other iPSC-derived FTLD-MAPT lines. We have tested this line with tau-modulating drugs, and we anticipate it can be developed into a platform for drug testing. In summary, we have developed a novel human neuron model that recapitulates key aspects of FTLD-MAPT that can be used to identify key pathogenic mechanisms as well as to test potential therapeutics for tauopathies. Although the lines express an FTLD-MAPT associated mutation, they recapitulate many key features observed in Alzheimer’s disease and they are therefore a suitable model for drug screening targeting tau in a range of neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>i<sup>3</sup>N neurons with an S305N mutation predominantly express 4R tau after 7 days of differentiation</title><p id="P5">It is well established that iPSC-derived neurons predominantly express the 3R isoform of tau <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Most of the existing iPSC-derived neuronal models capable of generating 4R tau rely on the introduction of multiple mutations (&gt;3) to drive this shift<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Building on insights from a targeted mouse model where combining both S305N and IVS10+3 FTLD-MAPT-related mutations led to the expression of 99% 4R MAPT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, we aimed to determine whether a similar shift could be achieved in an iPSC-derived neuronal model. The S305N mutation affects the RNA stem-loop structure that regulates alternative splicing of exon 10 in the <italic>MAPT</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. The intronic IVS10+3 mutation lies adjacent to the splice-donor site and also disrupts the stem-loop structure of the pre-mRNA, promoting increased exon 10 inclusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">To generate our model, we used a commercially available iPSC line from Synthego (802:30F; referred to as WT) and introduced the mutations using CRISPR-Cas9 with a single guide RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). As the IVS10+3 mutation is spliced out, only a single, FTLD-MAPT-causing mutation is present in the protein and the cells are therefore a valid model of human 4R tauopathy. Two edited, homozygous clones, S305N_C1 and S305N_C2, were isolated and used for experiments. In addition to these lines, we used a patient-derived S305N heterozygous line (isoHet S305N), along with isogenic wild-type (isoWT) and homozygous (isoHom S305N) lines (available from NCRAD, Bowles <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. All iPSC lines were transfected with a doxycycline-inducible human <italic>Neurogenin-2</italic> (hNGN2) transgene using the piggyBac transposon system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Stable integration of hNGN2 enabled rapid differentiation into excitatory human cortical glutamatergic neurons (i<sup>3</sup>Ns) within three days of doxycycline exposure. Post-transfection, all lines maintained normal karyotypes (assessed via low-coverage whole genome sequencing) and continued to express pluripotency markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B–E</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To assess the effect of the mutations on exon 10 inclusion, we differentiated all WT and mutant iPSC lines into i<sup>3</sup>N neurons using a two-step protocol adapted from Fernandopulle <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, culturing them for up to 28 days. We examined MAPT isoform expression by semi-quantitative PCR (semi-qPCR), focusing on the inclusion (4R MAPT) or exclusion (3R MAPT) of exon 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). As expected, both WT and isoWT lines exclusively expressed 3R tau throughout differentiation (DIV7–DIV28). In contrast, both S305N_C1 and C2 clones expressed &gt;80% 4R tau as early as DIV7, increasing to &gt;90% by DIV28. The isoHet S305N line exhibited a 3R:4R ratio of approximately 60:40 at DIV7, shifting to a nearly 50:50 ratio by DIV28 which is consistent with ratios observed in the healthy adult human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The isoHom S305N line started with 55:45% 3R:4R tau at DIV7 which reached ~25:75% 3R:4R by DIV28 indicating significantly lower 4R levels compared to the S305N_C1 and C2 clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). The level of total <italic>MAPT</italic> RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR and no change was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). MAPT mRNA could not be detected in the neuronal lines before DIV7.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Characterization of S305N i<sup>3</sup>N neurons</title><p id="P8">To assess the effects of the S305N mutation and 4R tau elevation on neuronal maturation, we analysed neuronal marker expression at DIV21 and DIV28 by immunocytochemistry. All i<sup>3</sup>N neuronal lines were stained for βIII-tubulin (TUJ1) (an axonal marker), MAP2 (a somatodendritic marker) and NeuN, a nuclear marker associated with neuronal maturity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). No difference in TUJ1 expression was observed between S305N_C1 and C2 and the WT control at either timepoint (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). In the isoHet and isoHom S305N lines, TUJ1 expression remained comparable to the isoWT control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). While overall TUJ1 expression was unchanged, we noted the emergence of irregular, swollen axonal protrusions in all lines carrying the S305N mutation, particularly at DIV28. These structures may represent axonal blebbing, which is commonly associated with neuronal stress, injury, or degeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. MAP2 mRNA levels did not differ between lines but increased over time in all neuronal cultures, reaching a plateau after DIV21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). However, the level of MAP2 protein was significantly reduced in both S305N_C1 and C2 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>), whereas no change was detected in the isoHet and isoHom S305N lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). The observed reduction in MAP2 protein in the S305N_C1 and C2 lines may point to cytoskeletal instability, which coincides with the tubulin blebbing in these neurons. NeuN staining revealed that over 80% of cells in all lines were NeuN-positive, indicating a high proportion of mature neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We also examined the expression of VGLUT1, a marker of glutamatergic synapses. VGLUT1 mRNA levels decreased over time, reaching a plateau around DIV17 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>). At the protein level, immunocytochemistry at DIV21 and DIV28 revealed a statistically significant reduction in VGLUT1 expression in the S305N_C1 and C2 lines, with C1 showing nearly a 50% decrease compared to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E and F</xref>). In contrast, no difference was observed in the isoHet and isoHom S305N lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2G</xref>). Reduced VGLUT1 expression may indicate synaptic dysregulation in the S305N_C1 and C2 lines, consistent with observations from the mouse model expressing the same mutations, which exhibited synaptic loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Both S305N_C1 and C2 presented similar changes; however, for some measurements (<italic>e.g</italic>., blebbing or MAP2 levels), a stronger phenotype was evident in the S305N_C1 neurons. We therefore decided to focus on clone C1 for further experiments.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Mis-localization and distribution of tau in neurons expressing S305N mutant isoforms</title><p id="P10">Tau undergoes proteolytic cleavage by various proteases, generating fragments that contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. To investigate the subcellular distribution of tau, we performed immunocytochemistry on methanol-fixed neurons at DIV21 and DIV28 using antibodies targeting distinct tau domains: Tau13 (N-terminus, epitope 2–18 aa), HT7 (mid-region, epitope 159–162 aa), and TauC (C-terminus, epitope 244–441 aa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). In both WT and isoWT neurons, Tau13 and TauC labelled tau both in the somatodendritic compartment (co-localized with MAP2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) and in the axons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>, co-localized with TUJ1), with signal intensity increasing between DIV21 and DIV28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Notably, HT7 exhibited a prominent perinuclear signal, particularly in WT cells. In contrast, S305N_C1 neurons displayed pronounced somatodendritic tau retention with markedly reduced axonal staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). Densitometric analysis revealed an &gt;80% reduction in total tau signal detected by all three antibodies in this group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C, E, G</xref>). In the isoHet and isoHom S305N mutant neurons, tau remained detectable in both the somatodendritic compartment and axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). Among the antibodies, Tau13 showed the least variability and revealed significantly reduced tau levels in isoHet neurons at DIV28, with a trend toward reduction observed in isoHom neurons (22% reduction, p = 0.0894). Interestingly, HT7 was the only antibody that detected significantly increased tau levels in isoHom neurons at DIV28 (p = 0.0152). Since HT7 targets a mid-region tau epitope, this selective increase suggests the accumulation of tau fragments retaining the mid-region but lacking either the N- or C-terminal epitopes, possibly due to aberrant proteolysis.</p><p id="P11">Furthermore, neurons expressing isoHet and isoHom S305N tau displayed distinct tau-positive “blebs” at DIV28 when stained with Tau13 and TauC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, arrows). Co-staining with TUJ1 revealed partial colocalization of these tau “blebs” with tubulin-rich structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>, arrows). Overall, these results suggest that homozygote S305N mutations or high levels of 4R tau led to both mislocalization and altered levels of tau, particularly affecting its axonal distribution. The most profound changes were observed in S305N_C1 neurons, where tau was almost exclusively confined to the somatodendritic compartment. While tau remained detectable in axons of isoHet and isoHom neurons, overall levels trended lower, especially as revealed by Tau13 and TauC staining.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Increased tau phosphorylation depending on S305N isoform</title><p id="P12">To investigate the effects of the S305N mutation on tau phosphorylation, we examined the expression and distribution of phospho-tau (pTau) epitopes using the following antibodies: AT8 (pSer202/pThr205), CP13 (pSer202) and AT100 (pThr212/pSer214). Immunocytochemistry was performed on methanol-fixed neurons at DIV21 and DIV28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In S305N_C1 neurons, AT8 staining was predominantly localized to the somatodendritic compartment, whereas in the WT neurons AT8 staining was much lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Quantitative analysis revealed a significant increase in AT8 signal at DIV21 (p = 0.0083), whereas at DIV28 AT8 levels did not change between WT and S305N_C1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). When normalizing AT8 levels to total tau (via TauC) we observed a significant increase at both timepoints, despite the overall reduction in total tau levels in this line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>; AT8/TauC staining not shown). CP13 staining in S305N_C1 neurons showed both somatodendritic and axonal localization. However, total CP13 signal was significantly reduced compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). After normalization to TauC, a trend toward increased CP13 levels was observed at DIV28 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B and D</xref>). Surprisingly, AT100 staining in S305N_C1 neurons was restricted exclusively to the axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Given the overall reduction in total tau in this line, the presence of detectable AT100 signal suggests extremely low levels of tau were still localized within the axonal compartment. Interestingly, AT100 diverged between genotypes: while signal decreased over time in WT neurons, it progressively increased in S305N_C1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In isoHet and isoHom S305N neurons, AT8 and CP13 signal was evident in both soma and axons. Levels increased in a dose-dependent manner relative to S305N allele copy number compared to their isogenic WT controls at DIV21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B, F, G</xref>). At DIV28, both AT8 and CP13 levels were significantly elevated in isoHet and isoHom neurons. AT100 in the isoWT neurons mirrored the trend seen in WT neurons, showing a reduction over time. In isoHet neurons, the level of AT100 significantly increased at DIV28 (p=0.0005), whereas in isoHom neurons, elevated AT100 signal was detected at both timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). Notably, unlike AT8 and CP13, AT100 did not exhibit a clear allele-dose-dependent increase.</p><p id="P14">Collectively, these results highlight distinct phosphorylation patterns and subcellular localization profiles of tau in neurons with elevated 4R tau, expressing the S305N mutation. Some phospho-epitopes, such as AT8, were restricted to the soma (e.g., in S305N_C1), others were distributed in both soma and axons (e.g., CP13), while AT100 was found exclusively in axons. These patterns may reflect the interplay between isoform composition, total tau levels and subcellular localization of tau. Increased 4R tau in S305N mutant neurons influenced both isoform composition, the phosphorylation status and the spatial distribution of tau proteoforms.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Temporal analysis of total and phosphorylated tau reveals early alterations in S305N mutant neurons</title><p id="P15">To determine whether the observed reduction in total tau levels in S305N_C1 neurons at DIV21 and DIV28 represents an early developmental event or a progressive consequence of differentiation, we performed immunoblotting on lysates collected from DIV7 to DIV28. Blots were probed with antibodies against total tau (Tau13, HT7, TauC) and phosphorylated tau (pTau) (CP13, AT8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Across all timepoints, S305N_C1 neurons displayed consistently lower levels of total tau compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A, B and C</xref>). As previous studies focused on DIV21 and DIV28, we specifically compared tau expression at these timepoints, as well as at DIV10, the earliest timepoint where tau was detected with all antibodies used. At all-time points, significant reductions in tau were observed using all total tau antibodies in S305N_C1 neurons compared to the WT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B, C</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4H, I, J</xref>). Tau protein expression in both WT and S305N_C1 neurons increased over time, mirroring MAPT mRNA expression patterns; however, at no timepoint did tau levels in S305N_C1 neurons reach those observed in WT neurons. In the isoHet S305N neurons, both Tau13 and TauC, but not HT7, were significantly increased at DIV10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> left graphs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4H</xref>), but no significant changes were observed at DIV21 and DIV28 compared to isoWT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4I and J</xref>). A trend toward reduced Tau13 levels in the isoHet neurons was observed, though it did not reach significance. In the isoHom S305N neurons, a ~40% reduction in Tau13 was observed at DIV21 and DIV28, while TauC and HT7 showed a trend toward reduced levels (~20% reduction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4H, I and J</xref>; Graphs on the left).

Given that TOC1-positive signal was detected at both timepoints, we next sought to monitor the longitudinal formation and progression of tau assemblies in live neurons. To accomplish this, we used the conformation-sensitive fluorescent dye pentameric formyl thiophene acetic acid (pFTAA), which selectively binds to β-sheet-rich protein aggregates, including both early tau oligomers and mature fibrils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.

In S305N_C1 neurons, pFTAA-positive puncta were first observed within axonal processes, identified by tubulin staining.

Quantitative analysis confirmed a steady increase in pFTAA signal in both isoHet and isoHom S305N neurons throughout the imaging period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>).

As both TOC1 and pFTAA can stain dying neurons, we co-stained with MAP2 to assess neuronal viability. Most pFTAA- and TOC1-positive neurons also stained positively for MAP2, suggesting they were still viable and part of the neuronal cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>).

These results demonstrate that tau assemblies in S305N neurons develop progressively over time, with isoHet and isoHom neurons exhibiting earlier and more extensive aggregate formation than S305N_C1.

Longitudinal quantification of Tyr-Tubulin levels showed a progressive decline in WT and isoWT neurons, consistent with the transition toward stable axonal architecture during maturation.

In WT and isoWT neurons, PolyE-Tubulin levels increased over time, consistent with the formation of stable microtubules. However, S305N_C1 neurons start presenting a decrease in PolyE-Tubulin from DIV14; this change was only significant at DIV28. On the other hand, the isoHet and isoHom S305N neurons had significantly lower levels of polyE-Tubulin from DIV24, and a change was only statistically significant in the isoHet line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7E, F</xref>).

To address this, we employed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to insert the HiBiT tag at the C-terminus of the MAPT gene in S305N_C1 iPSCs. HiBiT is an 11–amino acid peptide that allows sensitive luminescence-based detection of tagged proteins when complemented with LgBiT in a lytic luminescence assay. Successful integration and expression of HiBiT-tagged tau was confirmed by immunocytochemistry in methanol-fixed neurons using Tau13 and TauC antibodies, both of which colocalised with the HiBiT signal at DIV21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>). To optimise the assay, we treated neurons with a panel of compounds known to affect tau dynamics, including the autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Baf), the mTOR inhibitor KU-0063794 (KU), and the small molecule Anle138b, reported to inhibit tau aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. After 3 hours of treatment, Baf led to a 50% increase in HiBiT signal, while KU induced a slight reduction. These effects were more pronounced after 20 hours, with Baf significantly increasing tau levels by almost 2-fold and both KU and Anle138b showing a more than 30% reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>) compared to DMSO-treated cells.

Compounds that can prevent this or modulate the levels of tau overall may be therapeutically relevant. We therefore designed a dual readout platform combining the HiBiT luminescence assay with high-content imaging for phenotypic screening. This setup allows parallel assessment of compound effects on tau levels (via the lytic HiBiT assay), tau localisation (via TauC immunostaining) and cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>). To validate the platform, we treated S305N_C1 neurons with Baf or KU for 20 hours. TauC staining confirmed increased tau accumulation with Baf, including a potential increase in axonal tau, while KU treatment resulted in reduced tau staining, consistent with enhanced clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8D</xref>). Dose-response experiments with KU and Baf showed concentration-dependent modulation of the HiBiT signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8E and F</xref>), demonstrating the assay’s sensitivity and dynamic range. Notably, neither compound adversely affected cell viability under these conditions; in fact, high concentrations of KU slightly increased viability (~25%), suggesting a potential protective effect.

Prior lines, even those with splice-shifting mutations, only partially model human 4R tauopathies, lacking adequate 4R expression levels or the formation of endogenous seed-competent tau assemblies. It is worth noting that most current neuronal models require multiple tau mutations to increase 4R tau expression, which may limit their physiological relevance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The isoHet S305N line is particularly noteworthy as it recapitulates the 1:1 ratio of 3R:4R tau seen in normal adult human brain. Our data demonstrate that the homozygous S305N mutation in MAPT leads to a more than 75% increase in 4R tau, which is associated with alterations in tau expression, phosphorylation, aggregation, and downstream cellular pathways critical for neuronal homeostasis and microtubule stability (see Summary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). These findings expand our understanding of how the disease-associated FTLD-MAPTS305N mutation can perturb tau homeostasis and contribute to neurodegenerative processes. Clinically, S305N-linked FTLD-MAPT is associated with early-onset disease and rapid progression, and neuropathological studies have identified a predominance of 4R tau pathology, ring-shaped perinuclear tau aggregates, and neurofibrillary tangles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Our neuronal lines recapitulate much of this phenotype and represent an early stage of this pathogenic process.</p><p id="P30">We show that S305N_C1 and C2 neurons harbouring the S305N and the IVS10+3 mutations express very high levels of 4R tau throughout differentiation. This isoform imbalance at such an early stage in maturation is particularly noteworthy as proper neuronal development is thought to depend on regulating the expression of both 3R and 4R tau isoforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. High levels of 4R tau early on may disrupt key developmental processes, particularly axonogenesis and microtubule organization. Whether this predominance in 4R splicing occurs in humans expressing the S305N mutation during development is not known but it might represent an unusual pathway to tauopathy among the tauopathy-causing mutations. The observation of a marked reduction in total tau protein levels compared to isogenic controls is also significant, as it could exacerbate the destabilization of microtubules and impair axonal transport. The isoHom S305N, based mainly on the immunoblotting analysis, presents a similar phenotype to S305N_C1 neurons in this respect (reduced N-terminus total tau and changes in tubulin PTMs), but at later timepoints (after DIV21). As this is when the levels of 4R MAPT start to increase by more than 70%, the shift towards excessive 4R tau is implicated in altered protein turnover and destabilisation of the axons. Previous studies have shown that 4R tau isoforms have a quicker turnover rate in iPSC-derived neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, which may result in lower tau levels. This may be reflected in the model described here.</p><p id="P31">The levels of phosphorylated tau were significantly altered in the mutant neuronal lines, particularly in S305N neurons with the homozygous mutation. This was demonstrated by increased CP13 and/or AT8 immunoreactivity, despite overall reduced total tau levels. This suggests a disproportionate phosphorylation of tau, possibly reflecting an early pathological shift. Interestingly, a significant correlation was observed between 4R MAPT mRNA expression and CP13 levels at DIV28, with lower 4R expression associated with an intermediate phenotype and higher expression correlating with a more severe phenotype This dosage effect reinforces the pathogenic role of the S305N mutation and suggests that even partial loss of tau isoform balance can significantly affect neuronal health. We also observed differences in the distribution of the different phosphorylated tau epitopes, with AT100 only being detected in the axons and not in the somatodendritic compartment. The AT100 (pThr212/pSer214) phosphorylation sites are critical for modulating the ability of tau to bind and maintain microtubule stability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Phosphorylation of tau at Thr212/Ser214 is thought to play a role in the formation of pathological tau inclusions that accompany the disruption of the structural integrity of neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Tau hyperphosphorylation at the AT100 epitope may promote or indicate tau detachment from microtubules, increasing its propensity to form small soluble oligomers or insoluble aggregates, which could be toxic to neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. AT100 was increased at DIV28 in all neuronal lines harbouring the S305N mutation, independent of the amount of total tau, and at a timepoint when pFTAA positive signal was present and neurons had formed endogenous, seed-competent tau. The presence of increased AT100 immunoreactive tau in axonal compartments might indicate that tau oligomer formation is initiated there, and that tau seeds are then transported to the soma, where we see the highest accumulation of TOC1 immunoreactive tau and pFTAA. The reasonable timeframe and progressive nature of the tau pathology observed in these neuronal cell lines will make them a valuable tool for assessing the sequence of pathological events during the initial stages and early progression of 4R tauopathies. The appearance of TOC1-positive oligomeric tau, particularly in the perinuclear region and in MAP2-positive compartments, indicates the presence of aggregation-prone tau species. It is worth noting that similar structures are present in neurons in the cortex of human S305N brain tissue. Importantly, these changes were detected as early as DIV21, and their accumulation increased over time, as confirmed by both immunostaining and live imaging with pFTAA. Notably, we observed pFTAA-positive structures colocalizing with lysosomes, suggesting that pFTAA-positive tau assemblies resist degradation. The absence of tau labelling by MC1, a conformation-specific antibody recognising pathological tau, suggests that despite the accumulation of oligomeric tau, the formation of mature tangle-like pathology may require longer culture times or additional stressors present in the human brain.</p><p id="P32">The presence of tau seeds in DIV28 neuronal lysates, as shown by the biosensor assay, suggests that S305N neurons not only accumulate misfolded tau, but also generate seed-competent species capable of propagating pathology. The absence of seeding at DIV21, despite detectable TOC1 signal, implies a temporal progression from early oligomeric intermediates to seed-competent assemblies. It is worth also pointing out that generally the seeding signal is on the lower range, possibly due to quite low levels of tau in the neurons, which might make it difficult to identify small changes at DIV21. Our observations support a model where tau misfolding and phosphorylation precede the formation of seed-competent tau species. It is worth noting that isoHet S305N neurons present a trend towards higher TOC1, pFTAA, and seed-competency compared to isoHom S305N. Due to the high density of the i<sup>3</sup>N cultures, identifying pFTAA-positive puncta in axons is challenging. However, we did observe some puncta, most of which were located near nuclei or in the pre-axonal segments. Most of the pFTAA signal at DIV28 in fixed cells was observed in MAP2-positive areas and co-localised with TauC which indicates that it selectively identifies tau species in S305N mutant neurons.</p><p id="P33">Transcriptomic analysis revealed broad changes in gene expression, particularly in pathways related to axon guidance, vesicle trafficking, and synaptic function—key processes that are tightly coupled to microtubule dynamics and tau function. These transcriptomic alterations align with our morphological and biochemical data, including the presence of tubulin blebbing, reduced MAP2 levels, and reduced VGLUT1 expression, which highlight the functional consequences of tau dysregulation. Post-translational modifications of tubulin provide additional insight into the cellular impact. Elevated tyrosinated tubulin and reduced polyglutamylation in the neurons with more than 75% 4R tau suggest a shift toward a more dynamic, less stable microtubule network.

This system enables rapid, sensitive detection of endogenous tau levels, and offers the added benefit of compatibility with drug screening pipelines. Using the lytic assay, we validated the effects of known tau-modulating compounds. Bafilomycin A1 treatment increased HiBiT signal, reflecting tau accumulation, whereas KU-0063794 and Anle138b reduced tau levels in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. This system also allows phenotypic readouts through high-content imaging, enabling the identification of compounds that not only alter overall tau (C-terminus) levels, but also compounds that affect the subcellular localisation of different tau proteoforms, a key pathological feature in tauopathies and in our cell model. Notably, these lines are the first to report endogenous tau aggregate formation, an important target of therapeutics, which can be monitored longitudinally in these lines. Based on our results, expansion of the toolbelt of S305N mutant lines (including the development of a KOLF background line), or the refinement of the currently available S305N mutant human neuronal lines (for example, the addition of tags to the NCRAD lines) is now justified.</p><p id="P35">In conclusion, our study provides an insight into how the accumulation of 4R human tau caused by the S305N mutation disrupts the normal biological function of tau, leading to pathological changes including altered tau, increased phosphorylation and aggregation, impaired microtubule stability, and dysregulation of key neuronal pathways. Our findings not only underscore the multifaceted role of tau in neuronal development and maintenance but also highlight potential therapeutic targets for the earliest stages of tau pathogenesis, and they provide proof-of-concept data for an assay platform to screen them.</p><sec id="S13"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="P36">One limitation of our model is that we used the piggyBac system to introduce hNGN2 into the iPSC lines, which typically results in random integration into the genome. No karyotype abnormalities were observed, but there is still the possibility that hNGN2 could have disrupted some genes in these cells. Replicating some of these findings in either directly differentiated neurons or in iPSC lines where hNGN2 has been introduced into a safe-harbour location will further strengthen our understanding of how the S305N mutation affects neuronal differentiation and tau aggregation.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Resource availability</title><p id="P37">The data generated and/or analysed in this study are available from the authors upon request.

mutation via CRISPR-Cas9</title><p id="P38">For the generation of iPSC with a double mutation, S305N and IVS10+3 were generated by Synthego utilising one of their in-house iPSC lines (802:30F). Briefly, a single guide (GUACUCACACUGCCGCCUCC) was utilised to introduce both mutations by using their in-house CRISP-Cas9 editing protocol. Sanger sequencing was utilised to identify clones with homozygote double mutation. Consequently, one of the clones (Clone B11) carrying the double homozygote mutation was selected to knock in a HiBit tag in the C-terminus of <italic>MAPT</italic>. Two clones were provided (D4 and G8) from Synthego that contained the double mutant and the HiBiT tag (S305N_C1 and C2) as well as the mock transfected wild-type cells (WT).</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Culture of iPSC</title><p id="P39">iPSC on the 802:30F background were maintained in Geltrex (Thermo; A1413301) coated plates using mTeSR Plus (StemCell Technologies; 100-0276) and passaged using 0.5 mM EDTA (Thermo; 15575-020). Patient-derived iPSC on the 300.12 background were obtained from NCRAD. These cells were maintained in Matrigel (Corning, 354277) using mTeSR1 (StemCell Technologies; 85850) and passaged using ReLeSR (Stem Cell Technologies; 100-0483). All iPSC lines for this work were regularly tested for mycoplasma.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Stable integration of piggyBac plasmids into iPSCs</title><p id="P40">To generate stably expressing hNGN2-expressing iPSC we integrated a BFP-containing doxycycline-induced hNGN2 cassette using the piggyBac system. iPSCs were washed with PBS, dissociated with Accutase (Gibco; A1110501), and plated into coated plates (Geltrex or Matrigel) at 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells/well of a 6-well plate in mTeSR Plus or mTeSR1 containing 10 μM Y-27632 (Tocris; 1254/10). Once cells were attached, they were washed with PBS before being transfected with constructs containing the donor doxycycline-induced hNGN2 and BFP fluorescent reporter flanked by transposon terminal repeats and the piggyBac transposase. For the transfection 3 μg of total plasmid DNA was used (2:1 donor to transposase ratio), with Lipofectamine Stem (Thermo; STEM00008) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, media was changed and supplemented with 1 μg/mL puromycin for 3 days to select for cells that had successfully integrated the hNGN2. To obtain a pure population of cells with high levels of BFP expression from thorough cassette insertion, cells were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using BFP fluorescence. To ensure genomic stability, iPSCs were karyotyped by using low-coverage sequencing (UCL Genomics) with 1Mb resolution. All lines were also checked routinely for abnormalities by using the hiPSC Genetic Analysis Kit (Stem Cell Technologies, 07550).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>iPSC differentiation into cortical i<sup>3</sup>N neurons</title><p id="P41">Induction of iPSC into cortical neurons was initiated by dissociating cells in Accutase and plating 1x10<sup>6</sup> iPSC onto Geltrex (Synthego 802:30F lines) or Matrigel (NCRAD 300.12 lines) coated 6-well plates using DMEM/F-12 with Glutamax/Hepes (Thermo, 11330032) containing 2 μg/mL doxycycline (Sigma; D9891), 1X N2 Supplement (Thermo, 17502048), 1X non-essential amino acids (Thermo, 11140050) and 10 μM Y-27632. The media was replaced daily for the next 2 days with media without Y-27632. At day 3, induced cells were dissociated with Accutase and replated into plates double-coated with 0.1 mg/mL Poly-L-Ornithine (PLO; Sigma, P3655; 24 hours at 37°C) and 30 μg/mL Laminin (R&amp;D Systems, 3446-005-01; 24-72 hours at 37°C). Cells were plated into 6-well plates at 0.6x10<sup>6</sup> cells/well, 24-well plates at 0.125x10<sup>6</sup> cells/well, into 96-well Phenoplates (Revvity; 6055300) or white plates for Luminescence assays (Greiner, 655083) at 30,000 cells/well. Neuronal maturation media consisted of Neurobasal (Thermo, 21103049) media containing 1X B27 (Thermo, 17504044), 10 ng/mL brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, PeproTech, 450-02), 10 ng/mL neurotrophin-3 (NT-3, PeproTech, 450-03), 6-12 μg/mL Laminin, 2 μg/mLl doxycycline, and 1X CultureOne (Thermo, A3320201). Once a week, one-half of the media was replaced with fresh media until cells were collected.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Immunocytochemistry, imaging, and analysis</title><p id="P42">Human iPSCs were fixed with 4% methanol-free paraformaldehyde (Thermo; 28908) diluted in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and washed 3 times in DPBS (Thermo; 14190-094). Most of the i<sup>3</sup>N neurons were fixed with 100% methanol for 15 min at -20° C. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold DPBS. Cells were blocked/permeabilised with Intercept Blocking Buffer (LICOR; 927-60003) containing 0.1% Triton (Sigma; 93443) for 1 hour at room temperature. Primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer were added to the cells and incubated overnight at 4°C and then washed twice with DPBS. The following primary antibodies were used: chicken anti-MAP2 (1:2000, Novus; NB300-213), mouse anti-TUJ1/TUBB3 (1:2000, Biolegend; 801202), chicken anti-NeuN (1:500, Millipore; ABN9), mouse anti-Tau13 (N-terminus tau, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; sc-21796), mouse anti-HT7 tau (Mid-range tau, 1:1000, Invitrogen; MN1000), rabbit anti-TauC (C-terminus tau, 1:5000, Daco; A0024), mouse anti-AT8 (1:500, Invitrogen; MN1020), mouse anti-CP13 (1:500, Peter Davies), mouse anti-TOC1 (1:1000, Nicholas M.

Secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer, including goat anti-mouse, anti-rabbit or anti-chicken conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 568 or Alexa Fluor 647 (1:1000) as well as Hoechst (1:1000, Thermo; 33342) were added into the cells and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with DPBS.</p><p id="P43">Images were acquired with the high-content microscope Opera Phenix Plus (Revvity) by using the 40x water immersion objective with 12 fields of view per well and z-stack of 6 planes (0.5 μm per plane). Acquisition settings (exposure times and laser power) were adjusted to be above the camera background and kept below saturation levels. Imaging settings were kept the same between biological replicates.</p><p id="P44">Acquired images were analysed in Harmony 5.1. Briefly, a stack of each image was maximum projected and basic flatfield correction was applied. Cells were segmented by identifying the nuclei of live cells only (‘find nuclei building block’). ‘Find image region’ was used to identify tau or Tubulin in the imaged field. For antibodies where staining was localised in the soma, such as TOC1 or AT8, MAP2 was used to identify cytoplasm and consequently ‘find image region with absolute thresholding’ was used to identify the TOC1 positive area. In some cases, TOC1 stained dead cells, and a filter was applied to remove these areas during the analysis. Both intensity and area of the studied protein were calculated, and the results were normalised to the number of cells. Integrated intensity was calculated by multiplying the area by the mean intensity. Due to variation in the absolute values of the integrated intensity between biological replicates, Z-scoring was used instead. For each biological experiment, the Z-score was calculated with the formula <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Xi</mml:mtext><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mo>μ</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>σ</mml:mo></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where Xi is the value of the individual technical replicate, μ is the mean of all conditions for the specific biological experiment and σ is the standard deviation for all conditions for the specific biological experiment. Average Z-scores from different biological replicates were plotted in GraphPad Prism.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>pFTAA live imaging of i<sup>3</sup>N neurons and imaging analysis</title><p id="P45">To monitor pFTAA staining in i<sup>3</sup>N neurons, cells were grown until DIV25. Old media was aspirated, and cells were washed with fresh Neurobasal media without Phenol Red (Thermo; 12348017) containing 1X B27 (Thermo, 17504044), 10 ng/mL brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, PeproTech, 450-02), 10 ng/mL neurotrophin-3 (NT-3, PeproTech, 450-03), 6-12 μg/mL Laminin, 2 μg/mL doxycycline and 1X CultureOne (Thermo, A3320201) to remove dead cell from the culture. Fresh neuronal media containing 1.5 μM pFTAA (Sigma, SCT066) and 1:10000 Tubulin Tracker™ Deep Red (Thermo, T34077) was added and plates were incubated for 30 min before starting live imaging on the high-content microscope Opera Phenix Plus by using the 63x water immersion objective with 9 fields of view per well and z-stack of 6 planes (0.5 μm) with the environmental control enabled (5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 37° C and humidity). Images were acquired every 9 h for four continuous days. The pFTAA signal was detected by using 405nm/550nm Ex/Em filters and Tubulin at 647nm/665nm Ex/Em, BFP was also imaged as a nuclei marker (375nm/450nm Ex/Em, it is part of the hNGN2 plasmid). For experiments where we fixed cells after staining with pFTAA, a similar approach was followed; however, plates were maintained in the incubator before fixation with methanol and staining.</p><p id="P46">Acquired images were analysed in Harmony 5.1. Briefly, a stack of each image was maximum projected, and basic flatfield correction was applied. Live cells were identified by the ‘find nuclei’ (using the BFP channel) function, bead cells were filtered out using a different approach such as nuclei size and intensity. The cytoplasm of living cells was then identified using the tubulin channel (cytoplasm was only considered areas that had tubulin staining). ‘Find regions building block’ was used to identify pFTAA positive areas by using the absolute threshold option to make sure that we detected objects above background (600-700 was used as the lowest threshold). Objects where pFTAA was colocalised with dead cells were excluded from the analysis by filtering them out. Both pFTAA area and intensity were calculated and normalised to the number of live cells. Results are presented as integrated intensity, and data were plotted on GraphPad Prism.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Quantitative PCR (qPCR)</title><p id="P47">iPSCs samples for RNA extraction were collected by washing cells with PBS and dissociating cells with either EDTA or ReLeSa, spinning down at 300xg for 7 min at 4°C.

Samples were washed with PBS and the neuronal monolayer was collected on fresh PBS and spun down at 300xg for 7 min at 4°C, and pellets were stored at -80°C until RNA extraction was performed with ReliaPrep RNA Cell Miniprep System (Promega; Z6012). Extracted RNA was sent to Novogene (Cambridge, UK) where quality control was performed by using the Agilent 5400 to determine sample quantitation, integrity, and purity. mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. After fragmentation, the first strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers, followed by the second strand cDNA synthesis using dTTP for non-directional library, which was ready after end repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, size selection, amplification, and purification. Samples were sequenced in NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) with pair-end 100 cycles. Raw data (raw reads) of FASTQ format were first processed through in-house Perl scripts. In this step, clean data (clean reads) were obtained by removing reads containing adapter, reads containing ploy-N and low-quality reads from raw data. At the same time, Q20, Q30 and GC content of the clean data were calculated. All the downstream analyses were based on clean data with high quality. Reference genome and gene model annotation files were downloaded from the genome website directly. Index of the reference genome was built using Hisat2 v2.0.5. Reads were aligned to the reference human genome (GRCH38) using Hisat2 v2.0.5. featureCounts v1.5.0-p3 was used to count the reads mapped to each gene. And then FPKM of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and the reads count mapped to this gene. FPKM, expected number of Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript sequence per Millions base pairs sequenced, considers the effect of sequencing depth and gene length for the read count at the same time. Differential expression analysis of two groups (2-3 biological replicates per condition) was performed using the DESeq2 R package. The resulting P-values were adjusted using Benjamini and Hochberg’s approach for controlling the false discovery rate. Genes with an adjusted P-value &lt;=0.05 found by DESeq2 were assigned as differentially expressed. To find enriched annotations with the hot genes, gene ontology was performed using gProfiler (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost">https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost</ext-link>), where annotations of canonical pathways, biological processes, cellular compartments and molecular function were determined for the hit genes.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Immunoblot analysis</title><p id="P50">All iPSC lines were differentiated into neurons on 6-well plates and samples were collected at DIV7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, 28 post-induction. Briefly, cells were washed with DPBS once before adding RIPA (Thermo; 89900) buffer containing cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche; 11697498001) and PhosSTOP (Roche; 11697498001). Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min, centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4°C, and supernatants were collected. Samples for dephosphorylation assay were lysed in 50 mM Tris pH 7.6, 0.15 M NaCl, cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail. Protein concentration was determined by using Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo; 23227) for all lysates. Equal amount was loaded into 4-20% TGX Stain-Free gel (Bio-Rad; 5678094) or dephosphorylated with lambda-phosphatase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-200312A). Low-fluorescent PVDF-membranes (Bio-Rad; 1620264) was used to transfer the proteins and blocked with 5% milk in TBS-Tween (0.02% Tween). Primary antibodies were diluted in SuperBlock TBS blocking buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 37535) and incubated overnight at 4°C. The next primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-Tau13 (N-terminus tau, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; sc-21796), mouse anti-HT7 tau (Mid-range tau, 1:1000, Invitrogen; MN1000), rabbit anti-TauC (C-terminus tau, 1:5000, Daco, A0024), mouse anti- AT8 (1:500, Invitrogen, MN1020), mouse anti-CP13 (1:500, Peter Davies), rat anti-Tubulin (tyrosinated tubulin) (1:2000, Sigma; MAB1864), rabbit anti-PolyE tubulin (1:5000, gift from David Villaroel), anti-β- actin-FITC (Millipore, F3022). Incubation with AT8 antibody was not compatible with the TGX Stain-Free gel for that reason, 4-12% SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen, NP0321BOX) were used. Secondary HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibodies were diluted in 5% milk in TBS-Tween for 1 hour at room temperature. Chemiluminescence (BioRad) was used for detection of immunoblotting and bands were quantified by intensity using ImageLab (BioRad). For the current study all, blotted membranes were stripped by using PLUS Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Fisher, 10016433) for 12 min before incubating with a new primary antibody.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Sample preparation for seeding with i<sup>3</sup>N neurons</title><p id="P51">i<sup>3</sup>N neurons were plates into 6-well plates and samples for seeding were collected at DIV21 and DIV28.

Excitation wavelengths and emission filters were used as follows: YFP 488 nm, 527-530 nm, Hoechst: 375 nm, 435–480 nm. The acquired images were analysed in Harmony 5.2. Briefly, images were loaded as maximum projection and basic flatfield correction was applied. Cells were segmented by using the “find nuclei” building block using the Hoechst channel, consequently, “find cytoplasm” was identified by using the watershed of the Hoechst channel. The YFP positive tau inclusions were identified by using the “find spots” building block (method C) on the YFP channel. The analysis was exported, and the number of spots per nuclei was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>HiBiT Lytic detection assay and Viability assay</title><p id="P54">For the lytic assay, neurons were grown in white, Cellstar plates until DIV20 at 100 μl maintenance media.
