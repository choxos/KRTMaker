A deep understanding of this process can secure healthy growth at the early phases of plant development and therefore the yield. Recent research indicates that germination is a complex process involving translational regulation. A large group of seed stored mRNAs together with newly synthesized transcripts are regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms and selectively translated at different stages to support the germination process. To investigate the mechanism of translational control, we performed ribosome profiling on mRNAs of distinct physiological stages during <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> seed germination. The 3-nucleotide periodicity of the ribosome association on mRNAs identified indicates their translational potential. Dry seeds, in which translation is on hold are characterized by a unique ribosome association landscape with high association at the 5’ and 3’ UTR, compared to physiological stages that show active translation. Start codon specific stalling of ribosomes in dry seeds is associated with an adenine enriched sequence motif. Throughout germination codons encoding glycine, aspartate, tyrosine and proline are the most frequent ribosome pausing sites. Moreover, the non-coding RNAs which we identified as associated to ribosomes are indeed translated as was revealed by investigating total seed proteome data. Seed specific upstream Open Reading Frames (uORFs) are identified which may be associated to translational control of adaptative response during early seed germination. Altogether, we present a first ribosome profiling analysis across seed germination that illuminates various regulatory mechanisms that potentially contribute to the seeds survival strategy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Seeds are the primary structures responsible for plant propagation and the survival strategy of plant. During germination, the seed embryo develops into a seedling, which subsequently grows into a mature plant. In their fully matured state, seeds store large amounts of mRNA. The translation of these stored mRNAs is essential for germination to take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Rajjou et al., 2004</xref>). These stored mRNAs can survive for years, while still maintaining their capacity for translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dure and Waters, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Waters and Dure, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Yashina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sano et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, stored mRNAs are predominantly associated with monosomes, single ribosome units, that are not actively involved in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bai et al., 2020</xref>). When dry seeds take up water, translation of monosome-associated transcripts is initiated. As more ribosomes bind to a single mRNA molecule, a polysome is formed, allowing multiple proteins to be synthesized simultaneously from a single mRNA. This process is strongly regulated and referred to as the Hydration Translational Shift (from dry seeds until 6 hours after seed imbibition). A second translational shift occurs around the moment that the seed embryonic root (radicle) breaks through its surrounding layers, the testa and the endosperm, and is referred to as the Germination Translational Shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bai et al., 2017</xref>). The translational shifts referred to indicate a change in translational efficiency (TE), e.g. the proportion of ribosome bound mRNA over total mRNA, a ratio used to evaluate the extent of translation for specific mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Juntawong et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The fate (synthesis, translation or degradation) of ribosomes on a transcript is influenced by interactions between the ribosome and mRNA sequence features such as the 5’ Untranslated Region (5’ UTR), upstream Open Reading Frames (uORFs) and the 3 ’ Untranslated Region (3 ’ UTR). Therefore, accurately determining the position of the ribosome on stored mRNAs in seeds can provide insights into the state of mRNA storage and their fate during seed germination when the translation is reactivated. Information about the ribosome position on the mRNA can be revealed by ribosome profiling. Deep sequencing of ribosome protected mRNA fragments (ribosome footprint, RP) identifies the position of the ribosome on the RNA molecules. This technique has been extensively used across various species, including yeast, bacteria, Archaea, Drosophila, and plants, to investigate translational control in response to environmental stimuli and during developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hsu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gelsinger et al., 2020</xref>). In crop seeds ribosome profiling has been used to study translational control during seed maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Guo et al., 2023</xref>) and to study tissue specific translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Sequence features such as the length of the UTRs, GC content and RNA structure are associated with mRNA translational efficiency in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bai et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, uORFs that are located in the 5’ UTR of some eukaryotic mRNAs, upstream of the main ORF (mORF) are known to regulate translation. These uORFs can cause stalling or releasing of the ribosome from the mRNA and thereby inhibit translation of the mORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Meijer and Thomas, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Wiese et al., 2004</xref>). The uORFs translational control mechanism is conserved, across multiple plant species the interaction between the uORF encoded peptides and metabolites, such as sucrose, polyamine, thermospermine and other metabolites, have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">van der Horst et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In addition to mRNAs, eukaryotic cells contain a substantial number of non-protein coding RNAs. Among these, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined a transcript longer than 200 nt that either lack an ORF entirely or do not contain an ORF encoding more than 100 amino acids. LncRNAs are known to play important regulatory roles in plants. For example some have been shown to encode functional peptides that are associated with plant morphogenesis and stress-induced plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bazin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). The majority of lncRNAs are transcribed by RNA Polymerase II and contain typical mRNA-like features, such as 5’m7G cap and a 3’poly (A) tail. Therefore, lncRNAs are processed in the same way as mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). LncRNAs are characterized by a lower conservation and abundance, more tissue-specific expression, and lower splicing efficiency than mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Ulitsky and Bartel, 2013</xref>). Over a thousand lncRNA are identified as associated with ribosome which indicates they have the potential to be translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bazin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To obtain a better understanding about translational regulation during seed germination we performed ribosome profiling (ribosome footprinting, Ribo-seq). We characterize the features and dynamics of the ribosome associated mRNAs in both dry seeds and during seed germination. Moreover, we utilize transcriptome-wide ribosome position maps across the course of seed germination to explore the function of uORF mediated translational control and to identify lncRNAs with a translation potential.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Seed Material Preparations</title><p id="P7">Seeds of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> accession Columbia-0 (NASC N60000) were used for ribosome profiling.

These time-points correspond to the physiological stages: dry seeds, seeds at early imbibition, seeds before testa rupture, seeds at 80% of endosperm rupture and 80% of seedling greening. These stages were shown to exhibit extensive translation dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bai et al, 2017</xref>). Transcriptome-wide ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) was performed at a depth of ~100 million reads per sample. Reads mapping to rRNA and tRNA, an unmapped reads were removed. Reads mapping to non-coding RNAs were stored as a separate dataset for further analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). About 10% of the total number of reads per sample mapped to an mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). Periodic patterns in the RNA sequence strongly indicate ribosome attachment, as ribosomes advance along the RNA in increments corresponding to three nucleotides (codons). A strong 3-nt periodicity was found for reads or ribosome footprints (RF) in the size range between 27-nt and 29-nt. In dry, 6 and 26 HAI seeds the 28-nt RFs are most pronounced, whereas at the later time-points during seed germination the 29-nt RFs become more pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). The -12-nt and +15-nt position marked the ribosome extremities at the 5’ and 3’ respectively at the start codon context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). At the stop codon, in addition to the 3-nt periodicity we also observe footprints in the +1 reading frame, both at the 5’ and 3’ ribosome extremities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a and b</xref>), suggesting a ribosomal frameshift. The ribosome P-site serves as a reliable reference point for ribosome positioning, since the start codon is aligned with the P-site during translation initiation. In order to further validate the genuine RFs, the P-site position was visualized across the up- and down-stream sequences of start and stop codon context. Like the ribosome extremity plot, the ribosome P-site metaplot also shows a clear periodic distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). This periodic P-site signal was identified in the CDS at all physiological stages including a strong general peak at the start codon and a smaller peak at the 5<sup>th</sup> codon position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a,b</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 2</xref>), indicative of initiation and post-initiation translational pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Han et al., 2014</xref>).

Strikingly, in dry seeds ~7% of the total mapped reads were positioned at start codon, this corresponds to 40% of the reads that are positioned at the P-site of the ribosome in the displayed region of the metaprofile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). This is significantly higher than in the other stages (~1%-2% for 6-72 HAI; t-test, <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 3</xref>), corresponding to 10-20% of the reads that are positioned at the P-site of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Summing up all the RFs across the transcripts, 92.3% of the RFs in dry seeds mapped to protein-coding sequences (CDSs), 3.57% to 5′ UTRs, and 4.13% to 3′ UTRs, while at other time points ~96%-98% of the RFs mapped to CDSs, ~1.9-2.3% to 5′ UTRs, and ~0.8%-1% 3′ UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 2, 3</xref>), indicating a reduced ribosome loading in CDS and an increased loading in both 5’ and 3’ UTRs in dry seeds compared to other physiological stages (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.05).</p><p id="P19">The strength of ribosome association can be influenced by the codons encountered during translation. To identify the codon that contributes the most to ribosome pausing (temporary halting of the ribosome during the process of translation), the codon usage index was computed based on the in-frame P-site position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). In dry seeds, ribosomes were paused mainly at the start codon followed by codons encoding glycine (G), aspartate (D) and tyrosine (Y). Interestingly, ribosomes in dry seeds were also partially paused at stop codons, especially at the UAG codon (codon usage index=0.13, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 4</xref>), which might reflect an incomplete translation termination. At 6 HAI, ribosomes were associated most frequently with the start codon followed by codons for glycine (G), proline (P) and aspartate (D), while the ribosome occupancy at the stop codon was strongly reduced at this stage. From 26 HAI onwards, as germination progressed and translation become fully activate, the start codon was no longer the primary ribosome pausing site. Instead, codons for glycine (G), aspartate (D), tyrosine (Y) and proline (P) emerged as the most frequent codon pausing positions. Although no stalling at the stop codon was identified, likely because only the P-site position was analysed, a distinct peak was observed 4 nucleotides upstream of the stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). This feature has been reported previously and likely corresponds to RNA compaction during translation termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Brown et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Heyer and Moore, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Translational features of start codon enriched genes in dry seeds</title><p id="P20">Dry seeds show a dominant RF peak at the start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a-c</xref>), which maps to 176 genes with enriched ribosome occupancy at their start codons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 5</xref>). Gene Ontology analyses showed that these genes are enriched for biological functions with terms as seed oil body biosynthesis, lipid storage and seed maturation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 6</xref>). When investigating the translational behaviour of these genes, two distinct groups were identified. The first group consists of genes that are enriched for RFs at the start codon in dry seeds, but show a marked depletion at 6 HAI. Examples include genes encoding oil body-associated proteins and Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins. Their transcripts are known to accumulate during maturation and are likely degraded immediately upon imbibition, consistent with their reduced transcript level during germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a-b</xref>). The second group includes genes that also show RF enrichment at the start codon in dry seeds, but exhibit increased ribosome occupancy in their CDS upon imbibition (6 HAI). Their transcript abundance reduces sharply upon further imbibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). These genes include seed storage protein genes. The accumulation of seed storage proteins during seed maturation indicates that the translation of these transcripts starts already during seed maturation and continues during early imbibition. These two modes of ribosome association pattern may represent different fates for seed stored mRNAs with varying function during seed germination.</p><p id="P21">To investigate whether there is a sequence basis for ribosome pausing at the start codon, the sequence context surrounding the AUG start codon of the 176 start codon enriched genes was analysed for motif enrichment. This analysis revealed the motif AAAGAUGG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>), whose nucleotide composition differs significantly from background sequences at positions -3, -2 and +4 relative to the adenine of the start codon. Specifically, positions -3 and -2 are enriched for adenine, while position +4 shows increased guanine and reduced adenine and uracil (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 7</xref>).

Comparing the differentially expressed genes between consecutive timepoints, we find a large overlap between the RNA-seq used in this study and the previously published microarray results, indicating the robustness of cross-platform translatome profiling during seed germination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). At the translational level, the overlap is considerably lower, likely due to methodological differences: the earlier study employed polysome profiling while the Ribo-seq used here also captures monosomes.</p><p id="P23">The sequencing-based method used in this study allowed us to explore ribosome association with non-coding RNAs such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) during seed germination.

To further investigate the coding potential of these identified lncRNA in seeds, both Ribo-seq and RNA-seq detected lncRNAs were investigated for the presence of ORFs. These analyses revealed that 463 lncRNAs expressed during seed germination contain a predicted ORF, among which 25 lncRNAs were found to be under translational control at distinct physiological stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental table 11</xref> and 12). To validate the translation potential of the ORF containing lncRNAs, the predicted peptide sequences encoded by their ORFs were used for peptide discovery (using Proteome Discoverer (PD) 2.4 SP1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA)). The proteomic data for these analyses was obtained from a total proteome analysis that was performed on the same germination time-points as those analysed in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bai et al., 2021</xref>). In total, 50 out of 426 lncRNA-encoded peptides were identified in the seed total proteome during germination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental table 13</xref>), providing strong evidence that the ORFs within these lncRNA are translated and may play a functional role during seed germination.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>uORFs impact the translation of main ORFs during seed germination</title><p id="P24">uORFs are known to regulate the translation of their downstream main ORF (mORF) by interrupting ribosome scanning during translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Meijer and Thomas, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Yamashita et al., 2017</xref>).

Globally, RF changes at uORFs agree with the changes at the mORF, suggesting that the majority of genes are not translationally regulated by their uORFs.

From the metaprofile, <italic>ALPHA/BETA-HYDROLASES (ABH) SUPERFAMILY PROTEIN</italic> (AT5G36210) uORF is associated with the ribosome in dry seeds while upon imbibition at 6 HAI, the concurrent decrease (<italic>p</italic>-value = 1.24E10<sup>-5</sup>) of uORF associated ribosome and increase (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.04) of mORF associated ribosome indicates that ribosome was likely stalled in the dry seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental table 13</xref>).

However, upon further imbibition at 26 HAI, the uORF associated RFs start to decrease, corresponding to an increase of its mORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>), exhibiting a development dependent uORF mediated translation regulation of its downstream genes. The trade-off between the RFs on uORF and mORF upon germination was also seen in other stages at 26-48 HAI and 48-72 HAI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3g and f</xref>).

The evidence so far that translation of these stored mRNAs is essential and sufficient for seed germination lies in the fact that a translation inhibitor such as cycloheximide can completely inhibit germination while a transcription inhibitor cannot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Rajjou et al., 2004</xref>). Dry seeds are translationally inert, following water uptake during seed imbibition the translational machineries are quickly activated. This results in an increase in the number of ribosomes that are associated to transcripts during seed germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bai et al., 2017</xref>). Understanding this pattern of ribosome association can provide mechanistic insight into seed germination control. By deep sequencing ribosome-protected fragments at five distinct physiological stages of seed germination, we generated a detailed ribosome occupancy profile of this developmental process at single codon resolution. In dry seeds, and at 6 and 26 HAI seeds 28-nt sized ribosome footprints are most pronounced. In contrast at later germination stages the 29-nt footprints that have been previously reported for Arabidopsis, become more prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bazin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gelsinger et al., 2020</xref>; Glaub et al., 2020).</p><p id="P26">The position of ribosome association on an mRNA transcript is pivotal for its translational outcome, since the regions such as the 5’ UTR, the CDS and the 3’ UTR have distinct roles in regulating translation. In dry seeds, ribosome association is significantly higher in both the 5’UTR and 3’UTR compared to germination stages, suggesting a higher proportion of untranslated mRNAs. This pattern is consistent with the absence of translation in dry seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b, c</xref>). Based on previous reports showing that transcripts in dry seeds are predominantly associated with monosomes, we conclude that a ribosome on a given transcript it typically associated with either the 5’ UTR or 3’ UTR, but not both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bai et al., 2020</xref>). Upon imbibition, the translation of stored mRNAs follows two distinct patterns. Transcripts are either translationally down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a, b</xref>) or up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c,d</xref>), as indicated by changes in the RF distribution along transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a, b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). These two translational trajectories in seeds correspond to two hypotheses regarding the fate of seed-stored mRNA respectively. 1) Downregulated upon germination: This group includes mRNAs that are actively translated during seed maturation, but degraded upon germination. Examples include transcripts encoding LEAs and seed oil body associated proteins involved in seed filling. This pattern likely represents the gene expression program during seed maturation, where mRNA translation is gradually attenuated towards the end of development, resulting in the complete loss of translational activity in dry seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bai et al., 2023</xref>). 2) Upregulation upon germinations: These are mRNAs that encode proteins required during early seed germination, such as seed storage proteins. These transcripts accumulate during seed maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Baud et al., 2008</xref>) and have been associated with the establishment of seed desiccation tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Terrasson et al., 2013</xref>). Upon imbibition, they become translationally active which is in agreement with the observation that storage proteins are synthesized during early germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Rajjou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Galland et al., 2014</xref>). The translation of seed stored mRNAs at early stages of seed imbibition might have ecological advantages. Early imbibition reflects a period in which seeds can still tolerate desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Maia et al., 2011</xref>), therefore the translation of these seed maturation and stress response proteins could help tolerating recurrent hydration-dehydration cycles. Moreover, seed storage proteins have been reported as “buffering proteins” for protection against oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). Their translation might be required for maintaining seed vigour in adverse environments, to increase to chance of seedling survival. This stress surveillance mechanism is specific for seeds before testa rupture and coincides with the stage at which seeds do not tolerate desiccation anymore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Maia et al., 2011</xref>). After this stage the transcript abundance and translation of seed storage proteins are sharply reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Ribosome stalling during protein translation has significant biological roles, for instance to provide enough time for molecular processes like nascent peptide folding, and the recruitment of signal recognition particles for ER targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Tanner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Nyathi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bui and Hoang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Mercier et al., 2017</xref>). The amino acids glycine, aspartate, tyrosine and proline provide the codons for ribosome pausing during seed germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). This is consistent with previous observations showing that proline, glycine and aspartate are the most conserved amino acids associated with ribosome stalling in yeast, fruit fly, zebrafish, mouse and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chyzynska et al., 2021</xref>). Ribosome stalling also frequently occurs at aromatic amino acids tyrosine (also identified during seed germination, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1c</xref>), phenylalanine and tryptophan in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cymer et al., 2015</xref>). The detection of the context sensitive Kozak consensus sequence that contributes to the ribosome pausing at the start codon in dry seeds suggests a potential sequence-based signal for ribosome stalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). Although the increased frequency of A residues at -2 and -3 position of Kozak consensus sequence in these seed stored mRNAs may explain ribosome pausing at the start codon, the mechanism and functional relevance of this pausing specifically for these transcripts remains to be discovered. It has been shown that A residues at position -1 to -5 are required for high-level translational efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the increased frequency of A residues at -2 and -3 might contribute to the ribosome pausing in these transcripts. In addition, the high frequency of the G residue at the +4 position constrains the choice of the codon following the start codon, favouring codons beginning with G. This constraint may further increase selectivity for the peptides encoded by these mRNAs.</p><p id="P28">The identified Kozak consensus sequence in start codon enriched transcripts likely mediates a Kozak motif-dependent translational control in seeds. This is consistent with the strong ribosome peak observed at start codon in dry seeds, which sharply reduces upon water uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Moreover, these findings align with the high polysome association of these transcripts during seed maturation and their reduced association during early germination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). Kozak motif-dependent translational control has also been reported for photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hang et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting that this mechanism may play a broader role in regulating translation in plants.</p><p id="P29">lncRNAs have been historically regarded as non-coding RNA based on their size and coding potential. However, there is increasing evidence that lncRNAs can encode short peptides that play roles in transcriptional regulation, splicing and protein scaffolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bazin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Sebastian-delaCruz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Wu et al., 2024</xref>). Moreover, the lncRNA encoded small peptide microRPG1 plays a key role in controlling maize seed desiccation through mediating ethylene signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Yu et al., 2024</xref>). In this study, we have identified over a thousand of lncRNA that are associated with ribosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental table 11</xref>). The identification of peptides that are encoded by lncRNA ORFs provides strong evidence that these lncRNAs are translated during seed germination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental table 13</xref>), which might add an additional layer of gene expression control during seed germination. Not all ribosome-associated lncRNAs contain an ORF which could allow them to generate peptides, however for these lncRNAs a regulatory role during translation cannot be excluded. Although largely unannotated, lncRNAs have been reported to play a role in regulating seed germination, with examples like as <italic>asDOG1</italic> and TE-lincRNA11195 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Yatusevich et al., 2017</xref>). These unexplored resources of ribosome associated lncRNA opens up a plethora of possibilities to understand the translational regulation in seeds.</p><p id="P30">Translation can also be regulated by uORFs. Well-studied examples in plants are the Conserved Peptide uORF (CPuORF) of the group S basic region leucine zippers (S1 bZIPs), which mediate Sucrose-Induced Repression of Translation (SIRT). SIRT confers the gene expression regulation of the S1 bZIP ATB2/AtbZIP11 upon sucrose treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Rook et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Wiese et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">van der Horst et al., 2020</xref>). The interaction between uORF-encoded peptides and the ribosome exit tunnel, where the nascent peptide is released on the ribosome, has been shown to regulate the ribosomal arresting, which causes the ribosome stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Yamashita et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, uORFs that regulate gene expression at the translational level were identified. For example, the translation of the uORF of ALPHA/BETA-HYDROLASES (ABH) SUPERFAMILY PROTEIN gene (AT5G36210) in dry seeds represses the translation of the ABH mORF, whereas at 6 HAI the repression is attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental table 13</xref>). The function of the ABH family protein during germination remains unknown, however the ABH domain can serve as a core component in the perception of gibberellin, strigolactone and karrikin, which are known to promote seed germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Shimada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Guo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hernandez-Garcia et al., 2021</xref>). This uORF-mediated gene expression attenuation can also occur upon imbibition, as observed for DET3 (AT1G12840) where increased ribosome association with the uORF correlates with reduced ribosome association with the mORF from dry to imbibed seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a, e</xref>). This uORF-mediated repression is specific to 6 HAI, by 26 HAI the ribosome association with the uORF reduces, coinciding with an increase in mORF ribosome association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b, c, f</xref>). Development dependent uORF control of gene expression is seen in all stages during germination, which fine-tunes gene expression regardless of their transcript level. uORF mediated translational control has been described as key in fast adaptive response to environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chen and Tarn, 2019</xref>). Instant gene expression control during seed imbibition is essential to regulate germination, ensuring it only occurs under conditions that are optimal for seedling establishment.</p><p id="P31">In conclusion, this study provides the first translational landscape at sub-codon resolution across seed germination and identified different mechanisms that may regulate translation during seed germination. The RFs in all germination stages showed <italic>bona fide</italic> ribosome association and substantial ribosome dynamics. In dry seeds, we found relative high ribosome association with the 5’ and 3’ UTRs, and low association with the CDS, compared to later stages of seed germination where association predominates in the CDS. This finding corresponds to the changes in translational status during seed germination. Translation of lncRNAs is supported by their ribosome association as well as the identification of their encoded peptides. The function of these peptides in seed germination has yet to be elucidated. Finally, novel uORFs, that might adjust translation of the mORF, were identified. We propose that the various mechanisms of translational control during seed germination are crucial for enabling rapid responses to environmental changes, thereby ensuring the survival of the germinating seeds and contributing to the seed’s role in the plant’s overall survival strategy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS207024-supplement-Supplemental_tables.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d41aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS207024-supplement-Supplementary_figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d41aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work is part of the research domain Applied and Engineering Sciences, project number 15228, which is financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO).

Heatmaps display aggregate ribosome occupancy based on the 5’ end (top panels) and 3’ end (bottom panels) of ribosome-protected fragments (RFs), aligned relative to annotated start and stop codons. Signals are shown for RFs of 27, 28 and 29 nt in length across five stages of germination: dry seeds and seeds at 6, 26, 48 and 72 hours after imbibition (HAI). For the dry seed panels, a schematic ribosome is superimposed on the plots. The E, P and A site position and the distance of the P-site to the start and stop codon are indicated to illustrate ribosome positioning (b) Metaprofile of ribosome occupancy displaying the relative abundance of P-sites around the start and the stop codon of annotated CDSs (fragment lengths, 27-29 nt combined) during seed germination.

Asterisk indicate the significance comparing percentages of in dry seeds compared to all other stages (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) (d) Codon usage based on in-frame P-sites during seed germination. The codon usage index is calculated as the frequency of in-frame P-site positions associated with each codon along CDSs, normalized for codon frequency. For the most frequent codons, their corresponding amino acid is displayed above each bar. The blue and red bars represent the start and stop codons respectively.
