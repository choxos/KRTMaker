Reliably demonstrating this <italic>in utero</italic> using fMRI remains a very challenging problem due to a variety of MRI-adverse factors, including distant coil positioning and motion-induced magnetic field perturbations. Here, we introduce a novel approach to functional network analysis, called seed-based functional covariance modes (FCMs), which leverages inter-subject variability in connectivity between seed regions and the rest of the brain to infer whole-brain network configurations. We first applied the FCMs approach to neonatal data to benchmark it against group-level independent component factorisation - a standard in fMRI network analysis - and found a high degree of concordance between the results produced by the two methods. We then applied it to the fetal data, where the standard approach has consistently failed to reveal spatially distributed networks. For the first time, and despite fundamental differences in signal characteristics between fetal and neonatal data, we detected network-like patterns with high spatial correspondence to neonatal functional networks. In particular, the FCMs approach efficiently recovered interhemispheric connections, a landmark feature of neonatal functional networks. Systematic organisation of interhemispheric fetal networks was observed; they tended to cluster along the brain midline but also were present in lateral sensorimotor and temporal areas as well as cortical limbic territories in ventral orbitofrontal cortex and temporal pole. By aligning fetal and neonatal connectomes, this study represents a crucial step towards supporting the biological veracity of observations made using fetal fMRI. Meanwhile, the concordance between FCMs and independent component factorisation in neonates prompts a re-evaluation of how inter-individual variability contributes to network structure inference in methods that ostensibly emphasise shared correlation patterns across subjects.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fetal and neonatal fMRI</kwd><kwd>functional covariance</kwd><kwd>network analysis</kwd><kwd>perinatal functional brain connectivity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Multiple lines of evidence suggest that that brain functional networks first emerge very early in human development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Observations of functional network organisation using fMRI at birth reveal a tendency for networks to show a near-symmetrical organisation across the brain hemispheres or to include a non-negligible node in the opposite hemisphere in networks with a predominantly unilateral spatial layout <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. These findings are corroborated by histological<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and structural connectivity studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> demonstrating the arrival at the cortical plate of collateral afferent thalamic inputs and the earliest callosal fibres, linking homologous regions across hemispheres, by the third trimester <italic>in utero</italic>.</p><p id="P3">A growing body of <italic>in utero</italic> fMRI studies has suggested that functional connectivity features characteristic of the neonatal brain may also be present before birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. However, reliably demonstrating this using fMRI remains a very challenging problem due to the difficulties associated with performing robust imaging studies with small, moving, and rapidly developing fetal brains. Independent Component Analysis (ICA), a widely used and powerful data-driven blind source separation tool for extracting spatial maps of resting-state networks in the ex-utero brain, has yet to demonstrate robust inter-regional connectivity features in the in-utero brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Spatial maps obtained with this or related methods are typically limited to isolated anatomical regions. A potential biological source of the ICA-derived differences in network estimates between fetuses and neonates may be the dramatic differences in brain physiology at these timepoints. The fetus is dependent on the placenta for life support and has a distinctive circulation which bypasses the lungs. Stimulation from the external environment is also attenuated. Birth is marked by the transition to autonomous functions, supporting air breathing and autonomous blood circulation, as well as the sudden experience of the full effect of gravity. This potentially could result in an adaptational shift in brain function at or following birth. However, the change in physiological state coincides with the a change in how the brain is observed when imaging a fetus in the womb versus a sleeping neonate, which undermines our capacity to differentiate real maturational differences from apparent ones, due to methodological limitations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. This creates ambiguity as to whether the fetal brain genuinely lacks long-distance connections, or if current fetal fMRI acquisitions and analysis methods are insufficiently sensitive to detect such networks.</p><p id="P4">To address this, we need analytic methods which are designed to accommodate the unique demands of the imaging the fetal brain but which can also be used for the neonatal brain. If the method recapitulates the network organisation of the neonatal brain observed using established methods, then we can have confidence it is valid. If it also exposes a similar organisation in the fetal brain, we can also be more confident that these are real fetal functional connectivity patterns, which are established prenatally and mirrored in the neonate after birth.</p><p id="P5">A key characteristic of the fetal period is the rapid transformation in all bodily functions occurring on a weekly if not daily basis. In the past, we proposed an approach that embraces inter-individual variability by leveraging cross-sectional age-related differences to infer maturational functional network properties in the fetal brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. This method, called matnets, allowed us to uncover a broader range of spatially distributed patterns and improve anatomical specificity of the mapped functional networks. Building on this, in the present paper we introduce a simple and computationally inexpensive approach, that utilises full-scale inter-individual variability in brain’s functional connectivity features to create a statistical contrast that would enable inference on the whole-brain network configuration. Given its design, this approach is called seed-based functional covariance modes (FCMs) and belongs to a broader class of models, known as “functional covariance networks”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">FCMs derivation comprises 4 steps: 1) computing seed-to-brain correlation maps in native fMRI space, 2) projecting maps into a template space; 3) concatenation of individual maps into a 4D volume (aka “subject-series”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>) and 4) independent component factorisation to obtain spatial maps representing functional networks. It also has two free parameters: 1) dimensionality (i.e., the desired number of components) of factorisation, that pertains to a trade-off between the discovery of new patterns and breaking into sub-parts the ones that were observed using lower dimensionality of factorisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and 2) seed location that pertains to interpretation of the results. Conceptually, computing the seed-based correlations can be compared to the injection of a contrast agent to enable observations. Consequently, the question is whether the seed in this metaphor stands for a “contrast agent” or an “injection site”. The former would uniquely define the observed patterns; if it were the case, then the seed-based FCMs could have an intriguing application for studying network patterning associated with a specific region in the brain. The latter would imply that the correlation maps computed using different seeds contain shared information; the choice of the seed may reflect varying sensitivity to detecting some patterns over the other but not be uniquely determined by this.</p><p id="P7">Using the openly available resource of perinatal fMRI data from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, we first test the FCM method using the neonatal dataset which allows us to evaluate its performance against the standard group-ICA factorisation, work out the correct interpretation its results, and define a strategy for enhancing its power. With this, we turn to the fetal dataset and demonstrate a range of spatially distributed functional associations in the <italic>in utero</italic> brain, which align with the previously identified neonatal networks and known system-level principles of functional organisation before birth.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Neonatal dataset</title><p id="P8">We start with assessment of FCMs performance in neonates, where previous standard (group-ICA) analyses demonstrated a range of spatially distributed networks that could be used to benchmark FCMs performance. Here we used a subset of the neonatal dHCP dataset of 311 neonates of nearly-symmetrically distributed age around the sample mean of around 37.5 gestation weeks, approximately matching age of the oldest subjects in the fetal sample<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">We start with the assessment of the FCMs computed using left thalamus as a seed. Two choices of dimensionality (<italic>d</italic>) of factorisation, <italic>d</italic> = 25 and <italic>d</italic> = 40, were explored. The results of group-ICA factorisation with <italic>d</italic> = 25, reported in Karolis et al.,2023, were used for initial comparisons. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> these group-ICA (gica) maps are shown with the best matching <italic>d</italic> = 25 and <italic>d</italic> = 40 FCMs. All FCMs maps are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 1 and 2</xref>; these and all other maps reported below are also available on the online resource associated with the paper, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Data Availability Statement</xref>. To aid assessment of the maps’ spatial layout, in particular the location of their centres-of-mass/highest values, visualisation of every spatial map in this report is scaled between <italic>z</italic> &gt; 3 and its maximum value.</p><p id="P10">The two approaches show a very good match between many spatial patterns they identify, demonstrating that the seed-based FCM provide a veridical representation for the neonatal group-level networks if gica maps are taken as a benchmark. These includes not only patterns which are good candidates for representing the neurally determined connectivity patterns but also patterns likely to be driven by other physiological effects including vascular signal (cf. patterns paired with gica 14, 17, 22, 24).</p><p id="P11">Several qualitative differences appear to stand out following a visual inspection. Firstly, group-ICA factorisation tended to produce spatially smoother maps and a greater tendency to align along the sulcal grooves; seed-based FCMs tended to be more anatomically focused (which is particularly seen in lateral occipital and lateral prefrontal cortices, where group-ICA tended to produce widely spread but anatomically non-specific maps, gica 19 &amp; 20) but also tended to be more sensitive to noise, manifested by both their “noisier” spatial distribution (i.e., with isolated, non-clustered voxels scattered across the brain while capturing the core network nodes) and larger number of the components (approximately, 50%) that can be unambiguously classified as of structured noise or vascular origin. Secondly, both <italic>d</italic> = 25 and <italic>d</italic> = 40 FCMs have a greater propensity of collateral patterns, i.e., spatial maps that are near-symmetrically distributed between left and right hemispheres. Thirdly, we also observed that <italic>d</italic> = 40 FCMs appear to show a better decoupling from the signal background (more focused spatial distribution) than <italic>d</italic> = 25 FCMs without losing the distributed spatial characteristics observed in gica maps. Considering all above, the choice of <italic>d</italic> = 40 offers a potential advantage compared to <italic>d</italic> = 25 for FCMs.</p><p id="P12">Next, in several analyses, we assessed the “injection site” vs “contrast agent” hypotheses. Firstly, we found that using the right thalamus as a seed rendered comparable results to those for left thalamus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 3 and 4</xref>). Given that left and right thalami can be closely related in the functional organisation of the brain, and consequently, reveal similarities in their correlation maps, we further repeated the analyses using seeds in the left cerebellum and left lateral ventricle. Cerebellum-based FCMs rendered a range of spatial maps that were similar to thalamus-based FCMs and gica maps but tended to show a greater number of noisy maps, especially at <italic>d</italic> = 40 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 5 and 6</xref>). Several matching networks could be also observed for ventricle-based FCMs, even though their quality was compromised by a prominent bias towards CSF areas in many of them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 7 and 8</xref>), including those that were closely matching the FCMs from a brain-tissue seed, apparently reflecting signal leakages due to partial voluming.</p><p id="P13">The conclusion of the above analyses is that the metaphor of injection site rather than of a contrast agent reflects better the selection of the seed in FCMs. This suggests that combining several seeds in the analyses can re-enforce repeating patterns in the correlational structure and thereby boost the power of factorisation. In other words, we can use multiple “injection sites” to provide a better coverage and re-enforcement of the persistent patterns, which can potentially be important factor when approaching data with inherently low SNR characteristics, such as in-utero fMRI.</p><p id="P14">To assess this possibility, we computed multiregional FCMs (mrFCMs), using left and right thalamus and cerebellum together as seeds. Maps for the left part of each anatomical structure were left-right mirrored and the averages between the right and mirrored left maps were computed. (Note that these maps become left-right equivalent). Tensor ICA concatenation, as implemented in melodic FSL, was used to combine the left-right average maps for thalamus and cerebellum in a unified analysis. The effect of each type of the data fusion (left-right averaging vs tensor-ICA concatenation) on the results were inspected in detail in the context of the fetal dataset, where the gains from boosting SNR can potentially be more evident. Here we just wanted to establish key features emerging from this approach. The maps for <italic>d</italic> = 40 mrFCMs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>.</p><p id="P15">Compared to single-seed FCMs maps, mrFCMs appeared to provide a better noise suppression while preserving the spatial specificity of single-seed FCMs. This did not compromise the spatial correspondence to gica maps, sometimes providing better matching to them than single-seed FCM (cf. maps paired with gica maps 2,3,12, 15 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The final analysis in the neonatal dataset aimed to assess the correctness of FCM factorisation. By “correctness” we mean that the observed differences between gica and FCMs maps are not due to the patterns “invented” by the FCM approach but rather reflect a scalable variability. The benchmark for this could be demonstrating that similar deviation can occur within the group-ICA approach when the latter is performed using a different choice of dimensionality. For this, the group-ICA factorisation was obtained using <italic>d</italic> = 40 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Several results indicate the correctness of FCM factorisation. Firstly, among 5 non-trivial mrFCM patterns (i.e., those which spatial layout suggest its biological veracity), that could not be matched to any of <italic>d</italic> = 25 gica maps, 4 could be reliably paired with <italic>d</italic> = 40 gica maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Another factor in favour of correctness of FCMs is that <italic>d</italic> = 40 gica maps provide a somewhat different interpretation of the spatial layout of the networks compared to <italic>d</italic> = 25 gica maps but which aligned with the FCM interpretation. For example, <italic>d</italic> = 40 gica maps 12, 16, and 23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) reveals the presence of a dorsal parietal bilateral network in combinations with two lateral parieto-temporal networks, which dominate one of the hemispheres with a non-negligible bilateral component. In contrast, the <italic>d</italic> = 25 group-ICA did not decouple the dorsolateral network from the right lateral network (gica maps 9 and 12 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Comparisons with <italic>d</italic> = 40 gica maps also helps refine the interpretation of similarities between gica and FCMs networks. <italic>d</italic> = 40 group-ICA recovers superior networks in the posterior occipital cortex (gica 19 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>) in addition to inferior ones recovered by <italic>d</italic> = 25 group-ICA, with the former but not the latter accurately matching <italic>d</italic> = 40 FCMs (cf. gica 13 and 16 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), whereas the <italic>d</italic> = 25 FCMs do not seem to differentiate between the two. A pattern closely matching the inferior network can be observed in right-thalamus-based FCMs (fcm 13 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Fetal dataset</title><p id="P18">Using the neonatal dataset, we demonstrated that seed-based FCM approach to produce a valid spatial factorisation when group-ICA results are used as a benchmark, with the differences in results between the two approaches on par with the differences that may occur within the group-ICA approach when the latter is performed using a different choice of dimensionality. Having established this, we now turn to the analyses of the fetal data, which proved to be very challenging for recovery of spatially distributed patterns indicating the emergence of the functional brain networks in a conventional sense.</p><p id="P19">For comparison, the d = 25 group-ICA maps, obtained from the analysis of the fetal sample of 201 fetuses from the dHCP cohort, aged 24.5 – 38.29, were reported in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, whereas the <italic>d</italic> = 40 factorisation is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>. Either way, they predominantly comprise components localised to one brain region (“dominant node”) of a “blurry” appearance and with the centre-of-mass biased towards white matter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and occasionally included a smaller, non-dominant node that could be indicative of the development of long-distance connections in the fetal brain.</p><p id="P20">Based on the analyses of neonatal data, we start with considering the <italic>d</italic> = 40 multiregional (left and right thalami and cerebellum) FCMs. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, where they are graphically organised to enable an easier identification of their anatomical location. It can be seen that mrFCMs represents a much more powerful tool for extraction of spatially distributed patters of functional relations compared to group-ICA, with those that are symmetrically organised or showing a secondary non-negligible node in the opposite hemisphere particularly prevalent. Additional analyses demonstrated that the left-right mirror-symmetric re-enforcement represents the critical factor for the ability to derive spatially-distributed patterns in the fetal data, as shown by comparison of left+right averaged thalamus-based FCMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>) and FCMs obtained by combining left thalamus and cerebellum seeds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>).</p><p id="P21">We next compare the mrFCMs with neonatal <italic>d</italic> = 40 group-ICA networks. Here we sought for a partial agreement between fetal FCMs and neonatal gica maps as sufficient evidence for the validity of FCM approach in the context of fetal fMRI network analysis (given that neonatal data can contain its own biases and limitations, which we will discuss later). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> shows the mrFCMs which either very accurately match the <italic>d</italic> = 40 neonatal gica map or represent their <italic>mul--nodal</italic> sub- or super-part. Other correspondences include two unilateral cerebellar components (cf bilateral gica 30 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) and the matching patterns between neonatal group-ICA and d =25 mrFCMs factorisation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>; e.g., fcm 20 vs. gica 34, fcm16 vs. gica 5 and 7, fcm 9 vs. gica 17). A closer inspection of the maps that were undeniably matching between neonates and fetuses is instructive to appreciate the differences in the signal characteristics, with the centres-of mass biased towards veins in the neonatal maps and towards white matter in the fetal maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P22">The final – intriguing – result occurs when a higher dimensionality of mrFCMs (<italic>d</italic> = 80) is considered. The motivation for the analyses of high-dimensional factorisation comes from the fact that the increase from <italic>d</italic> = 25 to <italic>d</italic> = 40 did not have a detrimental effect for ability to derive spatially distributed patterns but improved their spatial specificity; consequently, a higher dimensionality may permit a more efficient decoupling of such patterns from a background covariance structure dominated by local smoothness in the correlational maps. This proved to be the case and demonstrated a variety of collateral patterns (Data availability, Resource 1). The spatial distribution of these patterns revealed systematic trends. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> we combined the maps that showed a left-right near-symmetric organisation vs the maps that showed unilateral dominance. The FCMs with collateral patterns tended to belong to one of the following anatomical categories: a) regions lying along the midline separating the two hemispheres, both dorso-lateral and medial; 2) cortical limbic areas, combining ventral orbito-frontal and temporal pole regions; 3) a set of regions in the lateral primary and secondary sensorimotor cortices; and 4) a set of lateral regions along the superior temporal sulcus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">In this paper, we introduced an analytical technique that utilises inter-individual differences in seed-based connectivity to infer on functional network characteristics of the brain. Based on its underlying structure, we term this approach seed-based functional covariance modes (FCMs) and attribute it to a broader and relatively overlooked class of models known as functional covariance networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The motivation for developing this approach comes from our earlier work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> showing the utility of inter-subject variability for the inference on the network architecture in the fetal brain, which network-like properties are of primary interest to us.</p><p id="P24">We first assessed FCMs performance in the context of neonatal fMRI data. We demonstrated: 1) factorisation of network-like properties comparable to factorisation using the mainstream group-ICA approach, 2) relative tolerance to the choice of the seed location, consistent with the “injection site” hypothesis 3) higher anatomical specificity and higher sensitivity to noise compared to group-ICA maps. Based on these results, we developed a strategy, multiregional FCMs, for noise suppression via utilisation of several seed-based connectivity maps to reinforce repeating patterns in the data.</p><p id="P25">We then applied this approach to fetal fMRI data and showed that in this context, FCMs are not just inconsequential alternative to the standard group-ICA maps; rather they mark fetal fMRI as a key application for functional covariance models for detecting network-like properties with higher efficiency. Importantly, for the first time and despite the fundamental differences in the signal characteristics between fetal and neonatal brain, we were able to detect spatially distributed network-like patterns which could unambiguously be matched to the patterns observed in the neonatal brain using group-ICA, thereby boosting confidence in the biological veracity of observations made using fetal fMRI. The demonstration of such patterns has been a lingering problem for the fMRI, as depleted spatial characteristics of the fetal functional network maps obtained using other methods undermine their biological credibility, complicate their interpretation, and hinders generation of hypotheses about fetal functional brain development.</p><p id="P26">FSMs identified a broad range of collateral patterns in the fetal brain, which recapitulates the dominance of the interhemispheric relations characteristic of the neonatal networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. These patterns were particularly prominent with high-dimensional factorisation. The most prominent motif was their higher prevalence along the brain midline, comprising medial and dorsal regions of the brain, which is consistent with the organisation of callosal connectivity in the human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> as well as with the previous results obtained in preterm babies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. However, there are prominent exceptions to this gradient structure, which comprised lateral sensorimotor, temporal (along superior temporal sulcus) and limbic ventral orbito-frontal cortices/temporal pole, potentially pointing to the brain system needed to ensure survival at early stages of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">We note that the neonatal maps tended to be organised along sulcal grooves, a likely testimony of the venous bias of gradient-echo imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. This factor is also likely to contribute to overly smooth appearance of the neonatal networks and potentially leading to overestimation of their spatial spread. In contrast, fetal maps (both group-ICA and FCMs) demonstrate a bias towards infra-cortical white matter. This factor has previously been noted by us in relation to the dHCP dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and appears to manifest itself in results derived using other datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. In the dHCP dataset, this bias may further be exacerbated by a longer TE utilised for a more efficient suppression of the signal emanating from fatty maternal tissues and, consequently, the dominance of white matter contrast in the images due to its longer T2* (this can be ascertained by comparing grey-white matter contrast in fetal and neonatal dHCP datasets). The different directionality in the bias is likely to be sufficient for causing of a shift in network estimated locations and consequently, may conceal further potential similarities between fetal and neonatal network organisation.</p><p id="P28">The utility of inter-subject variability for the analyses of fetal brain network architecture was highlighted in our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> that leveraged age-related differences to infer network organisation in the fetal data. The method, called matnets, can therefore also be considered a special case of the functional covariance networks. Compared to that method, FCMs combine improved power in detecting spatially distributed patterns with a low computational cost. Methodologically, our approach is related to the two approaches which originally introduced functional covariance networks to the neuroscientific community. Zhang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> introduced seed-based functional covariance networks, where a particular seed was used to reconstruct a network it belongs to. Taylor et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> then used a combination of within-voxel signal metrics (e.g., temporal deviations or amplitudes) and ICA factorisation to reconstruct networks that proved to be similar to the results of the standard group-ICA. Our approach lies at the intersection of these two approaches: in contrast to Zhang et al., we showed that the use of a particular seed is not preventing, at least in the perinatal cohorts, inferences on whole brain network organisation. As noted earlier, metaphorically, the selection of a seed can be compared to a selection of an injection site for a contrast agent. This is not the same if the seed would be a contrast agent on its own, in which case the approach could have interesting neuroscientific applications, e.g., studying thalamus-induced patterning of connectivity, but was limited in its ability to analyse brain-wide network architecture. This does not imply that seed placement is irrelevant for the results, as we showed by placing a seed in the ventricles of the neonatal brain. How to select the seed in order to accentuate useful signal properties remains a question for future analyses.</p><sec id="S6"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P29">The question of course remains on the nature of information that is used in the FCMs approach that result in the coherent network factorisation. However, this question can be formulated from a different perspective, namely, what information is <italic>actually</italic> critical in the group-ICA approach? The prevailing assumption is that the spatial maps represent correlational structure shared across individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, not its inter-individual variability. Consequently, the efficiency of FCMs approach in recovering spatial maps which are highly similar to group-ICA maps invites re-evaluation of the role of inter-individual variability in the widely exploited tool for the group-level network analysis.</p><p id="P30">Demonstration of multi-regional associations in the fetal brain required the deployment of signal reinforcing strategies, the most powerful of which was left-right mirror-symmetric reinforcement. Note that this strategy reinforces mirror-symmetric patterns in any direction with respect to the seed location, i.e., it is not numerically biased to the detection of collateral patterns and therefore cannot explain their abundance due to artificially induced dependencies. The cost of such a strategy is of course the ambivalence of the spatial maps with respect to left-right orientation, that is, they are left-right equivalent. This is undeniably a limitation but not lethal, for several reasons. Firstly, this does not affect the interpretation of the near-symmetric patterns, which by default are left-right ambiguous. The small variation in their layout across the two sides of the brain can probably be ignored or averaged out. Secondly, for unilateral or inter-areal patterns, the importance of detecting these patterns in the context of fetal fMRI by far outweighs the importance of their attribution to a specific (or either) hemisphere; the latter can potentially be established in post-hoc analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Data</title><p id="P31">We used the pre-processed fMRI data included in the open-access release of the multimodal perinatal data by the developing Human Connectome Project Consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The fetal dataset consists of 201 cases, aged &gt; 24.5 gestation weeks, which data passed the quality control as described in Karolis et al. The neonatal dataset consists of 311 cases, described in XX and includes all cases which gestation age is &lt; 37 weeks and a randomly selected subsample such that the distribution around gestation age of 37 weeks has a near-symmetrical shape.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Image preprocessing</title><p id="P32">The preprocessing stages for fetal and neonatal datasets are, respectively, described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> and<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The warps between native and non-symmetrical template spaces are also provided by dHCP. These were concatenated with non-symmetrical to symmetrical template warp, to provide a direct mapping between native functional spaces and symmetrical template (available online, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Data availability statement</xref>).</p><p id="P33">The data from both datasets were pre-processed in an analogous way. The fMRI volumes were smoothed in the native space. The individual structural multiregional segmentations released by the dHCP (draw-EM for neonates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and BOUNTI for fetuses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>) were projected into native functional space to create a mask for a seed. The individual maps representing correlation between mean seed timecourse and timecourses of each voxel in the brain were computed in the native functional space. These maps were then projected to the symmetrical group space, 40-week-old neonatal template for neonatal dataset and 36-week-old fetal template for the fetal dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. The data across each dataset were concatenated into 4D map (“subject series”) and submitted to FSL melodic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> factorisation of desired dimensionality. When it was necessary to visualise together the results of fetal and neonatal analyses, the group-level neonatal maps were projected into the fetal template space.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS207569-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d71aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S10"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The data used in this study were acquired with the funding by European Research Council under the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/20072013)/ERC grant agreement no. 319456 (dHCP project).

The images were produced by combining, separately, near-symmetric and predominantly unilateral z-scored spatial maps, followed by their left-right flipping and extracting the maximum value across all maps and both their flipped and non-flipped versions. The two maps were thresholded at z = 5 to aid visualisation of the distribution of bilateral and unilateral patterns.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207569-f005"/></fig></floats-group></article>
