Reticulocytes (young RBC) derived from <italic>in vitro</italic> erythroid cultures have been reported to possess less cholesterol than their native counterparts, compromising their functional integrity and lifespan. However, variability in starting materials and culture protocols between studies has hindered definitive conclusions regarding the nature and consequences of this lipid deficiency.</p><p id="P2">Here, we evaluated the influence of lipid sources on reticulocyte quality using a well-established CD34<sup>+</sup> erythroid culture system. We compared the use of human AB-serum and Octaplas (solvent/detergent-treated pooled plasma) as lipid sources. Our results reveal that detergent- treated plasma leads to cholesterol-deficient reticulocytes with impaired characteristics, including reduced filtration yield, heightened osmotic fragility, and altered PIEZO1 activity. In contrast, AB-serum supported the generation of functionally stable reticulocytes, with cholesterol supplementation required to rescue the defects observed with plasma.</p><p id="P3">Importantly, this study provides the first integrated lipidomic, metabolomic, and proteomic characterisation of <italic>in vitro</italic>-derived reticulocytes cultured under distinct lipid conditions.

This exceptional deformability is largely due to their highly specialised membrane, which comprises a spectrin based cytoskeleton anchored to a cholesterol rich lipid bilayer. Unlike most cellular membranes which typically contain 10–30% cholesterol, the RBC membranes contain up to 50% cholesterol out of total membrane lipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, a feature critical for maintaining mechanical stability, fluidity and overall function.</p><p id="P5">The connection between cholesterol and erythrocyte physiology has been recognised for over a century since cholesterol was first identified in red cell membranes. Studies have since shown cholesterol levels influence RBC deformability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and are linked to haematological disorders associated with altered blood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>viscosity. Dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis affects RBC lifespan, clearance, and oxygen transport efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. For example, foetal erythropoiesis involves up-regulation of cholesterol metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, and is linked to activation of p53-dependent activation of cholesterol uptake by ABCA1 and suppression of cholesterol synthesis via the mevalonate pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. This regulatory axis is essential during adult erythropoiesis, where p53 influences iron uptake by controlling the transcription of the ferrireductase Steap3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Hypercholesterolemia has also been reported as disrupting RBC functional and structural properties, by accumulating cholesterol within the plasma membrane cell deformability is reduced, impacting oxygen transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. In mature RBCs, cholesterol depletion, which occurs during refrigerated storage, has been linked to changes in morphology, increased membrane rigidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, reduced deformability and, enhanced splenic clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining cholesterol availability during <italic>in vitro</italic> erythroid culture, where lab-grown reticulocytes must emulate native RBCs membrane properties to survive and function effectively <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P6">The heightened interest in lab-grown RBCs as potential blood substitutes has intensified the focus on the characteristics of cultured reticulocytes and how closely they mimic their native counterparts. Previous studies have shown that lab-grown reticulocytes exhibit similar blood group antigen expression to their originating donor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, possess a proteomic profile comparable to native reticulocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and are capable of deforming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, genetic modifications introduced into cultured erythroid cells to mimic patient specific mutations yield reticulocytes that display the characteristic phenotype expected, provided the phenotype manifests at the immature RBC stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that lab-grown reticulocytes possess requisite membrane protein structures and interactions, supporting their potential as functional RBC substitutes.</p><p id="P7">One currently underexplored factor influencing the properties of lab grown blood is their plasma membrane lipid composition. Outside the highly regulated and nurturing <italic>in vivo</italic> bone marrow microenvironment, the impact of exogenously supplied lipid sources used during erythroid culture is of particular importance. In the RESTORE clinical trial, which is currently evaluating the performance of lab-grown reticulocytes compared to donor derived red blood cells in healthy volunteers, AB-serum (alongside human serum albumin (HSA)) is used as a lipid source and no detrimental effects observed on the characteristics of the lab-grown reticulocytes. In contrast, several studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> have reported cholesterol deficiencies in cultured reticulocytes, which required supplementation to preserve reticulocyte integrity. These discrepancies are often difficult to interpret due to inherent variability in experimental reagents, donor cell sources and culture protocols. Nevertheless, we hypothesised that the observed differences may be attributable to the lipid sources employed- particularly as the latter studies all used detergent/solvent extracted plasma. Addressing this question requires a more standardised and systematic comparison of lipid supplements used in erythroid culture systems.</p><p id="P8">In order to systematically assess the lipid content of cultured reticulocytes produced using distinct lipid sources, lipids were provided through supplementation of <italic>in vitro</italic> erythroid cultures with AB-serum, or detergent/solvent-extracted (S/D) plasma in the presence or absence of cholesterol supplementation. Our findings demonstrate that the choice of lipid sources in erythroid culture significantly affects cholesterol availability, which in turn affects cell yield and reticulocyte characteristics. Moreover, we provide the first comprehensive lipidomic, metabolomic, and proteomic comparisons of reticulocytes derived from these diverse lipid sources.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Reticulocyte yield is impacted by choice of lipid source in differentiation media</title><p id="P9">To elucidate the role of lipid supplementation in <italic>in vitro</italic> erythroid cultures, multiple lipid sources were tested in adult hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) cultures. We used a well-established three-phase culture method comprised of Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM) supplemented with erythropoietin (EPO), insulin, heparin, holo-transferrin, as base media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. The culture media composition was kept identical but the lipid sources used were either 3% AB-serum and 2% HSA (called here AB-serum) or 5% human pooled plasma (brand name Octaplas®, referred to as Plasma for simplicity), or plasma supplemented with 50mg/L cholesterol-rich-lipids (Plasma + CRL). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> summarises the culture conditions tested, and the culture protocol followed. Cells were cultured for 20 days with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> illustrating the cumulative fold expansion of the erythroid cultures in the three tested media compositions. The standard deviation between the 6 donors tested is high, particularly when cultured in AB-serum, most likely due to donor biological variability in terms of progenitor expansion. The AB-serum cultured cells tend to experience a higher proliferation from day 5 onwards compared to the plasma culture, plateauing at 4.8±4.5x10<sup>4</sup>-fold at day 15. Plasma-cultured cells on average exhibited only 1.9±1.1 x10<sup>4</sup>-fold proliferation on day 15 and the supplementation with CRL increased proliferation to 3.6±2.4 x10<sup>4</sup>-fold on day 18.</p><p id="P10">From days 11 to 20, enucleation was assessed on the basis of Hoechst negativity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Until day 18 the percentage of reticulocytes in the AB-serum culture is greater than both Plasma cultures, indicating a faster progression through differentiation. Values remain constant for the AB-serum cultures day 15 onwards, contrary to Plasma which show a steady increase until day 18. Despite these differences, all three conditions yielded similar enucleation values at the time of harvest of the culture, an average of 61.0% ±2.9% (standard deviation, SD). Notably, supplementation with cholesterol does not alter enucleation percentages. For the same culture media composition containing AB-serum, values between 10<sup>4</sup> and &gt;10<sup>5</sup>-fold expansion and &gt;60% enucleation have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, consistent with the data collected here.</p><p id="P11">At the end of differentiation, the culture consists of a mixture of reticulocytes, pyrenocytes, and nucleated cells (mostly orthochromatic erythroblasts). To obtain a pure sample of reticulocytes (&gt;98%) leukocyte reduction filters can be used to isolate the reticulocytes. Leukofilters are normally used after whole blood donations to eliminate white blood cells prior to transfusion, relying on the deformability of RBCs to easily pass through the filter while the stiffer nucleated cells are retained<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. The cultures were filtered on day 20 and the yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) was calculated based on total pre- and post-filtration cell counts. After filtration, the AB-serum culture condition averaged a yield of 34.6 ±7.5% (SD) while Plasma-cultured cells only achieved 5.1 ±2.2% reticulocyte recovery, a significant difference highlighting the decreased deformability of reticulocytes grown in Plasma. The addition of cholesterol-rich lipids to the plasma containing media rescued filterability levels to 28.9 ±4.1%.</p><p id="P12">The degree of reticulocyte maturation of the filtered cultures was next assessed through flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) by plotting the expression of the transferrin receptor (CD71), a marker absent on mature erythrocytes, against Thiazole Orange – measuring residual RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. The individual data points indicate a higher CD71 expression, as judged by comparing MFI on AB- serum derived reticulocytes (RET<sup>AB-serum</sup>), compared with Plasma-derived (RET<sup>Plasma</sup>), either with or without cholesterol supplementation (RET<sup>Plasma+CRL</sup>).</p><p id="P13">Next, total cholesterol was assessed by Filipin stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). This indicated a significant increase in total cholesterol of native RETs (nRETs) and RET<sup>AB-serum</sup> compared with RBCs. RET<sup>Plasma</sup> had a 54% decrease in total cholesterol when compared to RBCs (2.0±0.8 x10<sup>3</sup> against 4.3±0.4 x10<sup>3</sup>), and 68% when compared to nRET (6.3±0.2 x10<sup>3</sup>). It should be noted that these results were obtained on the filtered reticulocytes, which only accounted for 5% of total reticulocytes present pre-filtration for plasma cultured cells. Upon cholesterol supplementation of plasma-cultured reticulocytes, total cholesterol levels increased to levels similar to that observed in nRETs. In fact, there is no significant difference between nRET, RET<sup>AB-serum</sup>, and RET<sup>Plasma+CRL</sup>, as all were higher than RBCs, although not significantly for RET<sup>AB-serum</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Plasma grown erythroid cells have compensatory changes consistent with exposure to low cholesterol levels</title><p id="P14">The gene expression levels of key genes important for cholesterol homeostasis were evaluated using real-time quantitative PCR on RNA isolated from erythroblasts exposed to different lipid sources at day 8 of differentiation. Multiple genes known to control cholesterol biosynthesis were evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) including the sterol-regulatory element-binding proteins 1 and 2 (<italic>SREBP1</italic> and <italic>SREBP2</italic>) expression (a transcription factor that controls cholesterol and lipid homeostasis), alongside 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (<italic>HMGCR</italic>) and Squalene monooxygenase (<italic>SQLE</italic>) which are both rate limiting enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. We also evaluated low-density lipoprotein receptor (<italic>LDRL</italic>) expression which plays a crucial role in cholesterol uptake.</p><p id="P15">Gene expression was significantly increased in the Plasma condition for all genes analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) and was either similar or reduced upon CRL supplementation when compared to AB-serum. <italic>HMGCR, SQLE, LDLR</italic>, and <italic>SREBP1</italic> all show greater than 2-fold increase in expression (2.4±0.74, 2.1±0.38, and 2.0 ±0.94, 2.7 ±1.6 respectively). <italic>SREBP2</italic> had a 1.8±0.76 increase in Plasma culture compared with AB-serum. However, it is notable one donor exhibited a less pronounced response, for all genes except SQLE, to the low cholesterol environment, suggesting that that there may be inherent variability among donors. When CRL supplementation occurs alongside plasma, all genes have a mean fold-expansion inferior to 1 in the Plasma+CRL condition, indicating lower gene expression than when cultured in AB-serum.</p><p id="P16">To control for possible differences in gene expression associated with differentiation progression the different cell stages of erythropoiesis were assessed by observing the expression of membrane proteins Band 3 and CD49d, with Band 3 increasing during terminal differentiation while CD49d decreases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Using one donor as an example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> exemplifies the gating strategy used to determine the percentages of erythroid cell type (Proerythroblast (I), Basophilic Erythroblast (II), Polychromatic Erythroblast (III), and Orthochromatic Erythroblast (IV), Reticulocyte (V)) for tested conditions. The combined results for 3 donors are visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>.</p><p id="P17">Interestingly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref> shows that both plasma-containing conditions differentiated slower than AB-serum, with the latter having only 37.5±8.31% of total cells left as Proerythroblasts while Plasma-only had 47.3±7.57%, and Plasma + CRL 69.5±4.82%. This observation suggests that the restoration of gene expression levels observed in the Plasma+CRL cells to those comparable with AB-serum is not due to similarities in erythroid cell populations but rather a response to cholesterol availability.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomic studies</title><p id="P18">To more extensively explore the effects of media composition on the reticulocyte produced from the different lipid sources, samples of filtered reticulocytes and RBCs were subjected to multi- omics analysis.</p><p id="P19">The proteomic dataset was analysed initially by normalising the Max Label Free Quantification values against donor-matched RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-B</xref>). Many of the proteins highlighted where abundance significantly changes across the three conditions were associated with processes related to reticulocyte maturation and red cell-specific functionality, including membrane trafficking, carbon dioxide transport, and hydration regulation. Although, notably, Fatty acid lipid synthase (FASN) was detected as upregulated in the plasma culture reticulocytes. To more precisely dissect the differences induced by the extracellular environment, we performed a second analysis normalising instead to AB serum-cultured reticulocytes, allowing for the quantification of 1021 proteins, up from 500 when comparing against RBCs, effectively doubling the proteomic depth. This aligns with findings from Gautier et al. (2018)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> who identified 654 proteins as being reticulocyte specific. The Enrichr software tool was used to detect functional relationships between the protein groups. Of note was the identification of three proteins significantly upregulated in Plasma only-grown reticulocytes, observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> – Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FDPS), FASN, and Diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase (MVN), all known to be involved in lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis. All three proteins are regulated by the transcription factors SREBP (Reactome pathway knowledgebase 2022, p=0.00002441), found to also be upregulated in the differentiating plasma-grown erythroid cells by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Metabolomics data was next analysed by comparing metabolites in Plasma or Plasma+CRL grown reticulocytes to AB serum reticulocytes. We observed that most metabolites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>) have no significant alteration between culture systems and, even if observed to be significant these often translated into modest changes associated with a large degree of variability observed across the 3 donors analysed. Of note was the detected upregulation in UMP levels, particularly in the presence of cholesterol supplementation, and a reduction in pyridoxal. Decreases in succinate and citrate highlight alterations in the TCA cycle. The depletion of gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteine (precursor to glutathione<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>) and the increase in L-selenomethionine (common intermediate used for synthesising selenocysteine, essential for peroxidase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>) also indicate alterations in antioxidant response.</p><p id="P21">A comprehensive lipidomics comparison was also conducted, and a summary heat map of the top 50 significant lipid changes identified between the cultured reticulocytes and matched RBCs is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>. This identified several lipid classes with similar or higher abundance compared with red blood cells, which aligns with the fact that cultured reticulocytes must still lose around 20%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> of their membrane surface area during the maturation process. Acylcarnitines (AcCa, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) are less abundant in serum-grown reticulocytes compared with both Plasma conditions, although this difference is not significant. Importantly, cholesterol levels were reduced in plasma, (Chol, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) whereas cholesterol levels were observed to be significantly increased in both serum grown and Plasma supplemented with CRL reticulocytes relative to erythrocytes.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Reduced cholesterol in the plasma-grown reticulocytes impacts reticulocyte characteristics</title><p id="P22">To assess the properties of the reticulocytes produced using the different lipid sourcesreticulocyte deformability was measured by Automated Rheoscopy (ARCA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, a single cell ektacytometry system where cells are subjected to a constant and specific shear stress field causing cell elongation. The A/B ratio is used as a deformability measurement, plotted against the frequency of said ratio in the cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The weighted average of the A/B ratio was calculated for all 3 donors and the values were plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>. Red blood cells achieve on average a higher A/B ratio, at 1.96 ±0.06 (SD), followed by RET<sup>AB-serum</sup> with 1.82 ±0.02 (SD), RET<sup>Plasma</sup> at 1.73 ±0.08 (SD) and RET<sup>Plama+CRL</sup> at 1.61 ±0.04 (SD). The higher elongation index observed in RBCs compared to cultured reticulocytes is in line with the well-established understanding that mature RBCs are more deformable. Statistically, there is no difference between the means of the three reticulocyte samples but when analysing the distribution peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> there is a visible shift of RET<sup>Plasma+CRL</sup>, indicative of reduced deformability. In fact, comparing the A/B ratio average of cultured reticulocytes with RBCs, only RET<sup>Plasma+CRL</sup> is substantially reduced, once again indicating a decrease in deformability correlated with the increased cholesterol content.</p><p id="P23">As reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, an osmotic fragility test (OFT) can be used to assess reticulocyte fragility. The OFT exposes cells to various dilutions of NaCl, exposing RBCs to a hypotonic environment, causing water to enter the cell, resulting in swelling and ultimately lysis. The OFT was performed on RBCs, native reticulocytes (nRETs) obtained by magnetically isolating CD71+ cells from donor red cells and filtered cultured reticulocytes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>, RBCs produce an S-shape curve consistent with 50% haemolysis observed between 0.45% and 0.40% NaCl (w/v) whilst native reticulocytes are more resistant to osmotic changes, requiring a concentration of 0.35% to 0.30% NaCl (w/v) to achieve the same cell lysis percentage. This is consistent with the consensus that reticulocytes are more resistant to osmotic alteration despite being less deformable than RBCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Both RET<sup>AB-serum</sup> and RET<sup>Plasma+CRL</sup> reticulocytes exhibit similar OFT pattern to that observed for nRETs but with significant differences at 0.45%, 0.40% and 0.30% NaCl solutions (w/v). These data indicate a heightened resistance to hypotonic solutions of cultured reticulocytes when compared with nRETs. Plasma-grown reticulocytes display the opposite, an increased fragility even when exposed to high salt concentrations. At 0.5% NaCl (w/v) RET<sup>Plasma</sup> experience 16.3 ±7.6% haemolysis while only 3.4 ±4.1% of nRETs and 1.2 ±2.4% of RET<sup>AB-serum</sup> lyse at that same NaCl concentration. This remains a significant difference throughout the remaining NaCl dilutions until all conditions 100% lyse in water.</p><p id="P24">Multiple reports have highlighted the importance of the lipid environment on the mechanosensory channel Piezo1 properties and activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, as such alteration in the different lipid sources and the resulting cholesterol changes could impact Piezo1 function. In order to investigate this RBCs, nRETs, and filtered cultured reticulocytes cultured in the different lipid sources were treated with various concentrations of YODA1. A baseline is first acquired for each sample followed by YODA1 addition which results in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, detected by Fluo4-AM fluorescence. The YODA1 titration results are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>, normalised for the highest concentration used (10μM).</p><p id="P25">Between 10μM and 1.25μM YODA1, no discernible difference in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is observed in erythrocytes, indicating saturating activation of Piezo1. This saturation is visually evident through the plateau in Piezo1 response. The channel activation experiences a gradual decline with decreasing YODA1 concentrations. Comparing nRETs with RBCs there was a difference in response from 1.25μM, with RBCs consistently exhibiting higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> influxes, also obvious by the required concentration to achieve 50% Piezo1 activation (approximately 0.20μM to 0.46μM). As mentioned before this is to be expected, as reticulocytes are less deformable. Focusing on cultured reticulocytes, there is no difference between nRETs and RET<sup>AB-serum</sup>, indicating that the differences observed between cultured reticulocytes and RBCs are due to their immaturity and not from <italic>ex vivo</italic> erythropoiesis.

It has also confirmed that a significant factor that can influence reticulocyte quality and functionality is the choice of lipid supplementation, particularly the use of human AB-serum versus solvent-treated plasma products such as Octaplas. Our findings show that when using solvent/detergent depleted plasma such as Octaplas, careful optimisation of cholesterol supplementation should be undertaken to ensure that the reticulocytes do not have cholesterol deficiency and so impact on their characteristics. We also show that supplementation of cultures with 3% AB serum provide sufficient cholesterol for erythroid differentiation. Consequently, additional cholesterol supplementation is not required when AB-serum is used. These findings underscore the broader challenge in erythroid culture standardisation, as different laboratories employ varied serum, plasma, or serum-free media formulations, each method will require careful optimisation, characterisation and testing to check for impact on reticulocyte characteristics and functionality.</p><p id="P28">Despite the challenge of donor biological variability in terms of proliferation, it was noticeable that under the culture conditions using AB-serum as a lipid source may yield better results than plasma alone in terms of proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), with cholesterol supplementation further enhancing the proliferation of plasma-grown cells. Given the rapid proliferation of early erythroid progenitors, it is expected that cholesterol availability would impact cell expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Colabelling with Band 3 and CD49d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) corroborated data observed regarding enucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), where reticulocytes cultured in plasma progressed slower through differentiation. This was independent of cholesterol availability, as CRL supplementation of Plasma cultures did not reverse this effect, marking a key difference between Plasma and Serum. A similar effect was observed regarding CD71 levels, a marker for reticulocyte maturity, with plasma reticulocytes showing reduced expression levels. A curious result given the apparent delayed differentiation observed in the early stages of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Importantly, plasma only cultures exhibit dramatically impaired filtration, producing extremely low recovery yields following leukofiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Adding cholesterol-rich lipids to the plasma containing media rescued the reticulocyte filterability to levels observed in AB-serum cultures. This is suggestive of impacted deformability, as successful passage through the leukofilter is highly dependent on cell deformability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. A recent study by Claessen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> explored the requirement for cholesterol supplementation as an aid to improved filterability and in their study, using plasma as a lipid source. Of note here is the novel correlation between the specific use of plasma in culture media and insufficient cholesterol availability, since erythroid differentiation in the presence of AB-serum does not require cholesterol supplementation. This was corroborated by measuring cholesterol levels in the filtered reticulocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>), which revealed reduced cholesterol in RET<sup>Plasma</sup> compared with even mature RBCs and is also observed in the comparative lipidomics.</p><p id="P30">The observed upregulation of <italic>HMGCR, SQLE</italic>, and <italic>LDLR</italic> genes in erythroid cells grown in plasma-only conditions is consistent with the hypothesis that the cultured erythroblasts are experiencing cholesterol restriction and so are compensating for the lower cholesterol availability by increasing cellular cholesterol synthesis and uptake. The downregulation of the same genes when cholesterol is supplemented in the culture media is consistent with a feedback mechanism where exogenous cholesterol inhibits the need for intracellular synthesis and uptake. This feedback control is well documented in cholesterol metabolism, where excess cholesterol leads to suppression of biosynthesis and receptor-mediated uptake to maintain homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P31">SREBP2 mRNA levels also increase in response to low cholesterol conditions, further amplifying the regulatory network that drives the expression of key cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake genes such as HMGCR, SQLE, and LDLR. Interestingly, the observed upregulation of SREBP2 in plasma-only conditions was quite modest, showing less than a two-fold increase, with significant variation between donors. Indeed one donor exhibited no upregulation of the transcription factor and correspondingly low expression of regulated genes HMGCR, SQLE, and LDLR, while the remaining two exhibited more substantial regulation of these genes.</p><p id="P32">SREBP1 was also significantly upregulated in the same two donors, suggesting that fatty acid metabolism pathways can also be activated alongside cholesterol biosynthesis. In fact, despite SREBP1 being more associated with transcription of fatty acid synthesis genes and SREBP2 more associated with cholesterol-related genes, recent publications have shown how SREBP1 is also activated by low cholesterol and how the upregulation of FASN (Fatty Acid Synthase), a downstream target of SREBP1, has been linked to enhanced cholesterol production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Our proteomics analysis of filtered reticulocytes further corroborates this observation, detecting a marked upregulation of FASN in Plasma-cultured cells only. Additionally, the upregulation of FDPS (Farnesyl Diphosphate Synthase) and MVD (Mevalonate Diphosphate Decarboxylase) in the proteomics data indicates an increased flux through the mevalonate pathway, crucial for cholesterol biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P33">Overall, the omics data showed that plasma-grown reticulocytes exhibit a marked activation of lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways, likely driven by SREBP1/2 activity, fuelled by reduced cholesterol depletion. These data also reveal minimal proteomic difference between cultured reticulocytes and mature red blood cells, independent of lipid source used.</p><p id="P34">We established that RET<sup>AB-serum</sup> have similar osmotic resistance profile to those of nRETs, whilst RET<sup>Plasma</sup> showed increased osmotic fragility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), consistent with previously published data of cholesterol-deficient reticulocytes levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The osmotic fragility was reversed by supplementation with CRL. Curiously when submitting the same reticulocytes to an automated rheoscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B-C</xref>), testing the elongation capacity of the cell, we saw no impairment of the plasma cultured cells, instead the reticulocytes supplemented with extra cholesterol had reduced deformability. Increased membrane stiffness has been described in hypercholesterolemia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, aligning with our findings. This suggests that careful optimisation of cholesterol supplementation should be considered, to ensure minimal impact on reticulocyte properties.</p><p id="P35">Cholesterol not only influences membrane fluidity and stiffness but also regulates the activity of membrane proteins, such as the mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO1. Studies have shown that PIEZO1 function and activity are dependent on cholesterol-rich lipid rafts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>.

P &lt; 0.05 was set as statistical significance threshold (*p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001. ****p &lt; 0.0001.</p><p id="P56">For omics data, statistical analysis were conducted using MetaboAnalyst v 5.0 and Rstudio upon autoscale normalization (i.e., data were mean-centred, divided by the standard deviation of each variable). Line plots and volcano plots of correlations (Spearman) were generated upon analysis of the raw data via Rstudio. Significance was calculated upon false discovery rate correction. Network analyses and pathway analyses were performed in OmicsNet v 2.0 using as input the significantly altered metabolites and proteins (FDR-corrected p &lt; 0.05).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Freire et al 2025 Supplemental figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS207124-supplement-Freire_et_al_2025_Supplemental_figure_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d59aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported through funding provided by the European Union ITN ‘EVIDENCE’ grant agreement ID 860436 for CMF, the Medical Research Council (MR/V010506/1) for TJS, NRK and infrastructure support funding from the National Institute for Health Research Blood and Transplant Research Unit (NIHR BTRU) in Red Cell Products (IS-BTU-1214-10032).

The base media consists of Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM) supplemented with insulin, erythropoietin (EPO), heparin, holo-transferrin, and either AB serum or Plasma as lipid sources. The addition of cholesterol-rich lipids (CRL) to plasma cultures was also explored. In the first stage, days 0-7, media is supplemented with stem-cell factor (SCF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3). The second stage until day 13 depends only on SCF supplementation and the third being only base media. On day 20 cells are leukofiltered to obtain a pure reticulocyte population. <bold>B</bold> Cumulative fold expansion (log<sub>10</sub> scale) of adult CD34+ cells differentiation grown in media containing either human AB serum, pooled human plasma, or pooled plasma supplemented with Cholesterol-Rich- lipids (CRL). <bold>C</bold> Percentage enucleation from day 11 of differentiation.

Cholesterol biosynthesis begins with acetyl-CoA and proceeds via HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), forming mevalonate and downstream intermediates (mevalonate-PP, isopentenyl-PP, and squalene). Squalene epoxidase (SQLE) converts squalene to 2,3(S)-oxidosqualene, leading to lanosterol and cholesterol synthesis. Fatty acid biosynthesis also originates from acetyl-CoA, with acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) producing malonyl-CoA, followed by fatty acid synthase (FASN) generating palmitate and complex fatty acids. SREBP1/2 transcription factors regulate these pathways, with SREBP1 driving fatty acid synthesis and SREBP2 controlling cholesterol biosynthesis. The LDL receptor (LDLR) mediates cholesterol uptake, maintaining lipid homeostasis.
