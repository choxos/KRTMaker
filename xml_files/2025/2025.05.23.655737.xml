However, producing large, high-quality ejaculates is costly by diverting resources from other fitness traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). The dependence of trait expression on resource availability and allocation between growth, maintenance, and reproduction is central to sexual selection theory, linking phenotypic quality to underlying genetic variation: traits that reliably indicate a male’s ability to acquire and allocate limited resources are hypothesized to signal heritable fitness benefits to mates or rivals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). This ‘good genes’ framework assumes that male condition is shaped by genetic variation in resource acquisition, allocation efficiency, or stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). However, the gut microbiome – a dynamic microbial consortium known to modulate host nutrient extraction, metabolic regulation, and hormone synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) – represents a potent, yet unexplored, factor that could decouple male condition from host genetics. Critically, by independently modulating host resource budgets, microbial communities could fundamentally alter the heritability of condition-dependent traits, thereby challenging a cornerstone of sexual selection theory.</p><p id="P3">The gut microbiome directly modulates host physiology, including nutrient assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), energy allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), and hormone signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), which collectively can influence reproductive function. Indeed, across diverse taxa, microbiome composition is well-documented to shape female reproductive biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), with functional differences between key bacterial groups (e.g., <italic>Acetobacter</italic> vs. <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) influencing metabolic and fecundity outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). By contrast, the role of the gut microbiome in male reproductive fitness, particularly its impact on fertilization success under sperm competition, remains entirely unexplored, despite limited associations between dysbiosis and impaired testicular function(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) or between seminal microbes to sperm motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Here, we tested the hypothesis that the gut microbiome modulates male reproductive fitness under competitive fertilization by enhancing condition-dependent ejaculate traits in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> a model for tractable host-microbe interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Specifically, we inoculated males with all 32 full-factorial combinations of five gut bacteria (<italic>Acetobacter orientalis, A. tropicalis, A. pasteurianus, Lactobacillus brevis,</italic> and <italic>L. plantarum</italic>). When present together, these species recapitulate key phenotypic traits of flies with intact microbiomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) and represent bacteria with established roles in female fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). We then quantified competitive fertilization success (P<sub>2</sub>) and its mechanistic underpinnings: sperm viability, transfer, and storage. We predicted that (i) males with diverse microbiomes outperform axenic (i.e., germ-free) or low-diversity males due to improved nutrient acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), (ii), competitive advantages are amplified by bacterial identity (e.g., <italic>Acetobacter</italic> abundance), synergistic interactions, and community composition (e.g., <italic>Acetobacter</italic>-dominance) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), and (iii) microbiome-driven gains in sperm viability, transfer efficiency and competitive storage underpin fertilization success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). By resolving how microbial communities shape sperm competition, this study bridges microbial ecology with sexual selection theory, offering novel insights into the evolution of condition-dependent traits.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>Microbial diversity enhances sperm competitiveness</title><p id="P5">To test if gut microbes influence male reproductive fitness under post-mating sexual selection, we compared the competitive fertilization success of male <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> inoculated with gut bacteria in all possible combinations between our five strains, using a full-factorial combinatorial approach (32 consortia) validated through colony morphology and 16S sequencing (Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). This combinatorial design—building on established gnotobiotic methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) but applied here to sperm competition—enabled high-resolution dissection of species interactions mediating host phenotypes. Standard competitor males (either axenic or conventional with intact microbiomes), which ubiquitously expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) for paternity assignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), mated three days before focal wild-type males, thereby providing distinct competitive contexts to resolve intrinsic microbiome benefits.</p><p id="P6">In competition against axenic rivals, we found experimental males harbouring any single bacterial species (except <italic>L. brevis</italic>) or consortium to outperform males without a microbiome, with second-male paternity (P2) increasing with species richness (generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) repeated across 1,000 bootstrapped datasets, accounting for block, microbial combination and overdispersion: <italic>N</italic> = 646 across 32 microbial combinations: odds ratio, <italic>OR</italic> = 1.09 [95% confidence limits: 1.00, 0.15]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Being associated with all five species translated into a 27% gain in P2 compared to the axenic state (mean proportion ± s.d. = 0.85 ± 0.05 vs. 0.67 ± 0.05, respectively). These patterns persisted when focal males competed against rivals with intact (unmanipulated) microbiotas [increase with richness: <italic>N</italic> = 624, <italic>OR</italic> = 1.05 [1.00, 1.10]; relative gain for 5-species association: 20% (0.72 ± 0.08 vs. 0.60 ± 0.03)], confirming that microbiome benefits reflect intrinsic physiological enhancement rather than competitor compromise.</p><p id="P7">This reproductive deficit in axenic males aligns with established connections between microbiome absence and physiological dysregulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Such microbial modulation of condition dependence likely extends beyond <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as gut microbiomes influence nutrient assimilation across the animal tree of life. While our study did not directly assay host metabolic states, prior work compellingly shows that axenic flies often exhibit hyperlipidemia and impaired insulin signalling – conditions detrimental to overall health and potentially sperm function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). These metabolic disturbances can be rescued or modulated by specific gut bacteria; for example, <italic>Acetobacter</italic> species are known to restore lipid homeostasis, potentially via acetate production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) (which may protect against sperm oxidative damage), whilst certain <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species exacerbate oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), which can directly compromise sperm membranes and DNA integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). In fact, <italic>Acetobacter</italic>- dominated communities conferred greater benefits than those biased toward <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, regardless of the standard competitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The contrasting impacts of <italic>Acetobacter</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> on P<sub>2</sub> based on their presence and absence were further supported by bootstrapped correlations between P<sub>2</sub> and the relative abundances (based on CFU counts) of each species across different microbial communities. These correlations yielded consistently positive and negative covariation with <italic>Acetobacter</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species, respectively, indicating a more quantitative pattern than sole presence or absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Combined, although our results establish that microbial diversity and particularly <italic>Acetobacter</italic> dominance directly enhance male competitive fertilization success, challenging classical frameworks attributing condition dependence solely to host genetics and resource status or stress resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Microbial interactions shape competitive outcomes</title><p id="P9">Bootstrapped generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs), controlling for experimental block, indicated that microbial interactions—rather than additive effects—were the primary drivers of variation in P2 across the 32 microbial consortia. There was no strong evidence for a five-way interaction among bacterial strains in sperm competition against either axenic males (<italic>N</italic> = 646, <italic>OR</italic> = 0.82 [0.55, 2.66]) or conventional rivals (<italic>N</italic> = 624, <italic>OR</italic> = 0.76 [0.40, 1.39]). However, after excluding these highest-order interactions, there was a clear four-way interaction among <italic>At</italic> × <italic>Ap</italic> × <italic>Lb</italic> × <italic>Lp</italic> in competitions against axenic males (<italic>OR</italic> = 1.84 [1.22, 2.77]) and among <italic>Ao</italic> × <italic>Ap</italic> × <italic>Lb</italic> × <italic>Lp</italic> in those against conventional males (<italic>OR</italic> = 0.67 [0.49, 0.93]), suggesting complex microbial effects on reproductive outcomes. Additionally, two and four three-way interactions, as well as six and eight of the ten two-way interactions had bootstrapped confidence intervals that excluded zero between the two models, respectively, further supporting a non-additive contribution of microbial composition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Predictive modelling showed that averaging mono-association effects between bacterial strains poorly forecasted outcomes for multi-species communities (e.g., mean of <italic>At, Ap</italic>, and <italic>Lb</italic> to predict the <italic>At-Ap-Lb</italic> combination), with only eight (30.8%) of the 26 possible combinations correctly predicted based on 95% confidence intervals including zero difference in competitive matings against axenic rivals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Averaging pairwise combinations to predict three-way species interactions (e.g., <italic>At-Ap, At-Lb</italic> and <italic>Ap-Lb</italic> to predict <italic>At-Ap-Lb</italic>) indicated similar accuracy (31.2%: 5 of 16 predicted combinations; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). These predictions by mono- or di-associations were broadly comparable when focal males competed against conventional rather than axenic first males (33.0 and 37.5%, respectively).</p><p id="P11">Additionally, pairwise interactions were context-dependent, varying conditionally on the remaining (“bystander”) species as reflected by interactions trending from positive (synergistic) to negative (antagonistic) between the same two species depending on the configuration of additional species in the microbiota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). This dependence on bystanders also held for three-way interactions between focal species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The prevalence of these non-additive effects reveals that microbial consortia function as integrated units—not mere sums of parts—mirroring ecological dynamics in host-microbe systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Such complexity suggests microbiome stability itself could be a target of sexual selection, with selection favouring host genotypes that stabilize high-performance communities (e.g., <italic>Acetobacter</italic> dominance), potentially explaining a microbiome-mediated resolution of the lek paradox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Mechanistic basis of microbiome-mediated fitness</title><p id="P12">To dissect how microbiomes enhance competitive fertilization success, we quantified sperm transfer, sperm viability, and female sperm retention and storage patterns, based on prior knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Due to the similar results between axenic and conventional competitor males, we here restricted our mechanistic investigation to axenic first males. For visualization of sperm, all assays except sperm viability involved standard and experimental males that, respectively, expressed green or red fluorescent protein in sperm heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We found that a more diverse microbiome directly translates into improved ejaculate quality, providing the mechanistic basis for enhanced competitive fertilization success (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). While axenic and mono-associated focal males transferred similar sperm quantities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), multi-associated males transferred 3–36% more sperm than either of the former categories, with gains scaling with microbial diversity (bootstrapped linear mixed model (LMM) controlling for block and microbial combination: <italic>N</italic> = 582, <italic>β</italic> = 57.14 [40.68, 76.47]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C,D</xref>). Sperm viability also increased with diversity: males with all five species had 94.9 ± 2.3% viable sperm compared to 54.5 ± 6.5% in axenic males (GLMM: <italic>N</italic> = 320, <italic>OR</italic> = 1.62 [1.52, 1.71]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E, F</xref>). Critically, freshly remated females tended to delay the ejection of displaced and excess sperm from first (standard) and second (experimental) males, respectively, if second males were associated with a more diverse microbiome (LMM: <italic>N</italic> = 582, <italic>β</italic> = 3.73 [-0.09, 7.39; 90%CI: 0.45, 6.90]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G,H</xref>), thereby increasingly biasing sperm storage toward these males (GLMM on relative sperm numbers in storage: <italic>N</italic> = 582, <italic>OR</italic> = 1.40 [1.34, 1.46]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I,J</xref>). Hence, microbiome-enhanced sperm quality or displacement efficiency biased post-mating sperm storage dynamics. Confirming prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), the relative numbers of sperm stored and their viability covaried with paternity outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Further, these phenotypic traits again covaried mostly positively with <italic>Acetobacter</italic> and negatively with <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> when considering relative colony forming units (CFUs) rather than species presence or absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Similar to P<sub>2</sub>, the component traits underlying competitive fertilization success were shaped by higher-order microbial interactions. Bootstrapped GLMMs revealed significant five-way interactions for both sperm viability (N = 320, <italic>OR</italic> = 0.29 [0.13, 0.63], <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>) and the proportion of second-male sperm stored by females (N = 582, <italic>OR</italic> = 2.34 [1.38, 4.11], <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). We detected a comparable five-way interaction in an LMM for time to female sperm ejection (N = 582, <italic>β</italic> = 150.10 [41.74, 255.22], <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). While no five-way interaction was found for the number of sperm transferred, a consistent four-way interaction among <italic>Ao × Ap × Lb × Lp</italic> emerged (N = 582, <italic>β</italic> = 393.09 [198.49, 582.51], <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>), with nearly all two- and three-way interactions also showing effect distributions shifted away from zero. Predictive models also indicated considerable underestimation of observed values for sperm viability and relative sperm storage when using additive models based on mono- or di-associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F,J</xref>), highlighting the importance of higher-order interactive effects. This dependence on microbial context appeared weaker for both the number of sperm transferred and time to sperm ejection. Across all stages of the competitive fertilization process, interactions among microbial pairs or triplets were often modulated by the presence of additional “bystander” species, emphasizing the context-dependent nature of microbial effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C–J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Evolutionary implications</title><p id="P15">The observed improvements in ejaculate quality and subsequent P2 gains conferred by species-rich microbial communities likely stem from their ability to restore or optimize host metabolic homeostasis and nutrient allocation toward reproduction. The superior performance associated with <italic>Acetobacter</italic>-dominated communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) lends support to this hypothesis, given their known efficacy in nutrient assimilation and influencing host metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). These microbes may channel resources more effectively towards energetically costly ejaculate production and maintenance, potentially mitigating damage from metabolic byproducts. However, the significant non-additive effects underscore that the <italic>integrated function</italic> of the microbial consortium, rather than simply the presence of key species, dictates the ultimate physiological impact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Although metabolite-specific mechanisms await future study, our reductionist approach definitively isolates microbiome contributions to sperm competitiveness.</p><p id="P16">Our findings prompt a re-evaluation of core tenets in sexual selection theory. By acting as an amplifier of condition-dependent reproductive traits, the microbiome introduces complexity to the “good genes” model, where such traits are assumed to reliably signal host genetic quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Our results suggest that the microbiome functions as a “hidden mediator,” bridging host genetics and environmental inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), with at least three key evolutionary implications.</p><p id="P17">First, the microbiome potentially introduces a transmissible component influencing fitness that is sensitive to environmental factors (diet, social context) and operates outside strict Mendelian inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). If microbial consortia are consistently acquired or partially transmitted (vertically or horizontally), this could contribute to maintaining heritable variation in sexually selected traits, offering a potential factor in resolving the lek paradox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Furthermore, the microbiome might act as an “environmental sensor,” allowing males to buffer reproductive output against nutritional fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), thereby stabilizing their fitness.</p><p id="P18">Second, the context-dependent microbial interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) and potential trade-offs (e.g., benefits vs. costs like oxidative stress potentially associated with <italic>L. brevis</italic>) suggest complex coevolutionary dynamics. Selection may favour host mechanisms for managing microbial partners (“screening” or selectively retaining beneficial symbionts), while microbes may adapt to host environments, potentially leading to conflicts or mutualisms influencing reproductive outcomes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Third, the influence of the microbiome clearly extends into the female reproductive tract. The finding that females preferentially stored sperm from males with more diverse microbiomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>) strongly suggests that microbiome-mediated enhancements to ejaculate quality (sperm function and viability, possibly seminal fluid composition) interact with female physiological processes. This opens a potential new dimension for cryptic female choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) with selection acting on microbiome-influenced male phenotypes. Critically, while our <italic>Drosophila</italic> model provides mechanistic tractability, microbiome-mediated condition dependence likely operates universally where sperm competition occurs.</p><p id="P20">The prevalence of synergistic effects also suggests that microbiome complexity and functional integration might themselves be targets of selection, favouring males capable of harbouring stable, high-performing microbial communities. Mechanistically, this could involve selection for host factors that influence microbial colonization, resource availability within the host environment, or the establishment of specific microbial interactions. Males with genotypes promoting a harmonious and efficient microbial ecosystem would likely experience enhanced physiological performance, ultimately translating to greater reproductive success.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Towards microbiome-integrated sexual selection</title><p id="P21">Realizing a comprehensive, microbiome-aware framework for sexual selection necessitates several key avenues of future research. Foremost among these is the need to elucidate the precise functional mechanisms underlying the observed fitness effects. This will require integrated ‘omics’ approaches (e.g., metabolomics, proteomics, transcriptomics) to map the links between microbial communities, their metabolites, and key ejaculate features influencing fertilization success. Alongside understanding the functional basis, it is also critical to determine how these fitness-enhancing microbiotas are maintained within populations. Future studies should therefore quantify the relative importance of different routes of transmission—including vertical passage, coprophagy, social interactions, or seminal transfer—and assess the stability, or heritability in a broad ecological sense, of beneficial microbial consortia across generations and varying environmental conditions.</p><p id="P22">Furthermore, exploring the role of females in these interactions would be an important avenue for future research. Investigations should examine female biases in both pre- and post-mating choice relative to potential male microbial cues or the enhanced quality of ejaculates produced by microbiome-rich males. A particularly crucial, yet unexplored, aspect is whether the female’s own resident microbiome interacts with the incoming ejaculate or associated microbes, potentially influencing sperm storage patterns and biasing competitive outcomes independently of male traits.</p><p id="P23">Finally, the ecological context and broader applicability of our findings require exploration. While host-manipulation becomes increasingly challenging in systems with richer microbiotas, our full-factorial study established core principles of microbial interaction hierarchies that likely scale to complex communities. Research should examine how diet-microbiome interactions shape male reproductive strategies under varying resource conditions. Critically, assessing generality in species with diverse mating systems and modes of microbial transmission will reveal the evolutionary scope of these interactions. Although natural microbiomes generally exceed five species, functionally defined ‘guilds’ (e.g., acetate-producers) can be modelled combinatorially. Given deeply conserved microbiome functions across taxa, our framework provides a blueprint for targeted manipulation of keystone interactions in other tractable systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P24">Our research demonstrates that the gut microbiome is an active participant in shaping male reproductive competitiveness.

These were either derived from an outbred wild-type population or, for standard competitors in the sperm competition assay, from a backcrossed population that had been genetically modified to ubiquitously express green fluorescent protein (GFP), permitting paternity assignment against the focal wild-type males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). To study biases in female sperm storage, we used focal males whose sperm heads expressed red fluorescent protein (RFP), and our standard competitors with ubiquitous GFP expression, permitting quantification of each competitor’s sperm inside the female reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). We maintained all fly populations at moderate densities under constant conditions of 25°C, 60% humidity, and a 12h:12h light:dark cycle.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Generating axenic flies</title><p id="P26">To generate axenic flies, we performed all steps hereafter in a laminar flow chamber to avoid contamination. First, we collected eggs from Petri dishes containing grape-juice agar with a smear of yeast paste that had been placed in four large population cages after a six-hour egg-laying period. After washing these eggs off the plates into a strainer, we dechorionated them with 3.5% bleach for 2 minutes, followed by a rinse in 70% ethanol and three rinses with sterile water. We then transferred these eggs to autoclaved standard fly food supplemented with antibiotics (ampicillin, kanamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline at final concentrations of 50, 50, 10, and 10 μg/ml, respectively) in autoclaved glass vials. These vials were then left undisturbed under standard conditions for flies to develop.</p><p id="P27">Upon fly eclosion, we collected both males and females as virgins, separated them by sex and confirmed their axenic state by plating a homogenized subsample of flies on LB and MRS agar followed by 16S PCR. Briefly, we extracted genomic DNA from 3-5 pooled axenic flies per sample using the ZymoBiomics™ DNA Microprep kit following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. We also extracted DNA from flies with an intact microbiome to serve as positive controls. For DNA amplification, we used bacterial universal primers 27F and 1492R as forward and reverse primers, respectively. We prepared the PCR master mix using 9.5 μl of nuclease free water, 12.5 μl kappa HiFi master mix, 1 μl of forward and reverse primer and 1 μl of template DNA. The PCR cycle included an initial denaturation at 95°C for 90 s, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, an extension at 72°C for 90 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 mins. We ran the PCR products on a 1% agarose gel and visualized them under ultraviolet light after staining with SYBR Safe (Invitrogen) to confirm the absence of bacteria in axenic individuals and the presence of bacteria in controls.</p><p id="P28">We maintained all females and standard competitors as axenic flies throughout the experiment and supplemented axenic focal males with different bacterial cultures to produce gnotobiotic associations as described below. All adult food was free of antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Bacterial cultures and gnotobiotic associations</title><p id="P29">Throughout this study, we used five bacterial species isolated from the gut of wild-type flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>): <italic>Acetobacter orientalis, A. tropicalis, A. pasteurianus, Lactobacillus plantarum,</italic> and <italic>L. brevis.</italic> We associated our focal flies with all 32 possible combinations among these bacterial strains following the general protocol of Gould et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). To prepare bacterial cultures, we grew them overnight: <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. in MRS (De Man–Rogosa–Sharpe) broth without shaking and <italic>Acetobacter</italic> spp. in MRS + mannitol medium at 30°C on a shaker. The next morning, we checked these bacterial cultures for growth and performed their optical density (OD) measurements at 600 nm. Then, we spun down these different bacterial cultures at 7000 rpm for 5 minutes and resuspended the resulting pellets to a concentration of 10<sup>8</sup> cells/mL in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Resuspension volume was determined following established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). Finally, we added a 50 μl (i.e., ca. 5×10<sup>6</sup> colony forming units, CFUs) of bacterial culture to sterile (but antibiotic-free) fly food vials, adjusting the volume per bacterial strain in multi-species associations for equal representation within a consistent total density, which itself was comparable to prior reports for conventional flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>).</p><p id="P30">After adding the bacteria to food vials and air-drying these under in laminar flow hood, we transferred 10 one-day-old axenic virgin males to each vial for inoculation with the added bacterial strains. We moved these males to fresh food vials with same bacterial treatment every alternate day for 5 days. Thereafter, we confirmed gnotobiotic associations by plating together the homogenates of 3-4 adult flies from same treatments and checking their colony morphologies, and by Sanger sequencing of 16S PCR homogenates. For multi-associations, we plated the fly homogenates and picked the distinct types of colonies from a given plate for PCR and performed sequencing to confirm that morphologically similar species corresponds to same species in all the replicates, thus allowing us to distinguish between different bacterial species by looking at their colony appearance. Thereafter, we tested the presence of the expected bacterial species in a particular bacterial combination by plating them and looking at the colony morphologies.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Bacterial abundance in different combinations</title><p id="P31">To determine bacterial abundance in different gnotobiotic associations, we counted the CFUs per fly for each bacterial species across the different gnotobiotic associations. To this end, we washed males with 70% ethanol, individually homogenized them with a pestle in microcentrifuge tubes, and then diluted these homogenates to different dilutions with a final volume of 100 μl to find a dilution with comparable colony counts (approx. 100 CFUs) for visual quantification. In gnotobiotic cultures with both bacterial genera, we transferred an aliquot of well-mixed fly homogenate to two plates, supplementing the MRS media of one plate with 10 μg/ml ampicillin to selectively inhibit the growth of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, while incubating the other in a CO2 atmosphere to prevent the growth of <italic>Acetobacter.</italic> We achieved within-genus differentiation of strains by colony morphologies: <italic>A. orientalis</italic> with flat colonies with ruffled borders, <italic>A. tropicalis</italic> with small tan coloured and highly reflective colonies, and <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic> with large tan colonies. Similarly, <italic>L. brevis</italic> produces brownish yellow colonies and <italic>L. plantarum</italic> milky white colonies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>). Using 16S PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing, we confirmed specificity of these colony properties, demonstrating the robustness of our method based on morphological identifications during experiments. After counting the number of colonies on each plate, we calculated CFU per fly as CFU = <italic>C</italic> × <italic>D</italic> × <italic>V</italic> / <italic>P,</italic> where <italic>C</italic> = number of colonies counted, <italic>D</italic> = dilution factor, <italic>V</italic> = volume of fly homogenate, and <italic>P</italic> = volume plated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Across all 10 replicate plates combination examined, the expected species were present, and none of the remaining species. Consistent with Gould et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), total CFU counts increased with species richness while the species-specific abundances declined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Sperm competitive ability</title><p id="P33">To investigate sperm competitiveness of focal males, we quantified their sperm offense ability (P<sub>2</sub>) by mating them as the second males with axenic females that had each mated with a an axenic GFP male three days earlier. We monitored the occurrence of copulations for 7-8 hours and transferred remated females to oviposition vials while giving those that did not remate another two 8-hour remating opportunities on the following days. Flies that did not remate by the last opportunity (within these 3 days) were discarded. We allowed all remated females to lay eggs for three days. After all progeny eclosed, we scored them for paternity under a fluorescence stereoscope, based on the presence/absence of the ubiquitous GFP marker in standard competitors. The proportion of second-male progeny indicated the focal-male sperm competitive ability (i.e., sperm offense). We replicated this experiment thrice with 30 replicates per bacterial treatment each time (total <italic>N</italic> = 2,880 trials).</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Sperm viability</title><p id="P34">We quantified sperm viability for 10 males per bacterial treatment (total <italic>N</italic> = 320 males). Once males were six days old and inoculated, we anaesthetized them on ice and dissected them on a microscopic slide to isolate the seminal vesicles from their reproductive tissue. We then placed one of the seminal vesicles in 10 μl of Ringers solution and punctured it with an insect pin to release the sperm mass for immediate staining with LIVE/DEAD fluorescent dye, following the principles of prior studies on <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). This two-component dye consists of SYBR-14 (‘LIVE’ component emitting green fluorescence), which is actively incorporated into living cells, and propidium iodide (PI, with red fluorescence) that can only permeate damaged membranes (typical of dead cells). We prepared an aqueous staining solution by combining 2.4 μl of SYBR-14 stock solution (1 mM in DMSO) and 4.5 μl of PI stock solution (2.4 mM in water) in 93.1 μl of Ringer’s solution. Then, we added 5 μl of the staining solution to the sperm sample before covering it with a coverslip and incubating it for 5 minutes in the dark. Under an Olympus BX50 fluorescence microscope with a GFP/RFP dual filter, we captured images of randomly chosen areas of each sample to later manually count at least 200 sperm and calculate the proportion of viable sperm in ImageJ v. 1.34(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Visualizing sperm competition within female reproductive tract</title><p id="P35">Since competitive fertilization events ultimately are the result of both male and female effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>), we investigated how females bias their sperm storage based on interactions with males supplemented with different microbiome. For this experiment, we again mated axenic virgin females first with an axenic GFP male and, three days later, with a focal male as for sperm competitive ability (above). To visualize sperm of both males, we used focal males expressing RFP in their sperm heads. Immediately after remating, we transferred females to individual wells of cell-culture plates, with a coverslip held in place with dots of rubber cement in two corners. We checked these females every 10 min for up to 6 h for the ejection of the sperm mass containing both displaced first-male and excess second-male sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). The timing and extent of sperm ejection have previously been reported to affect relative numbers of first- and second-male sperm stored by females and, consequently, competitive fertilization success among males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>).</p><p id="P36">Upon female sperm ejection, we recorded the interval from mating to ejection before removing females from the well and freezing them individually in Eppendorf tubes. Thereafter, we dissected these females and counted the green (standard competitors) and red sperm (focal males) within the female reproductive tract (paired spermathecae, seminal receptacle and bursa copulatrix) under a fluorescence microscope. From these counts, we determined S<sub>2</sub>, the proportion of all sperm stored by the female that came from the second (experimental) male. We also counted the respective sperm numbers in the ejected sperm mass to estimate, combined with above counts, the total number of sperm transferred by the second male and the number of first-male sperm still residing in storage at the time of remating. This experiment was performed in five blocks with 10 replicates per treatment for each block (total <italic>N</italic> = 1,600 remating trials).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="P37">All analyses were conducted in R v4.4.3 (R Core Team 2025), using bootstrapping procedures with 1,000 iterations to assess the stability and robustness of model estimates. To evaluate the effects of microbial diversity on reproductive outcomes, we resampled microbiome compositions (N = 32 unique consortia) and fitted mixed-effects models across all bootstrap datasets. These models included species richness (number of bacterial species) as a fixed effect and both experimental block and microbial composition (i.e., consortium identity) as random effects. Depending on the response variable, models were either linear mixed-effects models (for traits such as the number of sperm transferred and time to sperm ejection) or generalized linear mixed-effects models with a binomial error distribution and logit link function (for proportions of viable sperm, second-male sperm in storage, and second-male progeny). Binomial models included an observation-level random effect to account for overdispersion.</p><p id="P38">To examine the contribution of specific microbial interactions, we fitted similar mixed-effects models using the presence/absence of each bacterial species and their two- to five-way interactions as fixed effects, with block and, where appropriate, observation identity as random effects. In this interaction-focused analysis, we bootstrapped at the level of individual observations, stratified by microbial consortium, to retain the structure of specific combinations. All subsequent analyses used the same set of bootstrapped datasets for consistency and comparability.</p><p id="P39">To better understand the importance of species combinations in the microbiome and to isolate emergent effects beyond individual species contributions, we used an epistasis-based framework to elucidate how well the averaged phenotypic effects of single- or pairwise species associations predict higher-order phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). For single-species predictions, we compared the measured trait values of males associated with two- to five-species microbiotas to values averaged across mono-associated males that jointly represented the same bacterial combinations. These differences (averaged prediction minus measured trait value) were then plotted with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals to visually determine if predictions deviated from the measured estimates (i.e., confidence interval excluding zero difference). We then repeated this procedure to predict phenotypes by averaging the estimates of di-associated males (for calculations see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>)).</p><p id="P40">Following the same general principle, we further quantified how the presence or absence of non-focal (“bystander”) community members modulates both pairwise and three-way microbial interactions by exhaustively enumerating all possible bystander contexts. We then compared this “contextual” analysis against a “standard” test to reveal how higher-order community background shapes emergent effects on host traits. Following Gould et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) nomenclature, the “standard” test calculated the interaction coefficient among all species present in a specific community configuration, whereas the “contextual” tests assessed the interaction between a focal species pair within the context of additional bystander species. We computed interaction coefficients for each focal species pair or triplet across all possible presence/absence combinations of bystander species and plotted them with bootstrapped standard errors to highlight the varying directions of interactions depending on the bystander combinations.</p><p id="P41">In both the single/double-species predictions and these standard/contextual tests, we derived the coefficients to calculate the deviations from a mixed-effects models with an appropriate link function for each microbial combination, controlling for block effects. We repeated each model across 1,000 bootstrapped datasets to calculate the standard errors or 95% confidence intervals from the distribution of the calculated coefficient or interaction differentials.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS206021-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d21aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank W.

1</label><caption><p>Associations between the number of bacterial species in the microbiota and the different fitness traits. Each point indicates the mean of all replicate samples for a given microbiome consortium (N = 32). The lines and 95% confidence bands are derived from bootstrapped (generalized) linear mixed-effects models with microbiome composition and experimental block as random effects (for binomial models additionally also an observation-level random effect).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206021-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Variation in male fitness traits relative to their microbial community (left) and error in predicting these values for males associated with multiple species based on single- or pairwise species averages (right). In the left panels, colours indicate the different combinations of <italic>Acetobacter</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species associated with experimental males. The right panels depict the deviations in trait predictions from measured traits by averaging the corresponding coefficients of (generalized) linear mixed-effects models for individual species (orange points) or species pairs (green diamonds) that jointly represented the same species communities. The relevant microbial combinations are plotted in the same order across all panels. Error bars reflect 95% confidence intervals (from raw distributions in left panels, from bootstrapped prediction differentials in right panels). Sperm transfer in thousands, time to sperm ejection in hours, other variables in proportions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206021-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Correlations between the different phenotypic traits and the relative abundance (based on CFU counts) of each of the five bacterial species (left) and among the traits themselves (right). Values reflect the averaged correlation coefficients with 95% confidence limits of pairwise Pearson correlations across bootstrapped group means (<italic>N</italic> = 1,000 samples) among males with a given microbiome consortium. Relative abundances and proportional traits (sperm viability, S2, P2) were logit-transformed before bootstrapping.

For each code along the x-axes, 1’s indicate the species configuration of the interaction and asterisks denote placeholders for bystander species (order within codes from left to right: <italic>A. orientalis</italic>, <italic>A. tropicalis</italic>, <italic>A. pasteurianus</italic>, <italic>L. brevis, L. plantarum</italic>). The binary codes in the legends indicate the configuration of bystanders in the order, in which they would fill the placeholders (*) in each focal species configuration (1 = presence, 0 = absence). The right panels distinguish between the “standard” tests (grey triangles; i.e., global interaction across all community members present) and “contextual” tests (coloured points; i.e., separate interactions between a focal species pair or triplet for each bystander combination) for each focal triplet. All coefficients and propagated standard errors were derived from (generalized) linear mixed-effects models across 1,000 bootstrapped datasets.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206021-f004"/></fig></floats-group></article>
