Although all dicarbonyls disrupt biomolecular structure and function by forming advanced glycation end products, understanding the relative toxicity of each can help design targeted control strategies. Although known for cells, the comparative effects of distinct dicarbonyls on extracellular matrices (ECM) have yet to be benchmarked. Here, we investigate how glycation by three well known dicarbonyls: the C2-α-dicarbonyls methylglyoxal (MGO) and glyoxal (GO), and the C6-α-dicarbonyl 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG), affects two ECMs, Collagen I and laminin-rich basement membrane (lrBM), and alters their morphodynamic interactions with two human cells: untransformed endothelial TeloHAEC and aggressive triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231. On dicarbonyl-treated lrBM, endothelial and cancer cell adhesion, collective cord morphogenesis, cancer cell motility, shape polarity and its entropy are perturbed at low MGO levels, high GO levels, and are unchanged for 3-DG. Alcian Blue staining of lrBM shows dissolution of matrix at low MGO and high GO levels with no effect on 3-DG exposure. On collagen I substrata, adhesion for both cells is disrupted at low MGO levels, at high GO levels but is unchanged for 3-DG. Interestingly at high concentrations of MGO and GO, the latter decreases motility and increases elongation entropy more than the former; 3-DG has no effect. Picrosirius staining suggests that at high levels GO-driven collagen hyperpolymerization is similar to MGO with no effect of 3-DG. Our observations therefore suggest qualitative and quantitative distinctions in the effect of C2- and C-6-α-dicarbonyls on ECM homoeostasis and ECM-driven cellular morphodynamics.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Type 2 Diabetes</kwd><kwd>Dicarbonyl</kwd><kwd>Laminin rich basement membrane</kwd><kwd>Collagen I</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>adhesion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a chronic metabolic disorder associated with deregulated insulin signaling, is accompanied by an increase in blood glucose levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Hyperglycemia increases interstitial glucose in insulin-independent tissues like red blood cells, peripheral nerve tissue cells, endothelial cells, eye lens cells, and kidney epithelia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. It increases metabolic (glycolytic) flux and impairs the dicarbonyl detoxification system resulting in accumulation of dicarbonyl metabolites, also referred to as dicarbonyl stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Dicarbonyls are electrophiles that react with proteins, peptides, amino acids, phospholipids, and nucleotides and undergo complex chemical rearrangements like oxidation, reduction, and hydration, to form heterogeneous, stable, and irreversible end-products called advanced glycation end products (AGEs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Essential but pathological reactions involved in the formation of AGEs include Maillard reaction (non-enzymatic reaction that occurs between reducing sugars and amino groups)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, Polyol pathway (metabolic pathway that involves conversion of excess glucose to fructose via sorbitol)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, oxidation of glucose, and peroxidation of lipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The reaction of dicarbonyls with proteins inside cells alters their structures leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), apoptosis, anoikis, etc, whereas their reaction with nucleotides leads to DNA strand breaks and mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The accumulation of glycated proteins leads to chronic histopathological complications associated with T2DM including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Even newly diagnosed T2DM patients without any other complications have been reported to show a 1.62 fold increase in the presence of methylglyoxal, a well-known dicarbonyl, in the plasma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">AGEs can be formed by multiple reactive carbonyls. Examples include diacetyl, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, glyceraldehyde, glycolaldehyde, 1-deoxyglucosone, and 3-deoxyglucosone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Similarity in the crosslinks and receptor recognition factors of AGEs formed by α-oxoaldehydes like methylglyoxal (MGO), glyoxal (GO) and 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG) with glucose-derived AGEs makes them the most widely studied of glycating agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. These dicarbonyl metabolites have endogenous and exogenous sources. Pathways that result in formation of MGO include anaerobic glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glyceroneogenesis, ketone body metabolism, monosaccharide degradation, etc. GO is formed by metabolic pathways like glycolysis, lipid peroxidation, glycated protein degradation, oxidative degradation of serine, nucleotide degradation, etc. 3-DG is produced by enzymatic repair of glycated proteins, glycated protein degradation, monosaccharide degradation, fructose metabolism, etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Exogeneous sources include various food and beverages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. While MGO and GO are detoxified with the help of glutathione-dependent glyoxylase, aldoketo-reductases, and aldehyde dehydrogenase, 3-DG is detoxified with the help of aldoketo-reductases and aldehyde dehydrogenase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Pathological conditions like T2DM impair these detoxification pathways, increasing dicarbonyl levels by up to three-fold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. MGO is a C2-α-dicarbonyl with a ketone and an aldehyde group, GO is also an C2-α-dicarbonyl but with two aldehyde groups, while 3-DG is a C6-α-dicarbonyl with one ketone and one aldehyde group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Previous studies of these dicarbonyls on transformed keratinocytes reported MGO and GO increase cytotoxicity, reduce cell proliferation and alter cell cycle more than 3-DG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Amongst the three dicarbonyls, MGO has higher reactivity than GO and 3-DG as reported by the higher apoptosis of keratinocytes, higher reactivity with GSH (glutathione), and higher stimulation of VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor) production by peritoneal mesenchymal and endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. While MGO and GO are both C2-α-dicarbonyls, they show differences when it comes to reactivity, indicating the context-dependent roles of the dicarbonyls. On one hand, MGO interacts preferentially with arginine but also with lysine and cysteine residues, GO reacts preferentially with lysine but does react with arginine and cysteine too<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. 3-DG first reacts with arginine groups in a protein followed by lysine residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. This brings us to the impact of all these dicarbonyls on extracellular matrix proteins like collagen, laminin, fibronectin, elastin, consisting of these amino acids. There are reports on increased crosslinking of Collagen I, dissolution of laminin-rich basement membrane, destabilization of Collagen IV, decreased elasticity of elastin, and increased stiffness of collagen with the administration of dicarbonyl stressors, especially with MGO and GO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. However, a systemic comparison of the three most common dicarbonyl stressors (MGO, GO and 3-DG) on ECM and their effect on physiological and pathological processes is yet to be addressed.</p><p id="P4">Our work compares the impact on adhesion and migration of two cell lines on two different types of extracellular matrices treated with three different dicarbonyls. Our experiments include a non-cancerous endothelial cell line TeloHAEC and a triple breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231.

The three dicarbonyls that have been used to mimic diabetic microenvironment in the experiments we perform include MGO, GO and 3-DG.

To confirm that the cells only interact with the treated matrix and not with residual dicarbonyl stressors, lrBM was properly washed with 1X PBS. The dicarbonyl stressors before addition on lrBM and the solution collected after washing lrBM with 1X PBS were allowed to react with chromic acid. Chromic acid changes from orange to blue in presence of aldehydes; reaction of chromic acid with dicarbonyls before addition gave blue color and after wash gave orange color, indicating the absence of dicarbonyl stressors after the wash (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>).

This prompted us to study the migration of TeloHAEC after treating lrBM with 50 μM of MGO, GO and 3-DG for 1 d. Cells were added to the matrix after 1 d of treatment and migration was analyzed after 20 h of incubation (schematic of experimental assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1Bi</xref>). Endothelial cells tend to form meshed pseudo-capillary network structure on lrBM. Laminin, the primary component of lrBM, leads to “vascular mimicry” by endothelial cells that can initiate capillary-like multicellular tubular structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Hence, under untreated conditions, TeloHAEC were observed to form meshed networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1Bii</xref> left top untreated control). On lrBM-treated MGO at 50 μM, meshed networks did not form but rather remained as isolated cells or clusters; in contrast, they did form on lrBM treated with equivalent concentrations of GO and 3-DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1Bii</xref> middle top, left bottom, middle bottom).

Our study builds on previous observations made by our group and others on the effect of dicarbonyls on the extracellular matrix which serves as the scaffolding of tissues as well as reinforces the homeostatic state of their parenchyma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>; it then goes further and uses these assays to compare the specific effects of individual dicarbonyls on tissue organization and cellular morphomigratory traits. The results obtained for both cancerous and non-cancerous cells suggest a clear perturbation of both migration and adhesion on matrices treated with MGO at even low concentrations and with GO at high concentrations. 3-DG and low concentrations of GO seem relatively ineffectual at perturbing cell-matrix interactions. The alteration in adhesion on matrices treated with MGO and GO is phenomenologically similar for both endothelia and breast cancer cells, but the implications are drastically different. Untransformed cells upon loss in adhesion undergo anoikis and leave behind tissues that are vulnerable to invasion by pathological cell populations such as in cancer metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Cancer cells, on the other hand, are programmed to survive when detached from matrices; detachment, in fact, aids their invasive progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">We observe higher migration of cancer cells on C2-α-dicarbonyl-treated lrBM: the reason is the dissolution of the matrix leading to a likely measurement of cell migration on the underlying plastic substrata: lrBM is a confining sheet-like barrier for cancer cells and has to be breached for the cancer cells to migrate into stroma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. In contrast, we observe a decrease in migration of cancer cells on Collagen I treated with MGO and high levels of GO: although this may suggest an impaired kinetics of progression mediated by dicarbonyls, the association is worth re-examining, when the assay is made to further approximate in vivo histological complexity by incorporating normal untransformed parenchymal or stromal cells around the cancer cells. In this regard, the decreased migration of endothelia on dicarbonyl-treated matrix suggests impaired vasculogenesis and wound healing under carbonyl stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Lower migration of cells on glycated Collagen I substrata is associated with a decreased entropy of elongation, which implies that the cells are intrinsically less deformable and more rigid in such milieu. This suggests that mechanical cues from the glycated matrices are interpreted in distinct ways from control substrata by migrating cells resulting in altered cortical organization of the cellular cytoskeleton. We aim to test this hypothesis in future experiments through a combination of time lapse imaging and traction force microscopy.</p><p id="P29">The migration and adhesion data for both Collagen I and lrBM suggested a change in the matrix properties on exposure to dicarbonyl stressors. We observe dissolution of lrBM upon treatment with MGO and GO, with a more profound impact with MGO than similar concentrations of GO. There is no such change observed in case of treatment with 3-DG. LrBM, on the hand, dissolves in the presence of MGO and GO, faster under treatment with MGO than GO. In contrast, we observe insignificant dissolution in 3-DG-treated lrBM. The existent literature reports a similar chemical reactivity order of dicarbonyl stressors with GSH, where the difference in hydration of the three stressors has been considered to be the reason behind their order of reactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. The keto group of MGO is less susceptible to hydration than the two aldehyde groups of GO, making the former more electrophilic, and reactive towards nucleophilic proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Additionally, 3-DG forms a cyclic structure on hydration which contributes to its relatively lowest reactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. These findings imply that C2-α-dicarbonyls may not just be more reactive to extracellular matrices like Collagen I and lrBM than C6-α-dicarbonyls, there is also difference in the behavior of two different C2-α-dicarbonyls in their reaction with ECMs. However, the reactivity of MGO makes it also susceptible to glyoxalase-based conversion to D-lactic acid within cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. In the extracellular milieu, the lack of dicarbonyl-processing enzymes such as glyoxalase, aldoketoreductase and aldehydyde dehydrogenase, all of which are known to act on and decrease levels of dicarbonyls, results in MGO exerting a far greater pathological effect on matrix structure and organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P30">We wish to highlight the limitations of our study. While our experiments have been carried out with a triple negative breast cancer cell line and an endothelial cell line, the results may vary qualitatively or quantitatively for cancer cells originating from other tissues as well as non-cancerous cells. We have restricted our comparative analysis to three widely used dicarbonyls, but would like to extend the same to other dicarbonyls such as 3-DGal (3-Deoxygalactosone) and diacetyls which have their distinct signatures of cytotoxicity but whose effects on matrices are poorly, if at all, understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.
