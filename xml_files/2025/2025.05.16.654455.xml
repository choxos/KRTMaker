Fundamental questions also persist around the molecular and cellular events which set the metabolic programmes of diverse cell types across the body and how they adapt to nutrient excess or deprivation. While transcriptional regulation has been a major focus, growing evidence points to selective control over messenger RNA (mRNA) translation as a key layer of metabolic regulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Ribosomes, traditionally viewed as uniform translation machines, are now recognised to exhibit compositional and functional heterogeneity, enabling selective translation of specific mRNA subsets tailored to cell identifiy and function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) plays a central role in ribosomal structure and function, ensuring proper positioning of mRNA and transfer RNA (tRNA) to facilitate accurate codon recognition, which is crucial for maintaining translation fidelity. The small ribosomal subunit (40S) is tasked with decoding the genetic information. Its decoding centre closely monitors the base pairing between the mRNA codon and the anticodon of the aminoacyl-tRNA, thus ensuring correct amino acid incorporation into the growing peptide chain. Eukaryotic rRNA harbours over 200 post-transcriptionally modified nucleotides <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> – most commonly involving methylation – many of which occur at highly conserved and functionally important sites. Recent studies suggest these modifications can be dynamic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, raising the possiblilty that rRNA modifications are a potential driver of ribosomal heterogeneity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, the functional impact of many such modifications and their potential role in selective translational control remain unclear.</p><p id="P5">BUD23 (also known as WBSCR22/MERM1) is a highly conserved rRNA methyltransferase that has been implicated in the biogenesis and maturation of the 40S subunit and that acts together with its obligate dimerization partner, TRMT112, to modify guanosine 1639 (G1639) on human 18S rRNA to N(7)-methylguanosine (m<sup>7</sup>G) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. This specific modification has long been recognised, but remains of unknown functional consequence to translation. Our prior work demonstrated that global <italic>Bud23</italic> deletion in mice results in embryonic lethality, and its cardiomyocyte-specific deletion results in early postnatal death from cardiac failure, associated with altered mitochondrial function and insufficiency in cardiomyocyte energy production <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. These severe phenotypes limited mechanistic exploration.</p><p id="P6">Here, we investigate the role of BUD23 in energy metabolism using tissue-specific deletion in adipocytes and hepatocytes – key metabolic cell types. We show that BUD23 is a critical regulator of lipid and mitochondrial metabolism, with distinct effects depending on cell context. Mechanistically, we uncover a BUD23-dependent program of selective translational efficiency. BUD23-sensitive transcripts share distinct 5′ mRNA features, incuding short 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs), the presence of upstream open reading frames (uORFs), and high GC content immediately downstream of the translation start codon. These features are enriched among nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and lipogenic regulators, explaining metabolic phenotypes of BUD23 loss. Structural modelling of 48S pre-initiation complexes further supports a role for the BUD23-catalyzed m<sup>7</sup>G1639 modificaiton in translation initiation, via direct contacts with the initiator tRNA. Finally, human genetic analyses and Mendelian randomization indicate that BUD23 expression is associated with cardiometabolic traits including hepatic lipid content, body mass index, and obesity. Together, our findings identify BUD23-directed rRNA modification as a central regulator of selective translation and cellular energy state, with broad relevance to metabolic health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>Bud23</italic> is essential for normal lipid distribution and storage in white adipose tissue</title><p id="P7">To interrogate the role of BUD23 in regulating energy metabolism in mammals, we generated mice with selective deletion of <italic>Bud23</italic> in white and brown adipocytes using established transgenic lines (<italic>Bud23</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>; <italic>Adipoq</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A,B</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Under <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding conditions with standard chow diet, growth and body weight were similar between male mice lacking <italic>Bud23</italic> in adipocytes (<italic>Bud23<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, designated herein as Ad<sup>KO</sup>) and their littermate controls (<italic>Bud23<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, designated Ad<sup>WT</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, analyses of body composition revealed a striking phenotype, wherein Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice exhibited a pronounced attenuation of fat mass accumulation and a significant increase in lean mass relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). This lean phenotype in Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice was not associated with altered food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), nutrient absorption (as judged by faecal energy content; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), or locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). We did observe a small, and statistically significant, increase in daytime body temperature in the Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). However, housing the animals at thermoneutral conditions (28°C for 6 weeks) failed to normalise genotype differences in fat mass (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D,E</xref>), indicating that altered thermoregulation did not underly the altered adiposity of the Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice. A similar lean phenotype was observed in female Ad<sup>KO</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1F,G</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We next profiled metabolic gas exchange and energy expenditure. Despite the lean phenotype, Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice presented lower daily energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Furthermore, the mice exhibited a blunted diurnal profile in respiratory exchange ratio (RER) due principally to a significant reduction in RER at night relative to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). RER broadly reflects fuel utilisation (carbohydrate oxidation: RER ~1 vs fatty acid oxidation: RER ~0.7), and RER values &gt;1 can indicate elevated rates of lipogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Our findings thus suggest that the mice lacking BUD23 activity in adipocytes exhibit increased reliance on fatty acid oxidation and, possibly, reduced rates of <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis (DNL), both of which would contribute to the reduced fat mass.</p><p id="P10">Attenuated whole body fat mass in the Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice was reflected in a significant reduction in subcutaneous and visceral white adipose tissue (WAT) depots, starting at early age and greatly accentuated in older mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B,I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1H,I</xref>). Interestingly, histological analyses of gonadal WAT (gWAT) sections revealed relatively normal adipocyte morphology in the remaining WAT of these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>, insets; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1J,K</xref>). Serum triglycerides (TG) were unchanged between genotypes, yet Ad<sup>KO</sup> presented with significantly lower serum levels of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and glycerol, even at relatively early age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>). This suggests that reduced fat storage was not due to excessive lipolysis. To characterize adipose function more broadly, we next assessed circulating adipokine levels. In line with the lean phenotype, leptin, adiponectin, and resistin levels were all reduced in the Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1K</xref>), although the magnitude of effect implicates a more direct impact to adipokine production. Together, these findings highlight the profound disturbance in WAT function of Ad<sup>KO</sup> animals.</p><p id="P11">Given the significant attenuation of lipid storage in WAT, we next investigated possible compensatory accumulation of lipids within brown adipose tissue (BAT) and liver. Evident at the point of tissue dissection and further confirmed by histological examination, BAT showed accentuated lipid accumulation (“<italic>whitening</italic>”; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1L</xref>) in the Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice compared to controls. Similarly, the livers of these mice showed increased weight and TG content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1M,N</xref>). These findings suggest that attenuated WAT lipid storage capacity upon loss of BUD23 function drives excess secondary storage in organs such as liver and BAT. Stable isotope labelling with <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O (in drinking water, 48 hr) and [<sup>13</sup>C]-labelled D-glucose (bolus administration following short-term fasting) was used to assess rates of DNL across these tissues. Higher rates of hepatic DNL were confirmed by increased incorporation of both labels into palmitic acid (16:0) in the Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1O,P</xref>). By contrast, no differences were observed in BAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1O,P</xref>), although local alteration in rates of DNL may be masked by uptake of lipids from the liver. The observed increase in size, TG content, and DNL in the liver underscores a shift in lipid metabolism and storage dynamics in response to adipocyte-specific <italic>Bud23</italic> deletion.</p><p id="P12">In the Ad<sup>KO</sup> model, the deletion of <italic>Bud23</italic> occurs in both white and brown adipocytes. However, the phenotypic outcomes described above revealed striking differences, with attenuated and accentuated lipid accumulation in WAT and BAT, respectively. We hypothesised that the whitening of BAT in the Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice may be secondary to defective lipid storage in WAT. To address this possibility, we generated a <italic>Bud23<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>;<italic>Ucp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mouse line (BAT <sup>KO</sup>), in which <italic>Bud23</italic> is selectively deleted from only brown adipocytes. No differences in body weight, adiposity, or WAT depot weight were apparent in the mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A-D</xref>). However, intrascapular BAT tissue was significantly smaller and showed no evidence of whitening in the BAT <sup>KO</sup> mice compared with littermate controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>). The animals showed no overt differences in metabolic or thermogenic phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2F-G</xref>). These analyses highlight that while loss of <italic>Bud23</italic> clearly impacts BAT, the accentuated lipid accumulation in this tissue observed in the Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice is secondary to WAT dysfunction.</p><p id="P13">In an attempt to drive lipid accumulation in adipose tissues, we placed Ad<sup>WT</sup> and Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice onto high-fat diet (HFD; 60% energy from fat). As expected, control mice gained significant body weight and fat mass over the 9-week HFD treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1Q-S</xref>). In contrast, Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice were highly resistant to diet-induced obesity, accumulating significantly less fat mass. These findings demonstrate that adipocyte-specific <italic>Bud23</italic> deficiency impairs WAT lipid storage irrespective of whether the dietary energy source is carbohydrate-rich or fat-rich.</p><p id="P14">In summary, our results demonstrate that BUD23 is essential for lipid accumulation in WAT. The absence of complete adipocyte loss implies that explanations, such as defects in cell differentiation or survival, are unlikely to account for the observations. Instead, BUD23 appears to play a role in maintaining long-term lipid storage in WAT and preservation of mature white adipocyte function.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>Bud23</italic> is required for white adipocyte function, but not differentiation</title><p id="P15">We next isolated stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells from gWAT of Ad<sup>KO</sup> and Ad<sup>WT</sup> mice to directly examine adipocyte differentiation capacity <italic>in vitro</italic>. No defects in adipocyte differentiation efficiency, lipid accumulation, or lipid droplet formation in cells derived from Ad<sup>KO</sup> animals were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A,B</xref>). Furthermore, within these newly differentiated adipocytes, expression levels of endocrine hormones and lipid metabolism enzymes were normal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>). Hence, the lean phenotype observed in Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice <italic>in vivo</italic> is not due to an impaired capacity of adipocytes to differentiate.</p><p id="P16">Transcriptomics analyses on gWAT isolated from ~13-week old Ad<sup>KO</sup> and Ad<sup>WT</sup> mice (thus prior to the profound differences in fat mass that develop with age) revealed widespread differential gene expression associated with Bud23 deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We first assessed whether tissue cellular composition contributed to the transcriptional signatures observed. We therefore performed virtual cytometry analyses using CIBERSORT deconvolution 14, and leveraging published single-cell RNA-seq data from mouse gWAT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). While these analyses did not reveal profound changes to cell type composition, including adipocyte precursors, notable exceptions emerged. This included a significant reduction in <italic>lipid scavenging adipocyte</italic> (LSA) and <italic>lipogenic adipocyte</italic> (LGA) subpopulations, and a strong increase in <italic>stressed lipid scavenging adipocytes</italic> (SLSA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Although these analyses only infer cellular composition, the results align well with the observed <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype. LGAs, which are characterised by high expression of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and insulin responsiveness, likely contribute to DNL and efficient lipid storage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Their depletion in Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice, coupled with the concomitant increase in SLSAs, suggests a failure to properly manage and store lipids in the absence of BUD23.</p><p id="P17">We next undertook pathway enrichment on the gWAT transcriptomics. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed a striking downregulation of mitochondrial pathways, broadly affecting key metabolic processes, including respiratory electron transport, ATP synthesis, fatty acid β-oxidation, and branched-chain amino acid degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3D</xref>). Increased mitochondrial dysfunction was also predicted. Examination of key differentially expressed genes involved in adipocyte function, lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial activity revealed their extensive downregulation in Ad<sup>KO</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). The reduced expression of adipokine genes, such as <italic>Leptin (Lep)</italic>, <italic>Adiponectin (Adipoq)</italic> and <italic>Resistin (Retn)</italic>, was also consistent with the observed endocrine profiles of Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1K</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Bud23</italic> deletion did not cause uniform repression of all adipocyte-specific or metabolic genes. Instead, selective impact to key metabolic pathways, such as fatty acid synthesis, was evident. For example, <italic>Fatty acid synthase</italic> (FAS), key enzyme in fatty acid synthesis, exhibited a striking decrease in protein abundance in Ad<sup>KO</sup> WAT, while other markers remained relatively unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Analysis of mature adipocytes isolated directly from gWAT of Ad<sup>KO</sup> and Ad<sup>WT</sup> mice confirmed that observations made in whole tissue RNA-seq reflected <italic>Bud23</italic>-dependent reprogramming of white adipocytes <italic>per se</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Given the well-established influence of insulin over adipocyte function, we assessed insulin sensitivity in Ad<sup>KO</sup> and Ad<sup>WT</sup> mice. <italic>In vivo</italic>, clearance of circulating glucose in response to acute insulin administration was significantly attenuated in the knockout mice when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, gWAT explants derived from Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice showed a profoundly attenuated induction of <italic>Dgat2</italic>, <italic>Fasn</italic>, and <italic>Fabp4</italic> following insulin treatment, compared to the response in Ad<sup>WT</sup> explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We concluded from the above experiments that <italic>Bud23</italic> exerts profound influence over white adipocyte function, yet its effects are selective, with mitochondrial metabolism and lipid biosynthesis as key targets.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>BUD23 influence over lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function is conserved across white and brown adipose</title><p id="P20">White and brown adipocytes diverge in functional specialisation, with white adipocytes central to storage and liberation of energy (principally as TG/FAs) based on changing energy demands, while brown adipocytes oxidise FAs almost exclusively for the generation of heat. Therefore, we next assessed BAT function in the Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice to identify shared and divergent roles of BUD23 between these two adipose depots.</p><p id="P21">As highlighted above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>), Ad<sup>KO</sup> mice exhibited relatively normal profiles in body temperature suggesting maintained BAT function. This was confirmed through direct assessment of interscapular BAT temperature under normal housing conditions (~22°C±2°C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Moreover, both genotypes robustly maintained body temperature throughout the cold challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). In line with robust thermogenic capacity, BAT <italic>Ucp1</italic> did not differ between the genotypes at the level of RNA or protein expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B,D</xref>); although significant differences were observed in other thermogenesis-related transcripts. We therefore undertook RNA-seq analyses on BAT tissues derived from Ad<sup>KO</sup> and control mice, which identified significant numbers of differentially expressed RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). IPA pathways analyses of the RNA-seq data revealed clear enrichment of mitochondrial protein-encoding transcripts – characterized by the downregulation of key metabolic pathways such as fatty acid oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the respiratory chain, and branched-chain amino acid catabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Given that BUD23 is an enzyme known to modify rRNA near the ribosomal decoding centre 9, altered translation is a likely consequence of <italic>Bud23</italic> deletion. Indeed, proteomic analyses of identified widespread differential protein expression between Ad<sup>KO</sup> and Ad<sup>WT</sup>-derived BAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). IPA pathway analyses revealed a significant enrichment for mitochondrial proteins and those involved in branched chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). Downregulation of BCAA upon loss of <italic>Bud23</italic> has been consistently observed between WAT and BAT analyses, with pronounced reduction in the expression of key enzymes such as BCAT2 observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4E</xref>). Interestingly, the proteomics analysis of BAT also identified two ribosome/translation-associated pathways as significantly dysregulated: the <italic>Regulation of eIF4 and p70S6K Signalling</italic> and <italic>mTOR Signalling</italic> pathways. Both pathways involve overlapping gene sets that include ribosomal protein genes, translation initiation factors, and key signalling components critical for regulating both global and transcript-specific translation in response to hormones, nutrients, stress, and other signals.

The C41 residue is critical for maintaining the unique conformation of initiator-tRNA, distinguishing it from elongator tRNAs, and ensuring proper start codon recognition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Our structural analyses indicate that the N7-methyl group of m<sup>7</sup>G1639 fills a hydrophobic pocket that helps stabilize this interaction, while the positive charge conferred onto the guanosine ring by the methyl group (quaternary nitrogen at N7) enables cation-π stacking with Trp35 of ribosomal protein sE25/RPS25, particularly in the late initiation complex 48S-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5K</xref>).

In the CDS start codon environment, we quantified the Kozak sequence score; three proxies for RNA structure – GC-content in a 60 nt window preceding the initiation codon (-60 nt) or following it (+60 nt, ramp region), and RNA folding minimal free energy (MFE) over the ±60 nt window; as well as codon bias (low scores indicate higher proportion of rare codons).</p><p id="P38">Transcriptome-wide analyses showed that lower 5′ UTR coverage in Liv<sup>KO</sup> was primarily correlated with 5′ UTR length and the presence of translated uORFs, and anticorrelated with 5′ UTR GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8F,G</xref>). For CDS TE and normalised Start TE we detected strong anticorrelation with GC content (in the 5′ UTR and around the initiation codon), as well as with MFE.

To disentangle these effects, we applied linear regression modelling to identify the primary predictors of variance in the translation outcomes. The model identified 5′ UTR GC content as the predominant predictive feature throughout (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8I</xref>) with variable additional contributions from 5’ UTR length/CAGE distance, RNA folding MFE, and other predictors to lesser extent.</p><p id="P39">We observed globally lower CDS TE for mitochondrial protein mRNAs in Liv<sup>KO</sup> liver tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>).

We therefore examined if these effects on mitochondrial mRNAs were associated with any of the above transcript features. In these analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6D-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8J-O</xref>), we observed that the GC content in the 60 nt downstream of the start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>) was specifically elevated among mitochondrial transcripts.

Metagene analyses on transcript sets selected for high vs. low +60 GC contents further revealed the profound influence that GC content after the start codon has over ribosomal occupancies post-initiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8P</xref>). For mitochondrial transcripts, GC-content is indeed specifically increased in the post-initiation region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8Q</xref>), where codon composition is biased towards GC-rich codons for alanine, arginine and leucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>). These are common amino acids in the amphipathic α-helices that make up mitochondrial targeting signals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the association between high +60 GC content with reduced ribosome occupancy post-initiation seen across hundreds of mitochondrial protein transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H</xref>) extended to the translation level of the CDS as a whole – mitochondrial transcripts scoring very high for +60 GC content thus also showed particularly reduced CDS TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6I</xref>).</p><p id="P40">Another striking mitochondrial transcript feature was short 5′ UTRs – an effect that was highly significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>) and correlated with diminished 5′ UTR ribosome occupancy in Liv<sup>KO</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6J</xref>). When we further correlated 5′ UTR length with TE changes occurring on the CDS, we observed that many mitochondrial transcripts that carried extremely short UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6J</xref>) showed specifically strong reduction in CDS translation in Liv<sup>KO</sup> tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6K</xref>).

Other mitochondrial transcripts where short 5′ UTR and high +60 GC content synergised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6I,K</xref>) and CDS TE was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6L</xref>), were, for example, Cox6a1 (a nuclear-encoded subunit of the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain, Cytochrome c oxidase, COX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6N</xref>) or <italic>Ak3</italic> (an adenylate kinase necessary for TCA cycle activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6O</xref>).

This modification is located near the decoding centre, adjacent to the P- (peptidyl) and E- (exit) sites, and is unique in that it introduces a positive charge and alters local steric constraints within a structurally restricted region. These local changes likely perturb ribosome-mRNA interactions in a manner that selectively alters translation dynamics. However, the physiological role of BUD23, particularly in mammalian tissues, has remained largely unexplored.</p><p id="P49">In this study, we show that BUD23 exerts selective translational control critical for mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism, with profound effects in white and brown adipose tissue as well as liver.

In contrast, in BAT, loss of <italic>Bud23</italic> results in lipid accumulation and tissue whitening, likely reflecting impaired mitochondrial beta-oxidation. BAT is rich in mitochondria and relies heavily on mitochondrial respiration to fuel its thermogenic function (Cannon,Nedergaard, 2004). In our model, however, thermogenic function remains largely preserved, pointing to a distinct and intriguing mitochondrial phenotype. In summary, the opposing adipocyte phenotypes – lipid loss in WAT and lipid accumulation in BAT – underscore a shared mitochondrial dysfunction but reveal tissue-specific consequences, potentially driven by differences in mitochondrial content and the energy storage vs. expenditure roles of these adipose depots.</p><p id="P50">The liver exhibits a milder phenotype, but mitochondrial defects remain a primary outcome. This is supported by our ribosome profiling data that revealed changes to the translation of mRNAs specifying nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. Mechanistically, our findings support a model in which BUD23-modified ribosomes are optimized for translation of a critical subset of mitochondrial mRNAs. These transcripts often bear structural and sequence features that can challenge canonical initiation, such as very short 5′ UTRs and high GC content immediately downstream of the initiation codon. This GC bias is a predictable consequence of the amino acid composition of N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences, which are often amphipathic and rich in arginine and leucine. These features may predispose such transcripts to inefficient initiation, making them particularly dependent on BUD23-modified ribosomes for effective translation. This model provides a mechanistic explanation for the coherent mitochondrial dysfunction across tissues.</p><p id="P51">We also uncover a disruption in energy-sensitive translational regulation. Normally, 5′ TOP-containing mRNAs – mostly encoding ribosomal proteins and translation factors – respond dynamically to nutrient availability via mTOR signalling. In <italic>Bud23</italic>-deficient livers, this regulation is abrogated: 5′ TOP mRNA translation remains elevated during the light/fasting phase, indicating a decoupling of nutrient sensing and translational control. This may reflect altered ribosome activity due to altered 40S maturation or mRNA engagement during initiation, suggesting that <italic>Bud23</italic> contributes to the broader translational architecture that enables metabolic adaptation. While the precise integration of global and transcript-selective effects remains unclear, the observed specificity for mitochondrial mRNAs is not readily explained by general effects in ribosome biogenesis alone. These findings argue for an active regulatory role for BUD23’s methyltransferase activity in shaping the translational landscape.</p><p id="P52">An intriguing possibility raised by our findings is that m<sup>7</sup>G1639 modification may not be constitutive but instead dynamically regulated. Although BUD23 is generally considered a constitutive factor, growing evidence from other rRNA-modifying enzymes suggests that activity and expression may vary across tissues and physiological states. Indeed, viral manipulation of the BUD23-dependent methylation site has recently been described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, raising the possibility of endogenous regulation. If so, dynamic installation of this rRNA modification could provide a powerful mechanism to tune ribosome activity and selectively modulate translation of metabolically critical transcripts. This raises the exciting possibility that BUD23 itself may be modulated by metabolic inputs, forming a feedback loop between nutrient state, translational output, and energy homeostasis. Moreover, a broader rRNA-modification network – including other TRMT112 partners such as METTL5 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> – may have evolved to tune ribosomal activity according to metabolic needs.</p><p id="P53">Finally, our study connects these mechanistic insights to human health. While BUD23 has previously been associated with cancer and inflammatory disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, its role in metabolic organs had not been clearly defined beyond our previous work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Notably, BUD23 is located within the critical deletion region of Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS), a multisystem disorder characterized by cardiovascular and metabolic phenotypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Although multiple genes are deleted in WBS, our finding that <italic>BUD23</italic> is strongly associated with liver fat content (MASLD), body mass index, and obesity suggests it may meaningfully contribute to the metabolic features of this syndrome. Extending our large-scale genetic analysis to the related <italic>METTL5</italic> revealed partially overlapping protective associations, whereas TRMT112 showed minimal effects. These findings integrate functional and genetic data to support a key role for BUD23 in metabolic homeostasis and underscore its potential relevance to cardiometabolic health and disease.</p><p id="P54">Together, our findings define BUD23 as a key regulator of ribosome specialization, selectively enhancing translation of mitochondrial mRNAs critical for energy metabolism. By linking nutrient sensing, translational control, and mitochondrial function, BUD23 emerges as a central node in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Animals</title><p id="P55"><italic>AdipoqCREBud23fl/fl</italic> (AdKO), <italic>UCP1CREBud23fl/fl</italic> (UCPKO) and <italic>Alb<sup>CreERT2</sup>Bud23<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (LivKO) mice were generated by crossing AdipoqCre (JAX laboratory, Strain #:028020), UCP1Cre (JAX laboratory, Strain #:024670) and AlbCreERT2 (given by Prof. Pierre Chambon, GIE-CERBM (IGBMC)) respectively, with Bud23flox/flox (generated at the University of Manchester (UK) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.

Samples were washed with buffer (0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.2), stained with 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide in buffer, then rinsed with MilliQ water. Samples were further stained with 2% uranyl acetate in water, rinsed again with MilliQ water, then dehydrated through an ethanol series (30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 95% and absolute ethanol). Samples were then infiltrated with 25%, 50%. 75% and finally 100% low viscosity resin (TAAB) in ethanol. Samples were removed from the microwave processor and submerged in fresh 100% resin, then placed on a rotator overnight. Samples were incubated on the rotator for the following 4 days, with changes into fresh resin twice per day. The samples were embedded on the afternoon of the final day and polymerised at 60°C for 48 hours. Sections of 90 nm were cut from the resin blocks using a Leica UC7 Ultramicrotome and collected onto 3 mm copper grids. The sections were then post-stained with lead citrate and imaged using a JEOL Flash 120kV TEM equipped with a Gatan Rio camera. Analysis was done using Image J.</p></sec><sec id="S49"><title>Structural models</title><p id="P98">For structural models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7</xref>, PDB entries_8pj1-5 were loaded in Swiss-PdbViewer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> and the m<sup>7</sup>G1639 methyl group was added by superposing the guanine aromatic ring of pdb entry 5H3T chain A:MGT801 onto PDB entries 8pj1-5 G1639 guanine aromatic rings.

Three “Outcomes”, shown at the top of figure, were extracted from the ribo-seq profiles and quantified transcriptome-wide – translation efficiency (TE) change on the 5’ UTR (indicative of uORF translation), TE change on the whole CDS (i.e. change in overall translation rate) and specifically within the first 20 codons (the “ramp effect”). These were correlated with “Features” of transcripts, pertaining to the 5’ UTR – presence of ATG, (C/G/T) TG, UTR length as determined from cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) data, GC content – or the CDS initiation codon environment – KOZAK score, GC content, minimal free energy of folding (MFE), codon bias. (<bold>B</bold>) Spearman correlation coefficients between transcript sequence features (y-axis) and translation efficiency log2 fold-changes (beween Liv<sup>KO</sup> and Liv<sup>WT</sup>) at 5’ UTRs (first panel), CDSs (second panel), and the Start codon region (first 20 codons) relative to the whole CDS (third panel). TE fold changes were calculated as the average over the separate TE fold changes for the two Zeitgeber time points (ZT6 and ZT18). Bars are coloured according to correlation p-value.
