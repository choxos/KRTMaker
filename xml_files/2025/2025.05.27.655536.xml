Most proposed applications for such enzymes require their purification, enabling the regeneration of monomeric subunits suitable for the production of new plastic. However, large amounts of plastics exist as environmental contaminants, and are unlikely to be suitable for standard recycling. Such waste may still be suitable for bioremediation using enzymatic activities, albeit without the economic incentives of a full recycling process. Here we develop a delivery system for PET hydrolases, based on engineered yeast biofilms that grow and secrete enzymes directly on the substrate to be degraded. The system does not require any enzyme purification steps, and the biofilms at least partially assimilate the degradation products into biomass. Our work provides proof-of-principle that demonstrates the potential of biofilm-based approaches.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Plastics include some of the most widely used synthetic materials and constitute key environmental pollutants. A high proportion of plastics are produced for single use applications, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-based beverage and food containers. Although rates of recycling of PET-based materials are increasing, historical recycling rates are low, and only 9% of all plastics ever produced have been estimated to be recycled into secondary materials or products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). The remainder have been discarded to landfill or into the environment.</p><p id="P3">Once discarded, the lifetime of PET materials is estimated to be on the scale of decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) or centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Degradation of macroscopic items frequently involves release of smaller PET particles in the millimetre to micrometre range (microplastics), a process that is accelerated by agitation for example in marine surf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) or in areas subject to wind abrasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Following decades of uncontrolled plastic disposal, plastic and microplastic contaminants are now found in all areas of the environment, from remote mountain top lakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) to the gastrointestinal tract of benthic deep-sea organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) and inside humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). While both technical and consumer behaviour aspects of recycling are intensely researched and this can help to reduce rates of the introduction of new plastic waste into the environment, it does not address existing environmental contamination. Large-scale clean-up operations are underway to recover macroscopic plastic waste from the marine environment, but similar efforts for terrestrial contamination are not yet emerging, and microplastics remain challenging to remove from any environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The discovery of PET hydrolases that naturally degrade PET with moderate activity, such as <italic>Ideonella sakaiensis</italic> PETase (<italic>Is</italic>PETase) and Leaf Compost Cutinase (LCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), coupled with the application of engineering approaches to increase the specific activity of these enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), could be a promising solution for the bioremediation of environmental plastic contaminants.</p><p id="P5">Since expression levels in their native organisms are too low for industrial applications, a variety of heterologous expression systems have been developed for PET hydrolases, with some representative examples shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>. Some of these systems aim at the high-level production of enzymes for purification, and can now reach gram per litre yields for the most optimised expression systems. Other applications aim to enable PET hydrolase delivery in non-purified form, for example as whole cell catalysts where the enzymes are linked to the cell wall of the expression host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Such systems typically generate lower expression yields, which are nevertheless compatible with their specific intended purpose.</p><p id="P6">The most common proposed applications for PET hydrolases involve their purification and application to clean post-consumer plastic, which enables the generation of PET monomers suitable for the re-polymerisation of virgin PET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). While this approach is promising for clean post-consumer waste, existing environmental plastic contaminants are typically of mixed composition including environmental debris, from which they cannot easily be separated. Moreover, they may be chemically altered through the influence of UV and oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), which may make them difficult or impossible to fully recycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). PET hydrolases could still be used to remove such contaminants and turn them into bio-accessible breakdown products, but if these products are then not used to produce new PET the process would lose financial incentive, and the additional costs of enzyme purification could be a deterrent from applying enzyme-based bioremediation strategies.</p><p id="P7">For applications where the main intention is bioremediation, for example the enzymatic removal of contaminated plastic recovered from the environment, enzyme purification would in principle not be necessary if the enzymes were active in crude cell extracts or growth supernatants. However, achieving the high enzyme-to-plastic ratios required for efficient degradation (optimally above 2 mg enzyme per g plastic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>)), would be challenging in such formats. We reasoned that one way of addressing this limitation could be through the formation of biofilms by the expression host on the degradation substrate.</p><p id="P8">Biofilms are formed by the attachment of cells to surfaces and their concomitant growth and embedding into extracellular matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). They can be formed by single species or can be polymicrobial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), and are prevalent in a diverse range of ecosystems, spanning both marine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) and terrestrial environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Biofilm-embedded cells can often withstand environmental and other stresses better than planktonic cells, including sub-optimal pH and salinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Moreover, growth in biofilms can improve productivity in recombinant protein expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Surface hydrophobicity is a dominant characteristic determining the efficiency of biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), meaning that plastic materials are naturally good biofilm substrates. Indeed, environmental plastic is frequently colonised by both microscopic and macroscopic organisms, giving rise to the notion of the “plastisphere” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Yeasts and other fungi are particularly active in biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) as well as having well defined pathways for secreting proteins into extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Their biofilm matrix is composed of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), secreted proteins and other biomolecules that embed the cells and stabilise the biofilm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Diffusion within the biofilm matrix is significantly more limited compared to liquid medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), and one can thus make the rational argument that the secretion of plastic degrading enzymes within a yeast biofilm matrix should lead to an increase in enzyme concentration close to the plastic surface. Recent results on the association rate between <italic>Is</italic>PEtase and PET surfaces, which reported results as low as 1000 association events per second per μm<sup>2</sup> and M enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), indicated that increasing enzyme concentration close to the plastic surface could be a particularly powerful way of enhancing degradation rates.</p><p id="P10">With these considerations in mind, we developed yeast secretion systems that deliver active PET hydrolases into the growth medium. We observed evidence of plastic degradation both with planktonic cells and with biofilms, with significantly stronger degradation activity observed with biofilms. Overall, our work provides proof of principle for the application of engineered biofilms in the remediation of environmental plastic contaminants and enable us to define requirements for the development of biofilm-based systems with sufficiently high activity levels to enable actual environmental applications.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Expression of secreted IsPETase in baker’s yeast</title><p id="P11">To explore whether baker’s yeast was able to secrete PET hydrolases, we initially introduced expression optimised genes for <italic>IsPETase</italic> into two common laboratory yeast strains, BY4741 and Σ1278b. Following growth of the transformed strains in defined medium we tested for anti-HA reactive bands in both cell extracts and growth supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The theoretical molecular weights are 36.2 kDa for the full-length protein and 31.4 kDa following cleavage of the signal sequence. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1B</xref>, an HA-reactive band around the correct molecular weight for the latter product was observed in cell extracts. In addition, we also observed higher molecular weight bands in cell extracts, and supernatant samples exclusively showed higher molecular weight bands.</p><p id="P12">Baker’s yeast modifies some secreted proteins through addition of O- and N- linked glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), and we reasoned that the higher molecular weight bands in the supernatant could correspond to glycosylated <italic>Is</italic>PETase. Consistent with this hypothesis, a computational glycosylation prediction tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>) identified 5 asparagines in the <italic>Is</italic>PETase sequence as high confidence glycosylation substrates (quality scores &gt;0.9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). To further test whether the high molecular weight bands corresponded to glycosylated <italic>Is</italic>PETase, protein samples precipitated from the growth supernatant were treated with Endo Hf, an enzyme that cleaves asparagine-linked high-mannose glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Following Endo Hf treatment, a significant reduction in molecular weight was observed, with a distinct central band migrating around the molecular weight of the main intracellular product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We conclude that the high molecular weight bands observed in the cell culture supernatants correspond to glycosylated <italic>Is</italic>PETase.</p><p id="P13">Glycosylation is frequently introduced into proteins in response to incomplete folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). The modification increases the solubility of its targets and enhances their ability to fold correctly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). <italic>Is</italic>PETase has been engineered for higher thermostability, mostly with the aim of enabling degradation above the glass transition temperature of PET, where PET polymer chains can be more easily accessed by the enzyme. In addition to allowing enzyme activity at higher temperatures, higher thermostability can also result in more stable conformations at intermediate temperatures. We therefore explored whether the degree of glycosylation in yeast <italic>in vivo</italic> was altered for PET hydrolase variants that had been selected for increased thermostability. Indeed, when we compared levels of secretion of wild type <italic>Is</italic>PETase (T<sub>m</sub> 45°C), <italic>Is</italic>PETase<sup>Ts</sup> (T<sub>m</sub> 56.8°C)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>) and hotPETase (T<sub>m</sub> 80.5°C)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>) we observed a gradual increase in expression coincident with a higher proportion of less extensively glycosylated protein. This effect was particularly pronounced for the hotPETase variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>). In addition, two variants of another PET hydrolase, the generally very thermostable Leaf Compost Cutinase (LCC, T<sub>m</sub> 86°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>); and LCC<sup>ICCG</sup>, T<sub>m</sub> 91.7°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>)), were both expressed without any apparent glycosylation, with the more stable variant showing higher secretion levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>). These results confirm the connection between folding stability and secretion. Interestingly, expression of LCC in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> was shown to produce glycosylated enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>) whereas we observed no glycosylation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, indicating that the presence or absence of glycosylation is also organism- and context-specific.</p><p id="P14">We estimated secretion yields for HA-tagged hotPETase, the most highly expressed of our PET hydrolases, by comparing western blot signals of growth supernatants from a hotPETase expressing strain against HA-tagged protein standards of know concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental figure 1</xref>). From these data we estimate that hotPETase is secreted to levels of 400 μg/l. In comparison to other expression systems these levels are at the lower end (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>), but they are comparable with other specialised expression systems where the primary aim is to enable particular deployment modes for the enzyme, rather than bulk enzyme production for purification. If biofilms were able to strongly concentrate the secreted enzyme in the vicinity of the degradation target, these expression levels should be sufficient to achieve PET degradation provided the secreted enzymes are active.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Yeast biofilm formation on PET substrates</title><p id="P15">We investigated the ability of two yeast strains to form biofilms on PET surfaces, of which one (Σ1278b) has been reported to form biofilms efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>), whereas the other (BY4741) does not. Post-consumer PET samples were incubated with logarithmically growing cultures of these two strains, and cell adherence to the plastic surface quantified via a crystal violet staining assay. In this assay Σ1278b attached to the PET surface more efficiently than BY4741 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4A</xref>). We investigated the nature of this attachment in more detail by examining early (1 day-old) biofilms of Σ1278b grown on PET coupons, where yeast cells were stained with calcofluor white (CFW). At this early-stage yeast form small biofilm seeds distributed over the entire plastic surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4B</xref>). The samples had been washed with buffer prior to imaging, demonstrating that attachment of these seed biofilms to the surface is stable. Comparison of colony sizes on the smooth coupon surface with colonies on the rough outer edge where the coupon had been cut revealed that seeds were significantly larger in the latter area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4C</xref>, average diameter 4.7 μm in the rough area <italic>vs.</italic> 2.3 μm in smooth), indicating that seeds form more easily around crevices and other surface faults. Moreover, when we investigated PET samples incubated with Σ1278b for 96 hours, larger, confluent areas of biofilm formed around the rough outer edge of the PET coupon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4D</xref>), demonstrating that such biofilms can be stable and remain viable over several days.</p><p id="P16">A potential issue with the use of biofilms to degrade plastic is that yeast media are naturally slightly acidic, and yeast further acidifies growth media during the culture cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). In contrast, commonly used PET hydrolases are most active under alkaline conditions, with optima around pH 8-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Yeast cells tolerate media that are buffered to neutral pH well, and indeed show longer chronological life span in such buffered media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). To explore whether it was possible to buffer yeast cultures to a pH where <italic>Is</italic>PETase had higher activity, we tested yeast growth rates in media buffered to different target pH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental figure 2</xref>). From pH 7 to pH 8, we observed that growth rates showed a moderate decline, but yeast grew actively and reached similar biomass as in unbuffered medium. At higher pH (&gt;8.5), yeast appeared to show a very long lag phase, before eventually resuming growth. In the following we therefore conducted degradation assays in media buffered to pH8, which is both compatible with efficient yeast growth and high <italic>Is</italic>PETase activity.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Degradation of PET by IsPETase-secreting yeast biofilms</title><p id="P17">To visualise PET degradation, we incubated coupons of amorphous PET film in growing cultures of <italic>Is</italic>PETase-secreting yeast strains. Following 96 hours of growth, PET surfaces were washed to remove attached yeast cells and visualised using two different imaging approaches, AFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5A and B</xref>) and SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5C</xref>). Coupons incubated with yeast containing a control vector showed smooth surfaces with only few surface abrasions that appeared mechanical in origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, coupons incubated with <italic>Is</italic>PETase-secreting yeast showed widespread changes to the PET surface indicative of PET degradation activity. These surface changes were less extensive on coupons incubated with the non-biofilm forming BY4741 strain, where they appeared as a general surface roughening in AFM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5A</xref>), and as small irregular holes in SEM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5C</xref>). Incubation with <italic>Is</italic>PETase secreting, biofilm forming Σ1278b resulted in more extensive surface changes visible as strong pitting in both imaging modes. We quantified these results by determining the surface roughness in our AFM images, confirming quantitatively that incubation with the biofilm-forming Σ1278b strain produced much stronger surface changes than the non-biofilm forming BY4741 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P18">As further evidence that yeast-secreted PET hydrolases are active, we sought to detect degradation products in the yeast growth medium. PET degradation results in a mixture of the monomeric subunits TPA and ethylene glycol (EG), as well as the condensation adducts mono and bis(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalic acid (MHET and BHET, respectively). TPA and MHET are the predominant products detectable by HPLC, with BHET detectable at lower amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). We were unable to procure MHET standards for HPLC assays, and therefore developed assays for TPA and BHET which are available commercially in purified form.</p><p id="P19">Pure TPA and BHET were suspended in spent yeast growth medium, and generated clear additional peaks in HPLC spectra of spent medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental figure 3</xref>), with the peak volume correlating with the amount of both chemicals spiked into the yeast media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">figure 6</xref>). Peaks of similar retention times were also observed with media in which <italic>Is</italic>PETase secreting yeast had been grown in the presence of PET, but not when non-PET hydrolase secreting yeast were grown in the presence of PET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">figure 6</xref>). Peaks in the PET degradation samples appeared to show random shifts in elution time, within a range of +/- 0.2 minutes around the standard samples (<italic>c.f.</italic> the lower panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">figure 6</xref>). These shifts may be related to pH shifts in the media containing growing yeast, since changes in an analyte’s ionisation state can strongly influence its exchange between the mobile and stationary phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Even in our Tris-buffered media, the pH at the end of the incubation periods varied strongly (between 5 and 7), and differences in elution time in different samples may be related to these pH differences.</p><p id="P20">In principle the apparent peak volumes for BHET and TPA can be used to estimate how much product was formed on our degradation assays. However, since BHET hydrolyses spontaneously to MHET and EG in aqueous solution, and since we were not able to develop an assay for MHET, quantitation based on our data is only partial. At the point of analysis following 96 hours of incubation, the yeast media contained 7.5 μM TPA and 3 μM BHET when incubated with Σ1278b, and 6 μM TPA and 1.8 μM BHET for BY4741. These analyses confirm the higher degradation activity for the biofilm forming Σ1278b strain, although the difference between the strains appears less than in the surface-based assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5B</xref>). Accounting for concentration steps during sample preparation and the amount of plastic suspended in the culture (each coupon contained about 100 mg PET), this corresponds to a conversion rate of 5 μM TPA and BHET per gram PET for the Σ1278b strain. In optimised systems and with purified enzymes, conversion rates of up to 5 mM total aromatic substances (TPA+MHET+BHET) per gram PET, albeit with very high suspended PET concentrations of 29g/l (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). We conclude that while our biofilm-based system in its current state is not quantitatively competitive with mature systems based on purified enzymes, it shows promising activity that could be further developed by optimising expression levels, biofilm forming activity, and specific enzyme activity.</p><p id="P21">In a final degradation assay, we compared the activity of different PETases against a model substrate (amorphous PET film) and against post-consumer PET samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">figure 7</xref>). In these AFM-based surface assays we could detect activity against both substrates, albeit with quantitatively differing preferences for different PET hydrolases. In summary, we provide evidence of activity of biofilm-delivered PET hydrolases against different PET substrates. Based on the current strains and enzymes evidence for degradation activity is at the microscopic level. These results nevertheless provide proof of principle that biofilm-based approaches can function in principle, and suggest possible routes towards optimisation of such approaches (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">discussion</xref> for details).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Yeasts can assimilate PET-derived degradation products</title><p id="P22">The products of the <italic>Is</italic>PETase reaction are small, carbon-containing entities which could potentially be assimilated by yeast. We assembled yeast media containing various PET degradation products as the sole carbon source, and tested whether yeast could form biomass in such media. These experiments are complicated by the fact that standard laboratory yeast strains require amino acid supplementation, and amino acids can be efficient carbon sources in their own right. We therefore conducted growth assays with a completely auxotrophic wild-type yeast strain, S288c (the parental wild-type strain of BY4741,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>)), which does not require any amino acid supplementation. In pure yeast nitrogen base only supplemented with DMSO (the vehicle used to dissolve stock solutions of BHET and TPA), yeast only showed a residual increase in cell numbers after 48 hours of incubation, presumably enabled by intracellular carbon stores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">figure 8A and B</xref>). In contrast, in the presence of 0.5% BHET, TPA or EG, cell numbers following incubation were increased, and this increase was only statistically significant for the BHET sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">figure 6A</xref>). Because different carbon sources can affect yeast cell size and this can confound optical density measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>), these assays were conducted by counting cell numbers using hemocytometers. In addition, we were also able to observe growth in the presence of BHET as sole carbon source when we monitored culture oD continuously over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">figure 8B</xref>).</p><p id="P23">In conclusion, these results indicate that yeast can take up and assimilate either BHET or a spontaneous hydrolysis product of BHET (our assays do not allow us to distinguish between these possibilities). In either case, we demonstrate that treatment of PET with PET hydrolase enzymes generates bioavailable products, and that <italic>Is</italic>PETase producing biofilms are thus a potentially useful tool for the bioremediation of PET-contaminated soils and other environments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">PET hydrolases have been expressed in a number of heterologous expression systems (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>) which are optimised for different purposes. The production of bulk enzyme for purification is a frequent purpose, typically with the aim of fully recycling PET waste. For this application high expression levels are typically required to achieve commercial viability. Other, more specialised applications that have been proposed include the development of degrading consortia that facilitate conversion of the degradation products into biomass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), and the conversion of the PET degradation products into high value compounds such as vanillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Enzyme-based applications proposed or developed to date are predominantly tailored to the treatment of clean plastic. Plastic recovered from environmental sources frequently contains mixed plastic chemistries as well as other impurities, and the chemical structure of such recovered plastic is often altered due to the influence of UV light, oxygen, and other factors [ref] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). The ability to recycle such plastic waste through melting and reshaping is limited, as the chemical changes in the plastic lead to a loss of tensile strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>). We are not aware of studies that have directly addressed how recyclable such waste is with enzyme-based approaches, but the presence of impurities would presumably affect the ability to recover clean monomeric subunits that are amenable to the re-polymerisation of virgin plastic. Operations to recover environmental plastic are a growing activity area with operations such as the Ocean Cleanup and Shoreline Cleanups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>) now recovering tens to hundreds of tons of plastic waste annually. Biofilm-based solutions could play a significant role in the removal of such recovered waste.</p><p id="P26">Our current study demonstrates the delivery of degrading enzymes close to a target surface can enhance the degree of degradation. Based on the increase in surface roughness, we estimate that PET is removed at least 3 times more efficiently by a biofilm-forming PET hydrolase-secreting strain compared to a planktonic one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4B</xref>). Our <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>-based approach so far only delivers microscopic evidence of degradation and does not yet allow full deconstruction of plastic waste, but our work defines specific parameters that need to be improved for a functioning bioremediation solution.</p><p id="P27">With the strains selected for our study we observed limited secretion levels. This is common for unoptimised baker’s yeast strains, but expression levels can frequently be improved through random or rational strain engineering approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). One successful approach for disulfide-bonded proteins is the overexpression of elements of the oxidative folding machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>), although in our hands overexpression of neither yeast <italic>PDI1</italic> nor of <italic>ERO1</italic> significantly improved <italic>Is</italic>PETase secreation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental figure 4</xref>). Other optimisation approaches include modification of gene copy numbers or co-expression of chaperones, although we did not explore secretion optimisation further in this study.</p><p id="P28">Work published with purified enzymes indicates that degradation is optimal at ratios above 2 mg enzyme per gram plastic at PET loads of 29g per litre. For planktonic cells where the enzyme is roughly evenly distributed in the growth medium, secretion would need to be improved by several orders of magnitude, to levels of 50-100 mg/l, to achieve such ratios. Inside biofilm-matrices macromolecules remain trapped with half-lives of minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), and this would thus significantly increase the local enzyme concentration at the target surface over the average concentration in the overall culture, reducing the requirement for increased expression levels.</p><p id="P29">Our observation that <italic>Is</italic>PETase is glycosylated, but that the degree of glycosylation is reduced with engineered forms of the protein that fold more stably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>), indicates that the ability to fold correctly may be limited at least for <italic>Is</italic>PETase (LCC did not appear to be significantly glycosylated in baker’s yeast). <italic>Is</italic>PETase secreted from <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> cells was similarly observed to be glycosylated, and partial enzymatic removal of the glycan chains was shown to increase enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>). Thus glycosylation is likely another parameter that needs to be controlled for efficient degradation. One approach to achieve this could be the removal of surface-accessible asparagine residues in the enzymes, although if the glycosylation is a response to incorrect folding of the enzyme as our observation that more stably folding mutants are less glycosylated suggests, this would adversely affect expression levels and host cell health. Since Leaf Compost Cutinase appears to be expressed without significant glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>), as well as being the most active enzyme against post-consumer waste (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental table 1</xref>), this enzyme would be a natural starting point for further development of biofilm-based degradation systems.</p><p id="P30">Overall, our results show that engineered biofilms are a promising approach for delivering plastic-degrading enzymes onto plastic surfaces and, with further development, could yield useful tools for the bioremediation of environmental plastic.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Plasmid Construction and Codon optimisation</title><p id="P31">The native PET hydrolase genes contain codons which are rarely used and suboptimal in baker’s yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).
