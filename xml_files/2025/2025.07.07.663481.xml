We use unbiased computational approaches to quantify features of ALN stromal architecture. We identify PDGFRβ as a robust, immunomarker for human fibroblastic reticular cells (FRC) and use it to quantify how FRC network topology changes during BC progression and after treatment. ALN (n = 331) from 179 BC patients and 23 benign reactive controls were assessed for FRC network metrics, including lacunarity and branchpoints, alongside de-identified clinico-pathological data. We find in node-negative, triple-negative BC, neoadjuvant treatment induced denser FRC networks which correlated with improved survival. Conversely, denser FRC networks in node-positive patients correlated with worsened survival, regardless of BC subtype or treatment. Further, increased FRC alignment within metastases improved survival. We show that FRC network topology predicts prognosis in BC, providing a new avenue for mechanistic, translational research.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Fibroblast reticular cells</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>axillary lymph nodes</kwd><kwd>sentinel lymph nodes</kwd><kwd>neoadjuvant chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>immunohistochemistry</kwd><kwd>conduit</kwd><kwd>topology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">In breast cancer (BC), axillary lymph node (ALN) status is central to guiding management decisions since sentinel lymph node (SLN) involvement is the most significant prognostic factor in early-stage disease. However, while ALN are the first site of BC metastasis, they are also highly organized, tightly regulated secondary lymphoid organs capable of generating powerful adaptive immune responses against tumor cells. Furthermore, ALN modulate fluid homeostasis in the arm and breast. Consequently, surgical clearance of the axilla can result in lymphoedema of the arm but the effects on immune function are still unclear <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Over the past 30 years, BC treatment has evolved significantly, now integrating tailored combinations of neoadjuvant and adjuvant systemic therapies based on disease stage and hormone receptor status (estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)). In parallel, management of the axilla has also changed, with the number of ALN clearances (ALNC) decreasing in favor of less invasive techniques such as SLN biopsy (SLNB) and, more recently, targeted axillary dissection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Clinical trials, such as Z0011 and AMAROS, have led to this paradigm shift by challenging the necessity of ALNC in patients with minimal axillary involvement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In particular, the fact that isolated tumor cells (ITCs; &lt; 200 cells or &lt; 0.2 mm in extent) and micrometastasis (0.2–2 mm in extent) do not impact recurrence or overall disease-free survival, if appropriate systemic therapies are given, supports conserving the axilla <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Despite this however, precise histopathological examination of every surgically removed ALN is still mandated to ensure accurate prognostication and staging. Furthermore, with neoadjuvant immunotherapy now being standard of care for TNBC, the potential of ALN microenvironment to either activate or suppress the immune response is clinically relevant <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. However, our biological understanding of the mechanisms of ALN metastasis, and the factors that determine if a patient will develop an effective anti-tumor immune response or not, remains poorly understood.</p><p id="P5">Fibroblastic reticular cells (FRC) are integral to ALN structure and function. These specialized stromal cells secrete and enwrap extracellular matrix to form a network of reticular fibers that facilitate efficient immune cell localization and antigen transport (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>). Lymph enters the lymph node via the subcapsular sinus (SCS), where sinus-lining cells act as a molecular sieve, restricting molecules larger than ~70 kDa from accessing the conduit system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Smaller soluble molecules filter into the FRC ensheathed conduit network and flow in a unidirectional, controlled manner through the lymph node parenchyma to high endothelial venules (HEV). In addition to their structural scaffolding role, FRC orchestrate immune cell interactions through producing chemokines such as chemokine ligand (CCL)19 and CCL21 which regulate lymphocyte migration. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has elucidated distinct subsets of murine FRC, each with highly specific roles in maintaining immunological niches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. However, the canonical marker of murine FRC remains Podoplanin (Pdpn). In mice, this membranous glycoprotein has been shown to have central role in the maintenance and dynamic remodeling of the conduit network, and in immunoregulatory properties of FRC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">In contrast, our knowledge of human FRC biology and their response to immune activation and cancer is still evolving. Studying human FRC is challenging due to the ethical constraints on accessing lymphoid tissue. In BC patients, every excised ALN must be formalin-fixed and paraffin-wax embedded (FFPE) and examined in its entirety for accurate pathological staging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. This limits the number of patient-derived ALN samples available for research. In addition, FRC make up only 1-5% of human lymph nodes and are significantly more difficult to isolate from primary tissue than immune cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it is widely recognized that subclassifying human fibroblasts is challenging due to the lack of unique, robust markers (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>). Attempts to isolate human FRC have traditionally used PDPN to define the population, but PDPN expression is low in human FRC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. However, very recent scRNAseq of reactive human lymph nodes has revealed that platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) is expressed by all subsets of lymph node fibroblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Finally, the collagenous reticular network formed by murine FRC also exists in human lymph nodes, yet our understanding of how its structure and composition change in disease remains limited. Histopathologists have historically used tinctorial stains such as reticulin to visualize this delicate network <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and Masson’s trichrome to highlight mature fibrosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, but these methods have not been correlated with functional and/or clinical data, or FRC topography.</p><p id="P7">There are limited data on freshly resected ALN containing BC metastases, which identify four fibroblast subsets with prognostic significance based on the differential expression of five fibroblast markers: fibroblast activation protein α1 (FAP), integrin β1, smooth muscle actin (SMA), PDGFRβ, and PDPN <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">However, this study was limited by a small sample size, the absence of benign reactive controls and did not define the spatial distribution of these FRC populations within ALN.</p><p id="P9">Herein, we define robust immunohistochemical (IHC) markers of human FRC and characterize their expression patterns in ALN from a large cohort of BC patients, as well as reactive, control, tumor-free lymph nodes from patients with benign disease. We comprehensively map and quantify the effect of BC and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) on FRC network topology in both involved and uninvolved ALN, linking changes in FRC network topology to patient survival.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Optimized IHC Markers of Human FRC Subsets</title><p id="P10">We analyzed 331 FFPE ALN samples from 179 BC patients diagnosed and treated at King’s College Hospital (KCH), encompassing all three molecular subtypes, as well as different TNM stages and variable responses to NACT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). No patients had received checkpoint inhibitor therapy (CPI). 23 tumor-free lymph nodes from patients with benign disease, who had never had cancer, served as reactive controls. Given the paucity of robust IHC stains for human lymph node FRC, we optimized protocols for five previously reported FRC markers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and compared staining patterns across serial sections to reticulin, a classic tinctorial stain which is known to highlight the collagen backbone of lymphoreticular organs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">PDGFRβ mirrored reticulin staining, proving to be the most robust pan-FRC marker. It showed consistently strong staining in T cell zones, weak follicular dendritic cell (FDC) staining in germinal centers, and strong capsular fibroblast staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). SMA strongly marked FRC in the paracortex and capsule, with weak staining in parafollicular zones; it was absent in germinal centers. PDPN, strongly stained lymphatic endothelial cells and moderately labelled germinal center FDC, but did not highlight T zone FRC. Integrin β1 was restricted to mature blood vessels and the lymph node capsule. FAP staining proved technically challenging despite extensive optimization. The high temperatures required to retrieve antigen and achieve a signal damaged the tissue, and therefore FAP was not pursued further.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Quantitative Metrics Capture FRC Network Architecture in Human Lymph Nodes</title><p id="P12">Whole slide images were scanned and representative 250,000 μm<sup>2</sup> regions of interest (ROI) were chosen from PDGFRβ-stained T cell zones. ROI were chosen from reactive nodes from patients with benign disease, uninvolved nodes from patients with BC, residual lymphoid tissue from nodes with smaller metastatic tumor deposits (&lt; 2 mm in maximal extent), areas of NACT-induced fibrosis and areas of metastatic tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Since subtle alterations in FRC topology could potentially have large implications for tissue function, we needed a precise, unbiased approach to quantify changes in response to BC and/or NACT. The Workflow Of Matrix BioLogy Informatics (TWOMBLI) is an image analysis pipeline designed to quantify a broad range of parameters in the extracellular matrix in normal and pathological tissue <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Due to the intimate association between FRC and the reticulin network, we were able to repurpose this pipeline to analyze FRC network parameters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. TWOMBLI analysis showed that the FRC network in reactive lymph nodes (benign controls; clinico-pathological characteristics shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) has low lacunarity (median = 6, interquartile range (IQR) = 5-7.8), moderate branching (median branchpoints normalized by fiber length = 0.066, IQR = 0.059-0.068), consistent FRC size (median width = 1.5 μm, IQR = 1.3-2.0); median fiber length = 24 μm, IQR 23-34) and are poorly aligned (median alignment = 0.053, IQR = 0.04-0.077). Interestingly, these network features were not significantly correlated with patient age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>); however, this finding should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size and the use of reactive nodes, which may not accurately reflect the uninflamed aging process.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Treatment-Naïve TNBC and NACT Remodel the FRC Network in Uninvolved ALN</title><p id="P13">Multivariate linear analysis of each TWOMBLI output from uninvolved nodes removed from BC patients against the clinico-pathological variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) revealed statistically significant associations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Number of endpoints in the reticular network yielded the highest R score (0.127, p = 0.000007), with molecular subtype (p = 0.0006) and tumor burden in the axilla (p = 0.01; explained below) as significant predictors. Fiber width (p = 0.00006), number of branchpoints (p = 0.00009), lacunarity (p ≤ 0.0001), fiber length (p = 0.00007), high-density matrix intensity (HDMI; p = 0.001) and hyphal growth unit (HGU; p = 0.05) were all significantly predicted by NACT exposure.</p><p id="P14">To assess network parameters alongside clinical variables in a more integrative manner, we performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the combined dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>). The first principal component (PC1) accounted for 26.09% of the total variance, predominantly driven by lacunarity (loading = -0.506), followed by branchpoints (loading = 0.478), and NACT (loading = 0.403) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). This suggests that PC1 captures variability driven by both network structural features and clinical context. Other PCs incorporated additional clinical and network parameters, indicating complex multi-variable relationships across topological and clinical parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Strikingly, the benign control lymph nodes always clustered separately from uninvolved ALN from BC patients, suggesting cancer-specific changes to ALN structure.</p><p id="P15">Further, we observed topological alterations linked to BC subtype. Stratification of TWOMBLI results from both treatment naïve and post-NACT patients by BC molecular subtype revealed that FRC networks in uninvolved nodes from patients with TNBC had significantly reduced lacunarity (p ≤ 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), unchanged HDMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>), increased branchpoints (p = 0.0048; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>) and fewer endpoints (p ≤ 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>) compared to HER2 and reactive nodes, independently of treatment. Visualization of the PCA distribution by NACT exposure also revealed a clear segregation between treatment-naïve and NACT-exposed patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). Subsequent faceting of the PCA by both molecular subtype and NACT exposure further demonstrated distinct separation between uninvolved and reactive control nodes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). However, the separation was more pronounced in TNBC than HER2 positive disease and was even greater in nodes from patients who had received NACT, indicating that both tumor subtype and therapy exposure contribute to network remodeling. Further stratification of individual TWOMBLI parameters according to subtype and NACT exposure confirmed these patterns. FRC networks from NACT-exposed TNBC patients displayed significantly decreased lacunarity (p ≤ 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>), increased branchpoints (p ≤ 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref>) and decreased endpoints (p ≤ 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3K</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Collectively, these findings indicate that in treatment-naive TNBC patients, the FRC network in uninvolved ALN is more compact and highly branched. Interestingly, exposure to NACT induces comparable alterations throughout the ALN basin. Notably, Kaplan–Meier analysis of patients with TNBC and no axillary nodal involvement following NACT (pathological nodal stage 0, ypN0) demonstrated that the presence of a denser FRC network, characterized by lower lacunarity (p = 0.0365, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3L</xref>) and a higher number of branchpoints (p = 0.0051, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3M</xref>), correlated with improved survival.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Metastatic Tumor Deposits Drive Greater FRC Network Disruption Within Residual Nodes</title><p id="P17">In order to test the effect of BC on the FRC network within a single node as well as across the ALN chain, we repeated our analysis including ROI of areas of residual lymphoid tissue in involved nodes from patients of all molecular subtypes, both treatment naïve and post-NACT. Multivariate analysis revealed lacunarity as the parameter most significantly influenced by clinical factors (R score 0.157, p = 2×10<sup>−9</sup>) with the size of metastasis (i.e. ITCs; micrometastasis; or macrometastasis), NACT exposure and molecular subtype as the most significant predictors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Direct comparison of TWOMBLI outputs from treatment-naive and post-NACT nodes confirmed the presence of a denser, more branched network demonstrated in the uninvolved nodes following NACT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, stratification by molecular subtype also confirmed a significant effect of TNBC on topology.</p><p id="P18">PCA again demonstrated that across all subtypes, reactive control nodes from benign patients formed distinct clusters compared to BC patient-derived ALN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-I</xref>). Moreover, within each molecular subtype, metastatic ALN containing residual lymphoid tissue clustered separately to uninvolved nodes. This indicates that the effects of BC on the stromal network are more pronounced in the residual lymphoid tissue that sits adjacent to tumor deposits in metastatic ALN. Interestingly, lacunarity had the highest loading on PC1 (0.410), which accounted for 26.62% of the variance in the data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). This aligns with the results of the multivariate analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Furthermore, PC1, PC2, and PC3 all contributed to meaningful separation of the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J-L</xref>). Taken together, these results confirm that the presence of TNBC and exposure to NACT induce a more compact FRC network in the residual lymphoid tissue of involved nodes.</p><p id="P19">We specifically investigated the impact of tumor metastasis in ALN on the FRC topology of uninvolved nodes within the same chain and linked these data with patient survival. In patients with metastatic BC involving one to three lymph nodes (pathological nodal stage 1, pN1 (treatment-naïve) and/or ypN1 (post-NACT)), a more compact FRC network, indicated by reduced lacunarity, in the uninvolved nodes was significantly associated with poorer overall survival, independent of treatment status (p = 0.0407; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4M</xref>). However, in this group of patients, number of branchpoints was not correlated with survival (p = 0.271; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4N</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Chemotherapy-Induced Fibrosis Replaces Reticular Network Architecture</title><p id="P20">In reactive, benign control lymph nodes the delicate reticulin/FRC network spans the entire node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A-D</xref>). In contrast, NACT produces wedge-shaped areas of fibrosis in which tumor cells are replaced by dense eosinophilic collagen and angiogenic vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). This fibrosis clinically indicates a response to NACT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. However, the nature of this fibrosis and its effect on the FRC network have not been previously characterized. Reticulin staining of these areas revealed abundant mature collagen composed of thicker, wavy, argyrophilic fibers that replaced the normal reticular network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). These fibers were similar to those found within the lymph node capsule and also showed blue staining with Masson’s trichrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>), indicating the presence of mature collagen. PDGFRβ immunostaining demonstrated complete destruction of the network with fewer, scattered remaining FRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>). TWOMBLI analysis revealed increased FRC alignment (p = 0.0210; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5M</xref>), non-significant changes in HDMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5N</xref>) and a significant reduction in FRC length (p = 0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5O</xref>) in these fibrotic areas. However, TWOMBLI is not optimized for assessing alignment, particularly in areas where the network has been destroyed. Therefore, the same ROIs were additionally analyzed using CurveAlign <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, which showed a trend towards increased FRC alignment (p = 0.09; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5P</xref>) in areas of post-NACT fibrosis when compared to matched, uninvolved ALN, but this did not reach statistical significance.</p><p id="P21">PDGFRβ staining at the interface between chemotherapy-induced fibrosis and the remaining FRC network showed the gradual transition from destroyed to disrupted to intact FRC network architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5Q</xref>). For high-resolution quantification, each ROI at the interface was subdivided into 100 tiles, which were individually analyzed using TWOMBLI. These tiles were then reconstructed into heatmaps to visually represent the gradual changes in network parameters across the residual node, interface and fibrotic area (examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5R and 5S</xref>). Aggregated heatmap data showed the highest average HDMI values in the interface region (p ≤ 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5T</xref>), and a gradual decrease in cell (lymphocyte) number from the residual node through the interface to the fibrotic zone (p ≤ 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5U</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>FRC Network Topology Correlates with Tumor Burden and Clinical Outcome in Metastatic ALN</title><p id="P22">As anticipated, survival analysis of this cohort demonstrated a poorer prognosis for patients with a higher nodal stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>), as well as those with TNBC and a higher tumor stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). However, traditional nodal stage incorporates only the number of positive nodes and not the size of deposits, which we have shown to be highly relevant to network topology. Furthermore, in the clinical setting, axillary tumor burden is routinely quantified only in post-NACT samples and not in treatment naïve disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. In order to compare these two patient cohorts, we adapted the formula used to calculate the residual cancer burden score to estimate axillary tumor burden (see <bold>Methods</bold>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Stratification using this metric revealed that patients with a tumor volume ≥ 20 had significantly worse outcomes (p = 0.0075; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). As tumor cells invade ALN, they progressively distort the FRC network, quantified by a significant increase in lacunarity correlated with a decrease in HDMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C-G</xref>). We observed that the degree of this network distortion is correlated to the size of the metastatic deposit, rather than molecular subtype or NACT exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C-G</xref>). Notably, large nests of tumor resulting in high network lacunarity (≥ 12) was associated with significantly poorer survival (p = 0.043, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H</xref>). More surprisingly, in patients with BC of all molecular subtypes and treatment status, increased FRC alignment in metastatic deposits improved survival (p = 0.0205, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6I-K</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">By optimizing robust IHC markers for human FRC, we have shown how different subsets of FRC localize within the ALN of BC patients. We confirmed PDGFRβ as a pan-FRC marker that highlights FRC in all of the microanatomical ALN compartments, where different immune populations reside and traffic in both health and disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Interestingly, our data show that, in contrast to murine lymph nodes, where it stains FRC in the T cell zones, human PDPN is highly expressed predominantly by germinal center FDC and lymphatic endothelial cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. In addition, SMA expression is more prominent in human tissue, where it is seen primarily in the paracortex, than in mice, where it typically stains weakly in germinal centers, increasing only upon activation. It is possible that this difference in staining patterns, rather than being an inherent variation between species, is age-related, since most mouse models use young, immunologically naïve mice, whereas in humans, even ‘normal’ nodes will have undergone repeated cycles of antigen exposure, immune activation and resolution before being removed and examined. Moreover, PDPN expression has been observed in FRC within tertiary lymphoid structures in human non-small cell lung cancer, indicating that its expression may be context-dependent <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Regardless, this biological variablity could compromise on-going efforts at clinical translational, and as such, should be investigated further.</p><p id="P24">Because of the intimate association between FRC and collagen in lymph nodes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, we were able to repurpose TWOMBLI as an unbiased and quantitative tool to map the human FRC network in different pathophysiological conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. By integrating TWOMBLI derived parameters with clinical data through multivariate analysis, we were able to clearly visualize FRC network changes in a translationally relevant context. Although we focused on BC, our approach is applicable to other malignancies and pathologies.</p><p id="P25">We have demonstrated that the FRC network becomes denser and more highly branched in treatment naïve TNBC, an aggressive, hard-to-treat BC subtype. We postulate that the denser FRC network seen in these patients may restrict the flow of lymph through the reticular network in the ALN parenchyma, shunting fluid through the SCS and into the efferent vessels. This change in fluid flow could likely have two clinically relevant effects. Firstly, the pooling of fluid in the SCS may provide an opportunity for cancer cells to extravasate and accumulate, leading to the development of metastatic tumor deposits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Secondly, controlled flow through the lymph node parenchyma is critical for antigen sampling by tissue resident antigen-presenting cells. Without these interactions the ability of the node to generate effective immune responses against tumor antigens and pathogens would be compromised <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Our data show these changes trend towards a poorer prognosis in patients with treatment naïve TNBC, but this result did not reach statistical significance. This is most likely due to the fact that it is hard to collect tissue from treatment naïve patients, since most TNBC patients receive NACT at present <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">Interestingly, these topological changes were evident in both patients without nodal metastasis and in uninvolved ALN from patients with metastatic deposits elsewhere in the axillary chain. Previous mouse studies have shown that factors secreted by primary melanoma travel to the draining lymph nodes, promoting FRC proliferation and a shift toward a cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-like phenotype <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Thus, it stands to reason that soluble factors originating in the primary breast tumor could be responsible for the changes seen in patients with pN0 disease. On the other hand, the presence of similar topological changes in uninvolved nodes from patients with nodal metastasis in other ALN (pN1/ ypN1) could be due to inter-nodal communication within the axillary chain through soluble factors. This makes it difficult to unpick precisely what is occuring in patients who received NACT, since these patients could have had metastatic disease in their axillary nodes which were eradicated before surgery. In other words, inter-nodal communication cannot be entirely excluded in ypN0 cases. This confounding effect is not seen once metastases are established in the axillary chain, however. In the uninvolved nodes from patients with pN1 or ypN1 disease of all subtypes, a reduction in lacunarity was associated with poorer prognosis, regardless of treatment status. This is clinically significant as treatment decisions regarding the extent of axillary surgery in the node-positive cohort are often challenging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Therefore, any biomarker that can predict whether SLN have switched from ‘helping’ (immunocompetent) to ‘harming’ (immune-exhausted) a patient would be invaluable.</p><p id="P27">Biologically, TNBC is thought to be more immunogenic than other BC subtypes. A subset of TNBC tumors are lymphocyte-predominant (i.e. contain tumor infiltrating lymphocytes amounting to at least 30% of the tumor) and ALN of patients with TNBC more often contain a greater number of GC than other BC subtypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Despite this, CPI are only effective if NACT is given concurrently to augment the anti-tumor immune response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, only 50% of TNBC patients achieve a complete pathological response after NACT, and only a further 10% benefit from the addition of a CPI to neoadjuvant treatment regimens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. We have shown that the FRC network of uninvolved ALN is significantly denser and more highly branched post-NACT, and that this was more pronounced in TNBC patients. Intriguingly, in contrast to the treatment naïve patients, this change in FRC topology was associated with an improved survival in TNBC patients with no residual metastasis in the axilla. This suggests that the same alterations in fluid flow, with shunting into the SCS, may be beneficial in this cohort, potentially by facilitating drug-induced killing of small subcapsular tumor deposits.</p><p id="P28">In metastatic ALN where chemotherapy eradicates large tumor deposits, it concurrently obliterates the FRC network, replacing it with dense, mature fibrotic collagen structures containing a few, highly aligned FRC and very occasional lymphocytes. These structural changes could have important functional consequences for impeding immune cell trafficking and activation, and this in turn might help to resolve whether patients who have a complete pathological response after NACT should have a targeted, rather than a complete, axillary dissection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Moreover, since the addition of CPI to NACT results in mixed responses, understanding all of the factors that could influence treatment response is crucial. We aim to confirm and further characterize this in a larger cohort of patients in the future.</p><p id="P29">Simulations indicate that the FRC network remains functionally resilient despite the loss of up to 50% of its structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. We have shown that even though the FRC network is maintained as BC invades into a node, its topology is highly distorted. Furthermore, remodeling of the FRC network to a denser, more branched topology was observed in residual lymphoid tissue that was situated &gt; 500 μm from metastatic deposits within a node. These changes were similar to those seen in the uninvolved nodes but to a greater extent. Simple diffusion of the tumor-derived soluble factors through a whole lymph node is unlikely to be responsible for these changes as the distances are too great <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. It seems more plausible that the tumor-derived soluble factors driving these intranodal changes are transported through the altered conduit network.</p><p id="P30">As axillary tumor burden increased in all of the BC patients in our cohort, survival significantly decreased. This reinforces the prognostic value of both the number of nodal deposits and the size of each deposit, in both the treatment naïve and post-NACT context. Furthermore, we have shown that the extent of FRC network distortion within the metastatic deposit correlates with the size of the deposit rather than the BC subtype or other clinical features, suggesting that physical disruption is the primary driver. Once a tumor deposit exceeds a lacunarity of 12, survival worsens significantly. This size threshold could indicate a critical point at which the altered flow of fluid through the FRC network compromises the ability of the node to mount effective responses, thereby adversely affecting survival. Conversely, increased FRC alignment in tumor deposits is associated with a better prognosis, which may reflect more controlled flow through the node parenchyma. These hypotheses warrant further investigation using <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic> models to fully elucidate the mechanisms by which FRC network architecture influences fluid flow and immune function. We intend to use the REPLICANT model, a unique <italic>ex vivo</italic> perfusion system for human lymph nodes, to study fluid flow in real time and identify key molecular drivers and/or clinically relevant biomarkers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P31">We have shown, that changes in FRC topology can be quantified using unbiased computational approaches in human ALN using IHC, and that these changes predict prognosis in BC. By integrating this with real time flow dynamics, we are now positioned to mechanistically disentangle these complex interactions in patient-derived samples in translationally relevant context in future.</p><sec id="S10"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="P32">None of the patients in this cohort received CPI, as these therapies were only recently introduced into routine clinical practice and therefore, outcome data for these samples would amount to less than 5 years <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Given the growing use of immunotherapy, particularly in TNBC, future studies should explore how combination therapies involving CPI and NACT impact FRC network architecture and function.</p><p id="P33">In addition, although this was a longitudinal study with ALN tissue samples collected from patients at various stages of disease and with follow-up data extending up to 10 years, the availability of sequential samples from individual patients was limited. Despite this, we were able to identify meaningful changes in the FRC network over time. Future prospective studies with longitudinal sampling after surgical resection of the primary tumor would enhance our understanding of the permanence or potential reversibility of these stromal
