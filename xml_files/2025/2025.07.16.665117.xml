In natural settings, perceivers adapt their motor-sensory strategies as they approach and explore objects, dynamically shaping both the generation and interpretation of sensory cues. Previous attempts to explain this process by reducing it solely to neuronal representations have failed to capture the mechanisms underlying dynamic perception. In this study, we use precise behavioral tracking to investigate the initial phase of object interaction, asking: What motor-sensory strategies support object detection during natural approach? Using high resolution video tracking of rats freely exploring objects under infrared illumination, we analyzed how head and whisker dynamics evolved across sequential contacts. We found that whisker-object interactions converged toward a distinct line, <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup>, within a motor-sensory plane, where small changes in voluntary whisker movements produced large changes in whisker curvature, a sensory correlate of contact force. This convergence was actively controlled, predicted head movements and marked the completion of object approach. Convergence to <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> was consistent across different objects, suggesting it serves as an invariant motor-sensory contingency for object detection. Proximity to <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> predicted the emergence of touch-induced pumps, a rapid motor-sensory reflex that further facilitated convergence within a single whisking cycle. Together, these results reveal that object detection is a closed-loop dynamic process, in which animals actively steer motor-sensory dynamics toward a robust detection-optimized state.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Natural environments are stochastic, rapidly changing, and present significant uncertainties. Yet, mammals are impressively effective at making sense of their surroundings and guiding behavior accordingly. They achieve this through generative motor-sensory processes, selecting the perceptual strategies that best serve their behavioral goals while adapting to environmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. For example, to judge a peach’s ripeness, broad and gentle pressure is typically applied; to find bruises, fingers sweep the surface as pressure is continuously adjusted. This kind of goal-dependent adaptation of motor-sensory strategy has been repeatedly demonstrated in whisker-based object localization. Object location can be encoded either through motor variables, sensory variables, or combined motor-sensory schemes, as demonstrated in head-fixed rats and biomechanical models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. This diversity is reflected in behavior, with studies in freely moving rats demonstrating that they actively employ and adapt different strategies depending on task demands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Perception can therefore be supported by various coding schemes, and a range of strategies aimed at stabilizing motor actions, sensory signals, or their relations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. This behavioral flexibility means that sensory signals must be interpreted in light of the movements that generated them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> (we therefore refer to these combinations as motor-sensory, rather than sensorimotor).</p><p id="P3">Freely moving rats choose when and how to engage (or disengage) with the object of focus, exercising control over information flow and the level of perceptual accuracy. Over the course of exploration, control requirements change with instantaneous goals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>; for example, object detection and localization, followed by focused exploration. Here, we examined such object-approach behavior in freely moving rats presented with a single object, and characterized the interaction between movements, object contact, and sensory signals. Studying rats that were free to select and control explorative motor variables, we asked: what motor-sensory contingencies support object detection? We found that over sequential contacts, the relation between changes in the whisker-base’s angle and curvature evolved towards a specific ratio which we term <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup>. We propose that proximity to <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> represents, for the freely moving rat, the perceptual confidence of contacting an external object.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Whisker-object contacts densely cluster around a distinct ratio in the motor-sensory space</title><p id="P4">Accurate quantification of motor and sensory measurements of the whisker was performed using high-spatio-temporal resolution videography (1024 × 1280 pixels, 500 frames per second, respectively; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>), under IR-only illumination. When whisking, rats actively control their whisker base-angle (<italic>θ</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). During whisker-object contacts, the whisker bends, producing changes in base-curvature (<italic>κ</italic>, which is inversely related to the radius of an osculating circle at the point, and thus measured in units of <italic>m</italic><sup>−1</sup>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Base-curvature during contact is proportional to the bending moment at the whisker base, which activates mechanoreceptors and consequently drives the trigeminal neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. We tracked the dynamics of motor variable, <italic>θ</italic>, and sensory variable, <italic>κ</italic>, for individual C-row whiskers bilaterally and examined how they varied with object contact. All other whisker-rows were trimmed to avoid occlusions, which hinder tracking (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>). Values of <italic>κ</italic> during non-contact whisking are not proportional to bending moment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, but are given as a reference.</p><p id="P5">As rats approached the object, they engaged in free-air whisking until making contact, usually unilaterally. Throughout the approach, rats typically varied whisker angle, inducing corresponding torsion-related changes in curvature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In a representative example, we examined dynamics of two whiskers on the same side of the snout—one that made contact, and one that did not. Angle dynamics were similar across whiskers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, top), but contact was associated with sharp transients in curvature. Nonetheless, the range of curvature values measured during contact still overlapped substantially with values measured in non-contact periods, both within the contacting whisker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, bottom, gray) and compared to the non-contacting whisker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, bottom, black). Thus, neither angle nor curvature are likely to make a reliable indicator of contact. Previous work in anesthetized rats and models has shown that an object’s position was ambiguously encoded by either angle or curvature separately but reliably read out when both were considered jointly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In line with this, plotting angle and curvature jointly on a motor-sensory phase-plane produced partial separation of the non-contacting and contacting whiskers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). However, epochs of contact did not occupy a unique contiguous region but rather overlapped with non-contact epochs. The (<italic>θ, κ</italic>) plane thus does not support a reliable representation of contact epochs in freely moving rats.</p><p id="P6">Since perceptual systems are typically tuned to changes rather than absolute values, a principle captured by Weber’s law<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, we examined how object contact is reflected by the change in angle and curvature, using their time-derivatives denoted <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>). Considered individually, neither angle change nor curvature change showed robust separation of contact from non-contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>). The angle-change trace for the contacting whisker was nearly identical to that of the non-contacting whisker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, top). Curvature change was preferentially associated with sharp increases during contact, although similar increases sometimes appeared in the non-contacting whisker as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, bottom). When examined jointly on a motor-sensory phase-plane, however, the joint dynamics of angle-curvature changes revealed a distinct region associated with contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Whereas non-contact trajectories typically evolved horizontally and covered much of the plane, contact trajectories closely traced a tilted line through the origin with a steep positive slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). In other words, instances of contact were associated with a specific ratio such that small changes in whisker angle induce large changes in curvature.</p><p id="P7">Therefore, we asked which combinations of the motor and sensory variables are statistically associated with object contact across the entire dataset (<italic>n</italic><sub><italic>whiskers</italic>× <italic>frames</italic></sub> = 616,708). To automatically classify data points as contact versus non-contact, we calculated the minimal distance between each whisker trace and the object’s surface. For this analysis, we excluded snout-object contact frames (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>). The resulting distribution featured a pronounced left tail with a distinct mode at very small distances. This mode was used to set a data-driven threshold separating contacts from non-contacts at ~1 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>). Next, we plotted visit-rate maps of motor-sensory combinations on a polar plane, equivalent to the original Cartesian plane of angle-curvature changes <inline-formula><mml:math id="M3"><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/></mml:math></inline-formula>. In this polar representation, angles, which we term <italic>α</italic>, correspond to specific ratios of curvature change to angle change; different combinations composing the same ratio <italic>α</italic> are mapped along individual radii from the origin (termed <italic>r</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). The transformation to polar coordinates highlights the importance of motor-sensory ratios, while maintaining a one-to-one mapping with original Cartesian coordinates. Since units of angle and curvature have no a priori correspondence, curvature was re-scaled before transformation to polar coordinates in all following analyses (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Before the first whisker-object contact occurred, combinations of angle-curvature changes covered much of the <inline-formula><mml:math id="M4"><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/></mml:math></inline-formula> plane, without a dominant peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 120,486). Following the first contact, a pronounced difference emerged between contacting and non-contacting whiskers: contacts tightly clustered around a specific ratio, forming a line in the phase plane, which we label <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, top; <italic>n</italic> = 44,621; <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> denoted by the red dashed line, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>). In contrast, the non-contact distribution (after 1<sup>st</sup> contact, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, bottom; <italic>n</italic> = 451,601) resembled the pre-contact distribution. The steep slope associated with <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> captures instances in which small angular changes induce relatively large changes in bending – as would be expected from a motor-sensory contingency supporting contact detection. The clustering around <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> after initial contact was driven specifically by contact, rather than by a general behavioral change, as the difference between contact and non-contact (after 1<sup>st</sup> contact) was greater than the difference between pre-contact and non-contact (permutation test using Jensen-Shannon divergence, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>). Alternative phase-planes, expressing different combinations of angle, curvature, and their derivatives, produced less clear separation between contact and non-contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Focusing specifically on <italic>α</italic>, the ratio of angle-curvature changes, we found that its distribution was narrower during contact than during non-contact, with a sharp peak near <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>; permutation test on Shannon entropy, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>). Consistent with this, the probability of a single whisker making contact increased up to threefold near <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup>, relative to more distant values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e,f</xref>; exponential fit, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M5"><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.995</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−8</sup>). Taken together, these analyses suggest a strong association between contact occurrence and a distinct ratio of whisker angle-curvature changes, namely <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup>, which forms a plausible motor-sensory contingency representing contact.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Motor-sensory dynamics converge towards the invariant contact ratio <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup></title><p id="P10">Given a single sample, the probability of contact remains low even near <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup>. This fact, together with the use of multiple contact epochs, strongly suggests that our rats relied on accumulating evidence across contacts. To examine the dynamics of this evidence accumulation, we asked how <italic>α</italic> evolved during object approach (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>), and whether this differed between contact and non-contact whisking. We approximated the system’s flow separately for contact and non-contact observations, examining how changes in <italic>α</italic> depend on its current value. Flow was quantified using two attributes: mobility and directional tendency (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>). Mobility measures how large a change tends to be (calculated as <italic>median</italic>(|Δ<italic>α</italic>|)). Directional tendency measures whether changes tend to evolve clockwise or counterclockwise (calculated as <italic>p</italic>(Δ<italic>α</italic> &gt; 0) − 0.5).</p><p id="P11">During retraction, dynamics were similar for contact and non-contact. In contrast, during protraction, contact and non-contact dynamics diverged: contact dynamics evolved away from <italic>α</italic> ≈ 0 and towards <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup>, whereas non-contact dynamics evolved away from <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> and towards <italic>α</italic> ≈ 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). This dissociation in directional tendency profiles highlights contact-induced effects on the flow of <italic>α</italic>: <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> is attractive only for contacts, and only during protraction—which is specifically relevant to exploration of the object ahead. Given the inherent asymmetry between protraction and retraction, <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> is resistant to perturbation only from one direction, i.e., it approximates a semi-stable attractor (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Are these fast, within-cycle, convergence dynamics towards <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> supported by slow dynamics across whisking cycles? For this analysis, we parsed the whisking trajectories into distinct cycles (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>) and included only trials in which a clear unilateral contact preference was demonstrated during the approach phase; otherwise, ordering of contact cycles became infeasible. To compare across trials with a different number of cycles, we grouped them into first, interim, or last - which ensured each trial contributed exactly one cycle to the first and last groups (<italic>n</italic><sub><italic>trials</italic></sub> = 83/155). Trials with a single-contact cycle are considered separately in the next subsection.</p><p id="P13">Collapsed across trials, contacting whiskers showed gradual convergence towards <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup>, from first to last cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, top row). Conversely, non-contacting whiskers – both from the contacting side and the other side – remained broadly distributed across consecutive cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, middle and bottom rows, respectively). For the non-contact groups, the last cycle distributions appear to cluster in the right hemi-plane because data only extend through the end of the approach phase, which typically ended before retraction began.</p><p id="P14">To quantify the observed pattern, we analyzed data at the cycle level by assigning each cycle with a single representative value, the angle <italic>α</italic> for which the median absolute deviation was minimized (MAD; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>). This ensured that longer cycles, or cycles where a larger proportion of the whiskers contacted the object, were not overrepresented, and that the first and last cycle groups were balanced. The resulting cycle-level statistics confirmed the convergence pattern described qualitatively above: for the distribution of last contact cycles, the median <italic>α</italic> aligned with <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.374), and its variance was narrower compared to that of simultaneous non-contact cycles, both ipsi- and contra-lateral to the contacting whiskers (Brown-Forsythe test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−6</sup> for both comparisons). This convergence process is consistent with the dynamics of a controlled variable: a perceptually meaningful quantity that perceivers actively maintain near a desired value by adjusting their behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Consistently, <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> remained a reliable indicator of contact across all three objects (<italic>p</italic> = 0.071; omnibus permutation test), exhibiting almost identical behavior across the two objects that were presented in most of the trials and differed only in shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e,f</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.78).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Correlation structures suggest <italic>α</italic> dynamics guide behavioral adaptation</title><p id="P15">The evidence above indicates that <italic>α</italic> converges towards <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> over consecutive contacts during object approach. Such convergence is consistent with active control, but could also arise passively; for example, if rats follow a pre-planned sequence of body and whisker movements, where forward motion is pre-determined, and it is the diminishing distance to the object that gradually shapes the outcome of whisker-object contact. To distinguish these possibilities, we focused on trials in which approach included only one contact cycle (termed single-contact cycles, <italic>n</italic> = 26, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Methods</xref>), and compared these to the first and last contact cycles of multi-contact approaches. If <italic>α</italic> guides approach termination, it should converge on <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> even in single-contact trials, and these cycles should therefore more closely resemble last than first cycles. If convergence reflects passive constraints affecting both head and whiskers, a similar pattern should also be observed in other movement-related variables.</p><p id="P16">To evaluate whether <italic>α</italic> demonstrated the predicted pattern, we quantified its dynamics within each cycle using median absolute deviation from <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> (<italic>MAD</italic>(<italic>α</italic>; <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup>)). As predicted, <italic>α</italic>’s values in single-contact cycles closely matched those observed in last cycles, but not first cycles, of multi-contact trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>; permutation test on medians, first vs. single: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; last vs. single: <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05; FDR corrected across panels <bold>a-d</bold>). In contrast, approach velocity – defined per cycle as the mean change in head-object distance along the y-axis – differed in single-contact cycles from both first and last cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for both comparisons). This challenges an interpretation in which <italic>α</italic>’s dynamics are merely a byproduct of pre-planned head-movement. We next asked whether this pattern of results was unique to <italic>α</italic> – or whether it may also be observed in other whisker-related variables. Specifically, we examined two additional variables: the radius on the polar-plane, termed <italic>r</italic>, representing the magnitude of motor-sensory change (quantified per-cycle by its 90<sup>th</sup> percentile to capture trajectories’ peak, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>), and the shortest distance from whisker base to contact point, termed radial distance (RD; quantified per-cycle by its median). RD showed a similar pattern to <italic>α</italic>, with values in single-contact trials resembling last but not first contact cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>; first vs. single: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; last vs. single: <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). In contrast, <italic>r</italic> did not exhibit the alignment observed in <italic>α</italic> and RD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05 for both comparisons).</p><p id="P17">We expanded on this rationale to further explore which variables are under active control. If approach terminates when a controlled variable reaches some desired range, then trials with more contact cycles are expected to typically begin farther away from that range. In other words, the distribution of first contacts should vary depending on the number of following cycles, while the distribution of last contacts should be similar regardless of the number of preceding cycles. This analysis mostly agreed with the previous one, as <italic>α</italic>, RD, and here also <italic>r</italic>, all showed the expected pattern for controlled variables: values at first contact showed a linear dependency on the number of contact cycles, whereas values at last contact did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e,g,h</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for significant slopes, FDR corrected across panels <bold>e-h</bold>). However, for <italic>r</italic>, variance increased from the first to the last cycle, as opposed to expectations from a controlled variable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. In contrast to these variables, approach velocity showed a linear dependency on the number of contact cycles in both first and last contacts, inconsistent with convergence toward a fixed target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Finally, on a cycle-by-cycle basis, all three whisker-related variables were significantly correlated with one another (Pearson’s correlation coefficient, <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>α</italic>,<italic>r</italic></sub> = 0.508, <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>α</italic>,<italic>RD</italic></sub> = 0.471, <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>r</italic>,<italic>RD</italic></sub> = 0.466, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 in all cases; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref>, gray bars). These correlations alone do not distinguish whether the variables co-vary or whether one drives the others, which motivated us to explore their temporal relationship.</p><p id="P18">To uncover a possible underlying causal relationship between these variables, we repeated the cycle-by-cycle correlation procedure. This time, however, we examined not only time-aligned correlations but also lagged the cycle-to-cycle correspondence by ±1 cycle to see whether any variable predicted another variable’s value in the following whisking cycle. All three whisker-related variables - <italic>α, r</italic> and RD - achieved their peak correlation with one another when time-aligned (i.e., at zero lag), suggesting that none of them drives the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref>, gray bars, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, FDR corrected).

Under open-loop evidence accumulation, percepts are often assumed to emerge from the gradual integration of sensory information over time without concurrent adaptation of exploration movements.

Our data show rapid reciprocal feedback between motor and sensory signals in the form of convergence towards <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> both across and within whisking cycles (whose typical duration is ~50-120ms).

The entire structure was made from clear Perspex and was mounted on poles to discourage rats from straying away from the task area. Within the task area, a single object was presented at a time, using the combined operation of two E19-1 linear servo motors (ElectroCraft, Dover, NH). The arena had four doors: one was the front door, leading to the task area. The three remaining doors each restricted access to a sipper spout when they were closed (E24-01 Optical Lickometer H20-94 single photocell sensors, Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA). Doors were controlled by HS-322HD Standard Heavy Duty Servo motors (HiTec, Poway, CA).

In three of the four analyzed sessions, the object was positioned ~3.5 cm from the task-area door; in the fourth, it was ~8.5 cm away. The overall duration of motor movement was kept constant for each of the three objects so their identity could not be inferred from the durations of noise produced by motor operation. The door connecting the arena and the task area would then open, allowing subjects to approach the object. As a rat entered the area, it triggered video acquisition by moving through an ROI, and as it moved back out through the ROI, video acquisition was stopped. Upon re-entering the arena, all sipper doors opened, allowing the rat to report object identity by choosing the associated sipper.

Propagating the state-vector across frames allowed for formation of initial tracks from concatenation of matched pairs.

This threshold was estimated by filtering the head-center y-position with a 1st-order lowpass Butterworth filter (100 Hz cutoff), then fitting a three-component Gaussian mixture model to the velocity distribution across all data. The mean of the leftmost component was set as the threshold, resulting in 0.79 cm/s.
