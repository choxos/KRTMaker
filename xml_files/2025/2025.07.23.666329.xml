This is particularly important for developing fully efficacious vaccines, which should include valuable blood stage antigens. Several antigen candidates are highly diverse and require further understanding. We surveyed the genetic diversity of the highly polymorphic merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP2) in 2761 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates collected across Sub-Saharan Africa. Using PCR-based genotyping and long-read sequencing, we identified extensive diversity among <italic>msp2</italic> size variants and sequences. Some size variants were more prevalent than others across different geographical regions, transmission intensities, and time points. These variants comprised multiple unique sequences, of which several were geographically and temporally widespread. Our study reveals greater <italic>msp2</italic> sequence diversity than previously known, while also identifying interesting similarities in sequence and gene length across Sub-Saharan Africa. These findings support the further exploration of common <italic>msp2</italic> variants in relation to parasite virulence and vaccine development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Malaria remains a significant public health concern globally, with an estimated 263 million cases and 597 thousand deaths in 2023 alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is the most prevalent and deadly species, accounting for 95% of malaria cases and disproportionately affecting Sub-Saharan Africa. The reduction in incidence that was initiated with introduction of artemisinin combination therapies and vector control strategies has stalled, making new approaches critical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is a highly complex pathogen; understanding its spatiotemporal dynamics and genetic diversity is essential for improving surveillance, diagnosis and treatment, as well as for developing preventative measures such as vaccines, to reduce morbidity and mortality and ultimately achieve elimination.</p><p id="P3">The efficacy of the two vaccines RTS,S/AS01 and R21/MatrixM, targeting the pre-erythrocytic stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], could potentially be improved with the addition of blood stage antigens. Many of the merozoite surface proteins have a role in host cell binding or invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] and are thus interesting targets for antimalarial drugs and vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Among them, the abundant, single copy merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP2) represents a highly polymorphic antigen which has been previously discussed as a valuable target for vaccine development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Such polymorphism serves as a molecular fingerprint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] which helps determine the number and type of co-existing genotypes present in individual <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], and provides information for malaria control and elimination efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Accordingly, the World Health Organization recommends using <italic>msp2</italic> in combination with <italic>glurp, msp1</italic>, and microsatellite markers, to track infections and assess drug efficacy by distinguishing between recrudescence and reinfection during drug trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Genotyping of <italic>msp2</italic> is widely used to assess the diversity of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasite population, however, studies using <italic>msp2</italic> as a diversity marker commonly focus on single study sites, reporting multiplicity of infection (MOI), or proportions of the two allelic families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] in relation to transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], age, or malaria severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Few studies have surveyed thediversity of the <italic>msp2</italic> locus over a broad temporal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] or geographical level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Such a survey is valuable for understanding the molecular epidemiology and transmission patterns of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, as well as the distribution of antigenic variants and their importance for immunity.</p><p id="P5">The <italic>msp2</italic> locus encodes three major structural domains within five blocks: The outer conserved termini are called blocks 1 and 5, and blocks 2 and 4 are referred to as dimorphic regions, containing family-specific sequences used to divide variants into two allelic families FC27 and IC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. The central block 3 is highly variable comprising both tandem repeats and variable sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. While this structure is well documented, no clear patterns of geographical distribution have been identified. Genotyping of <italic>msp2</italic> typically involves PCR amplification of dimorphic and polymorphic blocks 2-4, followed by gel electrophoresis to separate PCR products according to fragment size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. While this method is simple and accessible, it lacks the resolution to distinguish between fragments of similar lengths or detect minority clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. The adaptation of fragment sizing to capillary electrophoresis (CE) has improved detection of size variation, enabling highly reproducible sizing of PCR amplicons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Although sequencing of <italic>msp2</italic> has previously been limited by gene length and repeats, recent technical advances now allow for long-read sequencing of the entire locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Results from several of our own genotyping studies, as well as others’ studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], suggest that certain fragment sizes are detected more frequently than others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Understanding whether these are common in the parasite population over a large geographic area and over time, is needed for the development of MSP2 as a vaccine target.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P6">The study included PCR-based genotyping of <italic>msp2</italic> from 2761 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates, originating from 34 countries between 1993 and 2021, in Sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-C</xref>). Samples were collected as part of 19 studies conducted in 12 countries (n=2391), and from travelers diagnosed with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria in Sweden after arriving from Africa (n=370).

Distinct peaks in frequency of detection were found for alleles from both families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). The ten most prevalent FC27 size variants comprised between 3-16% of all FC27 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>), with a cumulative frequency of 67%. The ten most prevalent IC size variants comprised between 2.5-3.5% of all detected IC variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>), with a cumulative frequency of 23%. This contrasted with the cumulative prevalence of variants detected once or twice (FC27 n=76, IC n=87), adding up to approximately 3% of variants in each family.

Thus, additional markers to discriminate between reinfection and recrudescent strains remain necessary. Furthermore, a threshold number of SNPs or percent identity should be determined for calling sequences as different variants.

High affinity antibodies towards MSP2 and other merozoite antigens are associated with protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>], but importantly, antibody affinity is impacted by conformational changes in the antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. MSP2 is a highly abundant surface protein, and is thought to play a role in lipid interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Although allelic dimorphism is not unique to <italic>msp2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>], its specific role in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> remains unclear. The kinetics of fibril formation in FC27 and IC MSP2 differ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>], due to variation outside the conserved N and C termini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Many intrinsically disordered proteins contain short secondary structure regions flanked by disordered regions, called molecular recognition features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. Typically involved in molecular interactions, these regions can induce folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>] and are prone to aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>], a phenomenon that has been noted for MSP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. The secondary structure resulting from MSP2’s polymorphic block 3 and flanking regions may have such a role in modulating binding, influencing fibril formations, or hiding epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. MSP2 also appears to be dispensable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>], suggesting redundancy or a role in immune evasion. Indeed, the highly observed non-synonymous mutations in our data are common to genes subject to strong selective pressure, particularly those implicated in immune evasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. While immune pressure drives the extensive sequence diversity, the persistence of certain size variants suggests that gene length may have an important role. Common variants, like FC27_329, could be more easily expressed and maintained in the population, with mutations influencing immune recognition but not gene length.</p><p id="P27">There are several limitations to this study. First, we were unable to retrieve all sequenced <italic>msp2</italic> from the <italic>in silico</italic> pipeline due to the noise threshold, based on negative controls. While this may have removed true reads, it also ensures that all output sequences are true reads. Secondly, our statistical analysis was based on the hypothesis that any <italic>msp2</italic> variant genotyped from a randomly distributed population would have highly similar prevalence. This assumption does not account for the variable lengths of blocks 2 and 4, the additional family-specific repeats, or increased numbers of T’s in the IC block 3. Without knowing the mechanism behind why or how these kinds of repeats are added or deleted from the locus, we could not factor this into the statistical analysis. Finally, different sample materials, equipment, and slightly different PCR conditions between laboratories may have affected our ability to detect and genotype parasite <italic>msp2</italic> with equal accuracy and precision. While it is possible that we missed minority clones with, for example dried blood spot samples, our main observations were not limited to sites with the exact same sampling methods. On the other hand, the major strength of this study is the broad geographical and temporal spread of samples, which we believe makes it representative of <italic>P. falciparum msp2</italic> across Sub-Saharan Africa. The precision and reproducibility of length genotyping by CE, and the novel genotyping method based on high-fidelity long-read sequencing, are also major strengths. While our results confirm the diversity in <italic>msp2</italic> gene length, our study shows for the first time the extensive sequence diversity in single CE-determined size variants. Our results provide a foundation for further research and a better understanding of polymorphic antigens, which are important not only in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> but in other human pathogens as well.</p><p id="P28">To conclude, we present a comprehensive study of <italic>P. falciparum msp2</italic> genetic diversity across Sub-Saharan Africa. We identified extensive diversity in both <italic>msp2</italic> gene length and sequence. We also demonstrate a pattern of maintenance of the most commonly detected <italic>msp2</italic> size variants and sequences across a broad geographical and temporal scale. We believe that our results lay groundwork for identifying which variants are important for parasite biology and naturally acquired immunity to malaria. Furthermore, our findings suggest features of a polymorphic locus which could be leveraged for vaccine design, and may also be applicable to other polymorphic antigens. Additional studies of common <italic>msp2</italic> variants and sequence diversityin the context of immunity, could pave the way for the further development of MSP2 as a multicomponent vaccine target.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="P29">This study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Dnr 2008-998-31-3; Dnr 2011/1658-31/4 with amendments 2018/1967-32, 2024-01464/2; 2019-05746).
