To aid in therapy development, we sought to achieve robust detection of cognitive performance after stroke in a multi-site design. Ischemic stroke was induced in adult and middle-aged male C57BL/6J mice utilizing three well-established models: distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO), dMCAO with hypoxia and transient MCAO. Cognitive outcomes were assessed via Novel Object Recognition (NOR) and Barnes Maze (BM) tests prior to surgery, and during sub-acute (1-2 weeks) and chronic (8 weeks) phases post-stroke. Histology and immunostaining were used to assess infarct size, tissue damage and neuronal loss, and plasma neurofilament light was quantified. We did not detect a reliable cognitive deficit after stroke using NOR but saw a promising signal from BM (single site tested only). Overall, our study highlights the often-encountered challenges in detecting post-stroke cognitive impairment within the pre-clinical stroke community, as well as a number of complexities in the design and execution of pre-clinical stroke cognition studies, particularly as applied to a multi-site structure. We provide recommendations and suggest important aspects of stroke cognition studies to consider in the future, whether operating as an individual lab or a multi-site group.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cognitive behavioral testing</kwd><kwd>multi-center trial</kwd><kwd>neurofilament light chain</kwd><kwd>post-stroke cognitive impairment</kwd><kwd>stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Stroke represents a significant global health burden, contributing to high rates of mortality and disability. Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) has been identified by survivors as one of the most distressing consequences. PSCI affects up to one-third of stroke survivors within five years, and greatly diminishes their quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> This is underscored in surveys conducted among both patients and healthcare professionals, which identified the foremost priority in the field to be research aimed at improving cognitive symptoms such as impairments in memory and concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> Notably, stroke doubles the risk of subsequent cognitive impairment, irrespective of controlling for established vascular risk factors such as hypertension and obesity, or the prevention of additional infarcts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> PSCI represents a critical unmet need due to the absence of available treatments and lack of mechanistic understanding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">One way to address this unmet need is through the development and characterization of pre-clinical stroke models that generate robust cognitive deficits. Such models would create opportunities for pre-clinical screening of candidate interventions and improve prospects for translation into clinical therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> Previous networks have conducted therapeutic testing in multi-center, randomized pre-clinical trials utilizing stroke size as a primary endpoint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> The Stroke Preclinical Assessment Network (SPAN) has made important advances by establishing a multi-center trial protocol with sensorimotor function changes as the primary readout.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> Nonetheless, a need still remains to consider other functional outcomes relevant to stroke survivors, including cognitive decline, altered mood and fatigue. Researchers could then validate potential therapeutics using robust outcome measures with high clinical relevance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup></p><p id="P6">Rodents have a remarkable ability for spontaneous recovery after ischemic stroke, making long-term behavioral testing challenging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> Cognitive testing, in particular, is time intensive, can be hard to interpret and is difficult to perform reproducibly. Additionally, inter-lab inter-investigator and inter-animal variability are all difficult to overcome and present a major challenge for pre-clinical multicenter trials. Due to these challenges which are well-recognized within the field, there is likely an inherent publication bias against negative or neutral results from these studies, as observed generally in life science research, limiting the ability of the field to identify best practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup></p><p id="P7">It is also important to consider that cognitive decline after stroke likely arises from multiple etiologies. Acute cognitive decline is directly related to lesion size and location.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> While these direct effects may persist, additional mechanisms such as neurodegeneration and/or unresolved harmful inflammation may also underlie new diagnoses of PSCI in the chronic phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> Altered brain-wide connectivity is also likely a factor in longer-term cognitive changes after focal stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> Thus, it is important that cognitive tests can reliably detect a deficit at multiple timepoints after stroke, including chronic ones. Additionally, human ischemic stroke is a heterogeneous and complex disease, due to high inter-patient variation, which cannot be fully recapitulated using any one model of pre-clinical stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> Thus, assessing cognition in multiple stroke models that generate different amounts and anatomical patterns of damage will increase the sensitivity for detection of PSCI.</p><p id="P8">The Stroke-IMPaCT Network, a multi-site network comprising six labs across Europe and North America, was established to understand immune mechanisms contributing to PSCI, and from this, to identify and test novel immunomodulatory interventions. An enabling primary aim was to identify protocols that robustly detect cognitive impairment after experimental stroke in multiple labs. Our multi-site project design tested cognitive behavioral outcomes during both sub-acute (1-2 weeks) and chronic (8 week) phases of ischemic stroke. We included three stroke models, and tested at two different ages with two cognitive assays to more accurately reflect the complexity of the human stroke population. While we did not identify a combination of stroke model and cognitive test for robust detection of PSCI, we expect that our findings will aid the field (1) in managing expectations for detection of pre-clinical PSCI using commonly-applied approaches, and (2) as a basis for refining methodology to reproducibly detect cognitive impairment in pre-clinical models of ischemic stroke in future trials.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="P9">Detailed material and methods are available in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Materials</xref>.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Animals</title><p id="P10">All animal protocols were performed and reported in conformity with the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines.

Briefly, the unified NOR task consisted of two phases: a training phase (Phase I) and testing phase (Phase II). In Phase I, a single animal was placed in the arena with two identical objects and allowed to explore freely for 5 min. Phase II started 3 h after the completion of Phase I. Here, mice were exposed to one familiar and one novel object for 5 min, and their interactions with the objects were recorded. Objects were counterbalanced between animals, to avoid any innate object preference. Time spent interacting with each object was manually recorded by a blinded experimenter. To assess task performance, a discrimination index (DI) score was calculated with: (t<sub>novel</sub>-t<sub>familiar</sub>)/(t<sub>novel</sub>+t<sub>familiar</sub>). A score closer to -1 indicates a preference for the familiar object, a score closer to +1 indicates a preference for the novel object, and a score close to 0 demonstrates no object preference.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Barnes Maze</title><p id="P13">A modified Barnes maze (BM) protocol was utilized as previously described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> with minor modifications for middle-aged mice. Briefly, the BM consisted of a large, circular platform with 16 holes on the outer edge, which was positioned approximately 90 cm off the floor in the center of the room. All maze holes were left open to the floor, except for one which contained an escape hole. The escape hole was aligned with one of four visual cues, which were equally spaced around the testing room. Mice performed four trials per day for four consecutive days at each testing timepoint. The escape hole position was fixed for the entirety of the task, while the starting position of each trial within a day was altered relative to the escape hole position. Each trial had a maximum duration of 90 s. If a mouse failed to find the escape hole within 90 s, it was gently guided towards the escape hole by tapping its tail and hind legs. The time (in seconds) to identify the escape hole (primary latency), defined as a mouse entering the hole opening with at least their head, was manually recorded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Tissue Collection and Processing</title><p id="P14">Mice were euthanized at 3 or 56 days following stroke by exsanguination and intracardiac perfusion with 0.9% saline (without anticoagulant) under isoflurane anesthesia (UoE, UoA), sevoflurane (CNIC), sodium pentobarbital (WC), or xylazine/ketamine (SU, CUB).

The distribution of overt pathology at 56 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) was broadly similar to 3 days.

We also assessed NeuN coverage as a marker for neuronal death in the hippocampus, however saw no reductions in NeuN coverage in any model after stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D, E</xref>). In contrast to the acute timepoint, at 56 days there was no difference in plasma NfL concentration in dMCAO or DH stroke mice compared to their respective shams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). We did, however, observe elevated plasma NfL in tMCAO stroke mice compared to shams.

Indeed, over the course of training, the primary latency of naïve mice significantly decreases, representing improved task performance.

Here, we capitalized on a multi-site infrastructure embedded within the Stroke-IMPaCT network that spans six sites in Europe and North America. Three stroke models, three testing timepoints (pre-stroke, sub-acute phase, chronic phase) and two ages were used to assess cognition after stroke, initially using NOR. We found that low baseline DI (i.e. failure to show a preference for the novel object) led to a high number of exclusions in adults, and this was exacerbated by age and less habituation time. In addition, protocol and site-specific differences contributed to high variability at some sites. Overall, NOR did not detect stroke-specific changes in cognitive performance in any model at any site at either age. We implemented the BM as a secondary measure of cognitive function, which achieved fewer exclusions and demonstrated stroke-induced cognitive changes in middle-aged dMCAO mice (single site only). Overall, our study highlights the often-encountered challenges in detecting PSCI within the pre-clinical stroke community, as well as a number of complexities in the design and execution of pre-clinical stroke cognition studies, particularly as applied to a multi-site structure. We provide recommendations and suggest important aspects of stroke cognition studies to consider in future work whether operating as an individual lab or a multi-site group.</p><p id="P37">Our multi-site structure enabled us to incorporate a greater range of stroke models than would be possible within an individual lab, while also allowing for inter-site comparisons within models. We did not aim to standardize surgical or husbandry protocols due to regulatory and operational differences across sites. This also allowed us to assess recent observations suggesting productive heterogeneity can be an asset in multi-center studies, to increase generalizability of findings. Previous multi-center pre-clinical stroke studies have had a differing purpose (i.e. to test candidate stroke therapeutics) to our current study and have adopted differing degrees of protocol harmonization across participating sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup></p><p id="P38">We used established stroke models in the field with anticipated patterns of underlying pathology but considered it important to confirm this, to assist with interpretation of behavioral results. As expected, the distal MCAO models produced infarcts largely confined to the cortex with greater involvement of subcortical structures in the tMCAO model. The dMCAO and DH stroke models were consistent in infarct size and location across sites and surgeons, an important finding as it eliminates these factors as a source of variability. Both models are therefore good candidates for multi-center trials due to this consistency and because of low surgical time, fast recovery, and low mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> In contrast, higher variability in the tMCAO model was observed both within and across sites. This likely reflects the inherently more variable tMCAO procedure. The stroke lesion in the tMCAO model is influenced by anatomical differences in the Circle of Willis which is highly variable in C57BL/6J mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> The lesion size in this model is also highly dependent on extent and timing of reperfusion which can vary due to the ‘no-reflow phenomenon’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> This suggests that the tMCAO model may require additional inclusion/exclusion criteria and standardization of surgical protocols to reach a desired balance between model heterogeneity and low variability. Chronic pathology in stroke models is less well documented and more likely to be associated with cognitive function, given the potential for secondary/remote brain injury to evolve over time. The distribution of gross stroke damage remained largely consistent between acute and chronic timepoints, however more frequent pathology in thalamic and hippocampal brain regions and substantial ipsilateral brain atrophy was evident 56 days after stroke. In future studies, these structural and gross pathological changes may be captured by longitudinal MRI. Ongoing chronic neurodegeneration may also potentially be detected by blood NfL levels. We measured plasma NfL concentration in both acute (3 day) and chronic (56 day) phases. Whilst plasma NfL concentration was elevated in all stroke models at 3 days and correlated with 3 day infarct sizes, consistent with clinical data,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> by 56 days, plasma NfL was elevated only after tMCAO albeit at lower levels. Thus, while plasma NfL is a sensitive early biomarker for acute neurological damage after stroke, greater assay sensitivity may be needed to detect later degeneration, particularly in the distal MCAO models.</p><p id="P39">As in other multi-site studies, there is often a balance to strike in choosing methods with potential for widespread implementation with varying resources versus assay applicability and sensitivity. We did not detect a cognitive deficit after stroke with any variation of the NOR task. This was surprising as multiple network members have successfully used this task in the past to detect a deficit in single-site experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> We found that with predefined object interaction criteria, NOR can be scored consistently between observers, and does not require automated testing software. Additionally, our data suggest that higher habituation increased DI score, while any amount of handling or habituation reduced the variability in DI scores. This implies that animal anxiety may play a role in outcome variability, although we can’t exclude that environmental differences at each site may also impact these observations. Finally, our results indicate that NOR is prone to re-testing effects, and thus, may not be suitable for longitudinal studies. Overall, while NOR may be a useful test to implement on an individual lab basis where protocols can be tailored to maximize performance, it is not robust for use in multi-site studies.</p><p id="P40">We observed multiple patterns of damage affecting cortical, thalamic and hippocampal areas in our three pre-clinical models, therefore it is possible that NOR is not sensitive enough to detect subtle cognitive changes. Notably, executive function and processing speed are more likely to be affected in human stroke survivors and in vascular cognitive impairment and dementia generally, suggesting that cognitive tests of memory such as NOR may not be the most sensitive for detection of PSCI. In contrast, despite low N across groups, we saw a promising signal from the BM which primarily targets spatial working memory and processing speed. Of note, we did find evidence of hippocampal neuronal perikaryal damage, suggesting that neuronal function may be impacted after stroke. This has been observed in the DH model, where hippocampal LTP is normal at one week after stroke, then progressively worsens up to 12 weeks after stroke, and is associated with a cognitive deficit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> However, there was no relationship between the presence of hippocampal neuronal injury or changes in thalamic NeuN density and NOR performance in the current study. It is possible that there may be more subtle cognitive changes in the chronic phase after stroke, which require more precise cognitive testing to capture. There are many other cognitive tasks that we could not test, and we do not exclude there may be others that are effective. Where feasible, the incorporation of additional modalities such as electrophysiology, functional-MRI and calcium imaging may improve detection of changes in functional neural substrates/surrogates underpinning cognitive processes after stroke in pre-clinical models.</p><p id="P41">In addition to this, experimenter experience likely contributed to the high variability across sites for all cognitive testing, which likely impacted our ability to detect cognitive changes after stroke. Anecdotal observations across network labs have supported the idea that the ability to detect a cognitive deficit after stroke can vary by experimenter, even when other variables such as surgeon, testing environment and testing protocol are consistent. This may be due to sex differences in the experimenters, or additional intangible differences in experience and demeanor which impact the variability in outcomes of cognitive testing experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> To overcome these confounding factors when testing at multiple sites, automated tasks that reduce experimenter input such as touch-screen chambers may improve detection of pre-clinical PSCI. Nonetheless, in the specific case of NOR testing here it is unlikely experimenter differences were consequential as there was a consistent lack of PSCI detected across all sites and models.</p><p id="P42">To our knowledge, we are the first network to assess cognition after stroke with a multi-site design. We were limited, however, in our ability to incorporate both sexes and additional comorbidities such as hypertension and obesity which are common in human stroke survivors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> Mouse strain also impacts behavior and ischemic susceptibility, and incorporating additional strains may improve translatability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> Finally, anesthetics, which have been shown to impact cognitive outcomes, varied between sites and likely contributed to increased variability within models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> Each of these factors may increase variability in outcome measurements,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> and should be considered in future multi-site designs. Despite this, we successfully demonstrated that it is possible to reproduce consistent infarct sizes and pathological damage at multiple sites utilising the same stroke models. Another major strength of our study is the use of two cognitive tasks that assess complementary cognitive domains, and our incorporation of two age groups. Together, our results suggest that a multi-site design of this kind enables the incorporation of a greater range of stroke models and increases statistical power (via higher n), generating useful heterogeneity which would be unachievable within an individual lab.</p><p id="P43">Our findings highlight a need to manage expectations for detection of pre-clinical PSCI using commonly-applied behavioral paradigms, which should be carefully considered based on the study’s primary aims. We have provided a ranked list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) of readily used cognitive behavior tasks and compiled our recommendations into a framework for future testing of PSCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). This framework was specifically designed to ensure rigor and reproducibility with a goal of improving translatability. In it, we have prioritized tasks that mice are able to perform at baseline, prior to any surgical intervention, to reduce the required animal number for the experiment and maximize statistical power. We next consider whether the task can detect a cognitive deficit after stroke at a single site, and then whether it can be replicated at an additional site with the same effect size. Finally, our framework incorporates additional refinements to reduce experimenter time and improve statistical power such as automating the task and reducing inter-rater variability. In addition, we recommend that a) all sites incorporate handling and habituation, b) repeat testing is minimized, c) exclusion criteria are defined <italic>a priori</italic>, d) power calculations are performed after baseline testing, prior to surgical or pharmacological intervention, and e) multiple tests are incorporated to better evaluate different cognitive domains in sub-acute and chronic phases of stroke recovery. Finally, we advise against the use of NOR in a multi-site design, particularly in aged mice, due to the high number of exclusions we observed in our study. We instead encourage future testing of the BM, as it can be successfully undertaken in older mice, is not affected by repeated testing, tests spatial and working learning/memory, and showed detection of cognitive deficits at the single site tested in our study.</p><p id="P44">In conclusion, we have demonstrated the inherent challenges in assessing PSCI in pre-clinical stroke using community-established models and cognitive tasks. The NOR task is highly variable, poor performance prior to any surgical interventions leads to a high number of exclusions (which is exacerbated in older mice) and did not detect PSCI in any model at any site. In contrast, the BM is less variable and exclusions due to inability to perform the task prior to stroke are low. Given the promising single-site data from the dMCAO model, the BM warrants testing more broadly. Our findings are informative for the development of multi-site trials to test potential therapeutic interventions and in providing individual labs with important questions to consider when choosing which cognitive tasks may be most suitable in pre-clinical stroke studies. We hope this work will enable the field to move forward towards well-designed pre-clinical studies that are rigorous and reproducible and lead to critically needed therapies to prevent PSCI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures and Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS205789-supplement-Supplementary_Figures_and_Tables.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d16aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Methods</label><media xlink:href="EMS205789-supplement-Supplementary_Methods.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d16aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Lizi Hegarty, Michael J.D.
