astrocytic mitochondria with the dye MitoTracker. Here we report that MitoTracker transfers to neurons from both astrocytes and astrocyte-conditioned media, independently of mitochondrial transfer. Our observations should prompt an essential re-evaluation of the literature concerning astrocyte-neuron mitochondrial transfer and in other systems in which contact-independent transfer has been observed using mitochondrial dyes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Intercellular mitochondrial transfer (IMT) from astrocytes to neurons has been reported in sixteen papers from fifteen independent groups since the first report in 2016 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">From these reports, it has been concluded that astrocytes can release functionally intact mitochondria, either within extracellular vesicles (EV-mitochondria) or unenveloped, and neurons co-cultured with astrocytes or astrocyte-conditioned media (ACM) can take up astrocytic mitochondria. This transfer is upregulated following the application of mitochondrial stress to neurons, including oxygen/glucose deprivation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> , cisplatin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> , or rotenone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Furthermore, increased transfer correlates with improved neuronal viability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> . Notably, this neuroprotection can be observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, where transplantation of astrocytic mitochondria to the brains of mice can prevent neuronal damage in models of ischemia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">To study IMT, it is essential to selectively label mitochondria in the donor cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. For astrocyte-neuron transfer, the majority of studies have employed the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker<sup>™</sup> (mainly CMXRos but also Green/Deep Red) to label astrocytic mitochondria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. However, a recent report showed that MitoTracker, which binds thiol-groups in mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, can transfer between macrophages, B16 cells, HEK 293T cells and immortalised bone marrow derived cells independently of mitochondrial transfer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. This dye transfer was found to be dependent on cell contact in the systems that were investigated, with no transfer observed in transwell co-cultures which separate donor and acceptor cells. However, many MitoTracker-based studies have shown that astrocytic mitochondria can transfer through transwells and ACM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is uncertain to what extent previously reported astrocyte-neuron IMT is due to the transfer of dye rather than mitochondria. The aim of this study was to provide clarity on this issue.</p><p id="P5">To do this, we generated primary cortical astrocyte cultures from MitoTag x <italic>GFAP-cre</italic> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, where outer-mitochondrial membrane-targeted GFP (GFP-OMM) is expressed exclusively in astrocytes. These astrocytes were then labelled with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker and washed thoroughly to eliminate any residual extracellular dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). Using these dual mitochondrially-labelled astrocytes, we set out to compare the transfer of dye vs the transfer of mitochondria labelled with the genetically-encoded tag.</p><p id="P6">We first compared mitochondrial dye and MitoTag transfer in neuron-astrocyte cocultures because mitochondrial dye transfer was previously shown to be contact dependent. By imaging co-cultures immediately after application of astrocytes to primary cortical neurons expressing mTagBFP2, we observed that MitoTracker rapidly labelled mitochondria within adjacent neurons after only a few minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Ext. Data 1a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Video 1</xref>). However, GFP-OMM, which corresponds to mitochondria, did not transfer to neurons within the acquisition period of 30 minutes. Therefore, no IMT occurred over this brief timeframe. The same observation could be made away from the site of image acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Ext. Data 1b</xref>). After co-culture for 48 hours, a typical experimental duration based on previous reports, GFP-OMM, amplified by anti-GFP immunofluorescence, could be identified extracellularly to astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-i</xref>). Most of these extracellular astrocytic mitochondria were proximal to neurons but none were transferred to neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g,i</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Ext. Data 1c</xref>), while the mitochondrial dye was observed within neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). Therefore, we find that in contact-co-cultures mitochondrial dye transfers rapidly from astrocytes to neurons, without concomitant transfer of mitochondria.</p><p id="P7">We hypothesised that MitoTracker could also be transferred via ACM. To explore this, ACM from dual labelled astrocytes was applied to neurons during image acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Notably, the MitoTracker fluorescence significantly increased in neurons throughout the image acquisition period, while the GFP-OMM signal did not increase above background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supp. Video 2</xref>). Furthermore, depletion of mitochondria/EVs by filtration or further centrifugation of ACM reduced the fluorescence intensity in neurons, reflecting a reduction in mitochondrial dye transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e,f</xref>). This suggests that EVs or other cell components that are depleted by filtration or centrifugation can augment mitochondrial dye transfer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. After 24 hours, we were still unable to detect GFP-OMM uptake within neurons whereas MitoTracker was still observable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Therefore, MitoTracker can transfer from astrocyte-conditioned media independently of mitochondrial transfer.</p><p id="P8">We have shown that the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker rapidly transfers from both astrocytes and ACM to neurons, independently of mitochondrial transfer. Therefore, MitoTracker transfer does not correspond to mitochondrial transfer and should not be used to investigate IMT.</p><p id="P9">We were unable to identify transfer of astrocytic mitochondria to neurons using genetically-encoded markers. However, we recognise that light microscopy has much lower throughput than flow cytometry, which is more commonly used to assess transfer. As such, we do not refute that mitochondrial transfer from astrocytes to neurons can occur. This is supported by the existing evidence for mitochondrial transfer in studies using genetically-encoded mitochondrial labels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> . Instead, we believe that IMT from astrocytes to neurons is much less common than previously reported. Furthermore, it remains possible that neuronal stress such as ischemia could increase IMT, however, this needs to be confirmed using genetically-encoded mitochondrial labels.</p><p id="P10">The release of free or EV-mitochondria by astrocytes is now well established through electron microscopy, western blots and ATP assays of conditioned media <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In support of this, we were able to identify extracellular astrocytic mitochondria, some of which were in close proximity to, but not internalised by, neurons. While the work described here brings into question IMT to neurons, we do not deny the potential benefits of mitochondrial release by astrocytes. For example, there is good evidence suggesting that astrocyte conditioned media or mitochondrial transplantation can be neuroprotective, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, against ischaemic insults <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> . However, we suggest a reconsideration of whether mitochondrial transfer is itself neuroprotective, or if the presence of mitochondria and/or EVs in the extracellular space is sufficient. Alternatively, the neuroprotective effect of ACM could be elicited by EVs not containing mitochondria.</p><p id="P11">In summary, we agree that MitoTracker dye should not be used to study intercellular mitochondrial transfer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Moreover, it is essential that previous findings are re-examined in the context of dye transfer. Further experiments using appropriate genetically-encoded mitochondrial labels will be necessary to validate and improve the understanding of mitochondrial transfer from astrocytes to neurons.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="methods | materials"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="S2"><title>Animals</title><p id="P12">Animal work was approved by the Francis Crick ethical committee and performed under UK home office licence PP3668665.
