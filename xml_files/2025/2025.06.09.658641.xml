These involuntary movements affect quality of life and are linked to lowered motor inhibition in the cortico-basal-ganglia motor network during hyperdopaminergic states. Several cortical and subcortical spectral biomarkers are associated with dyskinesia, but the oscillatory patterns associated with the behavioral complexity of involuntary movement and voluntary movement suppression that defines dyskinesia, is not studied so far. To elucidate these spatio-temporal dynamics and its behavioral relevance, we studied cortico-subthalamic oscillations in 21 Parkinson’s patients during a dyskinesia-provoking experiment. We differentiated between non-dyskinetic and dyskinetic periods, and split data based on a kinematic movement registration, leading to respectively resting states and voluntary movement, and active movement suppression and dyskinetic movement. Elevated theta-activity and attenuated beta-activity was found in the subthalamic nucleus during voluntary movement suppression within dyskinetic periods, while cortico-subthalamic gamma-activity was only elevated during dyskinetic movement presence. Subthalamic spectral changes significantly predicted dyskinesia presence, and the amount of registered movement significantly affected the predictive value of dyskinesia predictions. We propose a dyskinetic macrostate to consist of distinct behavioral microstates of dyskinetic movements versus movement suppression, both associated with distinct oscillations in the cortico-subthalamic motor network.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Dopaminergic replacement therapy is the cornerstone to treat hypokinetic symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD), but also adversely causes disabling abnormal involuntary movements, defined as levodopa induced dyskinesia (LID) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. As disease progression continues and requires larger and more frequent dopaminergic intakes, LID occurs in up to 80% of PD patients, impacting quality of life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. LID primarily emerges during moments of dopaminergic peaks and has a fluctuating heterogeneous clinical phenotype of involuntary movements, alternating with episodes of voluntary motor suppression and subjective internal motor restlessness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Typically, LID is treated with either pharmacological interventions that improve levodopa’s efficacy and allow dopamine reduction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> or target specific striatal projecting neurotransmitter-receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>; or with device-aided therapies such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Although overstimulation with DBS can induce dyskinesia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, DBS generally alleviates LID by allowing a reduction of dopaminergic medication <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and possibly by a long-term desensitization of dopamine receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Current understandings of the pathophysiology of LID hypothesize that a reduced cortical long-term depotentiation alters cortico-striatal synaptic plasticity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The impaired synaptic plasticity fails to balance dopaminergic cortico-basal-ganglia excitation and increases the likelihood of movement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. On a striatal level, chronic dopamine depletion is hypothesized to cause compensatory structural changes in striatal projection neuron architecture and fast spiking interneurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. These compensatory neural changes shift the balance between the canonical direct and indirect motor pathways to restore homeostasis during hypo-dopaminergic periods <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, long term dopaminergic depletion leads to abnormal spiking patterns of SPN neurons with loss of spatial and temporal selectivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Neural dynamics can partially be restored by dopaminergic treatment, but during hyper-dopaminergic periods, inverse abnormalities in striatal activity pattern with overcompensated reduction in motor inhibition may occur, facilitating LID <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Since the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is specifically involved in movement planning, execution, and cancellation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, STN DBS can directly modulate physiological motor stopping <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, but also dyskinetic movement 11. Invasive neurophysiological studies explored biomarkers that represent spectral network oscillations during different motor, cognitive, and emotional states in PD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Subthalamic beta activity has been established as a symptom-specific biomarker for bradykinesia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, independent of disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Furthermore, cortico-subthalamic gamma activity has been used to decode movement initiation, velocity and stopping <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, whereas increased theta band activity has been described in conflicting cognitive tasks during decision making and in impulse control disorders <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Regarding LID, elevated subthalamic and cortical gamma-band (60 – 90 Hz) activity has been associated with LID presence and severity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, similar to elevated subthalamic theta- and alpha-band (resp. 4 – 8 and 8 – 12 Hz) activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, and decreased subthalamic beta-band (13 – 35 Hz) activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. The spatiotemporal patterns of oscillations associated with LID so far, have not been differentiated with respect to the highly variable behavioral dynamics of LID <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, i.e. movement execution and movement suppression, and therefore their behavioral relevance within LID remains unclear <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. This highly variable behavioral pattern within LID, containing both presence and absence of movement execution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, may modulate neural oscillations by the degree of successful active motor suppression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. In this vein, we hypothesize that LID in PD patients consists of distinct behavioral states, with distinct neural oscillations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, in line with a first rodent study that differentiated between distinct dyskinetic movements in rodents with distinct neural patterns <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">A recent concept developed to explain integrated systemic, cardio-behavioral states in the context of emotional challenge <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> allows to characterize temporal dynamics of behavioral and physiological changes over variable time-periods <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Herein, slow transitions are termed as macrostate changes and contrast fast-changing, momentary microstates, which reflect short-lasting distinct behavioral or neural patterns.</p><p id="P5">To gain insight into the behavioral relevance of LID-related biomarkers, we hypothesize that the heterogeneous behavior during dyskinetic periods can be explained by distinguishable neural and behavioral states that differ in spatio-temporal spectral characteristics. First, a prerequisite for LID to occur is the slow transition from the hypodopaminergic OFF state to the hyperdopaminergic ON state in PD, which we consider a macrostate change <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. On the background of the hyperdopaminergic ON state, fast-changing microstates may occur that lead to the execution of dyskinetic movements. To investigate the hypothesized states-concept, we characterized spectral patterns in invasive subthalamic and cortical neurophysiological recordings from the hypodopaminergic OFF state to the hyperdopaminergic ON state with LID, during the execution of dyskinetic movements and during voluntary movement suppression. The latter behavioral states we defined based on the presence and absence of movement execution during a dyskinetic state. We identified distinct subthalamic theta and beta oscillations associated with the slow-changing dopaminergic periods considered as a macrostate. Fast-changing patterns of cortico-subthalamic gamma oscillations that depend on the presence of dyskinetic movement could be defined as microstate changes. The identification of the behavioral relevance of these spatio-temporal spectral changes during dyskinetic periods will help us to better understand LID’s pathophysiology and cortico-subthalamic biomarkers relevant for motor control during LID. This may lead to optimized use of biomarkers for adaptive DBS tailored to clinical demands.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Dyskinetic periods contain moments with and without objectified movement execution</title><p id="P6">To investigate LID-related spectral patterns, we included twenty-one PD patients implanted with bilateral STN DBS electrodes, of which thirteen received a temporary unilateral electrocorticography (ECoG) electrode (mean age: 61 years, standard deviation (sd): 9.2 years, mean disease duration: 10 years (sd: 4 years)) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). All participants performed a dyskinesia-provoking experiment during the interval (two to seven days) between their surgical implantation of DBS-electrodes and its connection to the internal pulse generator <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Participants started the experimental protocol in the medication-OFF condition (at least 12 hours of dopamine withdrawal) followed by a supra-threshold dosage of fast-acting levodopa (circa 1.5 morning dose of Madopar LT ®, Roche Pharma). STN and cortical activity were recorded during repetitive rest and unilateral self-paced hand tapping tasks, intermingled with unscripted pauses to avoid fatigue and experiment abortion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p><p id="P7">A clinical movement disorders specialist assessed the presence and severity of LID based on video recordings, using the Clinical Dyskinesia Rating Scales (CDRS). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> The presence of LID was observed in eighteen out of twenty-one participants (86%), of which fifteen had a preoperative history of LID (83%) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). One participant, that did not develop LID, had a preoperative LID history. The eighteen patients that did develop LID had mean peak dyskinesia severities of 5 CDRS points (sd: 3, range: 2 to 13 CDRS points), out of a maximum of 28 points (the latter corresponds to severe dyskinetic movement in all seven rated body parts).</p><p id="P8">The distributed repetitions of resting and tapping tasks blocks led to the recording of movement presence and movement absence in both dyskinetic states and non-dyskinetic states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We defined a dyskinetic period as a time interval that starts at the first observed dyskinetic movement and prolongs as long as the patient regularly shows abnormal involuntary movements. Dyskinetic periods will also contain moments of suppression of involuntary movements, usually achieved by active movement suppression with voluntary muscular co-contraction in between dyskinetic movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Fluctuations in the clinically assessed severity of a dyskinetic period were assessed on a minute level, while the observation of actual movement was objectively assessed on a sub second level with accelerometer data. Consequently, we differentiated between 1) movement presence during the non-dyskinetic period (i.e. voluntary movements), 2) movement absence during the non-dyskinetic period (i.e. the resting state), 3) movement presence during the dyskinetic period (i.e., execution of both voluntary and involuntary movements, during episodes clinically confirmed as dyskinetic), and 4) movement absence during the dyskinetic period (i.e., epochs of motor suppression, lacking objectified movement execution, within periods clinically confirmed as dyskinetic). This behavioral concept, that dyskinetic periods contain epochs of both movement presence and absence, is essential to assess different neural microstates, i.e. dyskinetic movements, during the hyperdopaminergic macrostate characterized by a dyskinetic period.</p><p id="P9">The three neural time-frequency plots represent spectral unilateral cortical (ECoG) and bilateral subthalamic (STN) activity. Note the decrease in beta activity bilaterally in the STN at about 10 minutes after levodopa intake and during LID, and irregular gamma synchronization during LID, mostly in the presence of movement. *: The recording was interrupted around minute 45 for a toilet break and the x-axis is adjusted accordingly.

Spectral activity was calculated using an unbiased data-dimensionality reduction method (spatio-spectral decomposition) on the multi-channel recordings and resulted in single time-frequency data per recording site <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. These data are optimized independently regarding signal-to-noise ratios per frequency band of interest (theta, beta, and gamma band; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). We hypothesized that distinct neural oscillatory patterns occur during hyperdopaminergic ON periods and correlate with the severity of dyskinetic periods. To this end, we first descriptively compared local STN and cortical changes occurring with the transition from OFF to ON dopaminergic periods and during different LID severity grades. All neural data from the rest and tap task were included, without specifying movement presence and absence. CDRS raters were blinded for neurophysiological results and scores were categorized into mild (less than 4 points), moderate (4 to 8 points), and severe LID (8 or more points) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Power spectral densities calculated over 10-second epochs showed an increase in subthalamic theta activity that occurred during the dopaminergic ON period without LID and gradually increased with LID-severity, whereas subthalamic low-beta activity showed a gradual decrease. Similarly, this low-beta decrease extended the low-beta decrease observed in both all non-dyskinetic periods as well as in ON-periods periods without LID after 30 minutes post-levodopa-intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, upper row). A large increase in narrow band gamma activity was observed in both subthalamic and cortical data predominantly during the dyskinetic periods but did not show a strong scaling effect with LID severity. Additionally, we calculated squared coherences in the same epochs to investigate how LID affects spectral connectivity between the two STNs and between the cortex and the ipsilateral STN. Inter-subthalamic coherence showed small and variable increases in theta-coherence and decreases in beta-coherence during the dyskinetic period but no obvious scaling effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, lower left). Gamma-activity was coherent between the cortex and the ipsilateral STN only in the two patients with severe LID.</p><p id="P11">Together, these spectral changes represent distinct neural patterns that represent medication induced macrostate changes: importantly, we describe the differences not only for the dopaminergic transition to the ON medication state without LID, but the dyskinetic state demonstrates a further spectral modulation.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Subthalamic theta- and beta-oscillations are associated with movement absence in between dyskinetic movements</title><p id="P12">The observed changes in oscillatory cortical and subcortical neuronal pattern have been associated with LID presence in prior studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. To explore the behavioral relevance of these long-lasting, dopamine-dependent macrostate changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) and their interaction with short-lasting movements, we split the neural data based on the presence and absence of movement. We first defined dyskinetic versus non-dyskinetic periods based on the clinical expert assessments of video recordings of the full protocol. Dyskinetic periods were identified as behavioral states that lasted at least several minutes, and did not change on a (sub)-second resolution. Within these periods (i.e., macrostates), movement presence and absence were defined using bilateral index-finger worn accelerometer data (TMSi Saga®, TMSi International, Oldenzaal, The Netherlands). Movement absence was verified by video protocol to exclude movements on other parts of the body. Movement start- and end-points were defined on a sub-second resolution based on a thresholding procedure and led to epochs of movement presence and absence (i.e., microstates). Combining the sub second movement detection with the clinical assessments of LID presence, resulted in the categorization of all neurophysiological data into the four mentioned behavioral categories, i.e. movement presence versus absence, and dyskinetic versus non-dyskinetic periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). We did not differentiate between voluntary and involuntary movements during dyskinetic period, since these two concepts are not reliably distinguishable. During dyskinetic periods, patients often try to mask involuntary movements with a voluntary movement, and voluntary movements vice versa often evolve into or provoke involuntary movements. All data were merged within the respective clinically relevant behavioral categories to identify the distinct neural pattern and its modulation during microstates of movement presence. Additionally, we defined an ON condition without LID, i.e., time points after 30 minutes post-levodopa-intake without LID (n = 15), to allow comparison of dyskinetic effects versus non-dyskinetic dopaminergic medication effects. Neural data were analyzed per recording source, i.e. per STN or ECoG electrode, using the first component of an un-biased spatial spectral decomposition method to reduce the data-dimensionality while optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Neural data were merged within their respective microstate clusters for LID- and movementpresence and underwent time-frequency decompositions allowing for spectral comparisons per canonical frequency band of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Movement presence and absence fluctuate</title><p id="P13">Spectral power densities and squared coherences were compared between the behavioral categories, within every frequency band of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

We argue that this small coefficient in the opposite direction as hypothesized, can be explained by the parallel increases in broad gamma during both dyskinetic movement absence and presence compared to non-dyskinetic periods. Modulations in cortical theta were significantly higher during dyskinetic movement presence versus absence (lmm-coeff. 0.3, p&lt;0.001), whereas subthalamic theta and both subthalamic and cortical beta activity did not differ significantly (lmm-coeff. resp. 0.02, p=0.04; -0.01, p=0.20; and 0.06, p=0.03).</p><p id="P22">Together, when comparing movement presence with movement absence, both during dyskinetic periods, dyskinetic movement is characterized by peak-gamma increases in the STN and the cortex, and broad-gamma increases in the cortex.

These findings demonstrate that the hypothesized cortical gamma activity related to LID is specific to movement presence during LID, and that increased activity in cortical gamma as well as subthalamic peak-gamma extend gamma modulation during non-dyskinetic, dopaminergic-ON movement presence.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Dyskinetic patterns lateralize contralateral in the cortex but spread bilateral in the STN</title><p id="P23">So far, we have observed relevant changes in spectral oscillatory activities during dyskinetic periods in both the absence and presence of movement (Table 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). To better understand the pathophysiological role of these LID-related changes within the cortico-basal-ganglia-motor network, we investigated their laterality with respect to clinically observed LID. For this sub analysis, we selected all dyskinetic periods of unilateral LID. Unilateral LID was defined as a sum CDRS of 1 or higher for one body side, while the sum of the other body side remained 0 CDRS points. Typically, unilateral LID marks the beginning of a dyskinetic period and often occurs at the more affected side of the body. Sixteen subjects experienced unilateral LID, of which eleven received a unilateral ECoG-electrode. This led to cortical recordings from five ipsilateral and six contralateral hemispheres with respect to the dyskinetic body side and subthalamic recordings from sixteen bilateral hemispheres.

Cortical recordings ipsilateral to the dyskinetic body side displayed an elevated mean gamma activity without a distinct peak. Modulation of cortical theta and beta activity did not show a consistent pattern. We suggest this to be due to the limited number of included subjects per group and the lack of movement selection. The observed results suggest that the specific subthalamic oscillatory activities during dyskinetic periods occur bilateral, whereas cortical LID-related oscillatory activity occurs only contralateral to the dyskinetic body side. Based on these findings, we excluded all cortical recordings during unilateral dyskinetic periods, originating from the hemisphere ipsilateral to the unilateral dyskinetic body side for further analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Theta- and gamma-increase and beta-decrease scale with dyskinesia severity</title><p id="P25">We demonstrated how neuronal patterns during dyskinetic periods differ regarding the absence or presence of movement.

Here, we propose an interpretation of our findings within a framework of systemic state changes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. A systemic state, of which there is only one at any given time for the entire system, integrates many other, more specific states, such as neural, behavioral, cardiac and others. These sub-states can vary in their spatial and temporal dynamics, which we can acknowledge by differentiating them into microstates (short-lasting) and macrostates (long-lasting). As such, all different sub-states form an integrated system responsible for specific behavior. Using neural deep brain recordings over an entire levodopa cycle that extends the dopaminergic dosage required for clinical benefit in our patients, we were able to measure neural and behavioral sub-states within periods of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) for a defined time period by repeated measurements and as entire time-series. Our findings propose that dyskinetic periods can be interpreted as hyperdopaminergic macrostates that contain distinct microstates of movement presence and movement absence which can be objectified in cortico-subthalamic oscillatory activities.

Herein, increased theta and decreased beta band activity have been associated with periods of reduced motor inhibition, whereas gamma synchronization has been related to motor execution, in line with our concept of long-lasting macrostate changes and intermingled movement-specific microstate changes. Nevertheless, these temporal and behavioral aspects of neural biomarkers during LID with respect to involuntary movement periods have not been elucidated before. In order to interpret the specific behavioral relevance of the neuronal activity modulation observed during dyskinetic periods, we distinguished LID periods containing both movement presence and absence during the hyperdopaminergic state. We observed movement-independent bilateral theta increase and beta reduction of subthalamic neuronal activity that occur with the dopaminergic ON period but further increase during the dyskinetic period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).

This is further supported by the significantly higher beta suppression with movement during LID as compared to movement during non-dyskinetic periods and the significant decoupling of inter-STN beta activity. The robustness of the LID-related beta attenuation regardless of movement presence, suggests that physiological and dopamine-dependent movement-related low beta synchronization and desynchronization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> may adapt their magnitude during the hyperdopaminergic state. To further investigate the latter however, the applied data-merging method (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>) limits the evaluation of single movement effects. A described relation between LID severity and attenuations in cortical beta activity previously observed in rodents <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, was not observed in our data.

Additionally, our data show that STN theta increase correlated with LID severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).

Whether task-related theta modulation more prominent in the motor-cognitive domain has a different functional role as compared to theta activity recorded within the motor cortical-basal ganglia loop during hyperkinesia cannot be answered with the current data available.

Importantly, we show for the first time a distinct movement-dependence of gamma activity associated with LID as we differentiated between movement presence and movement absence in dyskinetic periods. Previous findings on gamma synchronization during LID lack this information as current dyskinetic animal models typically lack movement absence recordings during dyskinetic periods <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>, similar to recent naturalistic patient recordings without continuous movement monitoring on a second-scale resolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Within our framework of macro- and microstate integrated state dynamics, we interpret these movements during dyskinetic periods as fast-changing microstates integrated in the complex phenotype of LID, which are represented by gamma elevations in bilateral STNs and the cortex contralateral to dyskinetic body sides. Movement execution has been closely associated with gamma synchronization on basal ganglia and cortical level suggesting that gamma increase may scale with the speed or vigor of voluntary movements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. During a hyperdopaminergic state of reduced motor inhibition an imbalance of reduced beta activity and excessive prokinetic gamma synchronization may lead to dyskinesia. Nevertheless, it is not yet clear if narrowband gamma oscillations cause dyskinesia or are simply a physiological short-lived correlate of (excessive) movements. In our patients, the strictly contralateral cortical gamma synchronization scaled with the dyskinesia severity and further supports that it can be used as a fast-tracking biomarker for movement activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. However, its contralateral expression opposed to dyskinetic movement makes it less robust as a biomarker in daily life and would suggest bilateral cortical recording hardware.</p><p id="P43">Subthalamic gamma activity has been argued to not merely effect movement execution, but also motor stopping <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>. Since the clinical phenotype of LID includes active motor stopping as patients’ typically intent to terminate involuntary movements, the observed decrease in cortical gamma activity during movement absence in the dyskinetic state may also be explained in parallel to reported decreases in subthalamic and thalamic gamma activity during successful intentional motor inhibition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P44">Together, fast changing movement-dependent gamma-magnitudes could be modulated by underlying slower bilateral theta and beta rhythm fluctuations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup> which would comply with the here suggested framework of interpreting the complex motor network activity associated with LID into macro- and microstate changes. The movement-independence of the bilateral subthalamic theta and beta patterns supports our hypothesis that they represent a slow fluctuating macrostate of lowered motor inhibition that leads to an increased likelihood of movement to occur. The movement dependence of the STN and cortical gamma patterns suggest a more volatile and fast-changing pathophysiological role that is more lateralized within the cortico-STN network and on the cortical level. Thus, we suggest dyskinetic movements to occur as fast-changing microstates represented by gamma activity changes, parallel to a slow-changing hyperdopaminergic macrostate of lowered motor inhibition represented by a reduction in beta and increase in theta activity within the cortico-STN network.</p><p id="P45">The hypothesized macro- and microstates fit into current fundamental principles and frameworks of motor inhibition within the cortico-basal-ganglia motor network. The striatal motor network lowers its motor inhibition under chronic dopaminergic depletion by adapting the SPN-architecture <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and the GABAergic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and glutamatergic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup> striatal projections. The hypothesized relevance of these striatal changes for the pathophysiology of LID <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>, was recently confirmed by studies showing that imbalanced clusters of direct- and indirect-SPN and structural hypertrophy of SPNs allow the occurrence of LID <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.

Moreover, the FSI-changes may explain the characteristic gamma activity during dyskinetic movement.</p><p id="P47">Since LID is a common target for adaptive DBS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref></sup>, the demonstrated clinical relevance of neurophysiological biomarkers can inform future adaptive DBS (aDBS) strategies, especially to improve spatial and temporal characteristics of different closed-loop feedback mechanisms such as fast versus slow aDBS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref></sup>. The demonstrated differences between cortical and basal ganglia spectral patterns during LID suggest that cortical biomarkers are sensible for fast aDBS algorithms that react to microstate changes, but may lose the specificity and effect with slow adapting algorithms. For the latter, subthalamic biomarkers may suit better using beta and theta band as biomarkers of macrostate changes. For example, in case a fast aDBS algorithm is targeted at movement-dependent cortical gamma activity, the volatile, non-continuous nature of movements has to be incorporated in the aDBS decision making process. The superiority of our subthalamic multivariate prediction model over the single ratio-biomarker and the cortical multivariate models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8BC</xref>), suggests that slow aDBS models (i.e., ten-second windows) do not profit from additional cortical features and perform best using computational heavier multivariate classifiers. The superiority of subthalamic features over cortical features to detect LID presence we hypothesize to be a result of the ten-second window length that favors slow network activity changes. We could therefore hypothesize that the prerequisite for dyskinesia to occur depends on the slower neural activity change at the level of the basal ganglia, which is in line with described discharge pattern changes within the striato-pallidal loop <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Microstate changes will not be preferentially detected in our prediction model due to the selected relatively long window length that inevitably leads to the merging of microstates of movement presence with periods of movement absence within the same window for prediction. Cortical features are therefore expected to have more predictive value in fast-aDBS strategies, applying shorter window lengths, and thus isolating separate microstates of movement presence. The latter is supported by earlier work showing that cortical features had more predictive value than subthalamic features in movement prediction on a sub-second temporal scale <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P48">Additionally we could demonstrate that the amount of movement presence within a ten-second window significantly affected the predictive performance of LID detection, since positive LID-present predictions were significantly more reliable in windows containing more movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8E</xref>).

The observed movement-independent spatial and spectral findings characterizing the dyskinetic state fit well into current pathophysiological concepts of an overcompensated motor disinhibition in PD that can allow for LID to occur. Finally, this improved behavioral understanding of these biomarkers aims to tailor future aDBS to their specific clinical purposes to optimally serve PD patients during real-life.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Patient inclusions and characteristics</title><p id="P51">We recruited 21 patients that underwent implantation of bilateral STN DBS electrodes as a treatment for idiopathic Parkinson’s disease at the Movement Disorders and Neuromodulation Unit of the Charité University Medicine Hospital.

The skip layers created a bottleneck in the temporal filter dimension, reducing it from 10 to 3 samples. A Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activation function was applied to each layer, with normalization on the output layer. The model used the “constant” temperature mode, a learning rate of 0.001, and was trained for 1000 iterations with a batch size of 300. Contrastive learning sampling was performed with the InfoNCE loss function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">106</xref></sup>, using a cosine distance between samples, by selecting time samples within a “time_offset” of 10, along with samples corresponding to the auxiliary dyskinesia binary training target variable. The four-dimensional embedding was following by training a ridge-regularized class-weight balanced logistic regression model, implemented in scikit-learn <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">104</xref></sup> (L-BFGS solver, 100 iterations), which was also applied for the non-cebra linear classifiers.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Analysis software</title><p id="P68">We performed all analysis with custom-written code in Python in which we made use of standard libraries as numpy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">107</xref></sup>, pandas <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">108</xref></sup>, scipy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">109</xref></sup>, sklearn.

Subthalamic theta and gamma elevations and beta-reductions occur in both contra- and ipsilateral data, while cortical gamma elevations only occur in the contralateral hemisphere opposed to the dyskinetic body side. All data result from Welch-transformations per ten-second epochs, without objectified movement selection. All percentage-changes are relative to the medication “OFF” state, defined as all non-dyskinetic-moments within the first five minutes after levodopa-intake, in the absence of movement, objectified with bilateral index-finger accelerometers. The blue lines represent spectral power changes in the hemispheres ipsilateral to the dyskinetic body side; sand-color lines represent spectral power changes in the hemispheres contralateral to the dyskinetic body side. Due to the presence of bilateral STN-electrodes in all sixteen subjects with unilateral dyskinetic periods, and only unilateral ECoG-electrodes in the eleven subjects with unilateral dyskinetic periods and an ECoG-electrode, sample sizes differ per visualized group.

Subthalamic spectral activity is demonstrated in the left column, cortical spectral activity in the right column. Gamma activity seems to be more dependent on movement presence, whereas theta and beta modulations enhance with more severe dyskinesia. Local spectral power features were extracted from ten-second epochs of subthalamic data and averaged over bilateral STNs per epoch (left column) and cortical data (right column). Mean spectral powers are calculated per ten-second epoch (applying a 50%-overlap with consecutive ten-second epochs) and shown for the three main frequency bands of interest, i.e., theta band (4 – 8 Hz, first row), the low-beta range (12 – 20 Hz, second row), and the peak gamma range (5 Hz bin around an individual gamma-peak frequency, third row). Power values are individually z-scored and color-coded with yellow representing high values and blue representing low values. X-axes represent the absolute dyskinesia severity as total sum of the clinical dyskinesia rating scale (CDRS), including bilateral and axial dyskinetic manifestations.

Only the STN CEBRA model is included based on its highest average performance. The x-axis is categorized based on z-scored individual accelerometer root mean squares and ranges from “No movement” (z-score -2 and less) to “Many movements” (z-score +4 and higher). The lines represent the distribution of individual PPV (green) and NPV (purple) values within the respective movement quantity. The NPV values show that the reliability, or the correctness, of “no LID present” predictions, shows a decreasing trend with increasing movement presence (Spearman R = -0.07, p = 0.06). Conversely, the PPV values show that the correctness of “LID present” predictions significantly increases with increasing movement presence (Spearman R = 0.27, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>a.u.: arbitrary units, bal. accuracy: balanced accuracy, CDRS: Clinical Dyskinesia Rating Scale, CEBRA: neural network using latent embedding (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>), ECoG: electrocorticography, LID: Levodopa-induced dyskinesia, LM: linear model, PPV: positive predictive value, STN: subthalamic nucleus, NPV: negative predicted value.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206460-f008"/></fig></floats-group></article>
