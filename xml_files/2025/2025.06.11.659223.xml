To our knowledge, this is the first study to use ddPCR to detect and quantify HIV-1 at the site of STB disease. HIV-1 DNA was detected in biopsies from patients with no detectable viral loads in the blood, potentially indicating tissue-specific presence and persistence. It is well known that HIV-1 integrates into the host genome as a provirus and can establish latency shortly after infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> As ART only inhibits actively replicating virus, it cannot eliminate the virus from latently infected cells, which persist through mechanisms such as homeostatic proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and represent a source of viral rebound, if treatment is interrupted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> In a recent review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, we presented a rationale for how the inflammatory state during active <italic>Mtb</italic> infection has the potential to both enhance viral replication, by driving transcription of HIV-1 genes from the HIV long terminal repeat promoter region, and to create an expanded cellular niche that is susceptible to HIV-1 infection. This may contribute to detectable viral loads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, albeit at low levels as ART adherence should prevent ongoing rounds of viral replication and rebound. While multiple factors can influence suppression of HIV VL, based on findings in our study, we hypothesize that HIV-1 tissue reservoirs at the site of STB inflammation may contribute to HIV-1 transcriptional activation and increased detection of circulating HIV-1 in these patients. However, since the HIV reservoir is composed of predominantly replication defective virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, only a limited proportion of latently infected cells can give rise to replication-competent viruses. Thus, more may be at play in the context of co-infection, driving ongoing HIV viral replication. Identifying tissue-based and specific cellular reservoirs of HIV-1 in patients on ART is critical to finding a cure for the virus. Recently, Chaillon <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> analysed HIV-1 reservoirs in both the blood, prior to death, and from various anatomical tissue sites, during post-mortems, of PLWH using ddPCR and showed evidence of the persistence of HIV in 27 deep anatomical sites including the colon, lymph nodes, and spleen. A prior study examined HIV-1 persistence in ART-treated individuals with undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and found PCR evidence of HIV-1 DNA in freshly isolated CD34+ bone marrow cells in 44% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> In addition, the detection of HIV proviral DNA (median: 62 copies/million cells) in bone marrow, using Realtime quantitative PCR (qPCR), was reported for Zambian individuals suppressed on ART in the first study to characterize HIV persistence in different anatomical sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. The Last Gift study analysed post-mortem tissue samples for the presence of HIV deep tissue reservoirs, and utilised ddPCR to measure HIV proviral copy number in the spinal cord and reported unexpectedly high levels of HIV at this site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> These reservoirs could be targeted for therapy either through cell-based drug delivery or by taking advantage of their close interaction with CD4+ cells, which are known to be a target of HIV-1 infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup></p><p id="P34">Overall, significant relationships were highlighted using the <italic>pol</italic> gene over the <italic>gag</italic> gene in samples where MTBC DNA was also detected and a strong positive correlation between <italic>pol</italic> and <italic>rpoB</italic> copies/million cells. Overall <italic>gag</italic> copy numbers appeared to be higher than <italic>pol</italic>. We cannot rule out that either the <italic>pol</italic> primer/probe set was less sensitive to provirus detection or that the <italic>gag</italic> primer/probe set may have produced off-target, background amplification signal, resulting in the discrepancies. As stated, the vast majority of HIV-1 proviral genomes are defective (either hypermutated or harbouring large internal deletions)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, and copy numbers of these two genes are not expected to be highly correlated. Most HIV-1 studies have focussed on whole blood and bone marrow aspirates for the detection of HIV-1 DNA. The Intact Proviral DNA Assay (IPDA) is a potential future improvement to our method, as it permits discrimination of defective proviral populations through amplification of targets that have an increased statistical likelihood of being present together only in intact genomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> Since viral reactivation and rebound would originate from the pool of cells harbouring intact proviral genomes, this could provide an opportunity to quantify the number of cells that can produce HIV in tissues that are also positive for <italic>Mtb</italic>. In future, isolation of specific cell populations from spinal biopsy tissues and flow cytometry or single cell omics in combination with ddPCR methods that distinguish intact viral genomes from those that are defective, as mentioned above, will aid in characterization of HIV-1 in these populations and specific cellular reservoirs. This will ultimately guide the improvement of TB and HIV-1 cure strategies that are specifically tailored to treat this potentially deadly syndemic.</p><p id="P35">The small sample size is a limitation of our study. This was due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the change in hospital seeking nature of our patients during enrolment period. In addition, the study was conducted at a single site. The study did not have a true TB negative control group, given the high rates of previous pulmonary TB in the <italic>Not STB</italic> group, confounding whether detection of MTBC DNA in the spine of those diagnosed as <italic>Not STB</italic> was due to current mis-diagnosis or migration of the previous infection that was no longer viable to the new clinical presentation. Future work should include the assessment of MTBC 16S mRNA as a complementary analysis to the detection of <italic>rpoB</italic> and <italic>IS6110</italic> DNA using ddPCR to inform potential viability of <italic>Mtb</italic>. More parallel studies using larger sample sizes, targeting more sequences, or involving different stages of disease, are needed to further clarify the diagnostic value of ddPCR for STB. ddPCR is not yet widely available, and widespread implementation has been hindered by the relatively high current cost per ddPCR reaction, compared with standard qPCR and more complex infrastructure and specialized personnel requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> However, recent innovations in chip-based vs droplet generation systems will likely overcome these factors. Future work should also compare the detection of MTBC and HIV-1 DNA in the peripheral blood, with the site of disease and how these may change with treatment. This would only be possible in patients who have repeated biopsies after they have been initiated on anti-tuberculous therapy for a certain level of time. Finally, we did not measure HIV RNA or proteins in tissue biopsies. Such assays could determine whether local replication of HIV is induced at sites of TB co-infection to confirm the TB inflammatory microenvironment facilitates HIV-1 reservoir persistence and activation in those ART established and peripherally suppressed.</p><p id="P36">In conclusion, rapid diagnosis of TB is crucial for patient treatment and outcome and for infection control. We report ddPCR can provide simple and rapid diagnosis of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, including in the context of HIV-1 infection, and may have superior sensitivity over Xpert Ultra, detecting low levels of DNA in 4 patients not diagnosed with STB by conventional molecular microbiological testing. We also report the co-localisation of both pathogens facilitates expansion of the other at the site of TB disease and this needs to be considered with detection methods and tailored treatment strategies that ensure penetrance into anatomical sites such as the spine. The contribution of the TB microenvironment as both a reservoir and site of HIV reservoir activation requires further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental</label><media xlink:href="EMS206471-supplement-Supplemental.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d14aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Nomsa Yekiso, Nosipho Mncwabe, Dr Qonita Hartley, Dr Chad Centner, Ms Nawaal Adikary and Zeenat Hoosen, orthopaedic surgical teams and our patients for helping, participating and contributing to global evidence.
