Advancements in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technologies offer unique opportunities to study parasite interactions with blood vessels in a well-defined host environment. However, endothelial iPSC-differentiation methods often result in cells with mixed epithelial identity. Here, we have generated an iPSC line with inducible and simultaneous expression of ETS transcription factors (ETV2, FLI1, ERG), which resulted in improved endothelial cell identity and strong barrier function. These cells display a high affinity to infected red blood cells. Exposure to parasite products caused significant endothelial metabolic changes and splicing alterations. Furthermore, it disrupted the iPSC-endothelial barrier, as a consequence of transcriptional downregulation of key barrier processes, and alteration of severe malaria biomarkers. Our novel iPSC-based approach represents a new <italic>in vitro</italic> platform to study the pathogenesis of vascular infections.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3"><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is the most severe human malaria parasite, causing over 600,000 deaths annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Severe malaria affects multiple organs, including the lungs, kidneys, liver, heart, and brain, with cerebral malaria being one of the most fatal complications. A major contributor to organ pathogenesis is <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected red blood cell (infected RBC) accumulation in the microvasculature, a phenomenon also known as sequestration. Models of severe malaria comprise either <italic>in vitro</italic> or rodent malaria infection models, with the latter poorly recapitulating high levels of parasite sequestration reported in patients. Since the endothelium is the key interface for pathogenic interactions, most <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental approaches have focused on endothelial cells. Unfortunately, immortalised cell lines often lack crucial junctional markers, while primary cells are prone to rapid dedifferentiation and batch-to-batch variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Moreover, both choices present poor endothelial barrier function, a critical feature for understanding vascular pathogenesis in severe malaria.</p><p id="P4">Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have become a promising alternative to address these shortcomings. Differentiation methods have been widely used in malaria research to generate RBC from hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). More recently, iPSC-derived erythrocytes have emerged as a novel tool for studying <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion into RBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), a technology that could be extended to dissect host-parasite interactions with blood vessels. One of the most commonly used endothelial differentiation methods generates iPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial cell-<italic>like</italic> cells (iBMEC-<italic>like</italic>). This differentiation method has been popular, as it is easy to implement and yields cells with consistent and strong barrier properties, functionally mimicking those found at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). However, iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> cells have recently sparked controversy, particularly with regard to their endothelial identity, as they express epithelial markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Nevertheless, iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> cells continue to be used in various applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), including the first iPSC <italic>in vitro</italic> model of cerebral malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Lentiviral expression of ETS transcription factors has been proposed as a strategy to rescue the endothelial phenotype of iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), and their overexpression is recently becoming a popular methodology for iPSC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Among ETS transcription factors, ETV2, ERG, and FLI1 are regulators of endothelial development. ETV2 stands out as a key orchestrator, coordinating the development by activating specific endothelial gene expression and even enabling the direct conversion of somatic cells into endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). ERG and FLI1 are both described as essential factors in endothelial development, angiogenesis, and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). However, to date, differentiation systems that promote ETS transcription factor overexpression have not been applied to investigate malaria pathogenesis, neither via lentiviral transduction nor through the introduction of stable transgenes. Here, we generated a doxycycline-inducible, stable transgenic iPSC line that upregulates ETV2, ERG, and FLI1 during iBMEC endothelial differentiation. The resulting cell type, ETS-iBMEC, presented increased transcription of endothelial markers and downregulation of epithelial transcripts. Although ETS-iBMECs showed equally strong barrier properties as iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> cells when grown in a 3D model, they exhibited a marked shift towards endothelial ultrastructural morphology. Perfusion of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected RBCs displayed increased cytoadhesion to ETS-iBMECs, and parasite products induced endothelial barrier disruption, two key pathogenic hallmarks of severe and cerebral malaria. Moreover, incubation with parasite egress product induced a progressive transcriptional dysregulation of endothelial development genes, robust downregulation of junctional, cytoskeletal, and basement membrane anchor genes in ETS-iBMECs. Interestingly, we also observed a dysregulation of spliceosome and metabolic pathways, revealing potential additional mechanisms for endothelial disruption.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>ETS transcription factors promote endothelial differentiation in a DOX-inducible iPSC line</title><p id="P6">We developed an endothelial differentiation protocol based on the widely used iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> protocol, including the addition of hypoxia, which has been shown to improve barrier functionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). To boost the endothelial identity of iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> cells, we genetically engineered the iPSC(IMR90-4) line with a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible Tet-One system to overexpress ETV2, ERG, and FLI1 (ETS) transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P7">This was achieved through a piggyBac transposase, which facilitated genomic integration of the three inducible ETS factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S1A</xref>). A clone exhibiting robust induction of all three factors was selected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S1B</xref>). Differentiation of the DOX-induced cells (hereafter referred to as ETS-iBMECs) was performed using the standard iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> protocol, with DOX-induction of ETV2, ERG, and FLI1 from day 6 to day 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), during the endothelial expansion phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). To rule out silencing of the Tet-One system over the course of differentiation, we generated a parallel DOX-inducible iPSC line expressing fluorescent reporters. Fluorescence imaging confirmed stable signal intensity throughout the differentiation timeline, validating the robustness of the DOX-induction system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S1C</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To fully assess the robustness of the ETS-driven differentiation, we characterised the endothelial identity of the DOX-induced cells (ETS-iBMECs) and benchmarked it against the non-induced control (iBMEC-<italic>like</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) using immunofluorescence, transcriptomics, barrier functional assays, and electron microscopy. Immunofluorescence assays showed a consistent loss of epithelial EPCAM over the course of DOX induction, being absent at day 11. Conversely, the expression of the endothelial marker CD31 was significantly increased at day 11 in ETS-iBMECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Furthermore, labelling of the tight junction marker ZO-1 and adherens junction protein β-Catenin revealed notable changes in cell morphology, with DOX-induced cells becoming smaller and elongated after ETS induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Moreover, the ETS-induced cells responded to TNFα endothelial activation by increasing the expression of ICAM1, a key endothelial receptor responsible for recruitment of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected RBCs and leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Similarly, the thrombin receptor PAR1, associated with severe malaria through dysregulation of EPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), displayed increased expression following DOX-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Together, these results show that the ETS-induced stable iPSC line promotes a shift towards endothelial identity, while non-induced iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> cells retain features reminiscent of epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>ETS-iBMECs present increased expression of endothelial transcripts</title><p id="P9">To dissect the transcriptional changes triggered by ETV2, ERG and FLI1 upregulation, we performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and compared the expression profiles of ETS-iBMECs with their non-induced counterpart and primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (primary brain ECs). Differential gene expression analysis confirmed the overexpression of ETV2, ERG, and FLI1, and revealed that ETS-iBMECs upregulate genes associated with endothelial identity (<italic>CDH5, PECAM1, FLT1, FLT4, TIE1</italic>), as well as genes involved in angiogenesis and vascular development (<italic>ANGPT2, TEK, ENG, APLN, ROBO4, EGFL7, SCUBE1, VASH1, RASIP1</italic>), together with the vascular tight junction transcript <italic>CLDN5</italic>. Conversely, many epithelial genes were found to be downregulated (<italic>CDH3, ELF3, EPCAM, ESRP1, GRHL2, OVOL1, OVOL2, TP63</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S2</xref>), highlighting a clear transcriptional divergence between ETS-iBMEC and iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> cells. Gene ontology (GO) over-representation analysis further supports the shift towards an improved endothelial identity, highlighting biological processes involved in angiogenesis, endothelial proliferation, blood circulation, and cell adhesion being upregulated in ETS-iBMEC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Indeed, the top five most significantly upregulated biological terms include angiogenic, circulatory, and vascular developmental processes, reflecting a strong shift toward endothelial programming after ETS induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Additional upregulated clusters included pathways involved in signal transduction and cellular homeostasis, such as G-protein coupled pathways, ion transport, and tissue homeostasis, alongside cell physiological processes related to chemotaxis and migration, cell adhesion, and synaptic organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Notably, the synaptic organisation cluster includes several genes expressed by endothelial cells, such as <italic>NRP1, NRP2, PLXND1, RELN</italic>, and <italic>NLGN2</italic>, that are key regulators of angiogenesis and neurovascular interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). DOX induction also enhanced the expression of genes involved in immune activation, highlighting the potential of ETS-iBMECs as an <italic>in vitro</italic> platform for modelling inflammatory responses, a relevant feature for infection models. Conversely, mainly non-endothelial morphogenetic processes were downregulated, including meso- and ectodermal developmental processes of epidermis, skin, glands, bones and muscle tissue as the most significant decreased processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Among these, epithelial developmental processes were found to be downregulated, together with terms associated with cell-contact organisation, extracellular organisation, cell motility, and multicellular organisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To further compare the expression profiles of the induced cell line with primary brain ECs, a widely used model for malaria studies, we analysed a curated panel of key endothelial and epithelial genes, along with markers important for modelling severe malaria pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). This analysis revealed a similar expression of these markers in ETS-iBMECs and primary brain ECs compared to iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> cells. ETS-iBMECs and primary brain ECs both exhibited similar expression levels of the endothelial marker <italic>PECAM-1</italic> (CD31) and did not express epithelial genes such as <italic>MUC1, EPCAM</italic> and <italic>SOX9</italic>. Endothelial transcription factors <italic>ERG</italic> and <italic>FLI1</italic> reached comparable levels of expression in both primary brain ECs and ETS-iBMECs. However, ETV2 was expressed at higher levels in DOX-induced cells compared to primary brain ECs, an expected phenotype due to the downregulation of ETV2 in fully differentiated endothelial cells. Analysis of junctional proteins showed that DOX-induced ETS-iBMECs partially recapitulate the expression profile of primary brain ECs. Junctional genes like <italic>CLDN5</italic> (Claudin-5), <italic>CDH5</italic> (VE-Cadherin), and <italic>JAM3</italic> showed similar expression in both ETS-iBMECs and primary brain ECs, while other important endothelial tight junctional genes like <italic>TJP1</italic> (ZO-1), and <italic>OCLN</italic> (Occludin) showed a higher expression in ETS-iBMECs, suggesting an improvement in endothelial barrier properties in DOX-induced cells. Lastly, parasite-interacting receptors such as <italic>PROCR</italic> (EPCR) and <italic>ICAM1</italic> show increased expression following DOX induction, except for <italic>CD36</italic>. Together, these transcriptional changes highlight a broad transcriptional shift in ETS-iBMECs, with an expression pattern that more closely resembles primary brain ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>ETS-iBMEC microvessels lose epithelial ultrastructural features while maintaining barrier function</title><p id="P11">To assess the microvascular properties of ETS-iBMECs, we incorporated them into a previously established 3D microfluidic device consisting of a pre-patterned type I collagen hydrogel, generated through soft lithography and injection moulding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Primary human astrocytes (HA) and brain vascular pericytes (HBVPs) were seeded at a 7:3 ratio in the collagen bulk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), while endothelial cells were seeded into the microfluidic network by gravity-driven perfusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). After a few days in culture, the endothelial cells formed perfusable microvessels with sparse contacts to the surrounding glial and perivascular cells. Both iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> cells and ETS-iBMECs formed perfusable microvessels in this setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Nevertheless, seeding required a pre-coating with fibronectin and collagen IV and was more challenging than with primary brain ECs, resulting in much lower throughput. To determine barrier function, we measured the apparent trans-endothelial permeability following perfusion with 40 kDa and 10 kDa dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Remarkably, ETS-iBMEC microvessels reached permeability values of &lt;10<sup>-8</sup> cm/s with median levels of 1.5x10<sup>-8</sup> cm/s, representing an over 100-fold barrier improvement over primary brain EC microvessels that present median permeability values of 4.3x10<sup>-6</sup> cm/s in the same setup. Furthermore, both iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> and ETS-iBMEC microvessels were largely impermeable to smaller molecular weight tracers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>-E, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S3A</xref>), with ETS-iBMECs showing slightly elevated 10 kDa dextran permeability rates (median 5.9x10<sup>-8</sup> cm/s) compared to iBMEC<italic>-like</italic> controls (median 8.8x10<sup>-9</sup> cm/s). These results demonstrate that microvessels made from iBMEC<italic>-like</italic> and ETS-iBMECs possess stronger barrier properties than those derived from primary brain ECs.</p><p id="P12">While both differentiated cell types exhibit robust barriers, their transcriptional profiles are markedly distinct. To better understand these differences, we conducted transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on thin sections of the 3D brain microvascular model. IBMEC-<italic>like</italic> cells showed greater apical-basal height, forming elongated junctions characterized by the typical architecture of epithelial junctional complexes: apical tight junctions followed by adherens junctions, prominent desmosomes, and interdigitated regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>, G). Conversely, ETS-iBMECs were flatter and had shorter junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>), containing tight junctions, and no desmosomes were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Additionally, the two cell types exhibited distinct apical surface morphologies: iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> cells displayed epithelial microvilli-like projections, which were rarely observed in ETS-iBMECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>). The ultrastructural morphology of ETS-iBMECs closely resembled that of primary brain ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S3B</xref>), further suggesting a loss of epithelial characteristics. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that ETS-iBMECs outperform primary brain ECs in barrier function, while displaying enhanced endothelial transcription and ultrastructure compared to iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> cells.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title><italic>P. falciparum</italic> presents strong binding to ETS-iBMECs under flow</title><p id="P13">Cytoadhesion of parasite-infected RBCs to endothelial EPCR and ICAM1 is a key determinant of severe and cerebral malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). To evaluate the suitability of ETS-iBMECs for malaria <italic>in vitro</italic> pathogenesis studies, we first tested their capacity to bind <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected RBCs. Fluorescently labelled <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected RBCs were perfused for 30 minutes through microfluidic flow chambers seeded with either iBMEC-<italic>like</italic>, ETS-iBMEC, or primary brain ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Unbound parasites were washed out for 10 minutes and bound parasites were quantified after fixation. The <italic>P. falciparum</italic> line ITGICAM1 is known for its dual binding to CD36 and ICAM1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4, 4B</xref>), and showed significantly higher adhesion to ETS-iBMECs compared to iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> cells, and a non-significant increase in binding relative to primary brain ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C-D</xref>). The IT4var19 parasite line, known for strong affinity to endothelial EPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4, 4B</xref>), a phenotype highly enriched in severe malaria patients, exhibited robust cytoadhesion to all three cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C-E</xref>). Notably, IT4var19 showed increased binding to ETS-iBMECs compared to iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> cells and primary brain ECs, although the difference was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Overall, the improved endothelial identity and the strong binding rates for <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected red blood cells exemplify the usefulness of ETS-iBMECs as an alternative cell model for malaria pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title><italic>P. falciparum</italic> induces transcriptional changes in ETS-iBMECs, including metabolic alterations and alternative splicing events</title><p id="P14">Next, we aimed to identify endothelial disruptive mechanisms upon exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected RBCs. Accumulation of infected RBCs in the microvasculature results in the localised release of parasite-derived products near the endothelium at the late stages (schizonts) of the blood stage cycle, an event previously characterised as highly disruptive to barrier integrity in primary endothelial cells of various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Here, we generated a solution containing parasite egress products by arresting the egress of highly synchronised late-stage <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected RBCs using the reversible protein kinase G inhibitor, compound 2 (C2), followed by the simultaneous release of parasite-derived products upon its removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). To understand the molecular mechanisms upon exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-iRBC products, we performed bulk RNA-seq after 8 and 24 hours of exposure to 5×10<sup>7</sup> egressed infected RBCs/ml. As a control, we also sequenced iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> and primary brain ECs under the same conditions. While most of the dysregulated transcripts were unique to each cell type, some commonalities were observed between all three or in pairwise comparisons, suggesting that these pathways are commonly disrupted by the malaria egress products (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S5A-B</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Shared dysregulated GO term processes included upregulation of sterol and cholesterol synthesis pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B, D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S5C</xref>). Other upregulated processes in ETS-iBMEC included circulatory regulation and synaptic organisation, with the latter including endothelial transporters important for barrier regulation (AMPAR, NMDAR, KAR, CACN) and angiogenesis-related transcripts (<italic>NTN1, SEMA3, SEMA4, SEMA7, L1CAM</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). A common downregulated process among the three cell types, with special relevance in ETS-iBMEC, was RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), along with other terms associated with RNA processes and translational regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S5C</xref>). Spliceosome transcripts showed early decreased expression after 8 hours, sustained throughout the 24-hour experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Because alterations in pre-mRNA processing can result in profound changes in the endothelial cell biology, we then focused our analysis on alternative splicing after exposure to infected RBC products. Using vast-tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), we identified 692 events (about 7%) that were differentially spliced between the two conditions (more than 15% of a particular mRNA alternatively spliced; ΔPSI ≥ 15) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>). The most common events included alternative exon splicing (37.7%) and intron retention (28.3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>). Based on data from VastDB, many of the detected events are predicted to disrupt the open reading frame (51.3%) or create alternative protein isoforms (30.7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H</xref>). Moreover, 112 events had substantial changes in splicing (ΔPSI ≥ 25). Among them were proteins responsible for autophagy (ATG16L2, RB1CC, SQSTM1), with important functions in cytoskeleton dynamics (Tropomyosin 1), and a histone deacetylase regulating inflammatory gene expression (HDAC5/7/8) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>).

Overexpression of ETV2 has been widely used to promote endothelial differentiation, including electroporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), lentiviral transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) or more recently with the generation of stable lines through piggyBac-mediated integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). Our study, to our knowledge, is the first to use a stable, transgenic iPSC line enabling inducible upregulation of three ETS-factors, thereby robustly promoting endothelial identity.

The decline in barrier function commonly observed in primary brain EC <italic>in vitro</italic> is often attributed to the loss of tight junctional features [12,27-29], supported by the reduced expression of ZO-1 (<italic>TJP1</italic>) and occludin (<italic>OCLN</italic>) transcript levels found in primary cells in our transcriptomic analysis. Conversely, ETS-iBMEC displayed increased expression of these markers and showed minimum permeability to both low and medium-molecular-weight dextran tracers in a 3D microvascular BBB model, while keeping endothelial ultrastructural morphology, including thin apical-basal height, loss of desmosomes, and lack of microvilli. Future iterations of the model to improve the differentiation toward brain-specific lineage, relevant for cerebral malaria studies, could incorporate FOXF2 and ZIC3, as the recent inducible expression of these brain-specific transcription factors via lentiviral transduction has shown enhanced brain identity and strengthening of barrier properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>).

Perfusion of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected RBC through commercial microfluidic flow chambers revealed strong binding affinity to ETS-iBMECs, supporting their relevance as an alternative model of parasite cytoadherence. The parasite lines used in this study expressed PfEMP1 variants that are highly enriched in severe and cerebral malaria patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). The dual CD36-ICAM 1 binder, ITGICAM1, showed increased binding to ETS-iBMECs compared to iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> and primary brain ECs. ETS-iBMECs expressed the highest levels of ICAM1 under resting conditions and low levels of CD36. Therefore, it is likely that the increased binding of ITGICAM1 is mediated by ICAM1, given its strong affinity to the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). The EPCR binder, IT4var19, also showed increased binding to ETS-iBMECs compared to the other two cell types. Although this phenotype cannot be explained through our transcriptomic analysis, as the expression of <italic>PROCR</italic> (EPCR) was higher in primary brain EC, post-translational modifications or differences in receptor trafficking to the surface may account for the non-significant increase in binding in ETS-iBMECs. The pronounced binding of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> to ETS-iBMECs highlights this model’s relevance for studying host–parasite interactions in severe malaria. Future studies could include additional parasite lines with a dual EPCR–ICAM1 binding phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>) or samples from patients with severe and uncomplicated malaria to gain deeper insights into disease mechanisms, as cerebral malaria isolates have shown increased affinity for primary brain endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Furthermore, future strategies to gain deeper molecular insights into host–parasite interactions could include knocking out EPCR and ICAM1 in the parental line or introducing point mutations.

Furthermore, brain vasogenic oedema is not exclusive to severe disease and has also been observed in cases of uncomplicated malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>).

Notably, this phenotype was recapitulated in ETS-iBMECs using impedance-based assays. The disruption was accompanied by a global and homogenous downregulation of almost all transcripts belonging to tight and adherens junctions, among them occludin and ZO-1, previously found decreased in histopathological labelling of cerebral malaria from paediatric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>) and adult samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). Downregulation of vinculin, a focal adhesion junctional protein, was also found in patient post-mortem samples. Although we did not observe a significant downregulation of vinculin upon ETS-iBMEC exposure to parasite products, a significant decrease in expression of almost all other structural and signalling focal adhesion proteins was found. Remarkably, such robust and global downregulation of key regulatory barrier pathways by malaria parasites or products has not been found in previous primary 2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) or in a 3D endothelial-only model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).

This may be a consequence of the greater maturation of endothelial junctions in ETS-iBMECs compared to primary ECs. Alternatively, the global and coordinated response in ETS-iBMECs could result from a more homogenous cellular identity, compared to the heterogeneity observed in primary brain ECs, which arises from their diverse anatomical origin across brain regions and vascular segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>), such as arterioles, capillaries, and venules.</p><p id="P24">Despite these differences in the response to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> between primary brain ECs and ETS-iBMECs, we also identified similarities, such as important transcripts for malaria pathogenesis that were later classified as serum biomarkers of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Furthermore, the ETS-iBMEC model reproduced alterations in angiogenic pathways important for disease, such as VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>) and the angiopoietin/tie2 axis.

Equally sized ROIs (150 μm x 150 μm) were set along the microvessel wall with an equal distribution on the vessel (150 μm x 30 μm) and hydrogel area (150 μm x 120 μm). Apparent microvascular permeability in cm/s was calculated by integrating fluorescence intensity measurements of the set regions between the two timepoints into the following equation: P = (1 / Δt) (V<sub>gel</sub> / A<sub>v</sub>) ((I<sub>gel1</sub> - I<sub>gel0</sub>) / (I<sub>v0</sub> - I<sub>gel0</sub>)), in which Δt is the time interval between t<sub>0</sub> and t<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>gel</sub> is the volume of the collagen matrix, A<sub>v</sub> the lateral vessel surface, I<sub>gel1</sub> - I<sub>gel0</sub> is the difference in measured intensities in the gel area between t<sub>1</sub> and t<sub>0</sub>, and I<sub>v0</sub> is the fluorescent intensity in the vessel at t<sub>0</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Barrier integrity assays by xCELLigence</title><p id="P33">The ETS-iBMECs were grown on collagen-fibronectin-coated 96-well PET E-plates (Agilent) during real-time cell-index measurements in the xCELLigence RTCA SP reader. Cell attachment and barrier formation was assessed for three days until the cell-index plateaued with a media change every two days. To test for dose-dependent effects on barrier integrity of the egress media, concentrations equivalent to 5, 2.5 and 1.25x10<sup>7</sup> ruptured infected RBCs were adjusted with the stock egress media in hESFM with 1% PDS and DOX. After application, the cell index was measured in 15-second intervals in parallel to a media control. All conditions were applied in triplicate, and each experiment was performed with independent ETS-iBMEC differentiations and individual parasite egress media purifications. For analysis, the cell index progression was set to 0 after sample application and sedimentation. The averaged triplicates of the cell index were normalised to the cell index of the media-only control. Area under the curve analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (version 10.0.2) for experimental times of 12 hours.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Transmission electron microscopy</title><p id="P34">The 3D microvessels were fixed with 2% PFA and 2.5% GA in endothelial media by perfusion for 30 minutes, followed by two media washes.

These areas were processed with a secondary fixative (2% PFA, 2.5% GA, 0.25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5% sucrose in 0.1% sodium cacodylate in water) over night at 4°C and post-fixed in a reduced osmium solution (1% OsO<sub>4</sub>, 1,5% K3F3(III)(CN)6 in 0.065M sodium cacodylate buffer) six times. Post fixation, the hydrogels were incubated for two hours in OsO<sub>4</sub> at 4°C and washed with water six times. The samples were dehydrated in steps of 30, 50, 80, and thrice with 100% ethanol in a PELCO Biowave Pro microwave processor (Ted Pella, Inc.) containing a SteadyTemp Pro and a ColdSpot set to 4°C, with 40 seconds at 250 W each. Infiltration was performed in serial steps of 25, 50, 75, 90, and twice with 100% EPON 812 hard epoxy resin in acetone, assisted by the microwave (3 minutes each at 150 W under vacuum) and a final infiltration step in 100% EPON 812 hard epoxy resin overnight at room temperature. In the embedding mould, samples were positioned with the microvessel luminal axis at a 90° angle to the cutting surface to cut transversal sections of the vessel, and then polymerised at 60°C for 48 hours. Microvessel pieces for imaging were randomly selected, and thin sections (70 nm) were retrieved on an ultramicrotome (UC7, Leica Microsystems), collected on formvar-coated slot grids and post-stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Tile montages (12,000x) were acquired on a JEOL JEM 2100 plus at 80 or 120 keV using SerialEM.

Briefly, parasites are synchronized with 5% sorbitol and the RNA of ring stage parasites (0-22 h) post-invasion is extracted with Tryzol LS and an RNAeasy kit, and reverse transcribed with TaqManTM Reverse Transcription Reagents (Applied Biosystems, N8080234).

After 5 hours, simultaneous schizont rupture was induced by resuspending parasites in endothelial media without compound 2 at a concentration of 10<sup>8</sup> schizonts/mL overnight at 30 rpm on a shaker. The total rupture efficiency was assessed by a hemocytometer count, and Giemsa blood smear and supernatants were recovered after spinning at 1000 rpm and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. For experimental use, the concentration of rupture released factors was adjusted to the equivalent of 5, 2.5 and 1.25x10<sup>7</sup> ruptured schizonts/mL, which represents the physiological simultaneous release during approx. 1% parasitemia within one asexual blood cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Bulk RNA-sequencing and analysis</title><p id="P37">For transcriptional analysis, bulk RNA sequencing data were generated from primary brain EC, iBMEC-<italic>like</italic> cells, and ETS-iBMEC.

The experimental design included exposure durations of 8 and 24 hours to examine transcriptional responses over time. Samples were fixed with RLT buffer, and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAgen), including DNAse treatment. Quality and RNA concentration were assessed by TapeStation (Agilent). Individually barcoded stranded mRNA-seq libraries were prepared from high-quality total RNA samples (~100 ng/sample) using the New England Biolabs NEBNext RNA Ultra II Kit combined with the polyA-enrichment module in 12 PCR cycles on a liquid handling robot (Beckman i7).
