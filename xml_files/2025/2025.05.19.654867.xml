However, they have also been shown to drive inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). γδ T cells are potent and rapid producers of inflammatory cytokines, being activated in either a T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent, or independent manner. Like conventional αβ T cells, γδ T cells rearrange their TCR genes in the thymus however, γδ TCRs are less variable than αβ TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) and lack MHC restriction. Instead, γδ TCRs recognise a range of ligands including stress-induced MHC-like molecules, phosphorylated metabolites and lipid antigens presented by CD1 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P6">γδ T cells can be classified into subtypes based on their effector capabilities, being either IFNγ or IL-17A-producers, with effector phenotypes conferred by the lineage-defining transcription factors, T-bet or RORγt respectively. Concomitantly with expressing rearranged γδ TCR chains, γδ T cells also acquire their effector fate, with murine Vγ1 and Vγ5 cells (Tonegawa nomenclature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>)) mainly gaining IFNγ-producing potential, and Vγ4 and Vγ6 T cells largely gaining IL-17A-producing potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). The Vγ TCR chain expressed is not the determining factor in effector fate acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), but Vγ gene order on the TCRγ locus is important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The development of γδ T cells occurs in ordered waves comprising different subsets, beginning at embryonic day 15 of gestation with the appearance of Vγ5 (Dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC)) which home to the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). This is followed by the development of Vγ6 cells which home to dermis, uterus and the peritoneal cavity. Vγ4 cells develop shortly after, and home to lung, dermis and lymph node (LN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), then perinatally, Vγ7 (intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IEL)) develop and home to the intestine. Perinatal progenitors are required for generating IL-17-producing γδ (γδ17) T cells in the absence of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), however, γδ17 T cells can be generated <italic>de novo</italic> from adult bone marrow-derived precursors in response to inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) and Vγ4 and Vγ1 T cells continue to develop later in life but are ‘adaptive γδ T cells’ retaining the ability to adopt multiple effector fates in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Factors governing the sequential development of γδ T cell subsets are not completely understood, but both TCR and environmental signals are important.</p><p id="P8">TCR signal strength plays a crucial role in γδ T cell development. CD4<sup>-</sup> CD8<sup>-</sup> double negative (DN) cells receiving strong TCR signals commit to the γδ lineage and strong TCR signalling is key for IFNγ-producing γδ T cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). However, weaker TCR signals are required for γδ17 T cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), where distinct TCR-signalling pathways are engaged, specifying γδ17 T cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Negative regulators of TCR signalling such as the Src family kinase Blk, aid the development of γδ17 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), as does the transcription factor cMaf which drives expression of the lineage defining transcription factor, <italic>Rorc</italic>. TCR signal strength regulates cMaf levels, with strong TCR signals reducing cMaf, and weaker TCR signals increasing cMaf levels and thus driving <italic>Rorc</italic> and reinforcing γδ17 T cell effector fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Cytokines also regulate γδ T cell development with IL-7Rα required for V-J γδTCR recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). IL-7 signalling particularly impacts γδ17 T cells, as high levels of IL-7/IL-7Rα signalling favour IL-17 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) and IL-7Rα is required for the homeostasis of γδ17 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Lymphotoxin (LT) signalling is key for the development of both IFNγ-producing and γδ17 T cells, where LTβR drives the NF-κB family member, RelB, which in turn maintains <italic>Rorc</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). TGFβ also drives γδ T cell IL-17 production in early life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), although the mechanism is not yet understood.</p><p id="P10">Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) and cortical TECs (cTECs) are crucial for conventional αβ T cell development, supporting positive and negative selection and providing Notch signals and IL-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). However, less is known about their role in supporting γδ T cell development. cTECs promote Vγ4 T cell activity but are not required for Vγ6 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Conversely, mTECs are important for Vγ5 DETC development, as they provide signals via the butyrophilin-related protein, Skint-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Thymic dendritic cells (DCs) also contribute to conventional αβ T cell development, but a role in γδ T cell development has not been defined. Despite advances in our understanding of how γδT cell development is regulated, factors involved in this process remain incompletely understood.</p><p id="P11">CD200R1 is a cell surface receptor expressed on many immune cell types, inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production and mast cell degranulation in myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). However, CD200R1 is required for efficient IL-17 production by innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), and CD200R1 promotes inflammation in a psoriasis model and controls cutaneous fungal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), demonstrating that CD200R1 has diverse functions in different cell types, including promoting IL-17 production.</p><p id="P12">Given that γδ T cells are crucial for producing IL-17 in skin and drive psoriasis-like and anti-fungal immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), the role of CD200R1 in regulating γδ T cell IL-17 production was investigated. We show that CD200R1-deficient mice have impaired IL-17 production by γδ T cells, due to a specific reduction in γδ17 T cells, with IFNγ-producing cells not affected. The reduction in γδ17 T cells is due to defects in development, with CD200R1 likely required on either the developing γδ T cells themselves, or on thymic dendritic cells. Therefore, here we identify for the first time CD200R1 as a key factor required for the development of γδ17 T cells, shaping immunity at barrier sites, but also potentially contributing to the inflammatory skin disease psoriasis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mice</title><p id="P13">All animal experiments were locally ethically approved and performed in accordance with the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

Given the importance of γδ T cells for IL-17A production in these models, we measured IL-17A production by <italic>ex vivo</italic> CD200R1-deficient cutaneous γδ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), demonstrating that CD200R1 is required for efficient IL-17A production by dermal γδ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). CD200R1 suppresses cytokine production in myeloid cells, therefore we hypothesized that in the CD200R1-deficient cultures there may be an overactive cell type present which inhibits γδ T cell IL-17 production. To test this, CD200R1-deficient dorsal skin cells were fluorescently labelled and co-cultured with unlabelled WT cells before stimulation. CD200R1-deficient γδ T cells, retained an impairment in IL-17A production when co-cultured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), demonstrating that CD200R1-deficient cultures do not contain factors that inhibit IL-17 production by γδ T cells. Therefore, γδ T cells are impaired in IL-17A production when isolated from CD200R1-deficient skin.</p><p id="P26">To determine if CD200R1 affects γδ T cell cytokine production in a tissue specific, or γδ T cell subset-specific manner, cells from spleen, lymph node (LN) and thymus were stimulated with PMA and Ionomycin and IL-17A and IFNγ production by γδ T cells was measured by flow cytometry.

To identify the effect of CD200R1 on T cell populations, conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> αβ T cells and γδ T cells were examined in skin and lymphoid organs, showing there are not overall differences in conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> αβ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) or γδ T cells in thymus or spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, the overall γδ T cell population is reduced in lymph node (LN) and dermis in CD200R1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that CD200R1 is required for optimal γδ T cell numbers in these organs.</p><p id="P28">γδ T cells take on their effector fate during development in the thymus, when they also rearrange their TCR loci and express specific Vγ and δ TCR chains. In skin, the major IL-17A-producing subset expresses Vγ4. Indeed, in LN and dermis there is a reduction in the proportion and number of Vγ4<sup>+</sup> cells in CD200R1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-G</xref>), demonstrating that CD200R1 supports this population. As well as this population being reduced in CD200R1-deficient skin and LN, the Vγ4 T cells remaining have a reduced ability to produce IL-17A in the absence of CD200R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>), revealing that CD200R1 promotes IL-17 production, and is required for optimal numbers of γδT17 cells.</p><p id="P29">Previously, only low levels of CD200R1 expression were observed in dermal γδ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), but specific subsets were not examined. To determine if CD200R1 expression is specific to Vγ4<sup>+</sup> cells, flow cytometric staining for CD200R1 was carried out, revealing that both cutaneous Vγ4<sup>+</sup> and Vγ1<sup>+</sup> T cells express exceptionally low levels of CD200R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>). This suggests that CD200R1 does not directly affect the activity or maintenance of Vγ4<sup>+</sup> T cells once they are mature, but instead points towards either indirect effects via another cell type, and/or effects earlier during the development of these cells. The previous <italic>in vitro</italic> co-culture experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) show that there is not a cell type in CD200R1-deficient cultures that inhibits γδT17 activity, suggesting that CD200R1 affects γδT17 cells prior to their activation, perhaps during their development.</p><p id="P30">Although the proportion of Vγ4<sup>+</sup> T cells was not changed in the thymus and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), γδ T cells are less able to produce IL-17A in CD200R1-deficient thymus, spleen and LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that CD200R1 may indeed have a developmental impact. Therefore, γδ T cell subsets were examined in thymus, spleen, LN and dermis based on CD44<sup>hi</sup> and CD27<sup>+</sup> expression, corresponding largely to IL-17A and IFNγ-producers respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). In all these tissues, the proportion of CD44<sup>hi</sup> γδ T cells is reduced in CD200R1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>), demonstrating that γδT17 cell populations are reduced in the thymus and spleen, despite the Vγ4 T cell subset not being reduced in number.

Therefore, together with the evidence of a reduced CD44<sup>hi</sup> γδ T cell population in thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>), it seems likely that there is reduced production of Vγ4<sup>+</sup> T cells in CD200R1-deficient mice.</p><p id="P32">γδ T cells develop in the thymus where they take on their effector fate, before migrating to the periphery.

It has previously been shown that γδ T cells in the thymus can be gated into 3 distinct pathways of development, based on the cells’ ability to generate IFNγ-producing γδ T cells (populations D and E), TCR-naïve adaptive γδ T cells (populations B and C), and γδNKT and resident γδT17 cells (populations D, F and G) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Gating γδ TCR-expressing thymocytes in this manner showed no significant effect of CD200R1 on adult mouse thymic γδ T cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). CD73 is an adenosine receptor which is induced in TCR γδ<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>-</sup> CD8<sup>-</sup> double negative (DN) cells in response to TCR engagement and marks cells committing to the γδ T cell lineage in adult thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). CD200R1-deficient adult thymus has a lower proportion of cells expressing CD73 in each DN subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), and a reduced overall proportion and number of CD73<sup>+</sup> cells in thymic DN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>), demonstrating a reduction in T cells committing to the γδ T cell lineage in the absence of CD200R1.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>CD200R1 promotes neonatal and foetal γδT17 cell development</title><p id="P33">Although γδ T cells can develop in adult mice, the most significant generation of these cells, certainly in the absence of inflammation, occurs early in life. Therefore, the impact of CD200R1-deficiency on developing γδ T cell populations in neonates was examined, demonstrating that the numbers of cells in each developing population A-G were not affected by CD200R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F-G</xref>). In addition to marking cells committing to the γδ T cell lineage in adult thymus, in neonatal thymus, CD73 is expressed at a higher level on cells committing to the IFNγ-producing, than the IL-17-producing γδ T cell lineage, reflecting stronger TCR γδ signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Examining CD73 expression in neonatal thymic γδ T cells showed an increase in CD73 expression level in CD200R1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>), demonstrating an increased proportion of γδ T cells belonging to the IFNγ-producing subset relative to the IL-17-producing subset.</p><p id="P34">Vγ4<sup>+</sup> T cells specifically are reduced in adult CD200R1-deficient skin and LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D-G</xref>). These cells develop in a wave during foetal development and seed the skin to become a resident population. Therefore, the impact of CD200R1 on foetal γδ T cell development was examined using foetal thymic organ cultures (FTOC) (gating shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Total numbers of γδ T cells were not affected by CD200R1 deficiency, but the overall number of IL-17-producing γδ T cells was reduced in the absence of CD200R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, both the proportion and numbers of RORγt-expressing γδ T cells was reduced in CD200R1-deficient FTOC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) showing that CD200R1 is required for the development of γδT17 cells.</p><p id="P35">To determine the stage of γδT17 development affected by CD200R1, cells were gated based on CD24 expression and the progenitor CD24<sup>+</sup> populations were examined, showing distinct populations based on CD44 and CD45RB expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). In CD200R1-deficient FTOC, the CD44<sup>hi</sup> population is reduced, with a proportional increase in the CD44<sup>low</sup> population which is not due to changes in the number of these cells but is due to decreases in CD44<sup>hi</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The number and proportion of CD24<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells expressing RORγt and the numbers producing IL-17 are reduced in the absence of CD200R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), again demonstrating a requirement for CD200R1 to support the development of γδT17 cells, particularly at this early stage of development.</p><p id="P36">The CD24<sup>-</sup> γδ T cell population contains more mature developing cells, and again, the absence of CD200R1 reduced the number of IL-17 producing cells in this population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). These cells can be split into four populations, with population A having the potential to produce both IL-17 and IFNγ, populations B and C only containing IFNγ producers, and population D containing mainly IL-17 producers. The absence of CD200R1 led to a minor skewing towards increased population A cells and away from population C and D cells, but no other differences were observed within the individual cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Overall, these data demonstrate a requirement for CD200R1 for efficient acquisition of effector function (RORγt-expression and IL-17-production) in γδT17 cells, which is observed in the early stages of development.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Effects of CD200R1 on γδT17 cell development are likely either via direct effects on γδ T cells, or via indirect effects on thymic dendritic cells</title><p id="P37">To ascertain how mechanistically CD200R1 affects γδT17 cell acquisition of effector function, the expression of CD200R1 on different developing thymic γδ T cell populations was assessed. In adult thymus, where CD200R1-deficiency reduces the number of cells committing to the γδ T cell lineage, CD200R1 levels were negligible on the earliest developing γδ T cells (population A), and cells on the developmental pathway to generate adaptive γδ T cells (populations B and C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Significant CD200R1 levels were observed on populations D and E on the pathway to generate IFNγ-producing γδ T cells. CD200R1 levels are also significant on cells early in the pathway to become IFNγ and IL-4 producing γδNKT and long lived resident γδ17 T cells (populations D and F), but only a small proportion of cells later in the pathway (population G) express CD200R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Whilst it is interesting that CD200R1 levels vary in different developing γδ T cell populations, the expression pattern observed does not explain why CD200R1 affects the IL-17-producing, but not the IFNγ-producing population, as CD200R1 is expressed in cells developing along both pathways. In mature dermal γδ T cells, the level of CD200R1 expressed was found to be dependent on age, with newborns expressing high levels of CD200R1 on γδ T cells, which rapidly declines to very low levels of CD200R1 expression by adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Therefore, CD200R1 expression was examined in developing neonatal thymic γδ T cells, demonstrating similar patterns of expression to that seen in adults, with undetectable CD200R1 expression on the earliest developing γδ T cells (population A), and cells on the developmental pathway to generate adaptive γδ T cells (populations B and C). A significant proportion of cells in populations D and E, on the pathway to become IFNγ−producing γδ T cells express CD200R1, and CD200R1 is expressed on a proportion of cells in populations D and G which are the early and late stages of the pathway to generate IFNγ and IL-4 producing γδNKT and long lived resident γδ17 T cells, but population F in neonates does not appear to express significant levels of CD200R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P38">CD200R1 expression on developing γδ T cells in FTOCs was also examined, showing that of the less mature CD24<sup>+</sup> populations, the CD44<sup>hi</sup> cells have particularly high CD200R1 expression, followed by the CD45RB<sup>hi</sup> subset, whereas the CD44<sup>low</sup> subset has only low levels of CD200R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>) and expression was not significantly changed by activating the cells with PMA and Ionomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Therefore, CD200R1 may directly affect the acquisition of effector function at this CD24<sup>+</sup> CD44<sup>hi</sup> stage of γδ T cell development. Examination of the CD24<sup>neg</sup> population showed negligible expression of CD200R1 on population A cells (IL-17 and IFNγ producers) and very low expression on population D (IL-17 producers). Higher levels of CD200R1 expression were observed on populations B and C (IFNγ producers) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Therefore, CD200R1 is not expressed highly on CD24<sup>neg</sup> γδ T cell subtypes which produce IL-17, but it is expressed on some IFNγ producing subsets. Interestingly, the expression of CD200R1 was upregulated on population D (IL-17 producers) cells in response to PMA and Ionomycin stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting that CD200R1 may be upregulated in response to activation, and thus may contribute to the development of these cells during an activation stage in thymus.</p><p id="P39">To determine if CD200R1 could mediate its effects on γδ17 T cell development indirectly via stromal cells, CD200R1 expression on thymic epithelial cells (TECs) and dendritic cells was examined by flow cytometry. CD200R1 is expressed in a proportion of cTECs in neonatal thymus and FTOCs but was not detected in adult thymus cTECs or mTECs from any life stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Therefore, CD200R1 is unlikely to be affecting γδ T cell development via effects on TECs in adults, and in early life CD200R1 could directly affect cTEC, but not mTEC activity. In DCs CD200R1 is expressed by both the CD11b+ and CD11c+ thymic DCs in adult and neonatal thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>) and is expressed highly by MHC-II+ CD11c+ DCs in FTOC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). CD200R1 has no effect on dendritic cell or TEC numbers in adult thymus, but CD200R1 deficiency increased neonatal thymic DC numbers and decreased cTECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>) which may impact γδ T cell development. Therefore, CD200R1 promotes γδT17 development either via cell extrinsic mechanisms, likely involving thymic dendritic cells, cTECs or IFNγ-producing γδ T cell subsets (populations with high CD200R1 expression), or CD200R1 promotes γδT17 development in a cell intrinsic manner, likely whilst cells are expressing CD24, or during/after activation signalling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P40">γδ T cells are critical immune cells, being able to rapidly respond in both innate and adaptive manners, producing large amounts of IFNγ or IL-17. Here we show that mice deficient for CD200R1 have fewer IL-17-producing γδ T cells due to a requirement for CD200R1 for efficient development of γδ17 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B,D</xref>). This is not due to a complete block in the development of γδ17 T cells but is due to a deficiency in the effective acquisition of effector function in CD200R1-deficient mice. This is seen in spleen and thymus where the population of Vγ4<sup>+</sup> cells is not reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), but where the CD44<sup>hi</sup> γδ T cell population is reduced in the absence of CD200R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>). This suggests that TCR rearrangement has occurred effectively, but the cells have not been able to take on their effector phenotype, involving upregulation of CD44 and RORγt, and ability to produce IL-17. This is also demonstrated in FTOC where the major differences were in RORγt<sup>+</sup> and IL-17-producing cells, with numbers of the main CD24<sup>neg</sup> γδ T cell population (A-D) not significantly affected by CD200R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P41">An interesting increase in CD200R1 expression was observed on activation of population D (CD24<sup>-</sup> CD44<sup>hi</sup>) γδ T cells in FTOC. The relevance of this upregulation is not known, but activation of mature adult γδ T cells did not result in up-regulation of CD200R1 (data not shown), suggesting that this may be developmental-stage, and population specific, and therefore may be important. However, it remains unknown if there are endogenous activation signals <italic>in vivo</italic> during development which would also be capable of inducing this peak in CD200R1 expression.</p><p id="P42">The mechanism by which CD200R1 promotes γδ17 T cell development it likely to be via a cell intrinsic mechanism, perhaps via suppression of TCR signalling, or via effects on other signalling pathways. CD200R1 is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is an ‘immune checkpoint’ pathway being therapeutically blocked in cancer to promote immune responses and allow the immune system to target the tumour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). However, the evidence for CD200R1 specifically affecting T cells or TCR signalling is weak. Cytotoxic T cell function is inhibited by CD200R1 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), and blocking CD200R1 signalling promotes TCR-driven CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation in Lupus patients, but there was no effect on healthy T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Therefore, a direct effect of CD200R1 on T cell activation or TCR signalling may be likely but remains to be proven.</p><p id="P43">CD200R1 may alternatively affect γδ17 T cell development via indirect effects involving other cell types. This would likely be via thymic dendritic cells which have the highest expression levels of CD200R1 however, a clear role for these cells in γδ T cell development is yet to be defined. Alternatively, CD200R1 may affect γδ T cell development via effects on cTECs which also express CD200R1, at least in early life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). cTECs are crucial for Vγ4 T cell activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) and support αβ T cell development by providing Notch signals and IL-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), which could also be important for supporting γδ17 T cell development. Notably, cTEC numbers are reduced in the absence of CD200R1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>), supporting this as a possible mechanism.</p><p id="P44">Together this demonstrates an important role for CD200R1 in driving early life γδ17 T cell acquisition of effector function specifically, without affecting the development of IFNγ-producing subsets. The precise mechanism by which CD200R1 drives γδ17 T cell development, and what regulates CD200R1 expression remains to be identified and it will also be important to determine if CD200R1 plays a similar role in human γδ17 T cell development however, this research is technically difficult to undertake. Understanding the development of γδ17 T cells and their acquisition of effector function is important as these cells have crucial functions in immune responses, tumour surveillance and wound healing, but they also contribute to inflammatory disease. Therefore, a better understanding the factors involved in the development and function of these important cells has the potential to improve multiple areas of health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS205845-supplement-Supplementary_Material.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d124aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by a pre-competitive, open innovation award to the Manchester Collaborative Centre for Inflammation Research, at the University of Manchester, AstraZeneca and GSK, and a Wellcome Trust and Royal Society, Sir Henry Dale Fellowship to AS (109375/Z/15/Z).
