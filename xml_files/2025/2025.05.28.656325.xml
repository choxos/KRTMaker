Here, we explore how DNA segregation and division are mechanistically coupled in archaeal relatives of eukaryotes, which lack CDK/Cyclins. Using live cell imaging we first describe the series of sequential changes in DNA organisation that accompany cell division in <italic>Sulfolobus</italic>, which computational modelling shows likely aid genome segregation. Through a perturbation analysis we identify a regulatory checkpoint which ensures that the compaction of the genome into two spatially segregated nucleoids only occurs once cells have assembly a division ring - which also defines the axis of DNA segregation. Finally, we show that DNA compaction and segregation depends, in part, on a ParA homologue, SegA, and its partner SegB, whose absence leads to bridging DNA. Taken together, these data show how regulatory checkpoints like those operating in eukaryotes aid high-fidelity division in an archaeon.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The regulation of the eukaryotic cell division cycle is now relatively well understood in a variety of model systems, from yeast to humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In eukaryotes, orderly cell cycle progression relies on waves of transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, proteasome-mediated protein degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, and oscillations in CDK-cyclin-dependent protein phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. These controls are aided by cell cycle checkpoints, which ensure that critical events in the cell cycle are completed before the initiation of subsequent steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. One of the best studied examples of this is the spindle assembly checkpoint, which ensures that spindle-dependent DNA separation and cytokinesis are not triggered until the system is in a state of readiness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In addition, to ensure that each nascent daughter cell inherits a complete copy of the parental cell’s genome, DNA segregation and cytokinesis must be spatially coordinated so that the division plane bisects the center of the spindle. In different eukaryotes this coordination is achieved in distinct ways. In animal cells, for example, which undergo a relatively open mitosis, a signal emanating from overlapping microtubules at the center of the anaphase spindle triggers the assembly and contraction of an overlying actomyosin-based cytokinetic ring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Later, the midbody positions the ESCRT-III machinery to bring about abscission at a site adjacent to the center of the division bridge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Conversely, in budding yeast cells, which undergo a closed mitosis, in addition to the operation of a spindle checkpoint which ensures high fidelity DNA segregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, DNA segregation and cell division are coordinated by a checkpoint that monitors spindle position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Outside of eukaryotes, there is little evidence to support the operation of similar cycle checkpoints. While it is often assumed that this reflects the lack of clear temporal separation between DNA replication, DNA segregation and cell division in prokaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, including in some archaea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, many of the closest archaeal relatives of eukaryotes, including <italic>Sulfolobus acidocaldarius</italic>, possess an orderly cell division cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. This involves waves of transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and proteasome dependent protein degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Furthermore, despite lacking close homologues of CDK-Cyclins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> cells use eukaryotic-like Cdc6/Orc1 proteins to fire multiple origins of DNA replication once per cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and, like human cells, employ composite ESCRT-III polymers to trigger abscission at the end of each cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. This suggests the possibility that there may be deeply conserved mechanisms of cell cycle control that have yet to be revealed.</p><p id="P3">At the same time, some of the machinery <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> cells use to control critical events in their cell cycle are profoundly different from those operating in eukaryotes. For example, <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> cells use an archaeal specific protein CdvA rather than ESCRT-I and II complexes to nucleate ESCRT-III polymer formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. In addition, while <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> cells possess a Rad50-like SMC protein, called Coalescin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, they appear to lack functional homologues of the SMC proteins Cohesin and Condensin that help drive DNA individualization in bacteria and eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. In addition, they lack homologues of tubulin, while possessing a ParA-like protein SegA, which based on <italic>in vitro</italic> work has been proposed to work together with a DNA binding-partner protein, SegB, to drive genome segregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Since it is not known how archaea coordinate DNA segregation and cell division, in this paper we use <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> as an experimentally tractable model system to explore how these different processes function together to ensure that each daughter cell inherits a full copy of the genome at the end of each cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. This work reveals a complex choreographed set of changes in genome organisation that accompany division. In addition, it identifies a regulatory decision point in the <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> cell cycle that, like the spindle assembly checkpoint in eukaryotes, acts to ensure that cells do not commit to cell division until everything is in place - implying the existence of more general rules that aid cell division across the tree of life.</p><sec id="S2"><title>DNA segregation and cell division are temporally coordinated</title><p id="P5">To investigate the spatial and temporal coordination of DNA segregation and cell division in <italic>Sulfolobus</italic>, we began by using live imaging to follow wildtype cells (DSM 639) as they progressed through the cell cycle. Cell Mask Deep Red Plasma Membrane Stain and SYBR Safe were used to label the cell membrane and DNA respectively, and cells were imaged in 15 second intervals at 75°C using our upgraded Sulfoscope set up<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. This revealed a dynamic series of changes in DNA localisation, compaction and segregation that accompany the progression of cells from G2 into division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P6">For most of the cell cycle, the DNA appeared stably localized to a discrete site close to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S1</xref>). However, as cells progress towards division, the DNA dissociated from the membrane - becoming diffuse and mobile in the process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary movies 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">2</xref>). After a variable length of time (average 18 ± 8.5 std, mins) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S2A</xref>), this “mobile phase” ended when the DNA compacted to form two spatially separate foci. This process of nucleoid individualization was rapid, often occurring within the 15 second interval separating consecutive frames of the movie (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary movies 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">2</xref>). Once compacted, the two nucleoids remained relatively stationary. Later, during cytokinesis, they re-associated with the membrane at opposing poles of the dumbbell-shaped doublet.</p><p id="P7">To visualize these dynamic changes in DNA organization in another way, we overlayed the DNA and membrane signals taken from the same cells at different times points in different colours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). Again, the DNA appeared largely stationary in G2 cells (white), highly mobile in cells preparing for division (multi-coloured), before becoming rapidly compacted to form two spatially separate stable DNA foci (white). As a more quantitative measure of DNA dynamics in cells progressing from G2 into division, we also used an image analysis pipeline (see methods) to calculate the difference in the DNA signal at each pixel over time in the subset of dividing cells that remained stationary throughout the process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). Consistent with the observations described above, a significant peak in DNA motion was visible in these plots prior to the onset of DNA compaction and individualization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>), with little movement thereafter.</p><p id="P8">Importantly, the live imaging data also revealed a striking temporal correlation between the compaction of DNA into two spatially segregated nucleoids and the onset of cell division. In almost all cases, DNA segregation was complete before cytokinesis; occurring an average of 5.5 mins before the first visible cell constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). This implies strict temporal coordination between the two processes. Furthermore, DNA compaction and cell division were also coordinated in space, since the axis of DNA segregation was consistently oriented at 90° (±10.3°) with respect to the cytokinetic furrow (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S2</xref>). Finally, cytokinesis itself tended to be fast (~6.6± 2.5 mins) – and was considerably less variable in duration than the mobile phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S2A</xref>). Taken together, these data reveal that cell division in <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> is accompanied by a complex choreographed series of changes in DNA organization. In addition, they reveal a strong correlation between the axis along which the DNA is separated and compacted, and the placement of the cytokinetic furrow, implying the strict coordination of DNA segregation and division in both space and time.</p><p id="P9">As a way of assessing the likely function of the changes in DNA organization observed via live cell imaging, we developed a computational model of the process in which two circular DNA molecules (modelled as bead-spring polymers) were confined inside a vesicle, bounded by a thin membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>). To begin, we used this model to analyse the role of the mobile phase in DNA segregation. Earlier theoretical studies of bacterial DNA segregation had suggested that the weak entropic repulsion between overlapping chromosomes would be sufficient to lead to their segregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. However, this work also highlighted the importance of an elongated cell shape for efficient entropic segregation, implying that little to no segregation would occur via this mechanism in spherical cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">To take a fresh look at this problem and investigate whether entropic forces can lead to significant segregation in spherical cells, like those of <italic>Sulfolobus</italic>, we initiated simulations with DNA in a compact state (representing volume fractions of either 5, 10 or 20%). We then let the DNA relax and undergo Brownian motion, while allowing chromosome strands to cross in order to model the function of Topoisomerase-II. To assess the success of nucleoid segregation in simulations, we employed two different metrics, both of which tended to give similar results. The first, which we term “segregation efficiency”, was obtained using a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). This quantity is equal to 0 for a perfectly mixed configuration and 1 for a perfectly segregated one. The second measure defines the distance between the centers of mass (CoM) of the two chromosomes, normalized by the vesicle radius. By analysing simulations in this way, we were able to show that entropic forces are sufficient to drive the partial segregation of chromosomes in a spherical vesicle, in a manner that is improved by lowering the DNA volume fraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S3</xref>). When acting alone, however, these entropic forces were not sufficient to induce full DNA segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>), since they are unable to maintain the disentangled state.</p><p id="P11">To explore whether rapid compaction of DNA observed by live imaging might facilitate DNA segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>), we modelled this process by introducing a weak nonspecific attraction between all polymer beads, which was inhibited in a plane at the boundary of the two nucleoids to ensure alignment of the division machinery with the axis of DNA compaction (see below). After a period of entropic separation sufficient to reach equilibrium, we then compared the impact of slow or fast DNA compaction on DNA segregation relative to a no compaction control. While fast compaction of the DNA was not sufficient to induce complete DNA segregation, it significantly improved the quantitative outcome of simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S3</xref>). Moreover, by combining an extended period of the mobile phase with fast compaction with the reassociation of the DNA with the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S3</xref>), we were able to achieve an ~60% segregation efficiency. These data imply that the different phases of choreographed DNA movement (DNA mobility, rapid DNA compaction, and the reassociation of DNA with the membrane that brings the cycle to a close) likely contribute to DNA segregation in <italic>Sulfolobus</italic>, while also making it clear that other mechanisms not included in this simple coarse-grained model are likely required to ensure that DNA segregation is robust and goes to completion.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>The ESCRT-III ring couples DNA segregation to cell division</title><p id="P12">Having explored how DNA dynamics likely contributes to DNA segregation, we next sought to determine how DNA segregation, division ring assembly, and cytokinesis are coordinated. This requires aligning the axis of DNA segregation with the plane of cytokinesis. We considered two alternative hypotheses by which this might occur: i) the machinery driving DNA segregation defines the site of the future division plane (as the spindle does in human cells), or ii) the cytokinetic machinery sets the division plane to ensure the coordination of DNA segregation and cytokinesis. To ascertain which of these hypotheses best reflects the picture in dividing <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> cells, it was necessary to determine the relative timing of different steps in the process of division ring assembly with respect to the observed changes in DNA organization using immunofluorescence.</p><p id="P13">To begin this analysis, we extended our previous description of the steps in the pathway of ESCRT-III ring assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> by determining the timing of CdvA expression and ring formation. Cells were fixed at 10–20-minute intervals following release from a G2 arrest, stained for CdvA and CdvB, and analysed by flow cytometry. By gating cells with a 2N DNA content, the levels of CdvA could be compared with those of CdvB as cells progressed towards division. By this measure, levels of CdvA were found to rise 10-20 minutes before levels of CdvB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S4A-B</xref>). Furthermore, using confocal microscopy, ring-like CdvA structures were seen forming at mid cell prior to formation of CdvB, B1 and B2 rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S4C</xref>). These data support the previously proposed idea that CdvA acts as a template for the recruitment of CdvB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">Next, to investigate the timing of DNA segregation in cells relative to ESCRT-III ring recruitment, we stained both asynchronous and synchronized populations of <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> cells with combinations of CdvA, CdvB, CdvB1 and CdvB2 antibodies to visualise the various stages of division. In cells with CdvA-only rings, this microscopy-based analysis revealed that the DNA formed a single diffuse mass, with only 3% of cells displaying two individualised DNA foci. In the rare cells with a composite CdvA/CdvB ring, the proportion of cells with two DNA foci rose significantly to 30%. This increased further to 68% with the recruitment of ESCRT-III homologs CdvB1 and CdvB2. Following CdvA removal, the proportion of cells with two spatial separate DNA masses reached 83%. Finally, 98% of constricting wildtype cells were found to possess two individualized DNA foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S4D</xref>). These data reveal a tight temporal coupling of DNA segregation and cytokinesis. In addition, the data suggest that, in addition to its role as a template for the recruitment of the ESCRT-III division machinery, CdvA may also serve as a spatial marker that helps to define the plane of DNA separation.</p><p id="P15">Since DNA segregation follows the recruitment of CdvB to the CdvA ring, we considered several possible modes of regulation. First, the process might be triggered by some unknown target of the pre-division wave of gene expression, with some delay relative to CdvA. Alternatively, the cue for DNA segregation might depend on assembly of the CdvA ring or on formation of the ESCRT-III division ring itself. To distinguish between these different possibilities, we asked whether the premature accumulation of CdvA protein was sufficient to induce DNA segregation. To do so, we overexpressed full-length CdvA tagged with HA from an inducible arabinose promoter in G2 arrested cells. Upon release from the arrest, cells were fixed and stained at 20-minute intervals as they exited G2 and entered division. Strikingly, under these conditions, ectopically expressed CdvA was able to form linear, ring-like structures a full 80 minutes before the rise of endogenous CdvA expression in the MW001-empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S4E</xref>). The presence of CdvA ring-like structures, however, was not sufficient to induce DNA segregation. Instead, significant DNA segregation was only observed 100 minutes post-release, coincident with the recruitment of CdvB to the CdvA ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Next, to determine whether DNA segregation can occur in cells that are unable to complete ring assembly, we ectopically expressed a truncated version of CdvA (hereafter named CdvA<sup>Δ</sup><sub>E3B</sub>) that lacks the CdvB-binding E3B domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S5A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>.</sup> This was sufficient to prevent the formation of complete CdvB rings, leading to the formation of abnormal linear CdvA positive structures that likely contain both endogenous CdvA as well as the CdvAΔ<sup>E3B</sup> mutant protein. While these linear structures were able to recruit a portion of the cellular pool of CdvB, the expression of CdvA<sup>Δ</sup><sub>E3B</sub> almost completely blocked the recruitment of CdvB1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S5B-C</xref>). As a consequence, cells expressing truncated CdvA were unable to divide, as evidenced by both the accumulation of large cells that had failed division (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S5D</xref>) and by the decrease in the percentage of 1N cells observed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S5E</xref>). At the same time, these cells expressing CdvA-HA<sup>Δ</sup><sub>E3B</sub> and CdvB failed to compact and individualize the two copies of their replicated genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E-F</xref>). These data imply that DNA segregation does not occur until after the assembly of a functional ESCRT-III division ring. Furthermore, in this experiment we observed the small number of cells expressing CdvA-HA<sup>Δ</sup><sub>E3B</sub> that slipped through the division arrest, which contained a single mass of DNA on one side of the partially constricted defective division ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2F</xref>) - reinforcing the idea that DNA segregation requires the assembly of a fully functional division ring. Similarly, in live imaging experiments, cells expressing CdvA<sup>Δ</sup><sub>E3B</sub> remained stuck in a state with highly mobile DNA for up to 3 hours, as if unable to compact and segregate their DNA and divide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary movies 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Next, to determine how cells align the axis of DNA separation relative to their future cytokinetic furrow, we analysed live imaging data to generate a set of line profiles perpendicular to the future division plane which we could then use to compare dynamic changes in the DNA and membrane signal. These two-colour kymographs revealed that DNA segregation occurs around the future plane of membrane constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2G</xref>). By measuring membrane signal intensity across the whole cell during the earliest phase of constriction, we were then able to determine the position of the future cytokinetic furrow, which we could use as a landmark to compare with the position at which the gap between the new condensing nucleoids first becomes visible, a few minutes earlier. While limits in the resolution of light microscopy made it difficult to determine with high confidence whether the DNA segregates away from the geometric cell center or away from the site of the future furrow in cells that divide symmetrically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2G</xref>), in rarer asymmetric cell divisions it was clear that the DNA is cleared from a site that pre-figures the division plane rather than being aligned with the middle of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2H</xref>). Taken together, these results show that maturation of the division ring through the recruitment of ESCRT-III proteins is a pre-requisite for passage through the regulatory decision point that triggers the onset of DNA segregation and cytokinesis.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>SegA and SegB regulate DNA compaction</title><p id="P18">Having shown that assembly of the ESCRT-III division ring is a pre-requisite for DNA segregation, we next wanted to investigate the machinery involved in DNA compaction and individualisation itself. As potential regulators, we turned our attention to the proteins SegA and SegB, since these proteins are expressed at the same time as ESCRT-III proteins in preparation for cell division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, and have been suggested to bind DNA to drive chromosome segregation in <italic>Sulfolobus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">To investigate their roles in DNA segregation and division we used antibodies raised against SegA and SegB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> (kindly given to us by Arthur Charles-Orszag) to visualise the localization of the endogenous protein in cells in different stages of cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). In wildtype cells that had not yet undergone DNA segregation, SegB was seen localising in puncta on the DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. As the DNA became more compact, these structures tended to coalesce into two well-defined loci, which remained in place throughout DNA segregation and cytokinesis, as expected if SegB binds SegS sites as previously proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, and similar to those observed in other recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. At the same time, many cells contained additional foci that were less obviously associated with the main nucleoid mass. We also used immunolocalization to investigate localization of SegA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> in a similar manner. While there was a high background, the majority of the antibody signal was detected on or close to the DNA during division. We note that Orszag et al., also proposed that there is a focus of SegA staining between well-separated nucleoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. These data are consistent with the possibility that SegA and SegB might play a role in DNA compaction and segregation at both early and late stages of division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To test this idea and determine whether SegA and SegB play an active role in DNA segregation, we generated knockout strains for SegA <italic>(ΔSegA)</italic> and SegB <italic>(ΔSegB)</italic> as well as a double knockout strain lacking both proteins <italic>(ΔSegAB)</italic> – all of which were viable and grow well. By flow cytometry analysis, the loss of SegA and/or SegB led to a small, but statistically significant increase in the number of cells with more than two copies of the genome relative to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B-C</xref>).</p><p id="P21">To determine the origin of this modest division phenotype, we imaged <italic>ΔSegA</italic> and <italic>ΔSegB</italic> cells live (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S6</xref>). In interphase, mutant cells appeared similar to the MW001 control. However, while DNA became mobile as <italic>ΔSegA</italic> and <italic>ΔSegB</italic> cells entered division, as usual, there was a profound change in the transition from mobility to DNA segregation. Most strikingly, many cells underwent DNA segregation after the onset of membrane constriction - something rarely seen in the corresponding MW001 control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S6</xref>). Despite this, most <italic>ΔSegA</italic> and <italic>ΔSegB</italic> cells were still able to visibly compact and separate their DNA into two foci by late stages of cytokinesis. Similarly, when the sum intensity of DNA in each daughter cell during cytokinesis was quantified, we saw only a marginal increase in the average asymmetry of DNA inheritance in mutant cells as compared to the MW001 control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3F</xref>). Taken together these data show that while SegA and SegB play an important role in the temporal coordination of DNA segregation and cell division, back-up systems appear to be able to aid DNA segregation in their absence.</p><p id="P22">To investigate whether SegA and SegB play a role in DNA compaction itself, we investigated DNA morphology at higher resolution in mutant cells that had been fixed and stained using confocal microscopy. We focused on the analysis of DNA morphology in cells possessing a full ESCRT-III ring, as determined by the presence of CdvB and CdvB1 or B2, at a time when DNA segregation would normally be complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast to the control, <italic>ΔSegA, ΔSegB</italic> and <italic>ΔSegAB</italic> cells frequently failed to compact their DNA into two foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G-H</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S7</xref>). Instead, the DNA was seen in bright spots that were connected by thin linear segments.</p><p id="P23">This phenotype persisted in <italic>ΔSegA</italic> and <italic>ΔSegB</italic> cells that had been fixed mid-constriction. In these cells, DNA was often seen bridging the cytokinetic furrow - a phenotype that was extremely rare in dividing MW001 control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 I-J</xref>). Although these phenotypes appeared striking, a subset of dividing cells in all three deletion strains had correctly compacted and segregated DNA. Again, these data imply the existence of additional machinery that acts together with SegA and SegB to aid DNA segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3K</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S7</xref>). Furthermore, while the overexpression of the <italic>SegAB</italic> cassette under the control of an inducible promoter generated proteins that localized correctly to the DNA, their expression was not sufficient to induce compaction or DNA segregation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig S8</xref>). Taken together these results suggest that while SegA and SegB are not sufficient to induce premature DNA compaction and individualization, and are not essential for DNA segregation, they play a significant role in the temporal coupling of DNA compaction and separation with cell division in <italic>Sulfolobus</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">In this study, we used <italic>Sulfolobus acidocaldarius</italic> as a model to characterise the series of events that ensure the correct partitioning of a single copy of the genome into two daughter cells in an archaeal relative of eukaryotes. This work reveals the existence of a regulatory decision point in the archaeal cell cycle that <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> cells use to coordinate DNA segregation with cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This functions to achieve the same goal as the spindle checkpoint in human cells and the spindle positioning checkpoint in yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, to prepare cells before they commit to division and to re-entry into G1 of the following cell cycle.</p><p id="P25">In <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> cells, as in human cells, passage through this control point is associated with the transition from a single DNA mass to two spatially separated masses. After this point, cells are committed to division and entry into G1. This implies that the action of a pre-division regulatory control point is a more ancient mechanism of cell cycle control than coupling cell cycle progression to oscillations in the levels of CDK cyclins.</p><p id="P26">As we show in this paper, the complex series of events that accompany division in <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> begin up to half an hour before division, when the duplicated genome loses its association with the bounding cell membrane - similar to the way DNA comes away from the nuclear envelope in a eukaryotic cell entering mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. After membrane detachment, the duplicated genome becomes both diffuse and highly mobile. In fact, the localization of genomic DNA appears to change within the 15 seconds timeframe of our movies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary movie1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">2</xref>). While this mobile phase lasts a variable amount of time, it comes to an end with rapid DNA compaction.</p><p id="P27">The computer model we developed to test the likely role of these observed DNA dynamics in DNA segregation shows that entropic forces can help disentangle DNA polymers in spherical cells, like <italic>Sulfolobus</italic>, even though previous work on DNA segregation in bacteria suggested that such entropic forces depend on cells having an elongated shape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Thus, entropy could play a more general role in genome segregation in cells with different shapes. In this light, the “mobile phase” of division likely facilitates the entropic de-mixing and individualization of the two copies of the <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> genome. In cells, this mobile phase appears to come to a sudden end as the DNA compacts. Our simulations show that this rapid phase of compaction can aid the separation of the DNA into two spatially separate masses in two ways: it locks in the effects of entropic separation to aid DNA segregation (hence the need for speed) and reduces DNA mobility. In the model, efficient DNA segregation is also facilitated via the reassociation of the DNA with the membrane at cell poles – something we observe at late stages of cytokinesis. Although this analysis suggests how the dynamic changes in DNA-membrane association (high in G2, low in division, high during cytokinesis) and DNA compaction (high in G2, low pre-DNA segregation and high pre-division) observed in cells likely contribute to DNA segregation, it is clear from the model that other ingredients need to be added to enable robust and complete DNA individualization, e.g. machinery that functions in a way similar to that proposed for Condensin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> to compact of loop DNA molecules in <italic>cis</italic>. Whether SegA and SegB act in this way, or whether this relies on other machinery is a question we aim to resolve in future work.</p><p id="P28">At the same time as these dramatic changes in DNA organization are underway, cells assemble a medial cytokinetic ring (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). At the stage in the cell cycle when the DNA is mobile, our data from fixed cells suggests that the template protein CdvA begins forming a ring at the future site of cytokinesis. This CdvA ring then recruits the ESCRT-III homologue, CdvB (which lies downstream of CdvA in the CdvABC operon) likely through an interaction between the broken winged helix domain of CdvB and CdvA’s E3B tail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. This CdvAB ring in turn recruits the contractile ESCRT-III homologues CdvB1 and CdvB2, leading to the formation of a complete composite ring that, once activated, contracts to cut cells into two<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">Crucially, our data shows that the assembly of this mature composite division ring sets the stage for the subsequent events required to ensure a successful division in several ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, the ring not only recruits the division machinery in preparation for cytokinesis. It is also required to trigger the compaction of the DNA into two individualized masses, and the ring defines the axis of DNA segregation along which the two copies of the genome move apart from each other, towards the poles of the cell. Precisely how cells monitor completion of the division ring and used this information to direct DNA segregation is a fascinating question that remains to be determined. At the same time as DNA segregation is occurring, CdvB is removed from the pre-division ring by Vps4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, allowing for its subsequent degradation by the proteasome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, whose activity is also required during division for DNA replication in the following cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Taken together, these data support the idea that there is a regulatory point in cell cycle when the construction of the composite division ring has been completed, which marks the end of the variable phase of DNA mobility, when cells change their state and become committed to division and entry into G1.</p><p id="P30">Interestingly, we saw no similar evidence to support the existence of an equivalent checkpoint that monitors ring constriction or DNA segregation itself, since DNA segregation and DNA replication appeared unperturbed in cells expressing a dominant negative Vps4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and cells lacking SegA and SegB do not block progression into cytokinesis. Thus, as with the spindle checkpoint in human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> cells seem to have invested all control in a single decision point prior to DNA segregation that must be passed for cells to progress into the next phase of the cell cycle.</p><p id="P31">While we hope that future work will identify the machinery used to assess ring completion and transmit this information to different elements of the downstream machinery, in this paper we show that SegA and SegB play a critical role in the temporal coordination of ring completion and DNA segregation. We show that these two proteins, which sit in the same operon, are required together for the timely compaction of DNA into two spatially separate masses following completion of the division ring. In their absence, cytokinesis is initiated prior to DNA segregation, leading to the accumulation of cells with bridging DNA.</p><p id="P32">Nevertheless, while SegA and SegB perform an important role in DNA compaction and segregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, the fact that cells are still able to complete DNA segregation in their absence (something also observed in a parallel study by Charles-Orszag et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>) points to the existence of unknown molecular players. Given the importance of cell division for lineage survival, it is not surprising to find that the system is robust to perturbation. Other molecules involved may include a set of recently identified DNA binding proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. It is worth noting, however, that while almost all bacteria and eukaryotes rely on SMC-like proteins to individualize intertwined DNA strands by scanning the DNA in <italic>cis</italic> and generating loops (sometimes in partnership with bacterial ParA and ParB proteins), it is not clear whether a similar system operates in <italic>Sulfolobus</italic>. The only SMC protein thus-far identified in <italic>Sulfolobales</italic>, called Coalescin, is more similar to Rad50 than it is to Condensin or Cohesin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the timing of Coalescin expression is significantly later than that of the ESCRT and Seg proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, suggesting a role in S or G2 phase is more likely than in DNA segregation or cell division. Given the need for additional systems to facilitate high fidelity division in our model, we think it likely however that there are non-SMC proteins that operate in an analogous way to aid chromosome individualization in <italic>Sulfolobus</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>SM1</label><media xlink:href="EMS206050-supplement-SM1.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d65aAcCbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>SM2</label><media xlink:href="EMS206050-supplement-SM2.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d65aAcCcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>SM3</label><media xlink:href="EMS206050-supplement-SM3.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d65aAcCdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>SM4</label><media xlink:href="EMS206050-supplement-SM4.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d65aAcCeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>SM5</label><media xlink:href="EMS206050-supplement-SM5.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d65aAcCfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS206050-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d65aAcCgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Matthew Kenneth for his assistance with live cell imaging.

CdvA forms a medial division ring before the expression of ESCRT-III but is not sufficient to induce DNA segregation. CdvA recruits ESCRT-III proteins CdvB and CdvB1 and B2 to the division ring. Perturbing full ESCRT-III ring assembly at this stage blocks DNA segregation and subsequent cell division and cell cycle progression. If cells pass through this regulatory checkpoint, the two nucleoids segregate via compaction by SegA and SegB (and other undescribed factors) before the onset of cytokinesis. CdvB is removed and degraded to allow CdvB1 and CdvB2 cells to constrict and divide before DNA relicensing and entry into G1 and S phase. <bold>(B)</bold> Perturbation of <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> cell division via SegA/SegB knockout leads to cells with late DNA segregation and compaction leading to dividing cells yet to complete DNA segregation, as seen with bridging DNA.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206050-f004"/></fig></floats-group></article>
