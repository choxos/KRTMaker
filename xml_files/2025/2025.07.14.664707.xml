Depending on where a visual stimulus appears, visual performance can differ substantially. For example, while fixating, performance on orientation discrimination tasks is generally higher for stimuli presented along the horizontal meridian compared to the vertical meridian (Horizontal Vertical Anisotropy, HVA). Additionally, performance is better in the lower visual field compared to the upper visual field (Vertical Meridian Asymmetry, VMA; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Carrasco et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Fuller and Carrasco, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Zito et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Barbot et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P7">These perceptual anisotropies are coupled with known cortical magnification anisotropies in primary visual cortex, suggesting how a larger portion of surface area in primary visual cortex is dedicated to processing the horizontal versus the vertical meridian and the lower compared to the upper visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Himmelberg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Kupers et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Himmelberg et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Visual field anisotropies (or asymmetries) have been probed behaviourally at fixation using perceptual discrimination tasks such as orientation discrimination, target detection and contrast discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Carrasco et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Kristjansson and Sigurdardottir, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Barbot et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, they have been reported also in the context of deployment of attentional resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">He et al., 1996</xref>), and visual illusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Rubin et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p id="P9">However, in daily life, humans rarely stare at one point for long, but make frequent eye movements to scan their surroundings. It is not clear whether visual field asymmetries normally observed at fixation persist also when saccades are involved, and whether the known pattern of visual anisotropies (HVA and VMA) would emerge also in this context.</p><p id="P10">Literature on visual field anisotropies while participants are requested to perform saccades is limited. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Fracasso and colleagues (2023)</xref> showed that close to saccade onset, participants perform better in an orientation discrimination task in the upper visual field compared to the lower visual field. Furthermore, Liu and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Liu et al., 2024</xref>), showed a significant reduction in VMA reduction when participants were asked to perform saccades compared to fixation. As a third example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Grujic et al., (2018)</xref> measured the errors in perisaccadic localization of briefly presented targets when participants were requested to perform horizontal or vertical saccades. The authors observed significant differences in performance between upward and downward saccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Grujic et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Although the tasks adopted by these studies are different, spanning between orientation discrimination and target localization, it is interesting to note how these studies are suggestive of an overall VMA reduction or inversion during saccades compared to fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Grujic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Fracasso et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Liu et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P12"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Grujic and Colleagues (2018)</xref> suggest how effects in perceptual localization along the vertical meridian might depend on neural circuits that asymmetrically represent the upper and lower visual fields, as for example in the superior colliculus (SC) in the midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Grujic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hafed &amp; Chen, 2016</xref>). The superficial and deeper layers of the SC are organized retinotopically with corresponding visual and oculomotor maps, and it houses motor neurons controlling eye muscles and generating saccades in humans (Hafed et al., 2023) and non-human primates alike (Wurtz and Goldberg, 1972; Mohler and Wurtz, 1976; Wurtz and Albano, 1980). Interestingly, visual and motor neuronal responses in SC shows opposite anisotropies compared to primary visual cortex along the vertical meridian, showing faster and stronger neuronal responses for stimuli presented in the upper visual field compared to the lower visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hafed and Chen, 2016</xref>; Hafed, 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Fracasso et al., 2023</xref>; Hafed et al., 2023).</p><p id="P13">In the current study we measure visual field anisotropies at fixation and while participants are asked to perform saccades. We implemented the saccadic suppression of image displacement paradigm (SSID), a task in which participants are required to discriminate the direction of a visual target that is displaced while the eyes are moving toward it. In SSID, a participant’s ability to discriminate the direction of target displacement is severely impaired when the eyes are moving compared to fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bridgeman et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Deubel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Deubel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Deubel et al., 2002</xref>). In the original study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bridgeman et al. (1975)</xref>, the authors were interested in studying the influence of an anticipatory signal generated by the oculomotor system to the visual system (corollary discharge), to account for the upcoming retinal shift introduced by the following eye movement.</p><p id="P14">In this exploratory study, we aim to assess whether and how anisotropies observed at fixation (HMA and VMA) translate in the context of saccades. Specifically, given the existing results reported in the literature, we expect an overall reduction in VMA (smaller or no difference between the upper and lower VPF) and a largely unaltered HMA (better performance along the horizontal compared to the vertical meridian).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P15">A total of 25 participants between the age of 18 and 39 took part in the measurements (19 females). One participant was excluded because they showed non-collaborative behaviour. All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The experiment was approved by the local ethics committee at the College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences. Written informed consent was obtained, in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Participants received compensation of £6 per testing hour. Each participant took part in a variable number of experimental sessions (2 or 3). A variable number of blocks (between 10 and 29 blocks) were completed by each participant. The variability in the number of blocks performed is due to scheduling restraints, as some participants did not return for the third session. Experimental sessions took place on non-consecutive days, each taking about 60 minutes.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Experimental design</title><p id="P16">We measured the performance on a target displacement task in the periphery using a two-by-two within-participants design to study the influence of <italic>meridian</italic> (horizontal or vertical target movements) and <italic>viewing condition</italic> (fixation or saccades).

Responses were given by pressing keys on a standard keyboard. Stimuli were presented on a 24-inch LCD monitor (1920 x 1024 pixels) with a refresh rate of 144 Hz. Display luminance was linearized, and gamma corrected. A screen cover was placed over the screen to create a square aperture (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We opted for this experimental setup as visual references affect how we (mis)localize objects along the perisaccadic interval. More specifically, visual references directly affect perceived location and visual compression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Lappe et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, visual references can modulate performance in SSID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Deubel et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Eyes were horizontally and vertically aligned with the centre of the screen at a distance of 64.5 cm. Eye position was sampled using an Eyelink 1000 (SR Research, Ltd., Ottawa, ON), acquiring data at 1000 Hz. A five-point calibration in a square-shaped pattern was performed at the beginning of each experimental block. Both eyes were tracked for the duration of the experiment. The experiment was programmed in Matlab (R2021a, The Math Works, Inc., 85 Natick, MA), with the Psychtoolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Brainard and Vision, 1997</xref>) and the Eyelink toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cornelissen et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedure</title><p id="P19">The experiment consisted of three parts. During the first part, we measured an estimate of individual saccade latency separately for vertical and horizontal saccades. This individual reaction time was used later in the main part of the experiment to ensure an equivalent delay in displacement onset between the saccade and fixation condition. During the saccadic latency test, a starting fixation point of .35 dva was presented in the middle of the screen. Participants sat in a dimly lit room and were instructed to fixate on the starting fixation point and to press the spacebar to start each trial. After a variable delay (1 - 1.5s) the starting fixation point disappeared from the centre of the screen and reappeared at 10 dva in the periphery – the target fixation point. For horizontal saccades, the target fixation point could be presented randomly on the left or right, along the horizontal meridian. For vertical saccades, the target fixation point could be presented randomly on the upper or lower part of the screen, along the vertical meridian. Participants were instructed to perform an eye movement towards the target fixation point as accurately and as rapidly as possible. After each trial, we derived an estimate of saccade reaction time. Saccade latency towards the left/right (horizontal meridian) and upper/lower (vertical meridian) was tested in two separate blocks of 40 trials each. At the end of each training block, we derived the median saccade reaction time for horizontal and vertical saccades, separately. The saccade latency test lasted approximately 10 minutes.</p><p id="P20">Following the saccade latency test, the participant performed a training session consisting of 15 trials to become familiar with the experimental procedure. Participants were instructed to fixate on the starting fixation point and to press the spacebar to start each trial. After a variable delay (1 -1.5 s) the starting fixation point disappeared from the centre of the screen and reappeared at 10 dva in the periphery (left or right, along the horizontal meridian - the first movement). After a variable interval, between 80% and 120% of the individual participant’s median saccade reaction time in the horizontal condition, the target was displaced with -1.7, -0.5, 0.5 and 1.7 dva relative to the target fixation point, along the horizontal meridian. Throughout the manuscript, we use the term ‘first movement’ when referring to the shift of the initial fixation dot towards the periphery, and the term ‘displacement’ when referring to the second shift of the peripheral fixation dot.</p><p id="P21">During the third part participants performed the main task. Before each block, participants were informed of the task condition they would be taking part in (horizontal or vertical meridian) and whether to keep fixation (fixation condition) or follow the dot with their eyes (saccade condition). Each trial started with a black fixation point with a size of .35 dva appearing in the centre of the screen. Participants were instructed to fixate and press the spacebar to start each trial. After a variable interval (750 - 1250 ms) the fixation point moved either 10 dva to the left or to the right (horizontal condition), or up or down (vertical condition) – the first movement. During ‘fixation’ blocks, participants were instructed to keep stable fixation in the centre of the screen. During ‘saccade’ blocks, participants were instructed to move their eyes as accurately and rapidly as possible towards the displaced target. Shortly after the first movement of the target, the target moved again, 0.5 or 1.7 dva along or against the direction of the first target movement (displacement, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> for a graphic representation of the trial procedure in the saccade and fixation conditions).</p><p id="P22">The onset of the displacement was contingent on the experimental condition. On ‘saccade’ blocks, saccades were detected by means of a gaze-contingent algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Schweitzer and Rolfs, 2020</xref>). The displacement was presented in the first monitor flip immediately after saccade detection. This ensured that the displacements only took place while the eyes were ‘in flight’. On ‘fixation’ blocks, the displacement was presented between 80% and 120% of the individual participant’s median saccade reaction time in the corresponding condition (horizontal or vertical). For example, if someone’s median saccade reaction time was 170ms for horizontal saccades, the displacement would randomly occur between 136 and 204 milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Fabius et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Fracasso and Melcher, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Buonocore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Fabius et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Taylor et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P23">After each trial, participants were asked to press a key on the keyboard corresponding to the direction of the displacement of the target (‘v’ for left, ‘b’ for right for the ‘horizontal’ condition, ‘s’ for up and ‘z’ for down for the ‘vertical’ condition). A written reminder of the response mapping was presented onscreen after each trial. The direction of the first movement and the displacement was randomized for each trial (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Each block consisted of 45 trials and lasted for approximately 3 minutes.

Data wrangling, filtering, and analysis were carried out in R v4.2.0. Data were filtered based on several criteria: 1) whether participants were correctly performing eye movements or kept fixation in the corresponding experimental blocks, 2) for the ‘saccade’ condition, whether the first saccade was in the correct direction (left/right/up/down) 3) whether the displacement occurred while the eyes were ‘in flight’ (between saccade onset and saccade onset + saccade duration), 4) the duration of the first saccade being shorter than 95 ms and lastly, 5) whether the amplitude of the first saccade was at least 6.5 dva. One participant was excluded, and after applying the above filters we removed 18.9% of trials for the vertical condition at fixation and 22.3% of trials were removed in the saccade condition.

Thus, we considered it redundant to report the results here as well. Moreover, especially for estimates of bias, the relative difference between modalities is not informative per se. The bias departure from 0 (either towards the positive or negative) is indicative of the direction of the biased response, either along or opposite with respect to the eye movement, or towards or away from fixation, thus providing a clear interpretation of the participants response tendency in the different conditions. Lastly, we fitted Bayesian linear models and obtained Bayes factors from the BayesFactor package for R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Morey et al., 2015</xref>) comparing slope and bias estimates between experimental conditions.

It has been shown that compression is strongly linked to the presence of visual references (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Krekelberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Lappe et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p id="P76">On the other hand, SSID studies (including the current study) report a general outward bias, along the direction of the eye movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dassonville et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Deubel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Deubel et al., 1998</xref>). It is important to note that models of perceived mislocalization successfully predict patterns of shifts and compression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">VanRullen, 2004</xref>), but predict an absence of mislocalization corresponding to the saccade target itself, that is: briefly flashed probes around the saccadic target should be perceived veridically. SSID results indicate a different pattern, showing that the saccade target itself can be strongly misperceived as being shifted along the saccade direction. Another study supports this finding: in preparation of a saccade, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zirnsak and Colleagues (2014)</xref> showed that receptive fields shift towards the saccadic target, leading to mislocalized presaccadic stimuli as being nearer to the saccadic target, along with the direction of the saccade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Zirnsak et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Horizontal-vertical-asymmetry and vertical-meridian-asymmetry in the saccade condition</title><p id="P77">We observed the classic horizontal-vertical asymmetry for saccade and fixation in SSID, while we did not observe robust signs of the vertical meridian asymmetry.</p><p id="P78">The vertical meridian asymmetry is generally observed at fixation in orientation discrimination and related perceptual tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Carrasco et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Kristjansson and Sigurdardottir, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Barbot et al., 2021</xref>), moreover it has also been reported in the context of deployment of attentional resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">He et al., 1996</xref>), and visual illusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Rubin et al., 1996</xref>). The task adopted in this investigation (SSID) is different compared to the tasks in which the VMA is normally observed. In SSID the focus is on the displacement of target in space (‘where did the target move?’), instead of perceptual discrimination per se (‘what I am looking at’).</p><p id="P79">It could be speculated that these tasks rely on distinct visual processes or pathways, probing different streams of visual information: the ventral ‘what’ stream and dorsal ‘where’ stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Goodale and Milner, 1992</xref>). Differences in visual perception along the vertical meridian might serve a functional role in answering the question ‘what am I looking at?’, in which it is often more important to identify what appears in our lower visual field than in the upper visual field (e.g. grasping for objects, avoiding falls, avoiding falls, or stepping over hazards like a snake). In contrast, vertical meridian asymmetries (VMA) may not extend to tasks involving spatial displacement, such as determining where an object moved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Previc, 1990</xref>). This hypothesis assumes that the modes of operation governing the perception-action cycle at fixation and during (or in the vicinity of) saccades are different from one another. It has been proposed that visual perception at fixation evolved to support the motor system when performing precise actions towards the lower visual field, within the peri-personal space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Previc, 1990</xref>), for example: catching small prey, or grasping and reaching for objects. These actions heavily rely on visual feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Khan and Lawrence, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Kristjansson and Sigurdardottir, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Rossit et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Gottwald et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P80">Alternatively, these results could arise from the interaction between known neural anisotropies between the superior colliculus and primary visual cortex. In primary visual cortex a larger portion of surface area is dedicated to processing the horizontal versus the vertical meridian and the lower compared to the upper visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Himmelberg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Kupers et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Himmelberg et al., 2023</xref>), whereas the opposite has been observed in the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hafed and Chen, 2016</xref>). One might speculate about a compensatory mechanism balancing between opposite anisotropies in tasks relying heavily on both the perceptual and the oculomotor system, such as SSID. Visual perception during saccades could be dominated by the SC, an ontogenetically older structure, present since the early development of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">White et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Beltramo and Scanziani, 2019</xref>). The SC is more sensitive for stimuli presented in the upper compared to the lower visual field, possibly to serve early detection of dangers from above, for example flying predators. Literature shows that UV contrast is predominantly processed in the upper visual field in mice, which helps detect predators in the sky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Qiu et al., 2021</xref>). This interpretation is corroborated by recent evidence from monkey neurophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hafed and Chen, 2016</xref>). Moreover, it has recently been shown how orientation discrimination accuracy can be comparable between the upper and lower visual fields in close proximity with eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Liu et al., 2024</xref>), or even show an advantage towards the upper visual field in the perisaccadic interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Fracasso et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P81">As a third alternative, the upper visual field advantage observed behaviourally could be linked to biases introduced while scanning the environment during natural locomotion, requiring frequent and rapid orienting movements predominantly towards the upper visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Matthis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Muller et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p id="P82">We measured performance along different visual fields with SSID, a task which required the involvement of both the visual and oculomotor systems. Our results indicate the presence of a robust HVA effect, at fixation as well as when participants were required to perform a saccade, in the absence of a robust VMA (although we observed a trend in bias estimates).</p><p id="P83">This pattern of results is consistent with current literature on behavioural anisotropies measured in the context of saccades, showing robust HMA and an overall reduction in VMA. We proposed different non-mutually exclusive hypotheses to account for this pattern of results, as different mechanisms can interact and contribute to the observed effects.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>A.F. was supported by a grant from the Biotechnology and Biology Research Council (BBSRC, grant number: BB/S006605/1) and the Bial Foundation (Bial Foundation Grants Program; Grant id: A-29315, number: 203/2020, grant edition: G-15516).

Participants were instructed to fixate and press the spacebar to start the trial. After a variable interval (between 750 and 1250 ms) the fixation point moved either 10 dva to the left (or right, horizontal condition), or up (or down vertical condition) – the first movement. Participants were instructed to move their eyes as accurately and rapidly as possible towards the target fixation point (green arrow). Shortly after the first movement of the target, the target moved again, 0.5 or 1.7 dva along or against the direction of the first movement. The onset of the displacement was contingent on the experimental condition. In the saccade condition, the displacement was presented in the first monitor flip immediately after saccade detection; therefore, the displacements only took place while the eyes were ‘in flight’. After each trial, participants were instructed to press a key on the keyboard corresponding to the direction of the displacement of the target. The direction of the first movement and the displacement (up;down / left;right) was randomized for each trial. <bold>(B)</bold> The trial presentation during the fixation condition was identical to the saccade condition, the only differences being that participants were instructed to keep stable fixation in the centre of the screen throughout the trial, and the displacement was randomly presented between 80% and 120% of the individual participant’s median saccade reaction time.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207356-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Psychometric curve fitting <bold>(A)</bold> Differences in bias.

See main text for further details. <bold>(B)</bold> Examples of differences in slopes.

Although present, the bias in the fixation condition was considerably smaller than the unreliable and biased responses observed in the saccade condition.
