Two major H9N2 lineages dominate globally: the G1 lineage (genotype G1-B), prevalent in the Middle East, Africa and the Indian subcontinent, and the BJ/94 lineage (predominantly genotype G57), dominant in China, Vietnam, South Korea, Indonesia, and the Far East. We investigated replication, transmission, and pathogenicity of representatives of these two lineages, linking genotype to phenotype. The G57 strain A/Ck/Vietnam/H7F-14-BN4-315/2014 (Vietnam/315) was more lethal to chicken embryos than the G1-B strain A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL-01/2008 (Pakistan/UDL-01). Vietnam/315 exhibited higher replication in both directly infected and contact chickens, with increased virus shedding from the oropharynx and cloaca. In contrast, Pakistan/UDL-01 virus was primarily shed from the oropharynx, highlighting differences in replication, tissue tropism and transmission. Gene analysis showed the M gene of Vietnam/315 enhanced replication in primary chicken kidney cells, whereas the PB2, HA, NA, and M genes promoted increased replication in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells. Both viruses showed preferential binding to avian-like receptors over human-like receptors. However, Vietnam/315, however, exhibited higher neuraminidase activity and a more acid-stable HA (pH fusion 5.2) than Pakistan/UDL-01 virus. These findings suggest G57 genotype viruses possess greater replication and transmission fitness than G1-B viruses <italic>in vivo</italic>, ex vivo and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Reassortment events involving G1-B strains acquiring G57 genes may enhance replication and virulence, potentially increasing the risk of animal and human infection.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Importance</title><p id="P3">H9N2 avian influenza viruses are widespread in poultry, resulting in significant economic losses and occasional human infections. Different genetic variants dominate in various regions, but their ability to cause disease and spread in poultry remains unclear. These viruses can exchange genes with other avian influenza strains, altering their infectivity and transmission. This study compared two major H9N2 genotypes: G1-B (common in the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East) and G57 (dominant in China and Vietnam). The G57 virus showed higher replication in laboratory tests and infected chickens, shedding more virus through the orofecal route. It also exhibited a stronger attachment to bird cells and had a more acid-stable HA, suggesting an increased potential for infection and spread.</p><p id="P4">Our findings indicate that G57 genotype viruses are more infectious and adaptable in poultry than G1 viruses. Gene exchange with other avian influenza strains may generate more virulent viruses with increased transmission potential. This study supports the risk assessment of emerging strains and enhances disease mitigation strategies.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>H9N2</kwd><kwd>G1 lineage</kwd><kwd>G57 lineage</kwd><kwd>chicken transmission</kwd><kwd>embryo lethality</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S2" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">The H9N2 subtype of avian influenza virus (AIV) was first reported in 1966 from turkey farms in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The virus was later identified in poultry in China and diversified into different lineages, which are now prevalent across wider geographical regions worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Although classified as a low pathogenicity AIV, H9N2 outbreaks cause substantial economic losses to the poultry industry through both lethal co-infections and reduced egg production. Additionally, more than 137 zoonotic infections with H9N2 viruses have been reported in many countries, including China, Egypt, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Oman, Pakistan, India, Senegal, and Vietnam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. These viruses also show a high tendency to exchange their gene segments with other subtypes of AIVs through reassortment, leading to the emergence of reassortant viruses, often with an expanded host range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p><p id="P6">H9 haemagglutinin is classified broadly into two phylogeographic lineages: Eurasian and American, with the latter rarely reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. The Eurasian lineage is further divided into three sublineages: G1 (Eastern and Western, found in the Indian subcontinent, Middle East, and Africa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], BJ/94 (Y280 and G9-like viruses, dominant in China, Vietnam, South Korea and Indonesia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], and Y439 (Korean lineage, previously detected in Korea and parts of Eurasia but not reported in recent years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P7">Both G1 and BJ/94-like viruses have caused human infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], and extensive genetic reassortment has driven their evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. However, BJ/94-like viruses show higher genetic compatibility for reassortment than G1-like viruses. The G57 genotype is the fittest and the most predominant genotype of H9N2 viruses in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. It contributed to the emergence of the highly zoonotic H7N9 virus by donating six internal gene segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Additionally, at least twelve other subtypes, including H3N8, H5N6, and H10N3, that are linked to human infections acquired one or more internal genes from BJ/94-like H9N2 viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P8">Poultry outbreaks with G57 genotype-like viruses have also been reported in other neighbouring countries, including Korea, Myanmar, Tajikistan, and Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. While G1-like viruses are known to co-circulate with G57 viruses in China and Vietnam, it remains unclear whether G1 viruses are present in all these countries where G57 viruses are enzootic. The G1-like viruses in the Indian subcontinent have evolved by acquiring point mutations that modulate antigenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Since their identification in 2008, when G1 viruses were found to have reassorted between HPAI H7N3 and H9N2, resulting in a novel genotype G1-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], their genotypic constellations have exhibited limited divergence. It is therefore predicted that further genetic reassortment between the co-circulating genotypes, G1-B and G57, could give rise to new variants with greater fitness.</p><p id="P9">This study assessed the phenotypic characteristics of the BJ/94-like G57 H9N2 virus, which has caused severe disease outbreaks in Vietnam since 2014. The H9N2 strain A/chicken/Vietnam/H7F-14-BN4-315/2014, isolated from a live bird market in northern Vietnam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], was selected as a prototype virus. Its replication competence in cultured cells, infectivity and virulence in chicken embryos, as well as pathogenicity and transmission potential in chickens, were analysed and compared to the representative G1-B genotype of H9N2 virus A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL-01/2008, isolated from poultry outbreaks in Pakistan in 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Key viral fitness determinants, including pH fusion, receptor binding specificity, and neuraminidase activity, were examined.

To study virus transmission to contact chickens, naïve chickens (n = 10) were introduced for co-housing with directly infected chickens at one day post-infection (dpi) and were referred to as ‘early contact chickens’. To identify viral dissemination in the internal organs, directly infected chickens (n = 5) from either group were culled at four dpi. To determine if the virus shed in the later days was transmissible, second-contact chickens (n=4) were co-housed with the directly infected and contact chickens at four dpi and are referred to as ‘late contacts’. The oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were collected daily in Virus Transport Medium (VTM) from all directly infected chickens, early-contact chickens, and late-contact chickens until eight dpi. A fourth group of six chickens was left uninfected and served as the negative control. Chickens were monitored twice a day to observe the clinical signs. All the chickens were finally swabbed and humanely euthanised by an overdose of pentobarbitone at 14 dpi, and blood was collected adopting terminal cardiac bleed procedure.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Replication kinetics of H9N2 viruses in cultured cells</title><p id="P15">Replication kinetics of the wild-type H9N2 viruses and their single gene reassortants were assessed in primary chicken kidney cells (CKCs) and MDCK cells in quadruplicate, using 12-well tissue culture plates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].

The second contact chickens (hereby referred to as ‘R2’) in both the groups showed peak oropharyngeal virus shedding at seven dpi (three dpe), with Vietnam/315 virus group showing higher oropharyngeal virus shedding (mean titer – 10<sup>3.78</sup> PFU/ml) than Pakistan/UDL-01 virus (mean titer – 10<sup>2.95</sup> PFU/ml). The oropharyngeal virus shedding in the R2 groups continued until eight dpi (four dpe) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>), when daily swabbing was stopped.</p><p id="P26">The cloacal virus shedding in the D0 group was observed only in the Vietnam/315 virus group on three dpi in six out of ten chickens (mean titer – 10<sup>2.07</sup> PFU/ml), while the D0 chickens in the Pakistan/UDL-01 virus group did not show any virus shedding via cloaca (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). The cloacal virus shedding exhibited by R1 contacts in the Vietnam/315 virus group continued until four dpi (three dpe) (mean titer: 10<sup>2.40</sup> PFU/ml), while the R1 contacts in the Pakistan/UDL-01 virus group did not show any cloacal virus shedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). The R2 contacts in Vietnam/315 virus group showed peak cloacal virus shedding (mean titer – 10<sup>1.86</sup> PFU/ml) at seven dpi (three dpe), while R2 contacts in Pakistan/UDL-01 virus group showed peak cloacal virus shedding (mean titer – 10<sup>1.03</sup> PFU/ml) at eight dpi (four dpe) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that the Vietnam/315 virus replicates more efficiently, is shed at higher levels in directly infected chickens, and causes more severe infection in sentinel chickens compared to the Pakistan/UDL-01 virus. The Vietnam/315 virus sheds from both the oropharynx and cloaca. In contrast, the Pakistan/UDL-01 virus sheds mainly via the oropharynx, as the mean cloacal shedding in second-contact birds was close to the baseline.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Vietnam/315 virus shows more dissemination in internal organs in specific pathogen-free chickens compared to Pakistan/UDL-01 virus</title><p id="P27">To determine the dissemination of H9N2 viruses into internal organs, lungs and kidneys were collected from five directly inoculated chickens per group at four dpi. No virus was detected in chickens infected with Pakistan/UDL-01 virus, whereas four directly inoculated chickens and three contact chickens infected with Vietnam/315 virus showed the presence of the virus in their lungs. Two directly inoculated chickens and two contact chickens showed the presence of the virus in their kidneys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). These results indicate that the Vietnam/315 virus caused a more systemic infection compared to the Pakistan/UDL-01 virus.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>The Vietnam/315 virus replicates more efficiently in primary chicken kidney cells compared to the Pakistan/UDL-01 virus, with the difference attributed to the M gene</title><p id="P28">To determine viral replication <italic>ex vivo</italic>, the H9N2 viruses were compared for their replication in primary Chicken Kidney Cells (CKCs).

The Vietnam/315 virus attains a titer around 3x10<sup>6</sup> pfu at 19 hours post-infection and a peak titer of 8.8x10<sup>7</sup> pfu at 48 hours post-infection, while the Pakistan/UDL-01 virus attains a titer of 0.63x10<sup>3</sup> pfu at 19 hours post-infection and a peak titer of 3.5x10<sup>6</sup> at 48 hours post-infection. The multi-step replication kinetics of single gene reassortants showed that replacing the M gene of Pakistan/UDL-01 virus with Vietnam/315 virus increases the replication at early time points (19 hours and 24 hours post-infection) (P□&lt; 0.0001). However, NS gene replacement reduces the replication at 19 hours (P&lt;0.005), but the difference becomes non-significant as the replication progresses until 72 hours. On the other hand, replacing the PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, and NA genes of the Pakistan/UDL-01 virus with those of the Vietnam/315 virus reduces the replication rate in primary CK cells. These results indicate that the increased replication of the Vietnam/315 virus in primary chicken kidney cells is attributed, at least in part, to the M gene.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>The Vietnam/315 virus replicates to a higher titer in MDCK cells and forms relatively larger plaques, which is attributed to the PB2, HA, NA, and M gene segments</title><p id="P29">The comparative replicative fitness and plaque morphology of Vietnam/315 and Pakistan/UDL-01 Hwere analysed in mammalian-origin cells.

The plaque morphology of single-gene reassortants containing the PB2, HA, NA, or M gene of the Vietnam/315 virus with a Pakistan/UDL-01 virus backbone exhibited an increased plaque size in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p id="P30">The Vietnam/315 virus showed a significantly higher replication rate (P□&lt; 0.0001) than the Pakistan/UDL-01 virus at all time points in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). The replication kinetics of single-gene reassortants, in which the PB2, HA, NA, or M gene of the Vietnam/315 virus was introduced into the Pakistan/UDL-01 virus backbone, resulted in increased replication in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). This suggests that the enhanced replication and larger plaque size of the Vietnam/315 virus in MDCK cells are attributed to the PB2, HA, NA, and M gene segments.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>The Vietnam/315 virus exhibited more acid-stable HA compared to the Pakistan/UDL-01 virus</title><p id="P31">The pH fusion of haemagglutinin of H9N2 viruses was estimated by the syncytium formation assay in Vero cells. Consistent with the previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], the Pakistan/UDL-01 virus showed a pH fusion of 5.4. Interestingly, the Vietnam/315 virus showed a lower pH threshold fusing at pH 5.2 or lower. This indicates that the Vietnam/315 virus requires a lower pH for HA to undergo conformational change and trigger endosomal membrane fusion, resulting in a more acid-stable HA compared to the Pakistan/UDL-01 virus.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Vietnam/315 virus exhibited relatively higher receptor binding avidity towards avian-like sialic acid receptor analogues compared to human-like receptor analogues</title><p id="P32">The receptor binding specificity of Vietnam/315 virus was quantified and compared with that of Pakistan/UDL-01 virus using synthetic sialoglycopolymers—α2,6-sialyllactosamine (6SLN), α2,3-sialyllactosamine (3SLN), or sulfated 3SLN (6-Su) receptor analogues — by bio-layer interferometry. Binding to 3SLN was not detectable for either virus, indicating negligible interaction. Both strains showed moderate binding to 6SLN, with Pakistan/UDL-01 exhibiting slightly stronger binding (K<sub>d</sub> = 0.2075 μM) compared to Vietnam/315 (0.3921 μM). In contrast, markedly stronger binding was observed to the modified receptor 3SLN(6Su), with K<sub>d</sub> values of 0.0046 μM for UDL and 0.0029 μM for Vietnam. This represents a ~45–135-fold increase in binding affinity relative to 6SLN, highlighting a clear preference for 3SLN(6Su). Although the observed differences between Pakistan/UDL-01 and Vietnam/315 at each receptor are relatively small and may fall within expected assay variability, they suggest subtle differences in receptor-binding dynamics between the two strains. Overall, these data indicate a strong binding preference for 3SLN(6Su) over 6SLN or 3SLN, consistent across both viruses.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Vietnam/315 virus has a higher enzymatically active NA than Pakistan/UDL-01 H9N2</title><p id="P33">The contribution of NA to the differential fitness of these H9N2 viruses was assessed by measuring neuraminidase activity using a Fluorometric MUNANA Assay.

This suggests that a lower concentration of Vietnam/315 virus NA protein can antagonize 50% of the MUNANA substrate, requiring less viral NA for efficient progeny virus release from infected cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S25" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P34">H9N2 avian influenza viruses have undergone significant evolutionary changes since their initial identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], leading to alterations in replication efficiency, virulence, transmission dynamics, and zoonotic potential. In the early 1990s, H9N2 strains of both the G1 and BJ/94 lineages primarily caused mild or subclinical infections in chickens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. However, due to genetic mutations and reassortments, contemporary genotypes—most notably G1-B and G57— have been associated with more severe disease outbreaks in poultry populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. The G1-B genotype of the H9N2 G1 lineage emerged through reassortment with co-circulating highly pathogenic H7N3 viruses in Pakistan. This involved the acquisition of internal gene segments that significantly contributed to its fitness and dominance in poultry across the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, and Africa, replacing the older G1 lineage viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Meanwhile, the G57 genotype of the BJ/94 lineage has become prevalent in China, Vietnam, and neighbouring countries, establishing itself as the dominant genotype since its identification in China in 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Although both G1-B and G57 genotypes have maintained dominance in their respective regions, limited data are available on their key phenotypic differences, particularly in replication capacity, tissue tropism, virulence and the molecular factors driving the phenotypic differences between the two genotypes.</p><p id="P35">We utilised a combination of <italic>in vitro, in ovo, ex vivo</italic>, and <italic>in vivo</italic> models as well as reverse genetics approaches to compare the replication kinetics, tissue dissemination, and pathogenicity of two representative strains: Pakistan/UDL-01 (G1-B genotype) and Vietnam/315 (G57 genotype). We also identified the molecular factors driving the phenotypic differences between the currently dominant genotypes of H9N2 viruses. The findings demonstrate that the G57 genotype exhibits higher virulence in chicken embryos and a greater dissemination in the lungs and kidneys of infected chickens compared to the G1-B genotype. Molecular analysis revealed that the Vietnam/315 strain possesses a distinct combination of PB2, HA, NA, and M gene segments, which are likely contributors to its increased fitness and pathogenicity.</p><p id="P36">The genotypic variability of H9N2 strains likely influences the pathogenicity phenotype and tissue dissemination as genetic differences can directly modulate viral receptor binding, neuraminidase activity, polymerase function, and/or the ability to antagonise host antiviral responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies on the multistep replication kinetics of single-gene reassortants from the Vietnam/315 strain, when combined with the Pakistan/UDL-01 background, revealed that the higher replication of Vietnam/315 virus in avian cells is primarily attributed to the M gene segment. However, it is important to note that epistatic interactions between different gene segments also play a significant role. The reassortment of the M gene contributes to increased viral replication in avian cells, possibly by enhacing the export of ribonucleoprotein from the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>].</p><p id="P37">The crucial role of the M gene in viral replication was further demonstrated in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], where a reassortant H7N9 bearing PA and M from Vietnam/315 strain was generated by coinfecting chickens with H7N9 and H9N2 and the reassortant virus exhibited increased replication compared to its parental strain.</p><p id="P38">The Vietnam/315 strain also exhibited a significantly higher replication rate and increased cell-to-cell spread, resulting in larger plaque sizes in MDCK cells when compared to Pakistan/UDL-01. This phenotype can be attributed to its PB2, HA, NA, and M gene segments. Notably, the PB2 and M gene segments in the G57 genotype originated from Y280-like (or BJ/94-like) lineages of H9N2, while the G1 Middle East lineage contains the PB2 and M segments from the H7N3 subtype. Additionally, the PB2 of the Vietnam/315 possesses various amino acid markers associated with higher polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>) and enhanced replication in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] compared to the PB2 of the G1 Middle East lineage.</p><p id="P39">Receptor binding analyses indicated that both strains preferentially bind sulfated avian 3′SLN receptors. However, Vietnam/315 showed higher neuraminidase activity than Pakistan/UDL-01, suggesting a more efficient viral release contributed by Vietnam/315 NA. This facilitates efficient viral attachment and release from host cells, supported by replication kinetics data showing significantly higher viral titers for Vietnam/315 at 19 hours post-infection. Additionally, our previous work demonstrated that the six internal genes of Vietnam/315 confer a selective advantage to H7N9 viruses, enhancing their replication and transmission in chickens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. This advantage is attributed to the higher polymerase activity of the RNP complex, indicating that a combination of an optimized HA-NA balance and a highly active RNP complex confers Vietnam/315 strain a significant phenotypic edge over Pakistan/UDL-01 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>].</p><p id="P40">While the human seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses often require lower pH (&lt;5.5) for fusion, the avian influenza viruses typically have higher pH fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. The acid-stable HA of Vietnam/315 can contribute to its stability in respiratory droplets and aerosols, promoting airborne transmission, a characteristic shared with other human-adapted influenza viruses like pdm H1N1 and H3N2. The increased replication and shedding of Vietnam/315 in chickens heightens the risk of spillover to humans. The Vietnam/315 virus also possesses unique mammalian adaptation markers that improve its capacity to interact with human host factors, such as PB2 271I interacting with ANP32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>] and NP 52N conferring both BTN3A3 evasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>], and overcoming Mx1 restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. These markers confer increased susceptibility to replication and immune evasion in the human host, thereby facilitating cross-species transmission and infection. The Vietnam/315 virus, despite demonstrating lower binding avidity for human 6SLN receptors compared to avian receptors, undeniably has the capacity to cause human infections, as evidenced by recent findings with G57 viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Any future adaptation enhancing human receptor binding, while retaining the acid stability of HA, could further increase the risk of human transmission.</p><p id="P41">Genetic characterisation of G57 viruses from Vietnam revealed an HA cleavage site with the dibasic RSSR motif and residues associated with human receptor binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].

These features have become increasingly common among H9N2 viruses isolated since 2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>) and contribute to productive infection, enhanced dissemination, and greater viral shedding — ultimately facilitating efficient transmission within poultry populations.</p><p id="P42">Virus shedding patterns differed between the strains: Vietnam/315 was shed from both the oropharynx and cloaca, with respiratory shedding predominating as is common with H9N2 viruses in chickens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>], while the Pakistan/UDL-01 virus was primarily shed through the oropharynx. While cloacal shedding is more common in waterfowl, it has been occasionally observed in terrestrial poultry infected with certain low pathogenic H9N2 viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. We have previously observed cloacal shedding in Rhode Island Red chickens infected with Pakistan/UDL-01 virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. It was not significant in the Bovans Brown breed of chickens in the current study, possibly due to breed-dependent susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. Furthermore, low pathogenic viruses with more than dibasic HA cleavage motifs can lead to systemic infections, increasing the likelihood of cloacal shedding and facilitating faecal-oral transmission, as observed with Vietnam/315 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>].</p><p id="P43">Due to the migratory-wild-domestic bird interface across the major wetlands of the Indian sub-continent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>], reassortant viruses between G1 and G57 lineages have been generated which have an increased propensity to replicate in terrestrial poultry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. Our study elucidates the molecular factors responsible for the increased replication and fitness of G57 viruses. This contributes to the risk assessment of emerging reassortant viruses between G1 and G7 genotypes. Therefore, continuous surveillance, along with stricter biosecurity measures, is imperative to limit transmission within poultry and mitigate the risk of zoonotic spillover events.</p></sec><sec id="S26" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P44">G57-like viruses possess evolutionary adaptations which enhance their ability to circulate and persist in terrestrial poultry. These viruses also possess acid-stable HA glycoprotein and mammalian adaption markers, which can increase the chances of their zoonotic spillover to humans. The co-circulation of these viruses with other H9N2 lineages and other influenza subtypes in the Asia Pacific region poses an imminent threat to terrestrial poultry, as it likely generates reassortant viruses with the potential to infect humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary files</label><media xlink:href="EMS206002-supplement-Supplementary_files.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d2aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S28"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are thankful for the support provided by the Animal Services team at the Pirbright Institute during transmission studies and to Thomas Peacock, Joe O’Boyle and Toby Carter for their feedback on the manuscript.</p><sec id="S27"><title>Funding</title><p>This research was funded by BBSRC grant numbers (BB/N002571/1, BB/R012679/1, BB/S013792/1, BBS/E/I/00007034, BBS/E/I/00007035, BBS/E/PI/230002B, BBS/E/PI/230002C, BBS/E/PI/23NB0003), Zoonoses and Emerging Livestock (ZELS) (BB/L018853/1 and BB/S013792/1), the GCRF One Health Poultry Hub (BB/S011269/1), UK-China-Philippines-Thailand Swine and Poultry Research Initiative (BB/R012679/1)</p></sec></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="FN2"><p id="P45"><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p id="P46">The authors declare they have no conflict of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Homme</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Easterday</surname><given-names>BC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Avian influenza virus infections.
