We present a scalable, bioinstructive platform based on polylactic acid microparticles with controlled dimpled surface features that direct mesenchymal stem cell differentiation through endogenous topography-mediated mechanotransduction, establishing a mechanistically validated, additive-free platform. These 3D topographical cues drive cytoskeletal reorganisation and induce osteogenesis via canonical Hedgehog signalling. RNA-Seq revealed early significant upregulation of cytoskeletal components and osteochondral transcription factors, including runt-related transcription factor 2 (<italic>RUNX2</italic>) and SRY-box transcription factor 9 (<italic>SOX9</italic>), followed by activation of the insulin growth factor-II pathway and osteogenic commitment. To demonstrate translational potential, two-photon polymerisation lithography was employed to engineer precisely-patterned 3D topographies, inducing graded GLI1 expression without added soluble cues. This establishes a modular, versatile platform for stem cell engineering, offering a topography-driven, non-genetic analogue to mechanogenetics with broad utility for regenerative medicine and human-relevant development of bone models.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2"><fig id="F8" position="anchor"><label>Graphical abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS207218-f008"/></fig>

Although it is well established that cell-matrix interactions can be used to direct cell response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], a translation-ready approach to unlocking the potential of cell-instructive topographies for modulation of cell signalling has not been realised. This challenge is particularly relevant for tissue engineering, where traditional approaches rely heavily on costly, externally supplemented soluble factors that often fail to recapitulate the complexity of native tissue formation and can mask intrinsic cellular responses. The development of an alternative strategy leveraging cell-instructive biophysical cues to harness the inherent mechanosensory capabilities of cells to guide osteogenesis will transform regenerative medicine by enabling precise control over tissue formation while reducing costs.</p><p id="P4">Engineering functional bone tissue demands biomaterials that can precisely direct stem cell fate and patterning. While biochemical factors, such as dexamethasone, are widely used to induce differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs), they introduce confounding effects, which may result in inconsistent cellular responses and unintended lineage outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. This includes potential activation of adipogenic pathways and upregulation of oxidative stress-related genes, compromising bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].</p><p id="P5">The hierarchical structure of bone’s extracellular matrix (ECM) has inspired scaffold design with customised topographies for bone regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Microtopographies, including pits, pillars, and gratings on titanium implants promote MSCs osteogenic differentiation in the presence of osteoinductive supplements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. However, titanium’s stiffness and highly adhesive surface chemistry often favours fibrogenesis over the desired osteogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Similarly, tailoring topographically-textured micropatterns on glass slides coated with fibronectin (FN) has also been reported to promote osteogenic differentiation in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], but FN suffers from low stability and degradation over seven days when subjected to mechanical forces such as laminar flow with shear stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], limiting long-term effectiveness in certain applications.</p><p id="P6">Recent advances in our understanding of mechanotransduction pathways have revealed promising alternatives to biochemical manipulation. The Hedgehog (HH) signalling pathway plays a pivotal role in the development of the skeletal system during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], and regulates bone remodelling throughout postnatal life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Critically, its mechano-responsiveness allows it to function as a central mediator of biomechanical cues, translating external mechanical forces into cellular response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. The core components of the HH signalling pathway consist of HH ligands, with Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) being the primary member, the twelve-pass transmembrane receptor, Patched1 (PTCH1), the seven-pass transmembrane signal transducer Smoothened (SMO), and the effector transcription factor Glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Dysregulation of the HH pathway has been reported in primary bone tumours such as osteosarcoma, and other musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], reinforcing its central role in skeletal homeostasis.</p><p id="P7">Topographically-textured 3D polymeric microparticles offer a promising platform for bone tissue engineering. mimicking native bone microarchitecture, while providing cell-instructive capabilities and a high surface area-to-volume ratio for large-scale cell expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Previous research has demonstrated that 3D convex curvature enhances hMSC osteogenic differentiation by modulating the cytoskeleton, altering the distribution of focal adhesion proteins such as vinculin (VCL), and reducing stress fibre formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. The osteoinductive impact of topographically-textured microparticles on murine mesenchymal progenitors is mediated by the SMO-dependent activation of GLI1, but this has not been assessed in relevant human primary cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P8">This study aims to leverage these cell-instructive microparticles to investigate mechanically guided osteogenesis in primary hMSCs, mapping the transcriptional landscape of hMSCs cultured on these osteoinductive substrates to identify key bone-specific gene signatures and downstream molecular pathways governing lineage commitment and driving osteogenesis without the need for confounding biochemical supplements. Additionally, a key innovation of this study is the application of two-photon polymerisation (2PP) lithography to engineer precisely controlled GLI1 expression gradients, achieving fine-tuned modulation of cellular responses via engineered high-resolution topographies. While 2PP has been used to fabricate surfaces with gradients in roughness or stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], its application to generate spatially defined gradients of cell-intrinsic signalling, such as GLI1 expression, represents a novel approach, bridging advanced fabrication techniques with the study of spatial regulation of cell fate. This study advances our understanding of how stem cells respond to 3D surface topography by showing that these surface-engineered microparticles with defined microfeatures can spatially modulate GLI1 expression in the absence of exogenous biochemical stimulation that may mask inherent cellular responses. Transcriptomic analysis further supports topography-induced activation of Hedgehog signalling and its role in directing early cell fate decisions. By leveraging high-resolution topographical cues to induce spatially patterned Hedgehog pathway activation, we present a versatile platform for probing the physical regulation of stem cell signalling and directing differentiation with microscale precision.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Design and fabrication of surface-engineered, cell-instructive microparticles</title><p id="P9">To develop a scalable, supplement-free bone regeneration platform, we optimised our previously developed osteoinductive system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] for systematic investigation of topography-mediated mechanotransduction. This platform leverages topographical surface patterning to modulate cell responses. We engineered this platform based on three translational design criteria: (1) Microparticles should present precise microtopographical cues to enable spatially resolved, mechanotransduction-driven cell fate decisions; (2) Surface architecture should be tailored to promote optimal cell attachment and additive-free osteogenic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], in line with efforts to eliminate the need for exogenous biochemical cues for reduced regulatory complexity; and (3) Injectable particle size, facilitating minimally-invasive delivery and scalability for clinical translation.</p><p id="P10">Smooth and topographically-textured (‘dimpled’) microparticles were fabricated using a solvent evaporation oil-in-water emulsion technique, incorporating phase separation of fusidic acid (FA) as a sacrificial component to achieve defined surface patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. During hardening, FA is excluded from the bulk of the microparticle, producing distinctive surface patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Distinct surface morphologies were achieved through modulation of processing parameters, including homogenisation speed, polymer concentration and polymer/FA ratio (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Microparticles of similar size ranges of 46.52 ± 6.81 μm for smooth and 45.79 ± 5.43 μm for dimpled have been demonstrated to be injectable through clinically-relevant 21G needles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. The average dimple size falls within the mean size range that we previously reported to induce osteogenesis in hMSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] and C3H10T1/2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Surface area measurements (m<sup>2</sup>/g) indicated minimal porosity in both designs, reflected by low micro-pore (V<sub>micro</sub>) and meso-pore (V<sub>meso</sub>) volumes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The successful fabrication of topographically-textured microparticles was confirmed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses, revealing well-defined surface patterns and feature dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Dynamic light scattering measurements demonstrated narrow size distributions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). To maintain consistency in surface area available for cell attachment across samples, microparticle quantities were calculated to ensure uniform cell seeding density across 2D and 3D cultures.</p><p id="P13">Polymer microparticles are valuable for biomanufacturing workflows that depend on effective cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. hMSCs cultured on microparticles demonstrated excellent cell attachment and viability in serum-reduced medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), with no significant differences observed between the two designs at any time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).

This prompted the investigation of cytoskeletal architecture. Dimpled surfaces induced unique cytoskeletal arrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) that suggest differential mechanotransduction signalling. Apparent focal adhesions, which reflect cell-extracellular matrix interactions and subsequent cytoskeletal reorganisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], were examined by co-staining for VCL with F-actin. Immunostaining revealed well-defined, streak-like focal adhesions at the leading edge and pronounced F-actin stress fibres in hMSCs cultured on planar 2D-cultured controls. In contrast, cells seeded on dimpled microparticles exhibited diffuse VCL localisation and poorly defined focal adhesion structures, indicating impaired focal adhesion assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Cells on smooth microparticles displayed mature focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), highlighting the distinct effects of surface topography on focal adhesion dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Transcriptome profiling identifies unique temporal transcriptional signatures of hMSCs cultured on dimpled 3D topographical features</title><p id="P15">While our previous work established the osteoinductive capacity of topographically-textured microparticles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] and the involvement of canonical HH signalling in this response in murine C3H10T1/2 cells, the underlying molecular mechanisms in human cells remained unexplored. Decoding how stem cells interpret osteoinductive physical cues at the transcriptional level will enable the design of bioinstructive systems that leverage mechanically-guided developmental mechanisms for regenerative and tissue engineering applications. To build on our findings, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was therefore performed to determine the genome-wide transcriptional changes induced by different microparticle designs. hMSCs from three independent donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) were seeded on smooth microparticles (serving as 3D topographical control) and two sets of dimpled microparticle cultures. On the following day, one set of dimpled samples was treated with KAAD-cyclopamine (a HH signalling inhibitor), generating three sample conditions: smooth microparticles, dimpled microparticles, and KAAD-cyclopamine-treated dimpled microparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Canonical HH signalling is initiated with the binding of SHH ligand to PTCH1, relieving the inhibition of the transmembrane protein SMO. The activation of SMO enables the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor GLI1, driving the transcription of HH target genes, such as <italic>RUNX2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Treatment with KAAD-cyclopamine (SMO antagonist) inactivates this pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). RNA-Seq was performed at two time points: day 3, capturing any HH signalling activation and early topographically-induced osteogenic commitment, and at day 14, to assess HH signalling and downstream pathways governing cellular adaptation to the microenvironment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed distinct clustering by topographical condition and time point. At day 3, hMSCs cultured on dimpled microparticles segregated clearly from both smooth and cyclopamine-treated dimpled cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). The overlap observed between smooth and cyclopamine-treated dimpled samples suggests strong similarity of their transcriptional profiles at this early time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), with only three genes being differentially expressed at day 3: Zinc finger protein 117 (<italic>ZNF117</italic>), poly(rc)-binding protein 1 (<italic>PCBP1</italic>), and thioredoxin domain containing 5 (<italic>TXNDC5</italic>). By day 14, cells cultured on dimpled microparticles formed distinct clusters relative to those on dimpled microparticles at day 3, indicating sustained transcriptional divergence driven by the dimpled topography. At day 14, only 0.43% of genes were differentially expressed between cells cultured on smooth microparticles and those on dimpled microparticle cultures treated with KAAD-cyclopamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To identify putative drivers of hMSC adaptation to topography, we examined the top 30 up- and down-regulated DEGs at day 3 and day 14 post-seeding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2 and S3</xref>, respectively). Early responses (day 3) were marked by upregulation of genes involved in cytoskeletal organisation, including tubulin alpha 3C (<italic>TUBA3C</italic>), and transcription factors linked to early osteoblastogenesis, such as GATA binding protein 4 (<italic>GATA4</italic>). By day 14, differentially expressed genes were increasingly associated with musculoskeletal tissue development and matrix remodelling, including sclerostin domain-containing 1 (<italic>SOSTDC1</italic>) and serpin family E member 2 (<italic>SERPINE2</italic>). Culture of primary hMSCs on dimpled microparticles resulted in 11979 genes (19.11%) at day 3 and 2701 genes (4.31%) at day 14 of all analysed genes (62700 genes) showing significant differential expression (with log<sub>2</sub> fold change &gt; 1 and <italic>p</italic><sub>adj</sub> &lt; 0.05) relative to culture on unpatterned smooth microparticles.</p><p id="P19">Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was conducted to identify biological processes (BP) that were enriched in cells cultured on dimpled versus smooth microparticles.

Several tubulin genes were upregulated, including tubulin alpha pseudogene 2 (<italic>TUBAP2</italic>) and <italic>TUBA3C</italic>, which encode microtubule structural components. The upregulation of components of the actin–myosin contractile apparatus, including Troponin T1 (<italic>TNNT1</italic>) and actin gamma 2, smooth muscle <italic>(ACTG2)</italic>, may reflect increased cytoskeletal tension in response to dimpled topography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. On the other hand, other ECM and cytoskeletal-associated genes, including <italic>FN1</italic>, ABI family member 3 binding protein (<italic>ABI3BP</italic>), and LIM domain and actin binding 1 (<italic>LIMA1</italic>) were downregulated. These elements play critical roles in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics by modulating focal adhesion and actin filament assembly in response to mechanical cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].

This reduction was to a level comparable to that observed in hMSCs cultured on smooth microparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). This was conducted using a DMSO-containing vehicle control, which had no appreciable effects on GLI1 levels.
