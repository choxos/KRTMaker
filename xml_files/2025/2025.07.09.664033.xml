Amino acids have diverse metabolic origins and intracellular requirements. Therefore, to understand the cellular amino acid economy we require a quantitative understanding of intracellular and extracellular their amounts, and how distinct amino acids change temporally during growth. Using the unicellular eukaryote, yeast, we establish a quantitative blueprint of the intracellular and extracellular amino acid economy, including the fluxes of production, secretion and consumption across different growth phases. Certain amino acids dominate the intracellular pool, and proportions of distinct amino acids continuously change during growth. The extracellular pool is notably distinct from the intracellular pool in terms of composition and dynamics. Only some public amino acids are subsequently consumed, while others are secreted in surplus of cellular demands. Five amino acids are intracellular and privatized, and continuously utilized to support diverse metabolism. Through this, we establish pairs of highly effective synthetic, exchange-based communities of public good auxotrophs. Our results suggest organizing frameworks addressing the dynamic intracellular and inter-cellular amino acid economy and its trade, and informs the rational engineering of syntrophic cell communities.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cells make, utilize and accumulate metabolic resources such as amino acids in substantial amounts, and these resources can also be secreted outside to be traded between cells. Enabled by such trade, cells assemble into syntrophic communities – as seen in diverse microbial systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), or between cells in tissues. The consequences of metabolic exchange between cells include distributed metabolic functions between cell groups, divided metabolic labor, increased metabolic productivity, or reduced biosynthetic load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). This suggests that by rationally manipulating the exchange of amino acids, it may be possible to design engineered cells that assemble and form exchange-based consortia, or can support complex biosynthesis. Through division of labor, cells create metabolic efficiencies between each other. This is commonly observed in microbial communities, which host auxotrophic cells that rely on metabolites produced by other cells, creating exchange based syntrophic consortia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). A spectacular extreme example in nature are aphid insect-bacterial endosymbionts, who survive based on extensive amino acid trade and associated metabolic optimizations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Metabolic trade also occurs in colonies of prototrophic cells (which can biosynthesize their own metabolites), through the self-organization of cells into groups with division of labor to share resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Thus, building metabolic efficiencies based on biochemical and thermodynamic constraints can drive the assembly of cell communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). However, at a more fundamental level, the biochemical constraints that determine which metabolic resources are exchanged between cells, and how much cells prioritize major resources such as amino acids remain poorly understood.</p><p id="P3">Amino acids are very commonly exchanged between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). But amino acids are themselves not homogeneous entities. Instead, they are chemically, metabolically and functionally diverse, have varying individual cellular requirements, and are present in distinct intracellular amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Cells also maintain different extents of strategic amino acid reserves for metabolic and translational requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Indeed, cells function as demand-driven economies with respect to different amino acids – and the net demand for each amino acid shapes hierarchies or priorities of amino acid resource allocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). In order for a resource to be traded, sufficient quantities need to be available in excess of demand. The amounts of these amino acids will inherently be a function of their cycles of production – consumption – secretion. Therefore, in order to build a first-principles basis of understanding the cellular amino acid economy and trade, we require quantitative estimates of the amounts of intracellular amino acids in the context of extracellular pools, and how these pools change temporally across the growth phases of a cell. This knowledge can also aid in designing biosynthetic processes in engineered cells to produce amino acid derived molecules. However, there is limited quantitative information available for temporal changes in amino acid production, consumption and secretion across different phases of cell growth, even for prototrophic cells that make their own amino acids from carbon and nitrogen precursors.</p><p id="P4">In this study, we utilized the eukaryotic model cell <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, which is prototrophic for the biosynthesis of all amino acids, to quantitatively determine intracellular and extracellular amino acid amounts across a 24-hour growth phase. Estimates of biosynthetic flux, along with absolute quantification of amino acids revealed that cells maintain distinct amounts and magnitudes of intracellular and extracellular amino acids that do not correlate with each other in abundance, demand or hierarchies of utilization. Specific amino acids are strictly privatized and not secreted to the external medium, and these privatized amino acids are continuously required to support critical intracellular metabolic processes. A group of amino acids are secreted as public goods into the extracellular environment, only some of which are subsequently taken up and utilized to support metabolism of the producing cell. This quantitative blueprint of public and private good amino acids enabled the rational design of paired communities of public good amino acid auxotrophs, based on the amounts of amino acids exchanged. Pairs of auxotrophs of surplus public good amino acids established stable, syntrophic communities that grow robustly together. Our data therefore reveal quantitative hierarchies of cellular amino acid production, accumulation and secretion, with implications for the design of synthetic consortia for metabolic engineering applications.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>High amino acid production is limited to the early phase of exponential growth</title><p id="P5">The intracellular amounts of amino acids reflect the net amount of production, versus consumption and secretion of amino acids. Understanding this biosynthesis– secretion – consumption cycle across cell growth, and as cells enter stationary phase is a fundamental question in quantitative cellular physiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). However, even in laboratory based model microbial culture settings, we have a limited understanding of amino acid production-secretion-consumption amounts and temporal changes therein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). We therefore addressed this question, using prototrophic yeast cells grown in defined minimal medium without supplemented amino acids. In this condition, prototrophic yeast carry out <italic>de-novo</italic> biosynthesis of all amino acids, thereby allowing a quantitative assessment of amino acids over time, across phases of growth. In this study, we use a robust, prototrophic yeast strain (CEN.PK background), growing in batch cultures in synthetic, minimal medium with 110 mM glucose and ~35 mM ammonium sulfate as sole carbon and nitrogen sources respectively in all experiments.</p><p id="P6">Our first step was to quantify the changes in amino acid biosynthetic flux during different phases of cell growth. For this, we designed experiments to estimate amino acid biosynthetic flux over a 24-hour period of cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). To quantitatively assess the relative rate of amino acid biosynthetic flux over this 24-hour window, we designed a metabolic flux experiment, where employed a short pulse of stable-isotope labelled nitrogen precursors at the indicated time point, followed by assessing the relative nitrogen label incorporation into newly synthesized amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). For this, <sup>15</sup>N-labeled ammonium sulfate was pulsed briefly into cells (at the indicated time points), cells were collected, and the incorporation of <sup>15</sup>N into newly synthesized amino acids was estimated by quantitative, targeted LC-MS/MS. This allowed us to quantify and compare relative amino acid biosynthetic fluxes at different time points, viz. 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We observed highest amino acid biosynthetic flux during the first 2-4 hours of cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), which declines substantially after ~12 hours of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>. These data establish that cells in logarithmic phase of growth have highest amino acid biosynthesis.</p><p id="P7">We also assessed how this actual amino acid biosynthetic flux was reflected at the level of amino acid biosynthetic gene expression. The expression of amino acid biosynthetic genes are commonly used as a proxy to indicate amino acid biosynthesis, although this cannot distinguish reduced substrate availability, or starvation based feedback responses where amino acid biosynthetic genes can increase. To assess amino acid biosynthetic gene expression, we used a well-established luciferase based reporter for amino acid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), based on the activity of the amino acid master-regulating transcription factor Gcn4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This reporter activity was measured at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours, and it revealed two distinct waves of expression of amino acid biosynthetic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Reporter activity was highest during the early growth phase (2 hours), decreased thereafter, and a second burst of activity followed post ~12 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). However, as observed earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), amino acid biosynthetic flux is high only in the early (2-4 hr) periods of growth, and is low at ~12 hours. Therefore, the second wave of transcription would be consistent with a starvation response, where cells sense reductions in actual amino acid biosynthetic flux as nutrients deplete, and upregulate transcriptional programs for amino acid biosynthetic genes.</p><p id="P8">Collectively, these data comprehensively establish the temporal dynamics of amino acid production, highlighting that the majority of biosynthesis is restricted to early phases of growth.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Amounts and hierarchies of intracellular and extracellular amino acids are distinct and uncorrelated</title><p id="P9">Given the temporal restriction of amino acid biosynthesis, we next asked what are the intracellular and extracellular amino acid concentrations during different growth phases. This is an important, quantitative question asking how much the amounts differ for distinct amino acids. Thereby, this can address what the intracellular demand versus production of different amino acids are, and identify which amino acids might be shared in the external environment. We used quantitative, targeted LC-MS/MS approaches to determine absolute intracellular amino acid amounts across these (2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hour) phases of growth, and estimated the per cell concentration based on cell number and volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) (also see materials and methods for calculations). Additionally, the range of intracellular amino acid amounts of different amino acids at 4 hours of growth (when cells are in log-phase growth) are illustrated as a heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), highlighting the large, order-of-magnitude differences in amounts of different amino acids. The absolute intracellular amino acid concentrations differed for the most abundant to least abundant amino acids by ~four orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Consistent with studies from bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), and recent predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) the most abundant amino acids were glutamate, glutamine, alanine and aspartic acid, while methionine was among the lowest across different phases of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Note: cysteine was not quantified across these times due to its redox sensitivity. However in similar media conditions cysteine concentration are in the high nM range, lower than methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Interestingly, over this temporal window the absolute intracellular concentrations of amino acids, as well as relative proportions of each amino acid as a fraction of total amino acids inside a cell change markedly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Glutamate and glutamine remain the most abundant intracellular amino acids across this time-window, but their amounts decrease steadily. Some amino acids, notably aspartate, exhibited a decline across the growth phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Certain other amino acids, such as histidine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, asparagine, lysine, and the branched chain amino acids, accumulated throughout growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), while amino acids like proline initially accumulated but later decreased. Interestingly, intracellular arginine levels were maintained over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). A few amino acids, particularly phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, valine, leucine/isoleucine, and asparagine substantially increased after 12 hours of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, Fig. S1).</p><p id="P10">These results suggest that (i) many amino acids are produced and secreted in amounts exceeding cellular demand, and (ii) the relative or proportional pools of distinct amino acids within a cell are not constant, but vary depending on the growth state of the cell. Therefore, this immediately raises the question on the nature of the extracellular amino acid environment across this temporal window, in order to understand which amino acids are secreted and consumed by cells. We therefore quantified absolute amounts of extracellular amino acids from the culture supernatant (measured in picomolar amounts in 30 mL of liquid culture), across growth phases. Amino acids were arranged in groups from the most to the least abundant after 4 hours of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, only a group of amino acids were present at significant amounts in the extracellular medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Similar to intracellular trends, glutamine and glutamate were the most abundant extracellular amino acids, followed by alanine. Further, proline, branched chain amino acids, and threonine were present in substantial amounts in the extracellular medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, serine, asparagine, threonine, and leucine/isoleucine showed a consistent increase in the extracellular environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), also consistent with their intracellular accumulation patterns (Fig. S1). Cells therefore secrete significant amounts of select amino acids during logarithmic growth, when nutrient availability is high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Additionally, histidine, arginine, phenylalanine, and serine displayed minor variations in their extracellular concentrations, while having considerable intracellular concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>; S2).</p><p id="P11">In contrast however, some amino acids, particularly histidine, arginine, aspartic acid, methionine, and lysine were present in very low or undetectable amounts in the extracellular medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, 2E</xref> &amp; S2, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). These results underscore that the extracellular amino acid environment is not homogeneous throughout growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Furthermore, over time the levels of a subset of extracellular amino acids decrease, and the relative proportion of extracellular amino acids changed accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). This suggests phases of subsequent reuptake of these select amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, Fig. S2). Two important conclusions can be drawn. First, the extracellular environment does not reflect the intracellular amino acid environment – either in terms of the absolute amounts of distinct amino acids, or in terms of the relative proportion of availability of each amino acid. Importantly, some amino acids, which may be fairly abundant inside the cell, are almost unavailable outside. Second, note that while many of the abundantly secreted amino acids have high biosynthetic costs (proline, the branched chain amino acids, and threonine), they all have fairly modest demand within growing cells, as extensively shown earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). This is further discussed later in the manuscript. This reiterates that demand-driven criteria drive the cellular amino acid economy, and prioritizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We synthesize this qualitative relationship between intracellular and extracellular amino acids, and visually illustrate this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref> (reflecting twelve hours of growth). From this, we can observe that only a few amino acids show similar patterns in their intracellular and extracellular amounts, while others remain uncorrelated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Of note, arginine, lysine, histidine, and aspartic acid are abundant intracellular amino acids, but are low/undetectable in the extracellular environment, revealing that these amino acids are not secreted in substantial amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). In contrast, a subset of amino acids –phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine, leucine/isoleucine, proline, threonine and asparagine substantially accumulate in the extracellular environment over time. Note that all these amino acids have varying costs of synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), and no association can therefore be made with the costs incurred in making these molecules. However, all of these amino acids have relatively low cellular demand, and production can therefore exceed cellular requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Collectively, these results reveal how the dynamic extracellular amino acid environment differs strikingly from the intracellular amino acid environment.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Distinct amino acids function as a private, public or surplus goods</title><p id="P13">These data suggest that instead of forming homogeneous pools, the different amino acids can be divided broadly into two categories: (i) as a private good, and (ii) two types of public goods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). In economic terms, public goods are resources that are available to all members of a population, while private goods are those that are exclusively used only by the producing individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). For cells, this means that the amino acids that accumulate in the extracellular environment are public goods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), while those that are restricted within the intracellular environment are privatized goods. A group of amino acids are present in low/undetectable amounts in the extracellular medium, despite being present at considerable intracellular amounts, indicating privatization of these metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This set of privatized amino acids comprised of aspartic acid, lysine, arginine, histidine, and methionine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Contrastingly, the remaining amino acids fell into two main types of public goods – those that accumulate/do not decrease in the extracellular environment over time, and others that accumulate at earlier time points but subsequently deplete over time, thus suggesting possible uptake and utilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Asparagine, threonine, leucine/isoleucine, tyrosine substantially increased in the extracellular medium (as well as intracellularly), indicating that these amino acids are public goods (surplus). Of the other amino acids, alanine and glutamine initially accumulate in the extracellular medium, but subsequently decline, suggesting later demand and utilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). These are classified as public goods (consumed). Similar trends (at lower concentrations) can be observed for phenylalanine, proline, tryptophan, glutamine, alanine and valine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Therefore, prototrophic yeast cells clearly treat distinct amino acids differently –as private goods, public good-surplus, and public good-consumed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The private or public nature of the amino acid can therefore be unambiguously defined by the extracellular amounts alone.</p><p id="P14">We also assessed the biosynthetic costs of the privatized goods (Fig. S3), based on detailed estimates made earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). However, the privatized amino acids did not associate with high costs –aspartic acid, arginine and lysine are amino acids with relatively low costs, methionine has an intermediate cost of synthesis, while histidine has high biosynthetic costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) (Fig. S3). In contrast, when assessed based on their cellular demand for multiple processes, the privatized amino acids all had continuous, changing, and high demands for multiple, distinct outputs as shown earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), as also as illustrated in Fig. S3 which shows demand quantifications and usage respectively. Notably, all privatized amino acids have critical, continuous usage requirements in cells across stages of growth. Aspartate is an important, metabolically flexible precursor that fuels the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and enables gluconeogenesis via its conversion to oxaloacetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, S3), and is essential for nucleotide synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), making it metabolically useful under diverse nutrient environments. Arginine has high, continuous demand for polyamine synthesis, and ribosome biogenesis, particularly during metabolic transitions (Fig. S3). Histidine is a precursor in the tetrahydrofolate cycle, plays a role in metal chelation, and also maintains cellular buffering (Fig. S3), and therefore is continuously required. Methionine is the precursor for S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) and is continuously fluxed to SAM biosynthesis required for most biological methylation, SAH, polyamine synthesis, and the folate cycle (Fig. S3), making it a continuously utilized metabolite. Thus, the privatized amino acids are all continuously allocated towards multifaceted metabolic processes that the cell requires continuously (Fig. S3).</p><p id="P15">To experimentally assess the usage of privatized amino acids, we used aspartate as an example of a resource with diverse allocations at different times. For this, we carried out stable isotope-based label-incorporation experiments to estimate relative aspartate allocations during the course of growth, towards the TCA cycle or gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). We monitored label incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C4-aspartate pulsed during early (4 hours) or late (24 hours) growth towards the TCA or gluconeogenesis at different phases of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). At 4 hours, the labelled <sup>13</sup>C<sub>4</sub>-aspartate was predominantly incorporated into the intermediates of the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, light green box). This indicates that aspartate is continuously converted to oxaloacetate and supports TCA activity during the exponential growth phase. In contrast, at 24 hours, carbon from aspartate was incorporated substantially into gluconeogenesis intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, grey box) including UDP-Glc, PEP, G-3-P, GDP-Man, R-5-P, 3PG, and S-7-P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). These data demonstrate the continuous, changing use of aspartate to sustain diverse cellular needs, consistent with a plausible requirement to privatize it.</p><p id="P16">A subset of publicly accumulated amino acids decreased in the extracellular environment after ~24 hours (late growth). These suggest that cells excrete these as public goods, but might uptake and utilize them later, as the external environment changes. It is experimentally prohibitive to demonstrate this for each amino acid. However, we use alanine as an example to experimentally test this. Alanine accumulates in the extracellular medium at early time points, but start to decrease after 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Alanine is synthesized from pyruvate (from glucose metabolism), and alanine is catabolized to pyruvate, which can subsequently re-enter central carbon metabolism. To assess the use of alanine as an example of a late-utilized public good, we added a pulse of stable isotope labelled (d4-alanine) alanine, and estimated (uptake and utilization) relative flux towards pyruvate at 4 hours and 24 hours. Pyruvate formation from alanine was substantially higher at 24 hours compared to 4 hours, indicating robust uptake and utilization of alanine for central carbon metabolism after 24 hours of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). These findings illustrate how secreted alanine functions as a utilized public good, to support central carbon metabolism during late growth phases.</p><p id="P17">Collectively, our data establish that prototrophic cells produce and secrete select amino acids in excess, as public goods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Some of these public goods are subsequently taken up and utilized or exchange by the cells, based on subsequent metabolic requirements. Contrastingly, tightly privatized amino acids are restricted to the intracellular environment, and can be continuously used for multiple, changing resource allocations.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Cells secrete sufficient excess of amino acids to support growth of public good auxotrophs</title><p id="P18">Our data lead to the hypothesis that cells easily obtain public good amino acids from the external environment, and therefore auxotrophs of these amino acids would sustain their requirements exclusively from this external source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). As a corollary, our data directly predicts that auxotrophs of private good amino acids would not sustain growth in spent medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). We therefore investigated if the secreted amino acids in spent media could sustain the growth of auxotrophic strains of public or private good amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), using viable auxotrophs that could be generated (Fig. S4). The auxotrophic strains of public goods included <italic>bat1Δ/bat2Δ</italic> (auxotrophic for all branched chain amino acids), <italic>leu2Δ/bat1Δ</italic> (also auxotroph for all branched chain amino acids), <italic>trp</italic>5<italic>Δ</italic> (tryptophan auxotroph), while the private good auxotrophs included <italic>met6Δ</italic> (methionine), <italic>lys1Δ</italic> (lysine), <italic>his3Δ</italic> (histidine) auxotrophs (Fig. S4). To experimentally test this, we grew wild-type cells in synthetic minimal medium for 24 hours, and collected the culture supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). To this culture supernatant, we added only glucose and ammonium salts to make conditioned supernatant, and then assessed the growth of different auxotrophic strains in conditioned supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). For the public good auxotrophic strains, we assessed the growth of <italic>bat1Δ/bat2Δ, leu2Δ/bat1Δ</italic>, and <italic>trp5Δ</italic> cells in conditioned spent medium, including positive controls where the respective auxotrophic amino acids were supplemented at 2mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Notably, the conditioned supernatant supported the growth of these public good auxotrophic strains, at times as effectively as when these cells were grown in conditioned supernatant supplemented with excess of the specific amino acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). These findings reveal that the public good amino acids are produced/secreted in sufficient amounts to satisfy the demands and support the effective growth of their respective auxotrophic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). This further suggests that these amino acids are made by cells in amounts exceeding their own demands. We next assessed the growth of private good auxotrophs (<italic>met6Δ, lys1Δ, his3</italic>Δ) in conditioned supernatant. In contrast to the public good amino acid auxotrophs, the private good amino acid auxotrophic strains showed negligible growth in conditioned supernatant, in the absence of exogenously supplementing these respective amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). This demonstrates that <italic>met6Δ, lys1Δ</italic>, and <italic>his3Δ</italic> cannot obtain sufficient amounts of these respective amino acids from the spent medium to sustain growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Finally, to determine the actual utilization of these public amino acids by their auxotrophs, we assessed the relative levels of specific amino acids (tryptophan, leucine/isoleucine, and valine) in conditioned supernatant, after the growth of the indicated public good auxotrophic strain in this medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). After 24 hours of growth of the respective auxotrophic strain in conditioned supernatant, tryptophan, leucine/isoleucine, and valine levels significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). This indicated that substantial amounts of these amino acids are consumed from the extracellular medium by the respective auxotrophic strains, and reiterates that these amino acids were produced in sufficient amounts by wild-type cells to satisfy the demand requirements of auxotrophic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Collectively, these findings reveal that auxotrophic yeast cells can effectively consume/utilize only public good amino acids from the spent media, to meet their growth requirements.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Growth of synthetic coculture communities of public-public and public-private good auxotrophs</title><p id="P20">Exchange based auxotrophic communities can form in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), yet underlying metabolic rules driving these interactions are unresolved. In particular, can pairs of auxotrophs of surplus public goods establish effective communities, based on the nature of the auxotrophy and the type of amino acid exchanged? Will auxotrophs of public good amino acids therefore form effective, mutual exchange-based communities when paired? Our data indicate that public good auxotrophs grow effectively by using the corresponding amino acid obtained solely from spent medium of prototrophic cells. We therefore asked if effective synthetic communities based on complementary amino acid exchange could be created, using paired co-cultures of public good-public good, or public good-private good auxotrophic strains. To address this, we curated pairs of public good auxotrophs, as well as pairs of public good-private good auxotrophs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). We then inoculated each paired combination, with 50:50 ratios of each strain in low cell density in conditioned supernatant, and allowed these cells to grow together in this medium. The synthetic communities of auxotrophic-pairs used were: public good -public good auxotrophs (<italic>bat1Δ/bat2Δ</italic> + <italic>trp</italic>5Δ, and <italic>bat1</italic>Δ/<italic>leu</italic>2Δ + <italic>trp</italic>5Δ), and public good-private good auxotrophs (<italic>bat</italic>1/<italic>bat</italic>2Δ + <italic>met</italic>6Δ, and <italic>bat</italic>1Δ/<italic>leu</italic>2Δ + <italic>lys</italic>1Δ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). We monitored the fractional composition (of each auxotroph) over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref> and C). In order to accurately estimate the fraction of each auxotroph, each strain was engineered with a constitutive, fluorescent protein-label (mCherry or mNeonGreen) for all the public and private good auxotrophic strains, in the indicated combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref> and C). For all public good-public good auxotrophic pairs of co-cultures, we observed robust growth and a stable population of each strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). For each of these pairs tested, a constant ratio of each genotype was maintained over 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). In contrast, for public good-private good auxotrophic co-culture pairs, the fractional composition of each strain rapidly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). The public good auxotrophic strains utilized the conditioned supernatant and grew, increasing in fractional composition, while private auxotrophic strains failed to thrive in the co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), with their relative population abundance decreasing to &lt;5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P21">We next asked if pairing public good-public good auxotrophs in co-cultures led to a gain in cell numbers and overall growth that potentially comes from amino acid exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). We also asked if the growth can be explained by the conditioned supernatant alone, or indicated reliance on secreted amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). For this, we estimated cell numbers of the respective paired co-culture over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). We observed that the public good-public good auxotrophic pairs grew robustly, reaching significantly higher total biomass in 24 and 48 hours of co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). These data indicate that co-operative amino acid exchange between the public good-public good auxotrophs leads to a significant increase in population size and biomass, unlike with public-private co-cultures that rely exclusively on available amino acids in conditioned supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). The public good-public good auxotroph co-cultures easily outperform public-private co-cultures in biomass formation, through a robust exchange of public goods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Collectively, these data underscore the importance of identifying public good amino acids and their auxotrophs, through which exchange based communities can be established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Public good amino acids, produced in excess, are highly effective in supporting the growth of their auxotrophs, and can be used by cells to form effective, exchange based synthetic communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">In this study, we elucidate the quantitative amounts, and temporal dynamics of the formation, secretion and consumption of amino acids during yeast cell growth. We identified phases of high amino acid biosynthesis, which are restricted to the early phase of cell growth in batch culture, and gene expression programs induced at later time points will reflect a starvation response by cells attempting to restore biosynthetic flux without being able to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). Subsequently, we built a quantitative blueprint of intracellular amino acid amounts and dynamics, identifying that the relative proportions of amino acids change substantially over different phases of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>). Interestingly, the extracellular environment was entirely distinct from the intracellular pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Through this, we identified the amino acids that are tightly privatized by cells, versus those that are publicly exchanged. Interestingly, the privatized amino acids are required for continuous, distinct metabolic and growth needs in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). The public good amino acids themselves form two groups – those that are produced and secreted in surplus, and those that are produced in surplus initially but are later consumed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). From these data, we find that auxotrophs of public goods can grow effectively using resources exclusively obtained from their extracellular environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). These public good auxotrophs are also ideally suited to form stable, exchange-based synthetic communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Collectively, we can now build a quantitative blueprint of the hierarchies in a cellular amino acid economy, built on biosynthesis, secretion and consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). The highlight is direct evidence for distinct prioritizations of privatized amino acids, based on continuous cellular needs, as well as a truly dynamic intracellular amino acid economy that has been largely underappreciated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Even in versatile laboratory models or industrially important cells like yeast or <italic>E. coli</italic>, our understanding of the intracellular and extracellular amino acid economy is sparse. Current knowledge is limited to static snapshots of certain intracellular or extracellular amino acids or other metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). It is clear that cells have dramatically different amounts of individual amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), or maintain distinct amino acid reserves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Further, the amino acid economy is shaped not by the metabolic cost of an individual amino acid, but instead by total demand for that amino acid coupled with the ease of synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). This makes the amino acid economy especially dynamic and constantly changing in a growing cell. The extent and nature of this dynamic cellular economy is a feature of both the inherent constraints imposed by growth, as well as the metabolic flexibility of that cell. In light of our findings, made with reductionist approaches in yeast, it is interesting to ask what the range and limits could be for amino acid amounts inside different types of cells, and in what contexts would changes in one amino acid result in the induction or reduction of another amino acid.</p><p id="P25">Cooperative interactions based on syntrophic metabolic exchange and cross feeding enable groups of cells to build metabolic efficiencies, drive auxotrophic cell populations towards new metabolic imbalances and interactions, or even improve lifespan and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Designing and engineering synthetic communities based on syntrophic exchange is an area of considerable interest, for the obvious potential it holds for biotechnological applications. Yet many efforts to design exchange based microbial consortia for biotransformations fall short of meeting expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), in part due to challenges in quantitatively untangling metabolic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). In yeast, combinatorial efforts, or selection and adaptation, have been used to build exchange based communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). In contrast, our study offers a bottom up approach towards building effective microbial consortia based on metabolic exchange, which would require a quantitative understanding of the metabolite economy – based the production, secretion or consumption of this metabolite, or its intermediate. This is critical in the context of the cellular amino acid economy, where identifying supply versus demand constraints for distinct amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) will define metabolic frameworks that determine which amino acids or their intermediates might be effectively exchanged, or can build exchange-based communities. Context specific, quantitative insights into their production, secretion, consumption cycles can therefore identify resource-bottlenecks, and suggest ways to overcome these bottlenecks. This quantitative approach towards defining the amino acid economy will broaden our understanding of resource allocation strategies within and between cells, and can inform the rational design of metabolically engineered cell consortia as factories.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Yeast growth and media conditions</title><p id="P26">A prototrophic, haploid (CEN.PK mat a) strain of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>) was used in all the experiments, and was maintained in YPD medium containing yeast extract (1%), peptone (2%), glucose (2%) and agar (2%).

Absolute concentrations of extracellular amino acids (accumulated in the medium) across the indicated times of growth. Measurements were made in 30 ml of culture medium volume. The extracellular amino acids are arranged from the most to least abundant at the indicated time points. Note that while glutamate and glutamine remain the most abundant extracellular amino acids, several other amino acids in the extracellular environment are present at amounts that do not correlate with their intracellular amounts (panel 1B). Some amino acids are not detectable or present at very small amounts in the extracellular environment. N=3, mean ± SD (biological replicates).

A schematic illustration showing relative amounts and proportions of intracellular and extracellular amino acids, observed after twelve hours of cell growth in minimal medium. Many amino acids are present in abundance in both the intracellular and extracellular environments, while some others (Asp, Met, Arg, Lys, His) are present in distinct concentrations inside a cell, but are almost entirely absent in the extracellular environment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS207245-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Distinct amino acids function as a private, public or surplus goods</title><p>(A) Classification of amino acids as private or public goods based on extracellular amounts and availability. Amino acids can be classified as private goods, or two types of public goods (surplus or consumed) based on extracellular availability over time. The measured extracellular pool of the respective amino acid is an indication of the balance of production and reuptake/consumption of the same. Privatized amino acids are not present in significant amounts in the extracellular culture medium. Surplus public goods will continuously accumulate in the extracellular culture medium over time, while consumed public goods will initially accumulate in the extracellular medium and subsequently decrease in abundance.</p><p>(B) Categorization of individual amino acids as private or public goods. This grouping of amino acids is based extracellular availability, as well as changes in the extracellular amounts temporally. Private good amino acids include Asp, Met, His, Arg, Lys – and are shaded in light amber area. These are present in very low amounts in the extracellular medium. Amino acids that classify as public goods – consumed include Ala, Gln, Pro, Phe, Trp, Val. These first accumulate and then decrease over time in the extracellular medium. Public goods-surplus include Ser, Asp, Tyr, Leu/Ile, Thr. These increase/remain high in the extracellular medium. Also see Fig. S3 for privatized amino acids.</p><p>(C) Demonstration of distinct allocations of a private good (aspartate) over time: Experimental design to track the metabolic fates of aspartate at different times, using a <sup>13</sup>C<sub>4</sub>-aspartate pulse-label to monitoring incorporation into distinct branches of carbon metabolism – the TCA cycle or gluconeogenesis. Aspartate converts to oxaloacetate, and the carbon from aspartate subsequently can be tracked as it incorporates into TCA cycle or gluconeogenic intermediates by targeted LC-MS/MS. The relative utilization of aspartate as a carbon donor for intermediary metabolites in the TCA cycle or gluconeogenesis at two different times of cell growth was estimated. The grey shaded box is for gluconeogenesis intermediates, and the green shaded box is for the TCA cycle, comparing cells after 4hr or 24hr of batch culture growth. Note that in 4 hr, cells primarily use oxaloacetate from aspartate for the TCA intermediates, and after 24hr mainly use aspartate for gluconeogenesis. Data are from three biologically independent experiments (n=3), shown as mean ± SD. Also see Fig. S3.</p><p>(D) Demonstration of the use of a public good (alanine) from the extracellular medium after 24 hours: Left inset – a schematic showing how a utilized public good will function. Right - Relative consumption of exogenously provided alanine via conversion to pyruvate. As shown in the experimental design (top), cells at 4hr and 24hr of growth were spiked with d<sub>4</sub>-alanine, and the relative d<sub>4</sub>-label conversion into pyruvate was estimated using targeted LC-MS/MS. Bar plot was shown relative levels of d<sub>4</sub>-pyruvate. The pyruvate label coming from alanine considerably increases after 24hr. Data are from three biologically independent experiments (n=3), shown as mean ± SD, *p&lt;0.05, ***p&lt;0.0001 (student’s t-test).
