The disease displays remarkable clinical heterogeneity ranging from indolent to rapidly progressive disease with irreversible organ damage and subsequent mortality. Clinical management of SSc is complicated by the lack of effective treatments and variation in disease progression, which is difficult to predict<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, identification of pathogenic mechanisms driving disease may improve patient stratification and enable the development of targeted treatment strategies.</p><p id="P6">Like many other autoimmune diseases, SSc is hallmarked by a break in B cell tolerance towards nuclear proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Autoantibodies targeting the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) are observed in a subset of SSc patients and associate with diffuse cutaneous SSc, a distinct clinical phenotype with the highest mortality among the rheumatic diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Specifically, anti-topoisomerase 1 autoantibodies (ATAs) associate with progressive lung and skin fibrosis and early death, although not all ATA-positive patients show this progressive course of disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Recently, we could associate measures reflective of an active ATA B cell response to disease progression in ATA<sup>+</sup> SSc patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Specifically, ATA-secreting B cells were found in the circulation of SSc patients and their presence associated with the presence and severity of pulmonary fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Also, the presence of ATA-IgM was predictive of disease progression in the early stages of disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that activated, autoreactive ATA B cells might contribute directly to processes driving fibrosis. This notion is further supported by the beneficial effects of B cell-targeting therapies in SSc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which ATA B cells could contribute to disease remain unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. ATA pathogenicity has been debated, with the hypothesis that ATAs directly activate fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. However, whether this affects disease <italic>in vivo</italic> is unclear, primarily because ATA can also be present in indolent disease. ATA B cells, on the other hand, might contribute to disease by the production of cytokines and stimulation of T cells through antigen presentation and co-stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">A crucial prerequisite for B cell activation is the recognition of antigen by B cell receptors (BCR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The same holds for antibody-mediated effector functions which require antibody-binding to cognate antigens. Epitope structure and conformation can determine and modulate these interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. TOP1 is a DNA-binding nuclear protein which unwinds negatively supercoiled DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. During its enzymatic cycle, TOP1 covalently binds DNA to form a TOP1-DNA cleavage complex (TOP1cc) which allows the passing of the other DNA strand through the single-stranded break<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. TOP1cc is a transient complex under physiological conditions, but stable TOP1cc can be formed if DNA contains lesions, which can occur during cell death induced under inflammatory conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Binding of antigen to nucleic acids, a common property among many nuclear antigens targeted in autoimmune diseases, can potentiate antibody effector functions and B cell activation through co-engagement of innate Toll-like receptors with Fc receptors or the BCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Whether TOP1 as SSc autoantigen binds DNA, and how TOP1 and TOP1cc are recognized by human ATAs, warrants detailed analyses to better understand the antigenicity of TOP1 in SSc pathogenesis.</p><p id="P8">To this end, we set out to determine the molecular and functional characteristics of the interaction between ATAs and TOP1. We generated patient-derived monoclonal ATAs (ATA mAbs) enabling us to study the effect of DNA binding by TOP1 on the interaction with ATAs. We found remarkable heterogeneity in the recognition of TOP1 and TOP1cc among ATA mAbs and ATA in plasma. This heterogeneity affected antibody functionality and likely impacts on disease-relevant processes in progressive SSc. Together, these findings contribute to our understanding of disease variability in ATA<sup>+</sup> SSc.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P9">The experimental procedures for the recombinant production and purification of human TOP1, the generation of patient-derived ATA mAbs, gel electrophoresis, western blotting, cross-inhibition ELISA with ATA mAbs, mass photometry and TOP1-mediated DNA relaxation assay are provided in detail in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary methods</xref> section.</p><sec id="S7"><title>Patients and healthy individuals</title><p id="P10">Peripheral blood was obtained from ATA<sup>+</sup> and anti-centromere protein B autoantibody<sup>+</sup> (ACA<sup>+</sup>) SSc patients visiting the outpatient clinic of the Department of Rheumatology at Leiden University Medical Center.

B cells from peripheral blood of the patient were single cell sorted based on their reactivity towards TOP1 conjugated to Alexa Fluor™ 647 and phycoerythrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). These sorted cells were subsequently differentiated towards antibody-secreting cells in culture. Secreted antibodies could be detected in a fraction of the culture supernatants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1A-C</xref>). By analyzing the reactivity of the secreted antibodies towards human TOP1, we identified several TOP1-reactive clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-D</xref>). BCR sequences were determined from three of these clones (termed 2F8, 7G6 and 9D11; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) and expressed recombinantly as IgG1 mAbs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

TOP1 binding by ATA-IgG 2F8 was stronger compared to ATA-IgGs 7G6 and 9D11.

To study the effect of DNA binding on the recognition of TOP1 by the ATA mAbs, we next compared mAb reactivity towards TOP1 and TOP1cc. TOP1cc was formed using a suicide substrate, a double-stranded DNA ligand which covalently and irreversibly binds to TOP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. This binding results in a size shift which can be visualized by gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). By coating of either antigen on an ELISA plate, the recognition of TOP1 and TOP1cc by the ATA mAbs could be compared. ATA mAb 2F8 recognized TOP1 and TOP1cc to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>). In contrast, ATA mAbs 7G6 and 9D11 recognized TOP1cc with higher relative avidity than TOP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>). None of the mAbs reacted to suicide substrate alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2A</xref>). To further substantiate the differential binding of ATA to TOP1 and TOP1cc, we measured the reactivity towards either antigen by IgG in culture supernatants of 13 additional, single-cell sorted TOP1-reactive B cell clones. Only 3 of the 13 clones recognized TOP1 and TOP1cc to a similar extent, whereas the other 10 clones showed enhanced recognition of TOP1cc as compared to TOP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Importantly, we noted a strong variation between clones as to the extent to which TOP1cc was differentially recognized.</p><p id="P20">We next analyzed the differential binding under native conditions in solution to exclude that immobilization of either protein to the ELISA plate would have caused the observed effects. We employed mass photometry to determine the binding stoichiometry of the ATA mAbs to TOP1 and TOP1cc. This single particle interferometric scattering microscopy technique allows to analyze the formation of immune complexes in solution formed upon incubation of ATA mAbs with TOP1 and TOP1cc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

In the presence of antigen excess, ATA-IgG 2F8 bound both TOP1 and TOP1cc and efficiently formed immune complexes containing two antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). ATA-IgG 7G6 and ATA-IgG 9D11 did not show complete binding to TOP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). In these conditions, antibodies binding no or only one antigen could be detected, especially for ATA-IgG 9D11. In contrast, nearly complete binding of 7G6 and 9D11 was observed to TOP1cc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Hence, this independent approach confirmed the finding that certain ATA mAbs differentially recognize TOP1 and TOP1cc.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Polyclonal IgG autoantibodies from ATA<sup>+</sup> SSc patients differentially recognize TOP1cc</title><p id="P21">Differential recognition of TOP1/TOP1cc by ATA-IgG could affect the functionality of ATAs and, hence, influence disease pathogenesis.

Half-maximal binding titers of polyclonal IgG to TOP1 and TOP1cc were determined by serial dilutions of patient plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). ATA mAbs were taken along in these assays to control for comparable coating concentrations of TOP1 and TOP1cc (ATA mAb 2F8), and as positive controls for the differential recognition of TOP1cc compared to TOP1 (ATA mAbs 7G6 and 9D11). Plasma of all ATA<sup>+</sup> SSc patients (n=21) showed higher IgG titers to TOP1cc compared to TOP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Patients varied as to the extent of differential TOP1/TOP1cc recognition. The difference between anti-TOP1-IgG and anti-TOP1cc-IgG titers was modest for some patients. For others, much higher dilutions of plasma were needed to reach the same binding signal for TOP1cc in comparison to TOP1 (up to 30.000 difference in dilution factor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Again, we excluded suicide substrate recognition as confounder, as binding to suicide substrate was minimal to undetectable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3A</xref>). Also, plasma from ACA<sup>+</sup> SSc patients and healthy donors generated signals below the limit of detection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3B</xref>).

This difference correlated with anti-TOP1-IgG titers (r<sub>s</sub>=0.91) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3C</xref>).

Presence of ATA among the IgG subclasses was variable, as IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 anti-TOP1-autoantibodies could be detected in 67%, 81%, 52% and 95% of the samples (n=21), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4A-D</xref>). Therefore, we limited the analysis to samples in which TOP1 was recognized by multiple IgG subclasses (n=8 for IgG1/3/4, n=7 for IgG2) and in which total IgG recognized TOP1cc better than TOP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Enhanced recognition of TOP1cc compared to TOP1 was observed for IgG1 and IgG4, but not for IgG2 and IgG3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). To compare the relative difference in TOP1cc binding by the IgG subclasses to total IgG, anti-TOP1cc titers were normalized to anti-TOP1 titers by expressing the titers as a ratio (anti-TOP1cc titer divided by anti-TOP1 titer). The relative difference in TOP1cc binding by IgG1 was comparable to total IgG, while the ratio between anti-TOP1cc and anti-TOP1 titers for IgG2-4 were lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Consequently, the differential recognition of TOP1 upon DNA binding appears most prominent for IgG1.</p><p id="P24">TOP1-reactive antibodies of the IgA isotype can be detected in almost all ATA-IgG<sup>+</sup> SSc patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we detected anti-TOP1-IgA in all ATA-IgG<sup>+</sup> SSc patients (n=21) included in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). These IgA antibodies recognized TOP1cc slightly better in comparison to TOP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). However, the relative difference in the half-maximal binding titers between TOP1 and TOP1cc was significantly higher in the IgG compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p><p id="P25">For IgM, we observed that only 2 out of 21 ATA-IgG<sup>+</sup> patients generated higher signals on the anti-TOP1-IgM ELISA compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

To prevent interference of aspecific antibodies in the assay, we compared the reactivity of IgM antibodies towards TOP1 and TOP1cc in the two ATA-IgM<sup>+</sup> SSc patients and selected 9 other samples of ATA<sup>+</sup> SSc patients with high levels of ATA-IgM from a previous study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

TOP1cc was better recognized than TOP1 by IgM antibodies in these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). The relative difference in the half-maximal binding titers to TOP1 and TOP1cc was comparable between IgG and IgM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the differential recognition of TOP1 and TOP1cc is predominantly found in the IgM compartment and in the IgG1 subclass.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>ATA mAb can inhibit the enzymatic function of TOP1</title><p id="P26">We further characterized the ATA mAbs by assessing their effect on the enzymatic function of TOP1.

The enzymatic activity of TOP1 can be measured based on the relaxation of supercoiled plasmid DNA which impairs the mobility of DNA through agarose gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Pre-incubation of TOP1 with ATA-IgG 2F8, ATA-IgG 7G6 and a control mAb did not affect the enzymatic function of TOP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). In contrast, supercoiled plasmid DNA was still apparent in the condition in which TOP1 was pre-incubated with ATA mAb 9D11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). This indicates that ATA mAb 9D11 can inhibit the enzymatic function of TOP1.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Enhanced induction of cytokine production by anti-TOP1cc mAbs in complex with TOP1cc</title><p id="P27">The enhanced binding of ATA mAbs to TOP1cc compared to TOP1 may have functional implications on the immunostimulatory capacity of ATAs. Therefore, we stimulated the monocytic THP-1 cell line with ATA mAbs complexed with plate-bound TOP1 and TOP1cc and subsequently determined the secretion of IL-8. Minimal secretion of IL-8 by THP-1 cells was detected in conditions with TOP1 and TOP1cc coating to which no antibody or a negative control antibody was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

The ATA mAb 2F8, which binds to TOP1 and TOP1cc to a similar extent, induced comparable levels of IL-8 if complexed with TOP1cc or TOP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.

These data show functionality of the ATA mAbs generated and indicate that the ability of ATA to induce inflammation can be affected by the binding of TOP1 to DNA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">Predictability of disease progression forms a major challenge in the clinical management of SSc due to heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course of disease. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms driving the disease, we here focused on the ATA B cell response and assessed whether DNA binding by TOP1 would affect its recognition by ATAs. By studying monoclonal and polyclonal ATAs, we observed remarkable heterogeneity among these autoantibodies in the recognition of TOP1 and TOP1cc. In fact, a subset of ATAs recognized TOP1cc better than TOP1, indicating that TOP1cc formation induces conformational changes, presumably, that enhance the antigenic properties of individual TOP1 epitopes and, consequently, the immunostimulatory properties of ATAs.</p><p id="P29">The differential recognition of TOP1 and TOP1cc by ATAs could relate to disease by various means. We observed that enhanced recognition of TOP1cc can be found in all ATA<sup>+</sup> SSc patients, yet increasingly in patients with interstitial lung disease and in those with higher anti-TOP1-IgG levels in serum. Hence, it is likely that TOP1cc functions as an enhancer of the stimulation of ATA<sup>+</sup> B cells. In fact, our data indicate that TOP1cc could preferentially stimulate a subset of B cells expressing ATA with enhanced recognition of TOP1cc epitopes. Stimulation of these cells may be further amplified by BCR-mediated internalization of DNA in complex with TOP1 and subsequent co-engagement of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Consequently, TOP1cc recognition may be relevant for both the initial break of B cell tolerance to TOP1 and, likewise, the continuous activation of ATA B cells in established disease. In this context, it is important that we noted the predominant presence of ‘TOP1cc-enhanced’ ATA within the IgM and the IgG1 subclass compartment. The presence of TOP1cc-enhanced reactivity in the IgM compartment makes the naive B cell compartment susceptible to strong BCR-mediated stimulation, while TLR stimulation synergizes with BCR signaling to induce AID which mediates BCR class-switching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Previously, we could show that both the presence of ATA-IgM as well as ATA-IgG levels in serum associated with progressive disease, supporting this concept<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In addition, the presence of ATA-secreting cells in the circulation, a sign of recent B cell activation, associated with presence and severity of interstitial lung disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Together, these results indicate that the formation of TOP1cc could be important for ATA B cell activation and suggest that this process may be relevant to initiate and drive ATA<sup>+</sup> disease.</p><p id="P30">Our findings imply that TOP1 in complex with DNA is the autoantigen primarily targeted by the ATA B cell response. Differential recognition of TOP1 and TOP1cc likely depends on conformational changes that occur when TOP1 binds DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. This conformational change only affects the binding of ATAs that recognize epitopes of TOP1 which are altered and, thus, probably represent a subset of ATA B cells. This is consistent with the finding that ATA mAbs differentially bind to TOP1 and TOP1cc, bind to unique epitopes and vary in their ability to inhibit the enzymatic function of TOP1. Also, our data indicate that such interaction may enhance ATA functional properties inducing or supporting inflammatory processes. The relevance of these functional effects and the context in which the actual antigen is encountered by ATAs and TOP1-reactive B cells remains to be determined, particularly within affected tissues. It has been described that TOP1 isolated from nuclei of SSc skin fibroblasts shows reduced enzymatic activity and is more often modified with a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. These traits are associated with the presence of TOP1cc, as TOP1cc is SUMOylated in pathways needed to repair DNA lesions trapped in TOP1cc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Another variable could be the source of DNA incorporated in TOP1cc, as human TOP1 can also bind microbial DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Microbial DNA is a more potent inducer of TLR9 signaling in comparison to human DNA, which might further enhance the pro-inflammatory potential of TOP1cc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Together, such variables could determine the immunological properties of TOP1, add to the enhanced stimulation of B cells and indicate the need for molecular analyses of TOP1 in affected tissues.</p><p id="P31">In conclusion, our data indicate that DNA binding by TOP1, a nuclear autoantigen in SSc, affects the recognition of the antigen by disease-specific autoantibodies. This enhanced antigen binding extends the relevance of the well-appreciated pro-inflammatory effects of nucleic acid binding by nuclear antigens. Modulation of autoantigen recognition by nucleic acid binding could affect autoreactive B cell responses targeting nuclear proteins in SSc and other autoimmune diseases, thereby modulating their disease processes and course.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS206055-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d32aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Methods</label><media xlink:href="EMS206055-supplement-Supplementary_Methods.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d32aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Table</label><media xlink:href="EMS206055-supplement-Supplementary_Table.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d32aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Flow cytometry was performed at the Flow cytometry Core Facility (FCF) of the Leiden University Medical Center.</p><sec id="S23"><title>Funding sources</title><p>Research presented in this paper was funded by the Dutch Arthritis Foundation (LLP5), the IMI funded project RTCure (777357), Health~Holland Life Sciences &amp; Health sector programs Target to B!
