These mosquito-borne pathogens cause diseases ranging from mild febrile illness to severe manifestations including haemorrhagic fever, encephalitis and congenital abnormalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Despite their clinical importance, critical gaps persist in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing flavivirus biogenesis and host cell interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. This knowledge deficit has significantly impeded the development of effective antiviral strategies.</p><p id="P5">A hallmark of flavivirus infection is the extensive remodelling of host cell membranes to create specialised replication organelles (ROs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. These virus-engineered compartments serve as protected factories for viral genome replication and assembly, effectively shielding viral components from host immune surveillance. RO biogenesis necessitates substantial modifications in lipid metabolism, particularly involving the biosynthesis, trafficking and redistribution of lipid species to support membrane proliferation and curvature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, the specific host factors mediating these critical lipid modifications during flavivirus infection remain largely uncharacterised.</p><p id="P6">Central to cellular lipid homeostasis are lipid droplets (LDs), dynamic organelles consisting of a hydrophobic core of neutral lipids (primarily triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters) surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer embedded with a complement of regulatory proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Emerging evidence indicates that flaviviruses strategically manipulate both the formation and turnover of LDs during infection, suggesting a potential role for these organelles in the viral lifecycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. However, the molecular mechanisms governing flaviviruses exploitation of LDs and the viral and host factors involved in this process, remain poorly understood.</p><p id="P7">We previously reported that dengue virus (DENV) infection is accompanied by an early accumulation of LDs (between 10-18 hours) followed by their substantial turnover of lipid droplets at later stages (between 24-48 hours). This controlled degradation occurs primarily via AUP1-Ube2g2 mediated lipophagy, a selective autophagic pathway targeting LDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. While the functional impact of these temporal events in the LD lifecycle is not known, they can serve several purposes: (i) controlled release of fatty acids and cholesterol from LDs may supply building blocks for replication organelle biogenesis; (ii) released fatty acids may be used for protein acylation as a means of hijacking host factors; (iii) regulated lipophagy may prevent excessive LD accumulation, which could otherwise trigger inflammation; (iv) released fatty acids could also fuel β-oxidation, generating the ATP to meet the heightened energy demands of virus replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">In this study, we determined that LD alterations were accompanied by an increase in both lipid and protein fatty acylation in Zika virus (ZIKV) infected cells. To identify relevant acyltransferases, we conducted a systematic screen of fatty acyl transferase enzymes (MBOAT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and zDHHC families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>) and identified Sterol O-acyltransferase 1 and 2 (SOAT1 and SOAT2) as critical host factors in ZIKV and DENV infection. Also known as Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferases (ACAT1 and ACAT2), these enzymes serve as key regulators of cellular cholesterol metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. These are ER-resident integral membrane proteins that catalyse the formation of cholesteryl esters from long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and cholesterol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. This esterification process generates transport-competent forms of cholesterol that are important for cholesterol homeostasis and LD formation.</p><p id="P9">Our findings revealed that SOAT1 and SOAT2 activities are upregulated early during ZIKV infection, coinciding with increased LD formation. Using complementary approaches including genetic deletion through CRISPR/Cas9 and dose-dependent pharmacological inhibition, we established that SOAT1 and SOAT2 are required for ZIKV production in cellular infection models, specifically affecting the formation of replication organelles, and virion assembly. The importance of these enzymes lies in their ability to generate cholesteryl-ester enriched LDs with altered proteomes, enriched in fatty acid remodelling enzymes and lipid transport proteins, thereby creating specialised metabolic hubs that support membrane remodelling necessary for virus replication and assembly. Using a photo-crosslinkable cholesterol analogue we identified direct interactions between cholesterol and the viral structural proteins prM and capsid, as well as the non-structural protein NS1. Importantly, deletion or pharmacological inhibition of either SOAT1 or SOAT2 impaired this remodelling process, resulting in defective, vRNA-free replication organelles and a complete loss of immature virions, with subsequent degradation of viral proteins. This study establishes SOAT1 and SOAT2 as key host dependency factors for flaviviruses and provides mechanistic insights into the role of LDs as metabolic hubs during infection. These findings are clinically relevant, as reflected in dengue patients with obesity displaying increased disease severity, likely due to enhanced virus exploitation of lipid metabolism. Our findings open new avenues for understanding flavivirus-host interactions and may guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting host lipid metabolism to combat flavivirus infections.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Flavivirus infection alters lipid droplet dynamics and increased fatty acylation</title><p id="P10">We previously characterised Aup1/Ube2g2-dependent lipid droplet (LD) turnover during dengue infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Building on these observations, we investigated the temporal dynamics of LDs during ZIKV infection. We infected wild-type (WT) and Aup1 knockout (Aup1<sup>-/-</sup>) Huh7 cells and monitored LD turnover through the infection time-course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In WT cells, we observed an initial increase in LD abundance during the first 10 hours post-infection, followed by a gradual decrease over 24 hours and substantial reduction at 48 hours. This pattern is consistent with previous studies on DENV infection, which showed early LD accumulation followed by lipophagy-mediated turnover<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In contrast, Aup1<sup>-/-</sup> cells displayed impaired LD turnover, maintaining elevated LD numbers throughout the infection time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Given that LD turnover releases free fatty acids, we hypothesised that this phenomenon might enhance lipid and/or protein acylation during ZIKV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Knockdown efficiency was confirmed by mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A and S1B</xref>). While depletion of several ZDHHC proteins resulted in increased virus production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>), depletion of SOAT1 and SOAT2 (involved in cholesteryl ester synthesis) resulted in a substantial loss of virus production, suggesting a potential role for these enzymes in the virus lifecycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). In contrast, depletion of DGAT2 (involved in triacylglycerol synthesis) resulted in no detectable impact on viral titres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). These results suggest that SOAT1 and SOAT2, which specialise in cholesterol esterification, play important roles in supporting efficient ZIKV replication.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>SOAT1 and SOAT2 activities are required for productive viral infection</title><p id="P14">SOAT1 and SOAT2 (alternatively known as ACAT1 and ACAT2) are ER-resident cholesterol acyltransferases that convert free cholesterol to esterified cholesterol to be deposited into LDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). To investigate their potential involvement in flavivirus infection, we first examined their RNA expression profiles and activity during virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). SOAT2 mRNA levels were significantly upregulated following ZIKV infection, while increase in SOAT1 mRNA levels was less pronounced than SOAT2, and occurred only at 24 hours post infection. In contrast, DGAT1 and DGAT2 mRNA levels remained relatively stable, with DGAT2 mRNA levels significantly decreasing at 48 hours post infection. In line with increased SOAT1 and SOAT2 activity, there were more cholesterol esters formed in virus-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To assess the functional impact of SOAT1 and SOAT2 on Zika virus production, we generated Huh7 cells deleted in these genes via CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Confocal microscopy revealed a marked decrease in LD numbers in the SOAT-deficient cells compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>), confirming the expected disruption of cholesteryl ester synthesis and storage. Virus production from SOAT1<sup>-/-</sup> and SOAT2<sup>-/-</sup> cells was dramatically reduced by ~100-fold at 24 and 48 hours post infection, in Zika infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). To validate these findings through an independent approach, we treated wild-type cells with Avasimibe, a specific inhibitor of SOAT1/2 enzymatic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). When treated with increasing concentrations, viral titres in supernatants were similarly reduced at 24h and 48h post infection for both ZIKV and DENV without causing cytotoxicity at these concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). This is in line with a previous report showing reduced virus production in a range of cells and tissues upon treatment with a SOAT1 inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. On the other hand, inhibiting DGAT1/2 did not have any measurable impact on virus production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>SOAT1 and SOAT2 activities are required for morphogenesis of virions</title><p id="P16">To determine the mechanism underlying impaired virus production in SOAT1<sup>-/-</sup> and SOAT2<sup>-/-</sup> cells, we visualised dsRNA (marking virus replication organelles) and viral E-protein (indicating viral assembly sites) in infected wild-type, SOAT1<sup>-/-</sup> and SOAT2<sup>-/-</sup> Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that cells deleted in either SOAT1 or SOAT2 displayed substantially reduced dsRNA abundance and an even more profound decrease in E-protein clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We confirmed this reduction through RT qPCR quantitation of viral RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) and immunoblotting for viral proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). Interestingly, in cells treated with the SOAT1/2 inhibitor, while the structural proteins and NS1 levels decreased substantially (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A, S3B</xref>), viral RNA levels did not significantly change, suggesting that these enzymes most likely did not affect NS5-dependent replication directly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>). To test whether assembly of virus particles is also affected, we employed our previously established virus-like-particle system expressing the prME alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) to measure levels of structural proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> independent of replication. Similar to live infection, prM and E levels were found to be profoundly reduced in SOAT1<sup>-/-</sup> and SOAT2<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To determine whether SOAT1/2-deficiency impacted viral RNA stability and virion assembly on account of defective replication organelle and assembly sites, we used transmission electron microscopy on chemically fixed and resin embedded sections to assess ultrastructural defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). In wild-type cells, expanded ER containing vesicle packets and immature virus particles near the vesicle packets were frequently observed in virus-infected cells. Interestingly, these replication organelles contained electron-dense material, likely viral RNA, positioned adjacent to assembled virions in the wild-type infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, in SOAT1<sup>-/-</sup> or SOAT2<sup>-/-</sup> cells, the number of replication organelles were substantially lower, and those present were predominantly devoid of electron-dense material (highlighted in inset) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Most significantly, no assembled virions could be detected in the SOAT1<sup>-/-</sup> or SOAT2<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Similarly, SOAT-inhibitor treated cells displayed impaired biogenesis of replication organelle and viral progenies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3D</xref>). Interestingly, inhibitor treated cells also displayed defective mitochondrial morphology, indicative of potentially altered β-oxidation. Collectively, these data indicate that deficiency of SOAT1<sup>-/-</sup> or SOAT2<sup>-/-</sup> likely results in defective replication organelles and assembly sites, causing degradation of the viral RNA produced and abolishing assembly of viral progenies.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Remodelled cholesteryl ester enriched LDs supply lipids for ROs and virus assembly sites</title><p id="P18">SOAT1 and SOAT2 are enzymes that convert long chain fatty acids and free cholesterol into cholesteryl esters that are deposited into lipid droplets (LDs). SOAT1 and SOAT2 are induced upon ZIKV infection, increasing the amount of cholesteryl esters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B, 2C</xref>). In line with this, TEM analyses revealed striking morphological differences between LDs in uninfected versus ZIKV-infected cells indicative of a change in composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, LDs in virus-infected cells were also frequently ER-enwrapped. When visualised in FIB-milled samples, LDs in virus-infected cells frequently displayed a liquid crystalline phase (with 3.90 nm spacing of the lattice), a characteristic feature of cholesteryl ester-enriched LDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B, 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P19">To directly investigate this compositional remodelling of LDs, we applied a chemical biology approach using a cholesterol alkyne analogue. This probe is metabolically incorporated into cells, esterified and deposited into LDs. Through click chemistry, we attached a fluorescent tag onto alkyne cholesterol to visualise its subcellular localisation in virus-infected wild-type versus SOAT-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). TLC analysis confirmed that infected cells displayed significantly higher conversion of free cholesterol to cholesteryl esters compared to mock infected cells, in a SOAT-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Temporal tracking of cholesterol localisation revealed a dynamic redistribution pattern during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). At early timepoints, cholesteryl esters predominantly accumulated within LDs. However, as infection progressed, this cholesterol redistributed to viral replication and assembly sites, where it colocalised with dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, cholesterol accumulated in the plasma membrane upon SOAT1/2 inhibition and did not colocalise with replication organelles during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To identify the viral proteins that directly interact with cholesterol, we employed a bifunctional cholesterol analogue featuring both photo-crosslinking capability (via a diazirine group) and click chemistry reactivity (via an alkyne group). Mock and ZIKV infected cells were metabolically labelled with this cholesterol analogue and exposed to UV-light to activate the photo-crosslinking group, followed by Cu-catalysed click reaction with azide-biotin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). Streptavidin pulldown followed by silver staining confirmed capture of cross-linked proteins in both mock and virus-infected cells, but with distinct profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Immunoblotting for viral proteins indicated prM, capsid and NS1 interacted with cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>), as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Importantly, these interactions were abolished in cells treated with the SOAT1/2 inhibitor, indicating that LD-derived cholesteryl esters – rather than free cholesterol – represent the primary source of cholesterol for viral protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p id="P21">To test whether adding exogenous lipids could rescue viral titres in SOAT1/2-inhibited cells, we supplemented either free cholesterol or fatty acids in the form of oleic acid in time-of-addition experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E, 5F</xref>). When oleic acid was added to SOAT1/2-inhibited cells, virus production was rescued compared to DMSO-treated cells. In contrast, addition of free cholesterol – either at the same time of inhibitor addition, or 24 hours after inhibition addition – exacerbated the difference in viral titres between DMSO and SOAT-inhibited conditions regardless of the time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E, 5F</xref>). This indicates that the specific remodelling of LDs and access from them during infection is crucial for the ER-reorganisation required for productive virus morphogenesis, rather than free cholesterol, which can be detrimental to virus production.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>CE-rich lipid droplets are enriched in fatty acid remodelling and lipid transport proteins</title><p id="P22">To determine the molecular mechanisms by which cholesteryl ester rich (CE)-LDs support membrane remodelling during flavivirus infection, we conducted proteomic analyses of isolated LDs from mock and virus-infected cells using established protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. The LD proteome from virus-infected cells was profoundly altered, showing enrichment of fatty acid remodelling enzymes, Rab-GTPases, and lipid transport proteins (LTPs) including the class of bridge-like LTPs, and sphingomyelinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). These alterations collectively suggest a virus-induced remodelling of LDs at both the lipidome and proteome levels, transforming them into metabolically active hubs optimised for lipid mobilisation and delivery.</p><p id="P23">To further characterise this remodelling process, we examined key host proteins that participate in lipid mobilisation and membrane remodelling pathways. Remarkably, genetic deletion of either SOAT1 or SOAT2 resulted in complete loss of expression of specific proteins (data not shown) such as TMEM41B (a lipid scramblase previously implicated in flavivirus replication)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. This loss was recapitulated in SOAT1/2-inhibited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). These findings suggest a pathway in which SOAT1/2 enzymatic activity generates specialised CE-LDs with modified proteomes that include critical lipid transport machinery, such as LTPs and the scramblase TMEM41B. This remodelling most likely occurs at ER-LD contact sites, where regulated hydrolysis and lipid remodelling generate the lipid species necessary for virus morphogenesis.</p><p id="P24">Collectively, our study demonstrates that flaviviruses, particularly DENV and ZIKV induce extensive reprogramming of LDs that promotes virus production. These findings have important implications for understanding severe disease manifestations such as liver damage in individuals with obesity and related metabolic disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. To investigate the clinical relevance of our LD remodelling, we analysed dengue infection outcomes in a Sri Lankan cohort of 561 patients stratified by central obesity status, defined as waist circumference ≥80 cm in women or ≥90 cm in men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Analysis of disease severity distribution revealed a clear association between central obesity and severe dengue manifestations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). While both lean and obese patient groups showed predominantly dengue fever (DF) cases, obese patients demonstrated a markedly higher proportion of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) compared to lean patients. This difference in disease severity distribution was statistically significant (p=0.0407, Fisher’s exact test). Quantitative analysis of DHF risk showed that patients with central obesity had a substantially elevated risk of developing severe disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Central obesity was associated with a 33.3% risk of DHF compared to 25.4% in patients without central obesity, representing an absolute risk increase of 7.9 percentage points and a relative risk of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.01-1.46).</p><p id="P25">These clinical findings support our mechanistic discoveries regarding SOAT-mediated LD remodelling. The increased severe dengue susceptibility in obese patients is consistent with our demonstration that flaviviruses exploit cholesteryl ester-enriched lipid droplets for morphogenesis. Given that obesity is characterised by altered lipid metabolism and increased LD abundance, obese patients may harbour cellular environments that are more conducive to viral replication. Our data suggest BMI could serve as a valuable clinical indicator for identifying patients at elevated risk for severe dengue manifestations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">This study establishes cholesteryl ester synthesis as a critical host dependency factor for flavivirus infection and provides mechanistic insights into how viruses exploit LD metabolism to support their replication and assembly. Our findings demonstrate that SOAT1/2-mediated cholesterol esterification generates specialised LDs with liquid crystalline phases that serve as essential metabolic hubs for viral morphogenesis, advancing our understanding of flavivirus-host interactions.</p><p id="P27">The dramatic ~100-fold reduction in viral production upon SOAT1/2 deficiency, coupled with the complete absence of assembled virions, underscores the requirement for cholesterol esterification in flavivirus morphogenesis. Importantly, our findings reveal specificity for cholesterol esterification over triacylglycerol synthesis, suggesting that flaviviruses have evolved to preferentially exploit cholesteryl ester-enriched LDs rather than conventional triacylglycerol-rich LDs.</p><p id="P28">Our proteomic analyses reveal that flavivirus infection transforms LDs into specialised organelles with fundamentally altered composition and function. The enrichment of fatty acid remodelling enzymes, Rab-GTPases, sphingomyelinases, and lipid transport proteins, establishes these remodelled LDs as metabolically active hubs rather than passive lipid storage depots. The recruitment of bridge-like lipid transfer proteins, and correlation with TMEM41B expression provides a potential molecular mechanism for directional lipid transfer from CE-LDs to viral replication and assembly sites. This finding links previous observations of TMEM41B’s requirement for flavivirus replication with the broader context of virus-induced lipid mobilisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">The direct interactions between cholesterol and viral proteins prM, capsid, and NS1, which are specifically dependent on LD-derived cholesteryl esters rather than free cholesterol, suggest that the cellular source of cholesterol is a critical determinant of its functional role in viral morphogenesis. The failure of exogenous free cholesterol supplementation to rescue viral production in SOAT-inhibited cells, and its apparent detrimental effects, reinforces the specificity of this dependency. The interaction of cholesterol with both structural proteins (prM, capsid) and the secreted glycoprotein NS1 suggests multiple roles for cholesterol throughout the viral lifecycle. Our work also highlights the importance of organelle contact sites, particularly ER-LD contacts, as potential platforms for virus-host interactions and therapeutic targeting. The temporal coordination between LD accumulation, turnover, and viral replication phases may represent a programmed sequence optimised to provide lipid building blocks precisely when needed for replication organelle biogenesis and virion assembly.</p><p id="P30">The clinical relevance of our mechanistic findings is supported by analysis of dengue patients from a Sri Lankan cohort, where adiposity showed significantly higher rates of severe dengue haemorrhagic fever compared to lean patients. This observation aligns with our demonstration that flaviviruses exploit cholesteryl ester-enriched LD, as obesity involves altered lipid metabolism and increased LD abundance that may provide enhanced cellular environments supporting viral replication.</p><p id="P31">Our findings contribute to the growing recognition that viruses extensively reprogramme host metabolism to support their replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Future studies will examine whether this dependency extends to other flaviviruses and related RNA viruses, and whether similar mechanisms operate in physiologically relevant primary cell types. The development of more potent and selective SOAT inhibitors will be essential for advancing therapeutic applications targeting host lipid metabolism to combat flavivirus infections.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>STAR Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Cell Culture and Viral Infections</title><p id="P32">Huh7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) high glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, D6546) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C with 5% CO□.
