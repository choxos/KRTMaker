Many centromeres comprise highly variable, megabase-scale satellite DNA arrays, yet the mutation spectrum driving this variability remains poorly understood. Using replicated genome assemblies of six Arabidopsis mutation accumulation lines, we identified centromeric mutations consisting almost exclusively of point mutations and structure-preserving, in-frame indels spanning a few kilobases. Centromeric point mutations occurred at a ninefold higher rate (6.1x10<sup>-8</sup>/bp/gen) than in chromosome arms, frequently introduced by non-allelic gene conversions from closely linked repeat units. Forward-in-time simulations based on the observed mutation spectrum recapitulated the emergence of megabase-scale higher-order repeat (HOR) structures, including long-range sequence similarities, without requiring large-scale rearrangements, closely mirroring centromeric divergence among natural genomes. Our results show that centromere evolution is driven by a unique mutational spectrum, providing a quantitative framework to understand how small-scale mutations shape and maintain the large-scale architecture of centromeric DNA.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>centromere</kwd><kwd>tandem repeats</kwd><kwd>mutations</kwd><kwd><italic>de novo</italic> genome assembly</kwd><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Centromeres are essential for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division.

However, the mutational dynamics driving this rapid sequence turnover remain poorly understood.</p><p id="P4">The individual repeat units of the satellite repeat arrays are not identical but instead show sequence differences that give rise to distinct patterns, such as tandem duplications or triplications, which can be further extended into higher-order repeat (HORs) structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.

To overcome this, we applied a novel replicated genome sequencing strategy to eliminate genome assembly errors, allowing us to distinguish genuine centromere mutations from assembly artifacts. Applying this approach to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> mutation accumulation (MA) lines revealed a unique mutational spectrum in the centromeres. This was marked by frequent in-frame indels of several kb in size that added or deleted entire repeat units, while keeping the repeat array structure intact. In addition, we found highly frequency point mutations that were frequently introduced by non-allelic gene conversions. However, we did not find any large-scale mutations that could explain the megabase-scale differences between closely-related centromeres. Interestingly, forward-in-time simulations over millions of generations demonstrated that small-scale indels, in combination with non-allelic gene conversions, are sufficient to drive the formation of megabase-scale HOR structures and ongoing centromere turnover. The simulated centromere sequences recapitulated the divergence observed in natural genomes including the formation of variable HOR structures, the occurrence of long-distance similarities and the extreme size variation or the entire array. Together, these unexpected findings uncover how centromeres evolve through a distinctive mutational regime that underly their remarkable diversification.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Replicated genome assemblies eliminate errors</title><p id="P7">Despite significant progress in recent years, <italic>de novo</italic> genome assemblies still contain hundreds to thousands of errors, making it difficult to confidently identify mutations in highly repetitive regions that distinguish closely related individuals. Hence, identifying mutations in the centromeres to then simulate their dynamics requires error-free genome assemblies. To achieve this, we generated replicated genome assemblies (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., two independent assemblies from independent samples of the same individual) to first identify errors and then use error-corrected assemblies to identify true mutations.</p><p id="P8">We first reconstructed the genomes of two <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Col-0 plants using two independent DNA samples extracted from pooled progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Both mother plants (referred to as A and B) were originally derived from the same founder plant, but were kept separate for 16 generations based on self-pollination (as part of a controlled trans-generational mutation accumulation experiment). We refer to the four DNA samples as “A1”, “A2”, “B1” and “B2” to distinguish the origin of the samples (“A” or “B” plant) and their replication (“1” and “2”) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In general, Col-0 is a diploid, inbred and selfing plant with a homozygous genome, which is identical between different Col-0 plants, except for the mutations that occurred after individual lineages were split.</p><p id="P9">We sequenced the four samples with PacBio’s HiFi technology with very high coverage ranging from 96x to 142x (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD22">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and generated highly contiguous genome assemblies with NG50 values of 9.4 to 14.3 Mb. We scaffolded 19 to 31 contigs of each assembly into five pseudo-chromosomes using homology to the reference sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD22">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P10">When comparing the replicated genome assemblies (A1 against A2 and B1 against B2), we identified 391, 577, 266, and 298 errors in the four assemblies, where the errors were validated and assigned to individual replicates using alignments of additional short reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD22">Supplementary Table 3</xref>-6). The low error rate was confirmed by Merqury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, which estimated quality values (QVs) ranging from 58 to 62 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD22">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Closer examination of the assembly errors revealed three distinct reasons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD21">Supplementary Results</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD22">Supplementary Table 3-6</xref>).</p><p id="P11">The most common source, accounting for approximately ~80% of all errors, was simple sequence repeats, where HiFi reads failed to accurately capture the correct repeat unit count. These errors were almost exclusively small indels, typically 1-2 bp in size. Around 17% of errors were associated with random sequencing errors near GA(A) repeats, where low coverage hindered error correction through read consensus. The remaining ~3% arose from assembly artifacts or errors introduced during reference-based scaffolding. A detailed discussion of these error types is provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD21">Supplementary Results</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S4"><title>HiFi assemblies feature almost perfectly assembled centromeres</title><p id="P12">Centromeric regions, which have long posed major challenges for genome assembly due to their repetitive nature, were exceptionally well resolved. Across all four genomes, 17 of the 20 centromeres were fully assembled into a single contig. Unexpectedly, centromeres were among the most accurately assembled regions: although they comprise 8.3% of the genome, they accounted for less than 1% of all assembly errors.</p><p id="P13">In total we detected only 12 assembly errors, including seven large (&gt;50 bp) and five small (1-2 bp) errors. The large errors were primarily due to mis-scaffolding, while the small ones were associated with simple sequence repeats. This high level of accuracy is likely due to a marked depletion of simple sequence repeats within centromeres, which were the main source of assembly errors elsewhere in the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD21">Supplementary results</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Notably, visual inspection of raw PacBio read alignments enabled reliable distinction between true mutations and assembly errors, even without replicated genome assemblies.</p><sec id="S5"><title>Identifying centromeric mutations with error-free assemblies</title><p id="P14">Comparing the error-free assemblies of samples A and B, we identified 200 homozygous and 29 heterozygous mutations, comprising 97 point mutations (PMs) and 132 indels ranging in size from 1 to 11,570 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD22">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). Using allele information from the Col-0 reference genome, we assigned 115 mutations to sample A and 114 to sample B.</p><p id="P15">Previous studies have estimated a point mutation rate in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> of 6.95x10<sup>-9</sup> per site and generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The 77 homozygous point mutations (34 in A and 43 in B) are more than twice as many as expected given this mutation rate. It is important to note, however, that the original estimate was based on “unique” regions of the genome (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., regions accessible with short-read alignments) and did not include repetitive regions of the genome. In fact, when excluding the centromeres and 5S rDNA clusters (119.8 Mb), we identified only 39 fixed point mutations (19 in A and 20 in B), leading to a mutation rate similar to earlier estimations when considering the elevated mutation rates in transposable elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P16">The remaining 38 homozygous point mutations (49%) were located within just 13.8 Mb (9.8%) of the genome, corresponding to the 5S rDNA clusters and the centromeres. This suggested an elevated point mutation rate in these regions compared to unique regions and indicates that these regions undergo different mutational dynamics as previously described for pericentromeric regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. These findings contribute to the growing evidence that mutation rates are not uniformly distributed across the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">In the unique regions of the genome, the most common type of mutation was not point mutations but 2 bp indels, which accounted for 55.1% (n=81) of all mutations detected in these regions. All of these small indels were exclusively found in dinucleotide repeats within the chromosome arms, consistent with previous reports showing that mutation rates in dinucleotide repeats are orders of magnitude higher than those of point mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. All other small indels (1-50 bp) also occurred within simple sequence repeats, including three cases with slightly larger repeat units of up to 25 bp. In contrast, large indels (59 to 11,570 bp) were not associated with simple sequence repeats. While most small indels were confined to unique regions, large indels showed a distinct pattern in their genomic distribution, with the majority of them (15 out of 19) occurring in highly repetitive regions such as the centromeres or the 5S rDNA clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Only four of the large deletions occurred outside of these regions, of those three shared significant sequence homology with closely linked regions, implying that local homology is a major driver of large indel formation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Mutation spectrum in the centromere</title><p id="P18">In the centromeres, we identified 31 point mutations and 14 indels (11 insertions and three deletions) ranging from 535 to 2,314 bp, but no other type of mutation. This was in stark contrast to the chromosome arms, where small indels in simple sequence repeats were the predominant mutation type. The mutations were distributed over the entire span of centromeres, including very homogeneous HORs as well as divergent peripheries, without any apparent preference for either of the regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Also, no mutation bias for any of the sites within the consensus of the CEN178 repeats could be found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Unexpectedly, the breakpoints of all indel mutations were in-frame with the repeat units (i.e., the start and end positions of the indel mutations corresponded to adjacent bases in the consensus of the CEN178 repeat) implying that centromeric indels either delete or add complete repeat units only and thereby preserve the integrity of the satellite repeat array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), which is a prerequisite for highly dynamic repeat clusters, which conserve the repeat structure itself as observed between the centromeres of natural <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions. The three deletions removed 3 to 8 repeat units, while the 11 insertion mutations introduced 3 to 13 units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). The inserted sequences were either entirely or at least partially identical (in the case of complex tandem duplications) to the repeat units right next to the inserted sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). Most insertions and deletions led also to the formation of a few variants of the repeat unit, as new recombinant variants arose at their breakpoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P20">As mentioned above, the centromeres featured an increased point mutation rate as compared to the rest of the genome. While most of the point mutations were isolated and found across the entire stretch of the centromeres, five point mutations were located in the centre of a single CEN178 repeat unit, in a region not larger than 33 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Intriguingly, the CEN178 unit just upstream of the mutated unit contained the exact same sequence variation as introduced by the five mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e, f</xref>). The most parsimonious explanation is that the five point mutations were introduced by a non-allelic gene conversion (NAGC) and not by the more complex occurrence of five independent point mutation events. Considering the additional differences between the two units that were not converted, the estimated gene conversion tract size might have been between 33 and 126 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Although the remaining point mutations were not clustered, this does not exclude the possibility that they also arose through non-allelic gene conversions. When we searched for putative donor sequences, we found that 25 of the 26 unclustered centromeric point mutations had putative donor sequences on the same centromere.</p><p id="P22">This suggests that gene conversion events are largely confined to within individual chromosomes, with no evidence for inter-chromosomal exchange. This finding is consistent with prior studies showing that centromeric satellite variants are often chromosome-specific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, indicating that mutations within centromeres rarely propagate between chromosomes.</p><p id="P23">Some donor sequences were in closely proximity to the mutated sites, including eight cases where the putative donor was within ten adjacent repeat units, and four cases where it was directly adjacent. To test whether such proximity could occur by chance, we performed random simulations of point mutations. A high proportion of random mutations (86%) coincidentally resembled other repeat units, making it difficult to assess the actual contribution of gene conversions to the increased rate of point mutations. However, the distances between mutations and their putative donors were significantly shorter in real data than in the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g, h</xref>), supporting the idea that the elevated point mutation rate in centromeres is, at least in part, driven by non-allelic gene conversions within the same chromosome rather than by an increased rate of spontaneous mutations.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Estimating centromere mutation frequencies</title><p id="P24">To enable accurate estimation of mutation frequencies, we generated high-quality genome assemblies of four additional trans-generational MA lines, each propagated for 32 generations. In total, this added up to 160 generations of accumulated mutations in our panel. To confidently distinguish true centromeric mutations from the few assembly errors, we manually inspected read alignments at each assembly difference, allowing for the reliable identification of genuine centromeric mutations.</p><p id="P25">Combined with the two replicated lines, we identified 116 point mutations, 45 large indels, and 4 small indels within the centromeric regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD22">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). As observed in genomes A and B, all additional large centromeric indels were in-frame, with a notable enrichment of complex tandem duplications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 4b, d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD17">8</xref>). The increased number of generations also revealed a broader range of indel sizes, from single-unit events to insertions spanning 31 repeat units and over 5,507 bp in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). Overall, however, considering the overall sizes of the centromeric repeat arrays (megabase-scale), all observed indel mutation were still rather small (kb-scale).</p><p id="P26">The point mutation rate within centromeric repeat arrays was estimated at 6.12 × 10<sup>-8</sup> (95% CI: 5.06–7.34 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) per site per generation, which is approximately nine times higher than a recent estimate for point mutation rates in the chromosome arms of <italic>A. thaliana</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Besides methylated cytosines in transposable elements, which also exhibited elevated mutation rates, all other genomic regions in the chromosome arms showed significantly lower rates of point mutation.</p><p id="P27">As observed in A and B, many of the centromeric point mutations appeared to result from non-allelic gene conversions. We identified four clusters of point mutations: two clusters with two adjacent point mutations each, one with three mutations within a 104 bp window, and a striking case involving 16 point mutations and a 1 bp insertion within just 144 bp. In all cases, putative donor sequences were present on the same chromosome as the point mutation cluster further supporting the rarity of inter-chromosomal gene conversion. Despite the varying distance to their potential donor units (ranging from 10 to 3,570 repeat units), the presence of multiple clusters suggested that the elevated point mutation rate in centromeres is not primarily driven by an elevated rate of spontaneous mutations, but rather by gene conversion events enabled by the high levels of homology within centromeric repeat arrays. This interpretation is further supported by an altered point mutation spectrum in the centromeres: while GC→AT transitions are the most common type of the point mutations in the chromosome arms (~60%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, their prevalence in the centromeres was notably reduced to ~40%, consistent with a distinct mutational process. Notably, this difference could not be explained by a reduced GC content, as centromeres even have a slightly higher GC content (37.4%) as compared to chromosome arms (36.2%).</p><p id="P28">Taken together, the chromosome arms and centromeric regions display strikingly distinct mutational dynamics. These differences in mutation spectra stem from the contrasting repeat landscapes of the two regions. In chromosome arms, simple sequence repeats predominantly give rise to small indels, typically only a few base pairs in length, coupled with spontaneous point mutations in unique regions. By contrast, the extensive local homology among repeat units in centromeric arrays facilitates in-frame indels spanning several kilobases, as well as non-allelic gene conversions that mediate short-tract sequence exchange between adjacent repeat units.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Small-scale indels and gene conversions are sufficient to shape natural centromere structures</title><p id="P29">In both animals and plants, many centromeric repeat arrays contain large, homogenized regions composed of highly similar repeat units spanning multiple megabases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. These higher-order repeat (HORs) regions are often distinct from the rest of the centromeric repeat units. Although their origin remains unclear, mechanisms such as layered expansion, tandem duplication or unequal crossover have been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In this study, the largest indels observed in the centromeres were only a few kilobases in size, yet all were precisely in-frame with the repeat unit structure. This raised the question whether these small-scale, but structure-preserving indels could drive the emergence of HOR patterns or whether rarer, larger mutations – not detected in the 160 generations of analysed MA lines here – are also required.</p><p id="P30">To address this, we performed forward-in-time simulations of the mutational dynamics in the centromere using an initial sequence of 15,000 identical CEN178 repeats. We ran the simulations for six million generations, and in each generation, we introduced random mutations, which were sampled from the frequency distributions and spectra of the mutations found within the MA lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Within the burn-in phase, in which the initial similarity of the starting sequence was erased, we observed a quick sequence turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b, c, f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD23">Extended Data Video 1-5</xref>). After approximately one million generations, none of the original repeat units remained unaltered and new similarities between regions, which did not result from the similarities of the starting sequence, could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Unexpectedly, the high turnover of the consensus sequence did not lead to a continuously increasing divergence between the individual repeat units, instead, some regions became more similar over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g, h</xref>). Excitingly, this led to the formation of HOR structures resembling those large-scale HOR structures seen in natural genomes, including megabase-scale clusters of highly similar repeat units, which were distinct from their surroundings. The sizes of these HORs varied dynamically, expanding and contracting over time. This suggested that the random combination of point mutations, non-allelic gene conversions and medium-sized, kilobase-large in-frame indels is sufficient to generate megabase-scale patterns of homogenized repeat arrays – without requiring any large rearrangements or layered expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g, h</xref>).</p><p id="P32">We also observed that some of the HOR clusters were split by the emergence of distinct HOR clusters within already existing HOR cluster. This separated the original HOR cluster into to separated parts, which showed long-distance similarities (red box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). These patterns appeared as they were introduced through long-distance recombination, however, here they were solely introduced by small-scale indels and gene conversions.</p><p id="P33">Also, the overall centromere length varied dramatically, some centromeres more than doubled in size, while other repeat arrays were entirely lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d, e</xref>). This was unexpected, as the insertion and deletion mutations were rather small (compared to the entire centromere) and were introduced with equal probability, which should theoretically stabilize centromere length. However, across tens of thousands of generations, strong deviations from the original lengths emerged, reflecting the divergent centromeres between natural genomes and even the loss of entire centromeres observed in natural genomes that have been separated for tens to hundreds of thousands of years separated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> – again all the patterns were shaped only through continuous introduction of small-scale, in-frame indels and gene conversions. In summary, the simulations evidenced that small-scale mutations can recapitulate the emergence of megabase-scale HOR structures, long-distance similarities and drastic differences between centromere sizes. The HOR structures had a high turn-over rate, which mirrored the strong differences between different accessions in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, which are usually tens to hundreds of thousands of generations apart. In contrast, the consensus sequences themselves changed only gradually, and there were still significant similarities between the consensus sequences at the end of the simulations, which were on the same order as the similarities between the consensus sequences of different chromosomes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P34">In this study, we leveraged <italic>A. thaliana</italic> MA lines to explore the mutational dynamics of centromeres. To overcome the inherent challenges of detecting rare mutations in repetitive regions, we generated replicated, error-free genome assemblies. Despite the long-standing difficulty of assembling centromeric repeat arrays, we found that PacBio HiFi assemblies not only fully captured the centromeric sequences, but also contained significantly fewer assembly errors than other genomic regions. Remarkably, the previously “unassemblable” centromeres emerged as some of the most precisely assembled parts of the genome.</p><p id="P35">Recent analysis of human centromeres and pericentromeric regions in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> have suggested increased point mutation rates relative to chromosome arms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Indeed, although centromeric repeat arrays share well-defined consensus sequences, individual repeat units can differ by up to 40% within a single centromere. Our analysis of the MA lines confirmed a nine-fold increase in point mutation rates within centromeres, driven largely by non-allelic gene conversions that shuffle alleles among nearby repeat copies. This elevated gene conversions rate may stem from the absence of meiosis-associated crossovers in centromeres as previously hypothesized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Alternatively, it could result from somatic homologous recombination during DNA repair in meristematic tissues. In contrast to earlier studies implicating transposable elements (TEs) in centromere diversification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, we found no TE-associated mutations, suggesting that TE-driven structural change is rare and likely occurs over longer evolutionary timescales.</p><p id="P36">In addition to point mutations, we observed frequent in-frame indels in centromeres, with lengths up to 5.5 kb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.

The simulated repeat arrays closely mirrored those observed in natural centromeres, highlighting that homogenization does not require a specific mechanism linked to CENH3 binding or kinetochore formation, as previously proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P38">Instead, the simulations revealed a self-organizing process of repeat homogenization reminiscent of concerted evolution, which has been described for rDNA and other satellite DNA families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. These self-organizing dynamics fit to a feedback model proposed for the evolution of satellite repeats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, which can now be explained with specific mutational processes capable of driving such patterns.</p><p id="P39">Interestingly, our simulations also revealed that new HOR structures can emerge within existing clusters, effectively subdividing them into distinct domains. The two parts of the separated cluster shared more similarity to each other than with the new separating HOR, a pattern previously attributed to long-range recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. However, our results demonstrate that such structures can also arise solely through short-range indels and gene conversions.</p><p id="P40">Furthermore, the simulations showed that changes in repeat unit consensus do not require the genesis of entirely new centromeric arrays but can emerge through gradual, cumulative sequence changes. Since centromere function does not depend on a specific repeat sequence, reduced meiotic recombination in centromeric regions and relaxed selective constraints may allow the spontaneous formation and propagation of tandem repeat arrays ultimately enabling the birth of new centromeric consensus sequences.</p><p id="P41">Nonetheless, this also means that some questions remain unresolved. Despite the high turnover rates of centromeric repeats, the consensus sequences across different chromosomes remain strikingly similar. This implies some sort of inter-chromosomal homogenization, potentially facilitated by retrotransposons enriched at centromeres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.

in closely related <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genomes revealed by error-free genome assemblies.</title><p><bold>a</bold>. Pools of sister plants were sequenced (sampled from ~15 distinct sister plants per pool), with two independent pools from the progeny of each mother plant (referred to as A or B). Pooling genomes of sister plants dilutes somatic and gametophytic mutations in the mother plant and reconstitutes the genome of the mother plant (F16). All differences between genome assemblies of sister pools should therefore result from assembly errors. <bold>b</bold>. Distribution of true mutations in samples A and B. Two rows of circles represent mutation patterns, colour-coded by type: PMs (orange), insertions (red), deletions (blue), with circle size reflecting mutation size: small (1-2 bp), medium (3-50 bp), and large (&gt;50 bp). Solid circles mark homozygous, hollow circles heterozygous mutations. Chromosomes are shown as rectangles with repetitive regions highlighted: centromere (peach), mitochondrial insertions (red), 5S rDNA (light blue), and 45S rDNA (dark blue). <bold>c</bold>. Bar plots show mutation counts in samples A and B, with the middle bar representing point mutations, right bars showing insertions, and left bars showing deletions. Mutation size increases from the centre outward, with colour coding distinguishing counts in 5S rDNA (light blue), centromere (peach), and remaining regions (red). PM: point mutation; INS: insertion; DEL: deletion.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206202-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Mutations within centromeres.</title><p><bold>a</bold>. Two rows of circles display mutation patterns in the centromere of chromosome 4, colour-coded as point mutations (PMs; orange), insertions (red), and deletions (blue), with circle size reflecting mutation length: small (1-2 bp), medium (3-50 bp), and large (&gt;50 bp). Solid circles indicate homozygous mutations, while hollow circles indicate heterozygous ones. A line plot shows higher-order repeat (HOR) scores, rectangles highlight repetitive regions, and the heatmap below represents pairwise sequence identity between non-overlapping 10 kb regions, with a histogram summarizing identity values in the lower-left corner. <bold>b</bold>. Violin plots compare HOR scores of observed mutations (colour-coded by type) to 500 random centromere positions (grey), with a Mann-Whitney U test showing no significant difference (P = 0.826). <bold>c</bold>. Schematics illustrate three mutation types: deletion (left), tandem duplication (middle), and complex tandem duplication (right), with red boxes highlighting mutated patterns. <bold>d</bold>. Dot plots show collinearity of three example mutations against the CEN178 consensus sequence, demonstrating in-frame mutation patterns. The plots show sequence identity between wild-type and mutated sequences (A or B), with the longest identical sequences in black and others in grey. Mutated regions are colour-coded: blue (deletion) and red (insertion). <bold>e</bold>. Schematic representation of NAGC in the centromere, with a simplified example where the donor unit is adjacent to the recipient (though in reality, they may be separated). <bold>f</bold>. A schematic example shows five point mutations introduced by a single NAGC event rather than five independent mutations, with colours representing nucleotide bases. <bold>g</bold>. Violin plots compare repeat unit numbers between potential donors of observed point mutations and 500 random centromere positions, with donors being colour-coded: downstream (blue) and upstream (pink), showing a significant difference (P = 3.3e-05, Mann-Whitney U test). <bold>h</bold>. Line plots show the cumulative likelihood of donor distance (in repeat units) for real and simulated mutations, with asterisks indicating five-point mutations located centrally within a single CEN178 repeat unit.
