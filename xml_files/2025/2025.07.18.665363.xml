To achieve this, tissues must quickly react, forcing cells to rearrange and accommodate. Therefore, cells must cope with forces that will deform their shape to achieve these sudden but necessary changes. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc, we showed how tissue fluidisation accelerated wound healing in 2D. However, the 3D aspect of tissue repair remains poorly understood. Here, we uncover a new mechanism aiding the tissue in repairing itself by changing cell height. We find actomyosin contractile cables at the wound edge connecting the apical and basal cell surface, which indent the apical side of the tissue and deform the basement membrane (BM), respectively. To understand the role of the different repair mechanisms, we developed a 3D vertex model allowing apico-basal intercalations. The model predicts that lateral cables play a role in regulating cell-cell intercalations, confirmed by <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutations affecting cell deformations. Our results demonstrate that lateral cables cooperate with the apical purse string to drive 3D cell shape changes and intercalations to promote more efficient wound repair.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Effective wound healing relies on robust, tightly coordinated responses that depend on the mechanical properties of cells and their surrounding environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Most studies relating to tissue mechanics and wound healing have considered monolayered epithelial tissues as two-dimensional (2D) planar structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The three-dimensional (3D) shape of epithelial cells, particularly the organisation and mechanics of their lateral domains, plays a crucial role in driving tissue morphogenesis. For instance, developmental tissue folding in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing and leg imaginal discs has been shown to rely on apicobasally orientated forces driven by lateral accumulations of myosin II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. While there is some evidence that epithelial cells change shape in 3D during wound healing, mainly in flat cell culture epithelia, how these 3D shape changes are controlled and whether they contribute to epithelial wound healing has not been explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P3">In addition to intrinsic cell mechanics, 3D tissue and cell shape are also driven by communication to the external environment via cell-BM adhesions, for example, in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicular epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Cells also transmit forces to the underlying substrate via focal adhesions during wound closure, as quantified using traction force microscopy of MDCK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, Integrin-mediated adhesion is remodelled during wound closure in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Despite this, the relationship between 3D cell shape and substrate adhesion during wound healing has not yet been investigated.</p><p id="P4">In parallel, 2D vertex models have been widely used to study tissue mechanics during wound healing and other biological processes, helping to understand how forces at cell interfaces shape tissue behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Such models have shown that, depending on the initial cell geometry and tissue mechanical properties, distinct closure mechanisms can arise to seal the wound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. However, extending these models to 3D has proven challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], particularly when accounting for complex spatial features such as apico-basal intercalations or scutoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. A previous 3D hybrid model incorporating differential contractility at apical, basal, and lateral surfaces demonstrated that an apical purse-string can drive wound closure when combined with volume preservation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P5">To explore these questions in a physiologically relevant context, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc offers an ideal <italic>ex vivo</italic> system for investigating 3D cell behaviours. The wing disc comprises approximately 45μm tall pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells encased by a basement membrane (BM). We have previously characterised an actomyosin purse string similar to that found in wounded <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] and shown how tissue fluidity plays key roles in enabling intercalation for scarless wound closure in the wing disc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Here, we use live imaging and laser ablation of the wing disc to characterise 3D cell shape changes during wound healing. We have discovered a novel actomyosin-driven lateral cable mechanism independent from the apical purse string. By combining genetic perturbations with an intercalation-enabled 3D vertex model, we reveal how the distribution of myosin-II-driven forces dependent on substate adhesion can influence 3D mechanisms of wound repair.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Wing Disc Wound Healing Is Accompanied By 3D Cell And Tissue Shape Changes</title><p id="P6">We used wing discs between 96-120 hours after egg laying because, at this stage, the pouch region is relatively flat and thus easier to wound apically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Following wounding by laser ablation and live time-lapse imaging, we observed that the wound extended the entire height of the epithelium, from the apical surface to the basal surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). This led us to examine cell and tissue behaviours along the tissue’s apicobasal axis during wound healing.</p><p id="P7">120 min after wounding, we consistently observed that the apical and basal surfaces had indented towards the centre of the wound, forming distinctive funnel-like shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). We found that the tissue height at the wound edge decreases by approximately 40% over 120 min of closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). These observations indicated that wound edge cells were shortening as healing progressed leading us to hypothesise that such 3D cell shape changes could facilitate wound closure. Specifically, as cells shorten, they expand their planar area into the wound, reducing the wound gap. This hypothesis relies on wound edge cells conserving their volume during shortening. Previous studies of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic epidermis wounds have reported differing results, with some showing that wound-edge cells conserve volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] whilst another reports an increase in volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. To quantify cell volume, we induced sparse 1-2 cell cytoplasmic mCherry-expressing clones in the wing disc and wounded tissue so that these clones were on the wound edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>). We quantified the clone volume and height over the first 120 min of closure and found that while the clones decreased in height, they did not significantly change in volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>), supporting our hypothesis that cell shortening at the wound edge could facilitate wound closure.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Contractile Lateral Actomyosin Cables Form at the Wound Edge and Deform the Tissue</title><p id="P8">To investigate how wound edge cells change shape in 3D, we used 3D timelapse imaging to quantify wound edge dynamics. We marked the wound edge using GFP-tagged myosin II, the primary force generator in this tissue, which is enriched at the apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Imaging in 3D, we found that wound edge cells also begin indenting within 5 min and the indentation depth increases linearly over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The sustained apicobasal shortening at the wound edge suggests the presence of an active force-generating mechanism initiated rapidly upon wounding. At the apical surface of the wound edge, we observed strong myosin II accumulation forming a classic purse string, consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. When we examined deeper z planes basally through the wound, we noticed myosin II accumulations decorating the lateral edges of wound edge cells, emerging approximately 6 min after wounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). On closer inspection, we could identify a single cable in most cells, which was closely localised to sites of former tricellular junctions and formed a continuous structure with the apical purse string (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A-B</xref>). Using high-power, single-timepoint imaging of live tissues, we could resolve the full extent of these cables, revealing they spanned the entire apicobasal axis and colocalised with actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Based on their localisation, orientation, and composition, we refer to these structures as lateral cables.</p><p id="P10">Due to phototoxicity, it was not feasible to continuously image GFP-tagged myosin II along the full length of the lateral cables at high laser power and with high spatial-temporal resolution. We therefore focused on the apical portion of the lateral cables where signal intensity was strongest, and quantified myosin II intensity throughout wound healing. Compared to baseline apical myosin II intensity, lateral cables exhibit significantly lower intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). However, compared to baseline lateral myosin II intensity before wounding, lateral cable myosin II intensity increases by 50% within 5 min post-wounding and then remains stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>’). In contrast, the apical purse string sharply increases, reaching nearly 3-fold the baseline apical myosin intensity before gradually declining as healing progresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Given their geometry and continuity with the apical purse string, lateral cables were strong candidates for generating vertical tension at the wound edge to shorten cells. To test their role in force generation, we performed targeted nano-ablations of the cables and quantified the impact on apical indentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Simultaneous severing of all lateral cables (lateral ablation, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>) caused the apical surface to recoil upwards, whereas nano-ablation of cortical regions away from the lateral cables (control ablation, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>) caused minimal recoil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). We discarded nano-ablation experiments where cells were killed (Supplementary Methods). In the absence of any ablation (sham ablation), we observed a small increase in apical indentation depth, as would be predicted if proceeding closure was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F-H</xref>). Overall, specific severing of lateral cables produced significantly higher recoil velocities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>). These results suggest that the apicobasal axis is placed under increased tension by the lateral cables, which indent the apical surface.</p><p id="P12">Following nano-ablation, we also quantified both the apical wound area and purse string myosin II intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I-K</xref>). Lateral ablation led to an increase in apical wound area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J</xref>) and a decrease in mean myosin II intensity in the apical purse string, whereas neither effect was seen in control and sham ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that lateral actomyosin cables contribute to the mechanical stability and maintenance of wound closure speed as well as the apical purse string during wound healing.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>A 3D Vertex Model Predicts Cooperative Forces Accelerate Wound Closure</title><p id="P13">To decouple the individual contributions of the apical purse string, lateral cables and intercalation during wound healing in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc, we developed a novel 3D vertex model. To create the initial geometry of the tissue, we started from a segmented flat 2D image of the wing disc epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] which we extruded to generate a full 3D tissue geometry with a height equivalent to 45μm. A key innovation of our model is the ability to support intercalations in 3D, allowing for dynamic changes in apico-basal topology and the emergence of scutoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, and Supplementary Methods). When a T1 transition occurs on either the apical or basal surface, a scutoid often forms. To account for this, the model dynamically generates a new face between the two cells involved, localised only to the surface domain where the T1 takes place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, green arrow).</p><p id="P14">Since, initially in our model, both apical and basal surfaces have the same topology, we performed several intercalations in the basal surface to introduce topological differences between the apical and basal surfaces. This generated an initial state where approximately 50% of cells were scutoids, with a more regular polygonal distribution apically than basally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). Each cell is modelled as a 3D polyhedron with bulk and surface area elasticity, a substrate attachment term and a cell shape deformation term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). We included additional line tension terms to model the purse string and lateral cables as independent actomyosin pools. In the resting state, all line tensions are set to zero. Because the geometry derived from segmentation may not be mechanically equilibrated, we first simulated vertex dynamics until the tissue reached a steady-state pre-wound configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, t=0, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We then performed an <italic>in silico</italic> wounding experiment by ablating 10 cells in the middle of the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), modelling them as debris with altered mechanical properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). The model was parameterised using experimental data to reproduce key features of the experimental wound healing data observed <italic>ex vivo</italic>. These included strong recoil at approximately 6 minutes after the ablation, and apical indentation, intercalation and apical wound area closure over the first 60 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Further, we used experimentally measured myosin II intensities of purse string and lateral cables as a proxy for their contractile strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. We could replicate common 2D mechanical features (n=4 simulations with different topologies) such as peak recoiling at 6 minutes, apical wound area percentage decay rate, and apical junction loss rates as those observed in the <italic>ex vivo Drosophila</italic> wing disc during the first 60 minutes post-wounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Given the experimental complexity of selectively perturbing individual contributions <italic>ex vivo</italic>, particularly distinguishing between spatially distinct myosin II pools, we used our novel computational model to predict wound healing dynamics in the absence of the apical purse string, lateral cables and intercalations, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D-D”</xref>). Using four different control geometries, we ran simulations for each perturbation and compared wound healing by normalising closure velocities. All the velocities were normalised with regard to their corresponding control geometry simulation.</p><p id="P17">The strongest impairment in wound healing occurred when the purse string was removed, indicating that it is the primary driver of tissue repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D’</xref>, and Supplementary Movie 2). This aligns with its role as a contractile cable acting predominantly in the X–Y plane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], whereas lateral cables generate force along the apicobasal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Notably, eliminating either lateral cables (Supplementary Movie 3) or intercalations (Supplementary Movie 4) also significantly reduced healing efficiency, consistent with model predictions showing a complete loss of apical indentation in the absence of lateral cables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Unexpectedly, the model also revealed that removing lateral cables impaired cell intercalation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>”), suggesting that these structures may facilitate tissue remodelling by reducing cell height while preserving cell volume. This highlights a previously unappreciated role for lateral cables in coordinating 3D tissue architecture during wound closure.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Lateral Cable Assembly and Apical Indentation Occurs Independently of the Apical Purse String</title><p id="P18">To experimentally test whether lateral cable formation is independent of apical purse string myosin II recruitment, we used a temperature-sensitive <italic>shibire</italic> (<italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>TS</italic></sup>) mutant to block dynamin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), which has previously been shown to prevent purse string assembly in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. As expected, wound closure slowed 2.5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B-B’</xref>) and apical purse string myosin II intensity was reduced by approximately 40% during the first 60 min of closure in <italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>TS</italic></sup> wing discs, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C-C’</xref>). Loss of apical junctions at the wound edge, which reflects cell intercalation events, was unaffected during this early stage of closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D-D’</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Interestingly, apical indentation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E-E’</xref>) and initial lateral cable formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>-G) were unaffected, indicating that lateral cable formation and cell shortening can occur independently of the apical purse string. Fewer lateral cables remained after 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>), while overall myosin II recruitment to individual lateral cables was not significantly altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). This indicates that myosin II stabilisation in lateral cables may require cooperation with the apical purse string.</p><p id="P19">To explore an alternative method to manipulate the tension of the purse string, we next asked how wound healing is affected when myosin II activity is hyperactivated. Previous work has shown that myosin II hyperactivation by Mbs RNAi balances the tissue tension between resting unwounded cells and the purse string [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. We find that hyperactivation of Myosin II via Mbs RNAi significantly impaired healing dynamics compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>). By 60 min, Mbs RNAi wounds remained 100% open, whereas control wounds had closed to 50% of their initial area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I</xref>). The wound closure rate in Mbs RNAi wounds was approximately 2.7-fold slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I’</xref>).</p><p id="P20">The dynamics of the apical purse string were also significantly altered, with apical purse string myosin II intensity peaking 2-fold above resting levels in Mbs RNAi wounds, compared to 3-fold in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4J</xref>). While myosin II intensity then gradually declined in control wounds, it remained constant in Mbs RNAi wounds, indicating prolonged myosin II stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4J’</xref>). This reduced response likely reflects constitutively elevated myosin II levels due to impaired myosin phosphatase activity, consistent with our previous findings that Mbs RNAi elevated both purse string and resting tensions to maximum levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].</p><p id="P21">In line with our earlier work, wound edge apical junction loss was significantly decreased by more than half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4K-K’</xref>). Additionally, 3D cell shape changes were impaired, with apical indentation showing a decreasing trend and occurring approximately 3.2-fold more slowly in Mbs RNAi wounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4L–L’</xref>). Although the number of lateral cables per wound did not differ significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4M</xref>), their mean myosin II intensity declined by approximately 20% after 60 min in Mbs RNAi wounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4M-N</xref>). This intensity was also significantly lower than controls at 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4N</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Although lateral cables still formed, the declining myosin II intensity over time suggests that dynamic turnover is required to maintain their stability and contractility to drive apical indentation. By hyperactivating myosin II, we force the tissue to maximise its global myosin II pool at the apical surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] and as a result, lateral cable myosin II declines. These findings highlight how the spatial organisation of the overall myosin II can impact 3D cell shape changes during wound repair. However, the precise <italic>in vivo</italic> distribution and relative contribution of myosin II across apical, lateral, and basal domains remain difficult to resolve experimentally.</p><p id="P23">To decouple these mechanisms and systematically test their effects, we turned to our 3D vertex model. Based on previous quantifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]), we decreased the strength of the purse string by 40% to model shi<sup>TS</sup>, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). The model recapitulates the experimental trends in apical wound area closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B’ and 4O</xref>) and apical indentation in both mutants compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E’ and 4Q</xref>). In contrast, to model Mbs RNAi we increased the apical surface tension by an additional 40% and reduced the purse string and lateral cable strength by 21% compared to the in silico control. Whilst the model recapitulated the percentage of apical wound edge cells in Mbs RNAi, the model predicted that shi<sup>TS</sup> wounds would have less apical wound intercalations than was measured experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D’ and 4P</xref>). We hypothesise that tissue-level fluctuations or anisotropies may contribute to the number of intercalations over time. For example, uniaxial cyclic stretching has been linked to T1 transitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] and elevated temperatures increased membrane fluctuations and fluidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Thus, in the absence of such fluctuations or anisotropies in our model, we expect to measure fewer intercalations compared to <italic>ex vivo</italic> conditions such as in the temperature-shifted shi<sup>TS</sup> experiments.</p><p id="P24">Together, these findings reveal a critical mechanical balance between purse string tension and background cortical tension. Both impaired purse string assembly via shi<sup>TS</sup> and excessive myosin II activation via Mbs RNAi disrupt wound closure by stabilising cortical tension, thereby limiting 3D shape change and dynamic myosin II remodelling (Supplementary Movie 5 and Supplementary Movie 6). Our results also establish that lateral cables contribute to intercalation and tissue indentation, with their function compromised when myosin II dynamics are perturbed, as seen in both mutants.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Basement Membrane Deformation Correlates with Lateral Cable Myosin II Intensity</title><p id="P25">Building on our findings that lateral cables assemble independently and contribute to apical shape changes, we next explored their role in shaping the basal surface and Collagen-IV-rich BM. To understand how the basal tissue surface deforms during wound healing, we used live imaging of the BM and myosin II at the basal side of wounds over time. We computationally extracted the BM as a single layer, based on Collagen-IV-associated pixel intensities. To provide a tissue scale description of BM deformation, we first quantified the relative change in BM height within the field of view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Unexpectedly, on average, we failed to observe any pronounced change in BM height until approximately 60 min after wounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>), after which the BM gradually deformed, leading to the characteristic domed shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>) we previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, magenta). We next described local BM deformation by quantifying the mean curvature in 1µmx1µm square bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Similarly to BM height, there was no significant change in total mean curvature during the first hour after wounding. After this point, however, the BM began to bend inward, and its curvature became increasingly negative, particularly around the edge of the wound, indicating that the surface was curving toward the apical side of the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, 119min). This inward bending coincided spatially with the appearance of lateral actomyosin cables close to the BM surface as revealed by high-power, single-timepoint imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). This suggested that the basal surface, like the apical domain, may be subjected to forces generated by contraction of the lateral cables. To confirm that the pattern of basal deformations indeed matches the spatial distribution of lateral actomyosin cables, we correlated mean curvature with suprabasal myosin II intensity 2 µm above the BM. We found that myosin II intensity was strongly correlated with BM curvature towards the apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p><p id="P26">To provide mechanical insight to basal wound dynamics, we used our new 3D vertex model to explore dynamic characteristics that were inaccessible to 2D models, such as the basal tissue indentation or basal wound area during wound repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B-D</xref> and Supplementary Movies 1-6). Notably, when a cell intercalates away from the wound edge apically, it may remain at the wound edge basally, giving rise to an increased number of scutoids over time. Interestingly, the 3D vertex model predicted that both apical and basal indentations do not occur without lateral cables, highlighting their essential role in driving cell shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>). Furthermore, one of the computational model’s parameters is the strength of substrate adhesion, where we modelled the adhesion as an elastic spring attached to a given Z plane, mimicking an underlying substrate such as the BM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). When this adhesion was removed before wounding, basal indentation increased significantly in our computational model as the wound closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref> and Supplementary Movie 7), reaching approximately 6 µm at 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5I</xref>). This basal indentation is substantially greater than the basal indentation measured in control in silico wounds with a substrate adhesion term reaching approximately 3 µm at 60 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, Supplementary Movie 1, and 7).</p><p id="P27">To investigate the adhesion between lateral cables and the basal surface in our <italic>ex vivo</italic> wing discs, we imaged Talin, a key adapter protein that links Integrin adhesion complexes to the actomyosin cytoskeleton at the basal surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. We found that myosin II forms a ring around Talin puncta, which pepper the basal surface of the wing disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H-H’</xref>). There were occasional ‘torpedo-like’ myosin II structures projecting away from the basal surface in XZ, which were possible lateral cables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H”</xref>). The colocalization of these myosin II torpedoes with Talin suggests that Talin may serve as anchoring points for the lateral cables.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Computational Model Predicts Integrin-Adhesion Complex Perturbation Alters Cell Shape</title><p id="P28">We disrupted the proposed attachment of the lateral cables to the BM by either knocking down Talin using RNA interference (Talin RNAi) or expressing a dominant-negative form of the βPS integrin subunit (Integrin DN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Because changes in BM height and curvature did not become apparent until 60 minutes after wounding, we extended imaging to 120 minutes post-wounding. Apical wound healing appeared mostly unaffected by Talin knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B-F</xref>). However, the mean LC myosin II intensity failed to increase between 10 min and 60 min after wounding, compared to controls, suggesting that Talin may stabilise cable contractility at later time points without being essential for their assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>). By 120 min after wounding, the mean LC myosin II intensity decreases to match myosin II levels quantified in the control lateral cables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>). We verified these results using a second Talin RNAi line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Surprisingly, we found that Integrin DN wounds healed as quickly as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B-B’</xref>) despite reduced purse string myosin II dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C-C’</xref>), apical junction loss rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D-D’</xref>), and apical indentation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E-E’</xref>). Integrin DN also reduced the mean LC myosin II intensity compared to controls 60 min and 120 min after wounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>). This suggests that while integrin-based anchorage is not required for cable formation, it may modulate cable function and BM coupling during later phases of repair, similarly to Talin.</p><p id="P30">As imaging and quantifying BM deformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) in Integrin DN is experimentally challenging due to the tight folds of the tissues, preventing a clear area surface to extract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], we instead used our model to test the effect of removing substrate adhesion on <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc cells on wound repair. We removed the substrate adhesion and modified lateral cable strength, according to <italic>ex vivo</italic> observations. We assumed all lateral cables apply the same force throughout, and the number of cables is constant over the first hour of closure; we computed the force applied by multiplying the average intensity per cable by the number of cables. Therefore, the force exerted by them in the control would be 3.1 at 60 minutes, Talin RNAi 4.3, and Integrin DN 2.1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). We found that our 3D computational model successfully predicted apical wound area closure in both mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6H</xref>). The model predicted similar apical wound edge cell dynamics between the control and both Talin RNAi and Integrin DN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6I</xref>), unlike <italic>ex vivo</italic> Integrin DN results. Interestingly, the model predicted that Talin RNAi wounds would apically indent faster than the control, following the same trend as <italic>ex vivo</italic> data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E’ and J</xref>). In contrast, the model accurately predicted that Integrin DN wounds would apically indent more slowly than controls. To obtain these predictions, the in silico model required both Talin RNAi and Integrin DN wounds to basally indent more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6K-L</xref>, Supplementary Movie 8-9) than control simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, Supplementary Movie 1). We hypothesize that basal indentation compensates for the reduced apical indentation rate in Integrin DN wounds to maintain normal wound healing. Due to weakened BM attachment, the basal surface can deform more easily with weaker lateral cables.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">Our findings redefine the classical 2D model of epithelial repair by identifying a previously unrecognised contractile system that generates tension in the third dimension. Using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc, we show that wound edge cells undergo active apicobasal shortening while conserving volume, driving planar expansion into the wound gap. This 3D shape change is driven by the formation of lateral actomyosin cables, contractile structures that span the apicobasal axis and mechanically integrate with the apical purse string.</p><p id="P32">We confirmed the role of lateral cables using a newly developed 3D vertex model that incorporates substrate adhesion and scutoid geometries as a novelty. Our model simulations demonstrate that coordinated apical and lateral contractility accelerates wound closure, whereas loss of either slows repair. Notably, apical indentation and lateral cable assembly persist even in the absence of an apical purse string, as shown in both the model and experimentally using <italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>TS</italic></sup>. A particularly interesting finding is the prevalence of cell-cell intercalations in <italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>TS</italic></sup> despite the absence of a purse string. Contrary to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], these results indicate that intercalations do not depend on apical contractility and cell elongation alone. Our work suggests that changes 3D cell shape, particularly, in the Z axis, such as the lateral cables, may affect the frequency of T1 transitions. The independence of cell intercalation and cell elongation was also suggested by Casani et al., where impaired endocytosis prevented cell-cell intercalation, but not cell elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. The <italic>in silico</italic> model predicts that loss of lateral cables specifically impairs cell intercalations, emphasizing the importance of the lateral domain in shaping <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc during repair. We propose that while the apical purse string primarily drives closure in the XY plane, lateral tension plays a crucial role by facilitating cell volume preservation and aiding cell-cell intercalations. To preserve volume, cells must shorten along the apicobasal axis and elongate along the XY plane. As cells elongate, intercalations help to relax local tissue tension, promoting global tissue remodelling and faster wound closure. This cooperative mechanism offers a conceptual framework for how vertically oriented tissues might efficiently heal in 3D.</p><p id="P33">Interestingly, although tissue stiffness is known to delay wound closure by restricting apical intercalation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], weakened BM adhesion under Integrin DN may promote tissue deformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Normally, wound edge cells are anchored basally to the BM, forcing them to rearrange apically to relieve tissue tension generated by the contracting purse string. When BM adhesion is weakened, as in Integrin DN tissues, basolateral domains gain freedom to deform and accommodate shape changes, compensating for the reduced need for apical rearrangement. We use our model to show that wound edge cells without BM adhesion increase their basal deformation to resume normal closure. These effects may not be needed for wound closure in flatter tissues, such as the previously described <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. This freedom to deform likely affects myosin II arrangements, as seen by decreased mean LC myosin II intensity in our Integrin DN wounded tissues. We note that lateral cable myosin II contractility may be inhomogenously exerted along the apicobasal axis. This is challenging to confirm as it is infeasible to accurately quantify myosin II intensity along the apicobasal axis due to the dramatic cell height and its light scattering. The height also presents challenges in performing further nanoablations of the lateral cables to measure recoil in different parts of the cable.</p><p id="P34">These findings raise further questions about the role of the BM not just as a passive substrate, but as a dynamic mechanical interface that regulates the spatial distribution of tension during tissue repair. Our results suggest that weakened basal adhesion alters cell shape dynamics and mechanical tension distribution, highlighting the BM as an active regulator of 3D wound repair rather than just a passive substrate. We further speculate that BM composition or stiffness could influence the assembly, stability, or function of lateral actomyosin cables and associated remodelling at the basal surface, thereby modulating the transmission of basal tension. However, how extracellular matrix stiffness precisely tunes junctional remodelling remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. To support these insights, we developed a novel, flexible 3D vertex model that integrates scutoid cell geometry and substrate adhesion. This model can be broadly applied to study other epithelial tissues with complex 3D architectures. Altogether, our work expands the paradigm of epithelial wound healing from a 2D phenomenon to a multi-axial, 3D coordinated response.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>STAR Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Experimental model and study participant details</title><p id="P35">Drosophila stocks and crosses were raised on conventional cornmeal media at 25°C or 18°C for shibireTS stocks.

Left shows three cells forming an apico-basal intercalation. Right shows two cells with the scutoid face more visible. Yellow arrow is the face centre that connects two cells without an apico-basal transition between them. Green arrow is a face centre representing a scutoid face connecting two cells only at the apical side. Note that white cell displays the discretization in the model, showing all the vertices and their edges in black. Grey curved lines represent the BM. B) Representative tissue dynamics over time after ablation at t=0. At t=6, the tissue recoils only apically, increasing its wound area. At t=60, the tissue closes the wound and indents. Debris cells are represented with pale white colours. Cell colour scale indicates their volume. Black dotted lines highlight the tissue contours. C) Wound healing dynamics of in silico simulations (black, n=4) and ex vivo movies (orange, n=7) for 60 min.
