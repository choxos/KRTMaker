In <italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</italic> and many other members of Proteobacteria, the two-component system NifL-NifA controls the expression of <italic>nif</italic> genes that encode the nitrogen fixation machinery. The NifL-NifA system evolved the ability to integrate several environmental cues, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon availability. The nitrogen fixation machinery is thereby only activated under strictly favorable conditions, enabling diazotrophs to thrive in competitive environments. Whilst genetic and biochemical studies have enlightened our understanding of how NifL represses NifA, the molecular basis of NifA sequestration by NifL depends on structural information on their interaction. Here, we present mechanistic insights into how nitrogen fixation is regulated by combining biochemical and genetic approaches with a low-resolution cryo-EM map of the oxidized NifL-NifA complex. Our findings define the interaction surface between NifL and NifA and reveal how this interaction can be manipulated to generate bacterial strains with increased nitrogen fixation rates able to secrete surplus nitrogen outside the cell, a crucial step in engineering improved nitrogen delivery to crop plants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>biological nitrogen fixation</kwd><kwd>transcriptional regulation</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>structural modeling</kwd><kwd>sustainable agriculture</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">To meet current demands for global food production, agriculture relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Nitrogen fertilizer enabled the Green Revolution and has been one of the main drivers for exponential population growth since the mid-50s. However, synthetic nitrogen fertilizer production and distribution accounts for a large proportion of energy use worldwide, consuming 3%–5% of the world's natural gas production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Currently, an estimated 12 Gt/year of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents is released into the atmosphere from the industrial production of ammonia. This represents around 1.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. The engineering of more efficient delivery of fixed nitrogen by free-living soil bacteria that can associate with cereal crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] is a viable alternative to current practices, enabling more sustainable agriculture. In <italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</italic> and many other Proteobacteria, the expression of <italic>nif</italic> genes encoding the machinery for biological nitrogen fixation is controlled by the non-canonical two-component system NifL-NifA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. In the NifL-NifA system, the regulatory signal transduction does not involve phospho-transfer between the two components, as NifL does not have phosphorylation activity, and NifA does not have a receiver domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Instead, regulatory outputs are driven by stoichiometric interactions between NifL, NifA, and the global signal transduction protein, GlnK, in response to the oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon status in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p><p id="P5">NifA is a σ<sup>54</sup>-dependent bacterial enhancer binding protein (bEBP) that activates transcription of the nitrogen fixation (<italic>nif</italic>) genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Its central domain comprises the AAA+ ATPase domain responsible for ATP hydrolysis-dependent stimulation of open-complex formation at σ<sup>54</sup>-dependent promoters. NifA also has a HTH DNA-binding domain at its C-terminus, and a regulatory GAF domain at its N-terminus, which can bind 2-oxoglutarate to mediate the carbon signal transduction response. NifL is an anti-activator protein homologous to sensor histidine kinases in canonical two- component systems that does not hydrolyse ATP or function as a kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. In its N-terminus, NifL comprises two in tandem PAS domains, namely PAS1 and PAS2, whilst the C-terminus contains kinase-like DH and GHKL domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Under oxygen-excess conditions, the FAD moiety within the PAS1 domain of NifL is oxidized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], leading to a series of conformational changes that allow NifL-NifA complex formation and thereby inhibits promoter activation by NifA by preventing its oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). NifL has a second PAS2 domain that does not bind FAD and instead is involved in transmitting conformational changes from the PAS1 domain to the DH and GHKL domains in the NifL C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. The DH domain, referred to as the DHp (dimerization and histidine phosphotransferase domain[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]), in histidine protein kinases involved in NifL oligomerization, whilst the GHKL domain regulates NifL activity by binding either ADP and ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. As the K<sub>d</sub> for ADP is at least 10x higher than that of ATP, NifL acts as a sensor of the energetic status of the cell in which binding of ADP stimulates the interaction with NifA under conditions unfavorable for nitrogen fixation.</p><p id="P6">Regulation of NifA activity by nitrogen and carbon levels in organisms that encode NifL also requires the PII signal transduction protein GlnK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). In <italic>A. vinelandii,</italic> under conditions of nitrogen excess, a ternary GlnK-NifL-NifA complex is formed to inhibit NifA activity depending on the GlnK uridylylation state relative to the nitrogen status of the cell (for comprehensive reviews, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]). A NifL-NifA complex can still be formed when NifL is reduced and GlnK is uridylylated under nitrogen-limiting conditions if the cellular carbon levels, and hence the 2-oxoglutarate levels, are low. The binding of 2-oxoglutarate, an allosteric effector at the interface of carbon and nitrogen metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], to the GAF domain of NifA is required for the activator to escape inhibition by NifL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). This provides an additional layer of complexity to the NifL-NifA regulation that ensures activation of nitrogen fixation, a highly energy demanding process, is only triggered under carbon-rich conditions; for example, when the bacterium closely interacts with crop plant roots and can benefit from carbon-rich exudates.</p><p id="P7">Biochemical and genetic studies have provided important insights into how the NifL-NifA system integrates diverse regulatory inputs to regulate nitrogen fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. However, efforts to manipulate this system predictably to engineer diazotrophs with enhanced ability to fix nitrogen and release ammonia to benefit crop nutrition have been hampered by the lack of structural information. We recently obtained structural snapshots of the dynamic structural changes in NifL that lead to the inhibition of NifA using SEC-SAXS and protein labeling followed by mass spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Although methods of NifL-NifA complex purification have been known for decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], structural characterization of this complex has remained elusive.</p><p id="P8">In this study, we obtained a low-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction of the NifL-NifA complex that is consistent with a confident structural prediction. Extensive mutagenesis allowed us to confirm the interaction interface between NifL and NifA that provides insight into the inhibitory conformation of NifL that can hold NifA in an inactive state. This insight allowed reinterpretation of previously obtained mutant phenotypes and enabled the isolation of novel variants with sought-after properties in <italic>A. vinelandii</italic>. Substitutions of amino acids comprising the surface of interaction in either NifL or NifA led to de-regulated expression of nitrogenase, resulting in the release of excess ammonia outside the bacterial cell. This underpins a strategy to engineer synthetic associations between associative diazotrophs and plants that deliver fixed nitrogen directly to cereal crops.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Purification and structural characterization of the NifL-NifA complex</title><p id="P9">Following our previous SEC-SAXS-guided analysis of the structural dynamics of <italic>A. vinelandii</italic> NifL dimer in the oxidized and reduced states bound either to ADP or ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], we sought to determine the structure of the oxidized ADP-bound NifL dimer in complex with NifA to get further insights into how NifL represses activation of nitrogen fixation genes. A previously established protocol for NifL-NifA preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] was optimised to achieve high yields of the protein complex under oxidizing conditions and in the presence of ADP. Affinity chromatography and two rounds of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) were found to improve protein complex homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The peak fraction of the SEC eluate was analysed by mass photometry to assess NifL-NifA complex stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The main observed mass distribution was approximately 240 kDa, consistent with a NifL-NifA complex comprising two monomers of NifL and two monomers of NifA. This mass estimate contrasts with a previous assessment suggesting that the complex was formed by a tetramer of NifL and a tetramer of NifA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. As discussed previously, for the structural characterization of <italic>A. vinelandii</italic> NifL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], we propose that analytical SEC overestimates the molecular mass due to the elongated complex structure described below.</p><p id="P11">We sought to determine the structural architecture of the purified NifL-NifA complex by single-particle cryo-EM. Two-dimensional class averages revealed an elongated particle ~180 Å in length, which is comparable to the previous structural characterization of the NifL dimer alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. After further processing, a reconstruction was obtained to an average resolution of ~6.5 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, E</xref>). However, the generation of a high-resolution 3D volume for the complex was beyond the limitations of the data, since the particle images were noisy, displayed conformational heterogeneity, and suffered from orientational bias. The reconstruction was consistent with part of a structural prediction of NifL-NifA complex generated with 2:2 stoichiometry using AlphaFold3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). In the structural prediction, two NifL subunits are in a two-fold symmetric arrangement. The extended central axis is comprised predominantly of intertwined α-helices with a pair of PAS1 domains at one end of the complex, a pair of PAS2 domains at the midpoint, and a pair of GHKL domains at the opposing end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The reconstruction revealed significantly less density for NifA, and we were only able to model the AAA+ domain of a single subunit into the density, interacting with the GHKL and the central DH domains of NifL. This domain is predicted to be the only part of NifA that interacts directly with NifL in the model. It has the highest pLDDT scores, and the PAE plot shows reasonable confidence in the placement of this domain with respect to the C-terminal portion of NifL. Whilst the N-terminal GAF domain and the C-terminal HTH domain of NifA are predicted to be structured, the PAE plot indicates no confidence in their placement with respect to the AAA+ domain or the rest of the complex. However, the lack of a resolvable second NifA subunit is intriguing. The AlphaFold3 model predicts that the N-terminal GAF domain and C-terminal HTH domain of NifA are not anchored to the core of the complex. Could one or both of these apparently mobile domains have a tendency to associate with the air-water interface and either initiate the complete unfolding of the NifA subunit or simply detach it from the complex. Given that the two NifA subunits lie on opposing sides of the complex, perhaps in the majority of cases, only one NifA subunit per particle is affected, thereby giving rise to the asymmetric particles we observed.</p><p id="P12">Despite the limited resolution of our cryo-EM model analysis, it nevertheless provides orthogonal, experimental support for the predictive models generated by AlphaFold3 and, therefore, a robust three-dimensional framework for the interpretation of the wealth of genetic and biochemical data on this system. The overall architecture of the NifL-NifA complex provides a structural explanation for the sequestration and inhibition of NifA by NifL. The observed interaction with NifL precludes the formation of the predicted NifA hexamer that is required to activate the transcription of nitrogen fixation genes. AlphaFold models suggested that the architecture of the NifL-NifA complex is conserved across the phylogenetic spectrum of nitrogen-fixing proteobacteria that utilize this regulatory system, enabling the identification of conserved amino acid motifs in the interaction surface between NifL and NifA pairs in diverse diazotrophs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Biochemical and genetic characterization of the NifL-NifA interaction surface</title><p id="P13">To confirm that the DH and GHKL domains of NifL and the AAA+ domain of NifA are sufficient for the NifL-NifA interaction, a truncated NifL<sub>269-519</sub>-NifA<sub>188-445</sub> complex was purified to homogeneity in the presence of ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). In contrast to observations with the full-length complex, the estimated mass inferred from SEC correlated well with mass photometry (approximately 120 kDa), indicative of a more compact, globular structure of the truncated components as predicted from the structural model. Consistent with the structural model, full-length NifA co-purified with truncated NifL lacking the N-terminal PAS domains (NifL<sub>269-519</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>), and full-length NifL co-purified with truncated NifA containing only the AAA+ domain (NifA<sub>188-445</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To understand the functional contribution of individual residues at the predicted NifL-NifA interface, we performed extensive site-directed mutagenesis guided by the structural model. Selection of residues for substitution was further guided by the identification of conserved amino acid motifs in the predicted interaction surface between NifL and NifA pairs in diverse diazotrophs, since AlphaFold models suggested the architecture of the NifL-NifA complex is likely conserved across the phylogenetic spectrum of nitrogen-fixing proteobacteria that use this regulatory system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). An overview of the <italic>A. vinelandii</italic> NifL-NifA interface is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref> with substituted amino acids indicated. Residues close to the nucleotide-binding pockets of each subunit were avoided as they likely impart functional roles other than only complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B–C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>].</p><p id="P15">A previously established two-plasmid system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] was used to determine the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of single amino acid substitutions in the <italic>A. vinelandii</italic> NifL and NifA proteins expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain ET8000 using a <italic>nifH::lacZ</italic> fusion as a reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D, E</xref>). Analysis of NifL variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>) revealed that in all cases, amino acid substitutions increased NifA activity, as the reported β-galactosidase activity was always higher in the mutants compared to the wild-type under limiting nitrogen conditions (-N). A similar trend of increased relief of NifA inhibition, and therefore altered ability of NifL to interact with NifA, was observed under excess oxygen (+O2) conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). However, in contrast, under excess nitrogen conditions (+N), several of the variants maintained the ability to inhibit NifA, at least partially, particularly in the case of alanine substitutions, indicating that the specific side chain is not crucial to the interaction under these conditions, in contrast to charge-chain substitutions at these positions that alleviated inhibition, presumably as a consequence of electrostatic repulsion (e.g. NifL substitutions at E298, R323 and E488). We attribute these differences in oxygen and nitrogen responses to the nature of the protein complexes formed in response to environmental signals, since alanine substitutions can evidently de-stabilize the NifL-NifA complex formed under oxidizing conditions, but not the GlnK-NifL-NifA complex formed under conditions of nitrogen excess. Quantitative western blot analysis of protein extracts derived from the same cultures used to measure β-galactosidase activity revealed that the substitutions did not significantly influence the expression levels of either NifL or NifA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Analysis of the influence of NifA substitutions on inhibition by NifL was more challenging because the predicted contacts with NifL are located in the catalytic AAA+ domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5, A, E</xref>). Nevertheless, we identified substitutions that impeded regulation by NifL and retained high NifA activity in the absence of NifL, indicating that catalysis was not impeded by these substitutions. In some cases, the activity of NifA variants followed a similar pattern to those observed for the NifL mutants described above. For the NifA residues K230, E356, E360, and E366, charge reversing substitutions led to complete escape from regulation by NifL in repressing conditions (+N and +O<sub>2</sub>), whereas substitutions to alanine resulted in repression only in the presence of excess nitrogen (+N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Interestingly, some NifA variants, for example, P257A, R258D, and N373A were constitutively repressed by NifL even under permissive nitrogen-limiting conditions. This cannot be explained by a deficiency in NifA activity since these variants (indicated by asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>) were fully active in the absence of NifL. Quantitative western blot analysis indicated that the activity patterns observed are unlikely to represent the influence of the amino acid substitutions on the stability of the proteins because, in almost all cases, we observed no differences in NifL and NifA stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Structure-guided mutagenesis of NifL and NifA enables unregulated expression of <italic>nif</italic> genes and ammonia secretion in <italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</italic></title><p id="P17">Following up on our analysis of NifL and NifA mutant activities in a heterologous expression system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D, E</xref>), we further analyzed the nitrogen response of selected variants when expressed from their native genomic location in <italic>A. vinelandii</italic>, using a dual translational <italic>PnifH::GFP::LUX</italic> reporter fusion located at a neutral site (<italic>algU</italic>) in the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] to quantify <italic>nif</italic> gene expression.

Since escape from nitrogen feedback regulation is likely to result in ammonium excretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], a desirable trait for engineering more efficient diazotrophs, we also measured the ammonia concentration in culture supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). In contrast to the native <italic>nifLA</italic> background strain (Av_646), most of the variants exhibited levels of <italic>nifH</italic> expression under excess nitrogen (+N, black bars) comparable to the levels of expression of the wild-type under limiting nitrogen conditions (-N, pink bars, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>).

Most variants that ablated nitrogen feedback regulation and exhibited substantial nitrogenase activity in the presence of excess nitrogen, were also able to excrete ammonia in the millimolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Overall, these results in <italic>A. vinelandii</italic> correlate well with the nitrogen regulation data observed in the heterologous <italic>E. coli</italic> system.

For example, NtrC1 from <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] and NorR from <italic>E.</italic> <italic>coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] are negatively regulated <italic>in cis</italic> by their N-terminal regulatory REC and GAF domains, respectively. PspF from <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], a bEBP lacking an N-terminal regulatory domain, is negatively regulated <italic>in trans</italic> by interaction with its anti-activator partner, PspA. Interestingly, PspA does not interfere with the oligomerization of PspF. These proteins can form a complex comprised of six PspF monomers and six PspA monomers that can still interact with the RNA polymerase closed complex but are deficient in ATP hydrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Similarly, the regulation of AAA+ activity in NorR does not involve a change in the oligomerization state. The GAF domain, in hexameric DNA-bound NorR, negatively regulates the activity of the AAA+ domains by preventing access of the surface-exposed loops to σ54 of RNA polymerase. Upon nitric oxide binding, the GAF domain relieves repression of the AAA+ domain, enabling ATP hydrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>].</p><p id="P19">In this study, we uncovered the molecular basis of the interaction between the inhibitory form of the anti-activator protein NifL and the bEBP NifA from <italic>A. vinelandii</italic>. The oxidized form of NifL sequesters NifA monomers into a tetrameric NifL2:NifA2: complex, facilitated by stochiometric levels of NifL and NifA expression. The binding of ADP to the GHKL domain, which induces conformational changes in the C-terminal region of NifL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], is required to stabilize the complex and is likely to contribute to the extensive interaction surface involving both the GHKL and DH domains of NifL.</p><p id="P20">Although nucleotide binding by the AAA+ domain of NifA is unlikely to be impeded in the complex, ATP hydrolysis is prevented by the separation of NifA protomers to opposite sides of the NifL dimer. Formation of the catalytic site for ATP hydrolysis in bEBPs, requires interactions <italic>in trans</italic> between residues in adjacent AAA+ domain protomers, normally positioned in a “back-to-front” configuration in the hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). A precedent for negative regulation of bEBPs <italic>in trans</italic> by protein partners is observed for the analogous tetramer formed between the FleQ bEBP and the anti-activator FleN from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Similar to the NifL-NifA complex, the FleN dimer is sandwiched between the AAA+ domains of FleQ, and results in a conformational change in FleQ that prevents ATP binding and productive interactions with σ<sup>54</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>] under certain conditions. In contrast to regulation via anti-activator-bEBP interactions, control of catalytic activity in the NtrC1 bEBP occurs through intramolecular interaction between the REC and AAA+ domains, which is regulated by phosphorylation. In the non-phosphorylated dimeric form of NtrC1, the AAA+ domains are held together by a REC domain dimer in a configuration that prevents catalysis. Phosphorylation is predicted to alter the conformation of the REC domain, leading to the formation of an active heptamer in which the AAA+ domains assemble in a “back-to-front” configuration that favors ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In order for NifA to escape inhibition by NifL under conditions favorable for nitrogen fixation, conformational changes in both proteins are likely to be required. We have previously demonstrated that reduction of the FAD cofactor in the PAS1 domain results in a more kinked conformation in which the relative orientation of the GHKL and DH domains apparently changes to restrict access to NifA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Moreover, the GAF domain of NifA has an important role in enabling NifA to escape NifL inhibition via a conformational change induced by the binding of the ligand 2-oxoglutarate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. In the cryo-EM map presented here, we could not observe density corresponding to the GAF domain in the full-length complex modeled by AlphaFold. This is potentially due to the high flexibility of the helical linker connecting the GAF domain to the AAA+ domain, which may have added to the challenge of fully resolving the structure of this complex to a higher resolution. Further attempts to stabilize this inhibitory complex by adding a third protein, GlnK, that contributes to nitrogen signaling, may stabilize the complex into a form more amenable to high-resolution cryo-EM in the future.</p><p id="P22">The structural similarity between NifL and histidine protein kinases (HPKs) raises questions concerning the evolution of these proteins and the role of their structurally conserved C-terminal GHKL and DH domains, which constitute the catalytic core of HPKs. The signal transduction mechanism of HPKs involves activation via rotation of the GHKL domain (otherwise known as the CA or catalytic domain). This enables either <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> autophosphorylation of the conserved histidine residue in the DHp domain and docking of the response regulator adjacent to the phosphorylated histidine to enable phosphotransfer to the response regulator. Substantial rotations of the GHKL domain and changes in the conformation of the DHp helices accompany the transition from the phosphotransferase state to the phosphatase state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). In contrast, the oxidised NifL-NifA complex is inherently more stable than the transient interactions between HPKs and response regulators and has a buried surface area of 1745 Å<sup>2</sup>, reflecting the extensive interactions between the GHKL and DH domains of NifL with NifA.</p><p id="P23">Our extensive functional analysis of single amino acid substitutions in the NifL-NifA interface not only uncovers the importance of specific amino acid chains for stabilization of the complexes formed between NifL and NifA but provides a blueprint for engineering control of nitrogen fixation in diverse diazotrophs, since the NifL-NifA interaction surface is likely conserved across a broad phylogenetic range of nitrogen-fixing proteobacteria. Structure-informed single amino acid changes confer advantages over harsher approaches, such as deleting <italic>nifL</italic>, since they enable controlled modulation of NifA activity, rather than unregulated runaway <italic>nif</italic> expression in <italic>nifL</italic>-null mutants that results in a severe growth phenotype or, in some cases, lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>].

Hence, data analysis presented a significant challenge. Single particle reconstruction was performed using CryoSPARC v4.5.3. Manual particle picking was not possible; thus particles were picked from the whole dataset using an elliptical blob picker. From these, a set of eight templates were produced after 2D classification, which were then used for template-based picking and, after one round of further 2D classification, yielded a stack of ~2.2m particles. The classes revealed an elongated particle with high-resolution features, although there was also some blurring at the extremities. The best 2D-classes were fed into an ab initio reconstruction job with four classes requested, and all outputs were passed directly into a heterogeneous refinement job. This gave two classes that showed features consistent with AlphaFold models of the NifL-NifA complex. Both of these classes were independently taken forward for further classification and refinement using the same workflow, but one resulted in a significantly less complete reconstruction and was thus abandoned. The particles comprising the superior class from the heterogeneous refinement job yielded a stack of 743k particles after re-extraction to 1.48 Å/pixel.

There was a complete absence of density for one of the NifA subunits, even when the map contour level was lowered considerably, and there was significantly less density for the other NifA subunit compared to that which would be expected from the AlphaFold3 model.

This was then subjected to real space refinement in PHENIX, with the imposition of Ramachandran restraints as well as restraints to the input model. The latter restraints were subsequently turned off for a final PHENIX real space refinement job after adding hydrogens using phenix reduce.

enabling NifL to adopt an inhibitory conformation that is competent to inactivate NifA. (B) Under limiting oxygen conditions, the FAD cofactor is fully reduced (FADH2), triggering conformational changes in NifL that prevent interaction with NifA, releasing its activity. In the reduced state, NifL can still inhibit NifA in response to the levels of nitrogen and carbon as signaled by glutamine (Gln) and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG), respectively. (C) Under nitrogen excess conditions, non-uridylylated GlnK stimulates the formation of the GlnK-NifL-NifA complex that inhibits NifA activity. (D) Upon a shift to low nitrogen (signaled by low Gln levels), GlnK is uridylylated (GlnK-UMP). Under optimal carbon supply, a reduction in Gln is accompanied by an increase in 2-OG levels. Under these conditions, the NifA GAF domain is saturated with 2-OG, allowing for the complete dissociation of the complex and the release of NifA activity. (E) Under nitrogen excess conditions, the GlnK-NifL-NifA ternary complex is stable even if the GAF domain in NifA is saturated with 2-OG in carbon-rich conditions. (F) Under nitrogen limitation, if 2-OG is limiting, an inhibitory binary complex between NifL and NifA can still be formed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206307-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Purification and structural analysis of the oxidised NifL-NifA complex, prepared in the presence of ADP.</title><p>(A) size exclusion chromatography (SEC) elution profile of the NifLA complex.

Two copies of the NifL sequence could be fitted to the density (salmon and purple cartoons), with the exception of the first twenty residues and the last two, forming a two-fold symmetric arrangement. Only a single copy of the NifA AAA+ domain (residues 210-458; green cartoons) could be modelled interacting simultaneously with the NifL GHKL domain and the DH domain. The separated subunits on the right are coloured by domain in accordance with the respective schemes in the panels below. The locations of the FAD and ADP ligands are indicated (yellow and cyan van der Waals spheres respectively). These were predicted from the starting AlphaFold3 model and assumed to be present, but there was insufficient detail in the 6.45 Å-resolution reconstruction for them to be resolvable in the density. Note the distinctive constriction roughly at the junction of the upper and lower halves formed by opposing helices from the DH domains of the two NifL subunits; this is clearly visible in the 2D classes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206307-f003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Purification of truncated versions of the NifL-NifA complex allows identification of the surfaces essential for the interaction.</title><p>(A) Co-purification of NifL269-519 and NifA188-445.

We have added this second copy for comparison with the other structures (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). There is no experimental structure of the active form of NifA, but a hexameric assembly of the AAA+ domain can be predicted by Alphafold3 with good confidence (ipTM = 0.68, pTM = 0.72). (B) In the FleN-FleQ complex (PDB code 7EJW) the FleQ AAA+ domains are separated by a central FleN homodimer (in the image shown, ADP molecules are added for reference purposes only – these were not present in the experimental structure). The activated FleQ AAA+ domains form a right-handed helical assembly, repeating every six protomers (PDB code 5EXT). (C) In the NtrC1 dimer (PDB code 1NY5), the C-terminal AAA+ domains (green and yellow) are kept apart by the N-terminal receiver domains (salmon and purple), and the activated AAA+ domains form a heptameric assembly (PDB code 1NY6).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS206307-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
