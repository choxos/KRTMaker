While the pathways underlying seizure rhythmicity remain poorly understood, it seems likely that a contribution from the biological clock is involved. A better understanding of any such contribution may translate to better treatments. Here, the influence of the 24 h circadian rhythm on seizure activity in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is investigated. Seizure-susceptible bang-sensitive <italic>julius seizure</italic> (<italic>jus</italic>) mutants were subjected to mechanically induced seizure at six different <italic>zeitgeber</italic> points. A clear sex-dependent phenotype was observed, with seizure severity showing a greater time-of-day effect in females, than males. The temporal pattern of seizure recovery time was bimodal, exhibiting both a morning and an evening peak. Rearing flies in constant light, which renders the molecular clock dysfunctional, abolished the seizure rhythm. Conversely, female seizure mutants reared in constant darkness, allowing free running of the circadian clock, continued to exhibit a bimodal rhythm of seizure severity. These findings support a role for the biological clock in seizure activity, at least in female <italic>Drosophila.</italic> Thus, this study validates <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a potential model for the identification of mechanisms modulating seizure rhythmicity, with the potential to aid future treatment of epilepsy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>circadian rhythms</kwd><kwd>seizure severity</kwd><kwd>locomotor activity</kwd><kwd>bimodal</kwd><kwd>sleep disturbance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder, affecting ~50 million people worldwide (WHO, 2024). Epilepsy is characterised by recurring seizures, the clinical manifestation of abnormal, excessive and/or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Fisher <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014</xref>). The most common treatment is antiseizure medications (ASMs), the large majority of which target ion channels or neurotransmitter signalling, acting to restore excitatory-inhibitory balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Löscher and Schmidt, 2011</xref>). However, despite more than thirty ASMs being developed, one third of people with epilepsy (PWE) remain drug refractory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sultana <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>). This underscores the need to identify novel targets and/or better ways to use existing ASMs.</p><p id="P3">Circadian rhythms are a fundamental aspect of biology; an internal timekeeping system that generates 24 h variations in most cellular, physiological and behavioural processes. Circadian rhythms drive temporal patterns in processes critical for the initiation and spread of seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Meisel <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>). Thus, the relevance of circadian rhythms to epilepsy, and potential for treatment, is evident. Two of the most comprehensive databases of human seizures, SeizureTracker and NeuroVista, report 80% and 92% of PWE exhibiting seizures under circadian regulation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Karoly <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>). Seizure occurrence and/or severity occur at fixed daily timings in most individuals. However, previous attempts at describing such temporal patterns have also uncovered significant variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Leguia <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>). Seizure rhythmicity is shown to depend on the cortical lobe in which seizure onset occurs, seizure type, age, chronotype of patients, and sleep-wake cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kaleyias <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cho, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">van Campen <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>). Altogether, these factors reduce the accuracy of circadian rhythm evaluation in mammals, as well as complicate the distinction of circadian rhythm effects on epilepsy from other influences.</p><p id="P4">The fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> provides a favourable model for studying circadian control of seizure severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Johan Arief <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>). Clock cells that orchestrate circadian rhythms in adult flies consist of ~240 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Reinhard <italic>et al.,</italic> 2024</xref>), compared to the central circadian pacemaker suprachiasmatic nucleus with ~100,000 neurons in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Swaab, 2003</xref>) and ~20,000 neurons in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Varadarajan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>). Despite the evolutionary distance, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human genomes are highly conserved, and molecular pathways implicated in human diseases can be modelled and studied in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> including epileptiform activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cunliffe <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>). For example, <italic>bang senseless</italic> (<italic>bss</italic>) <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants, carrying a gain-of-function mutation in the <italic>paralytic</italic> (<italic>para</italic>) gene coding for a voltage-gated sodium channel (Na<sub>v</sub>), exhibit seizures that resemble those of Na<sub>v</sub>-associated pharmacologically resistant epilepsies in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Parker <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011</xref>). More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> (2018)</xref> reported that exposing <italic>Drosophila</italic> to the ASM phenytoin during nighttime decreased seizure burden compared with daytime administration, reproducing the nighttime application of phenytoin to PWE which similarly decreases seizure burden and associated adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Yegnanarayan, Mahesh and Sangle, 2006</xref>). Thus, the study of circadian rhythms contributing to seizure severity in fly seizure models has the potential to lead to significant progress in chronoepileptology.</p><p id="P5">Circadian rhythms are driven by clock genes, functioning as a molecular clock. Clock gene expression is altered in human epileptogenic brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Li <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Wu <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>), and the manipulation of clock genes influences the rhythmicity of seizures in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Gerstner <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014</xref>). Therefore, clock genes have been suggested to be important determinants of seizure activity. Despite the differences between the mammalian and fly molecular clock components, forward genetic screens have revealed a conserved mechanism that operates in key central pacemaker neurons to generate circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Hardin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Stanton, Justin and Reitzel, 2022</xref>). Ever since the first clock gene <italic>period (per)</italic> was cloned and characterised in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, this organism has been a model of choice for understanding how the molecular clock regulates rhythmic neuronal activity. Overall, <italic>Drosophila</italic> provides significant potential for the study of clock genes and neuronal excitability, involved in seizure initiation and propagation.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we explored the interplay between circadian rhythms and seizure severity in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> to provide evidence of circadian rhythms contributing to seizure phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> models of epilepsy. We report that bang-sensitive (BS) <italic>julius seizure</italic> (<italic>jus</italic>) flies exhibit a bimodal circadian rhythm of seizure severity. This effect is larger and more pronounced in females. The influence of the circadian clock is abolished under constant light (LL), but not under constant darkness (DD) conditions, as would be predicted if seizure activity is regulated by the molecular clock. As a result, our findings spotlight <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model for identifying the mechanism(s) modulating seizure rhythmicity.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Fly Stocks</title><p id="P7">Flies were maintained on a standard cornmeal medium (5 L water, 390 g glucose, 360 g maize, 250 g yeast, 40 g agar, 135 mL nipagin, 15 mL propionic acid) at 25°C under a 12:12 hour light-dark (LD) cycle, unless otherwise stated.

Light in LD was 1700 lux, and 1000 lux in LL, measured using a Thorlabs PM100A Power Meter.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Seizure Induction: Vortex Assay</title><p id="P9">Seizure severity of 7 d old (± 16 h) flies (of both sexes) was measured via vortex assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kuebler and Tanouye, 2000</xref>). Testing was conducted at <italic>zeitgeber</italic> times (ZT) 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20; ZT 0 indicating the onset of the light phase and ZT 12 the onset of the dark phase. In constant conditions, flies were tested at circadian times (CT). Flies were kept in LL or DD for 7 days prior to testing. Testing was conducted within one hour of each time point, equally spread across the 60 min for each lighting condition, genotype and sex. To assess seizure severity in mutants and CS (used as controls), food vials sealed with flugs (packed cotton bungs) were placed upside down (such that flies stood on the flugs) and vortexed on a standard laboratory vortex mixer at maximum speed for 10 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bermudez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). A total of eight vials (six flies per vial), per ZT, were vortexed for each genotype and sex. Seizure recovery time was measured as time required to regain posture and mobility for each fly. Seizure recovery time was used as a proxy for seizure severity; a higher recovery time indicated a more severe seizure.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Locomotor Activity and Sleep: DAM system</title><p id="P10">Circadian locomotor activity and sleep of female flies was measured using the Drosophila Activity Monitor (DAM) 5M software (TriKinetics Inc., Waltham, MA). Seizure mutant <italic>jus</italic> female flies (and CS used as controls) were collected upon eclosion (± 16 h), anesthetised with CO<bold>2,</bold> and transferred individually into DAM tubes (5 mm diameter, 65 mm length) using a fine paintbrush. Tubes were prepared by adding ~5 mm standard cornmeal medium (see above) to one end of the tube, sealed with a rubber cap, and a small cotton plug to the other end. Before any recordings started, flies were allowed 24 h to adapt to the new tube. DAM monitors with 32 flies per genotype, and per lighting condition, were initially entrained for 3 days in LD, followed by 5 days of either DD or LL. Experiments were run at 25°C, and an environmental monitor (DEnM; Trikinetics Inc.) was used to monitor conditions. Locomotor activity of flies was summed into 1-min bins. Flies that died before the end of the experiment were excluded from analysis. In all experiments, data are from flies collected and run concurrently (per lighting condition). DAM circadian and sleep data were analysed using the Sleep and Circadian Analysis Matlab Program (SCAMP, MATLAB 24.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Vecsey <italic>et al.,</italic> 2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="P11">Statistics were performed in GraphPad Prism (10.4.1). All data obtained were tested for normality and equal variances using Shapiro-Wilk and Brown-Forsythe tests, respectively, before any further statistical analyses were carried out. Sample sizes for vortex assays were determined from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Mituzaite <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>). Outlier tests were performed on vortex assay data to remove obvious outliers following ROUT 1% criteria. To determine the effect of ZT or CT (in the case of LL and DD data) on seizure recovery time, one-way ANOVA (or the equivalent non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, or Welch’s ANOVA for unequal variances) were used. Cubic spline curves were generated from means to visualize circadian rhythms in seizure severity. To compare recovery times between lighting conditions, two-way ANOVA was performed. To compare circadian locomotor activity and sleep data obtained from SCAMP between lighting conditions, one-way ANOVA (or the equivalent non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, or Welch’s ANOVA for unequal variances) was performed. Flies were considered rhythmic when the calculated rhythmicity index (RI) was greater than 0.3, weakly rhythmic for RI values between 0.1 and 0.3, and arrhythmic when RI was less than 0.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sundram <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012</xref>).

These mutants are defective for an uncharacterized protein-coding gene <italic>CG14509</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Horne <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>) and show prolonged seizures when subjected to a strong mechanical shock that simultaneously activates sensory input from peripheral hairs. However, this mutation does not show spontaneous seizures. Male and female <italic>jus</italic> flies, under (12:12) LD conditions, were subjected to vortex assay to induce seizures at ZT 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20, and recovery times measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The recovery time of CS, measured at the same time, was significantly lower than <italic>jus</italic> mutants, independent of sex (Kruskal-Wallis tests, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), thus validating the seizure phenotype observed.</p><p id="P13">Recovery time from induced seizure in <italic>jus</italic> showed a sex-dependent bias. Here, <italic>jus</italic> females showed a statistically significant effect of ZT on seizure recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, Kruskal-Wallis test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Dunn’s multiple comparison tests revealed significant differences between ZT 0-4, ZT 0-8, ZT 4-20, ZT 8-12, and ZT 8-20 (full descriptive statistics and <italic>p</italic> values are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). By contrast, males showed no statistically significant differences in recovery time (i.e., seizure severity) across time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, Kruskal-Wallis test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.39). To further examine the temporal pattern of <italic>jus</italic> seizure severity, spline curves were generated from vortex assay data. In females, cycles of seizure recovery exhibited a bimodal rhythm, exhibiting two peaks (ZT = 12.5 h and ZT = 22.7 h) and two troughs (ZT = 6.9 h and ZT = 16.2 h) across the 24 h day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Notably, spline curves generated for males also showed a similar temporal pattern, however, with a much smaller effect size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that seizure severity tested by the vortex assay is influenced by ZT, with an effect size that is larger in female <italic>jus</italic> mutants.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Bimodal Rhythm Abolished in Constant Light but Maintained in Constant Darkness</title><p id="P14">To provide additional evidence for a contribution of circadian time to seizure recovery, we determined the effects of altering the molecular clock. Under conditions of constant light (LL), <italic>Drosophila</italic> are arrhythmic because of continuous degradation of the protein TIMELESS (TIM) by its interaction with CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Marrus, Zeng and Rosbash, 1996</xref>). Thus, the expectation, in keeping with a contribution from the molecular clock, is that under LL a bimodal pattern of seizure severity would be absent. We focused attention to <italic>jus</italic> females because of the larger effect size. Indeed, <italic>jus</italic> females reared under LL showed no significant difference in recovery times between circadian timepoints (CT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>, Kruskal-Wallis test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.26). Therefore, time of the day did not influence seizure severity of <italic>jus</italic> females in LL.</p><p id="P15">Under conditions of constant darkness (DD), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> molecular clock free-runs (Konopka and Benzer, 1971). Maintenance of a bimodal rhythm of seizure severity under DD would, thus, further support our hypothesis of a contribution from the molecular clock to seizure severity. Indeed, seizure recovery times of <italic>jus</italic> females maintained under DD were significantly influenced by CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C-D</xref>, Welch’s ANOVA, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Dunnett’s multiple comparison tests showed significant differences between recovery times at CT 4-8, CT 4-20, and CT 16-20 (full descriptive statistics and <italic>p</italic> values are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, time of the day influenced seizure severity of <italic>jus</italic> females in DD. The temporal pattern of seizure severity was circadian, exhibiting two peaks (CT = 4.1 h and CT = 15.3 h) and two troughs (CT = 8.7 h and CT = 21.8 h) across the 24 h day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). However, the timing of peaks and troughs, and therefore the phase of the DD cycle, was shifted to ~4 h later relative to the LD cycle. Taken together, these results validate the hypothesis that the circadian clock governs seizure severity in <italic>jus</italic> females.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Circadian Locomotor Activity Complements Seizure Rhythmicity Findings</title><p id="P16">To further support the possible contribution of the circadian clock to seizure activity, locomotor activity of <italic>jus</italic> females was measured via the TriKinetics system under the same lighting conditions as vortex assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-C</xref>). In LD conditions, adult flies showed an expected bimodal circadian rhythm of locomotion, exhibiting morning and evening peaks of activity at ZT 0 and ZT 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The average period length was 23.95 h, and 89.3% of flies were rhythmic (88% of which were strongly rhythmic), with an average 0.36 ± 0.03 rhythmicity index (RI) and 2.82 ± 0.21 rhythmicity strength (RS). Conversely, when kept in LL conditions, 48% of <italic>jus</italic> females were arrhythmic and 52% were only weakly rhythmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Locomotor activity of <italic>jus</italic> females in LL was below standard rhythmicity thresholds, with a 0.091 ± 0.02 RI and 0.72 ± 0.13 RS. Lastly, when kept under free-running DD conditions, 96.3% of flies were rhythmic (76.9% of which were strongly rhythmic) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). The average period length of flies was 24.19 h, with an average 0.33 ± 0.02 RI and 2.61 ± 0.15 RS. Here, it is worth noting that the activity profile of <italic>Drosophila</italic> in DD does not exhibit two distinctive peaks of morning and evening activity as in LD, but rather one merged peak of activity.</p><p id="P17">As controls, CS female flies were monitored under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D-F</xref>). In LD conditions, adult flies showed a circadian rhythm, like <italic>jus</italic> females, exhibiting morning and evening peaks of activity at ZT 0 and ZT 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). The average period length was 24.03 h, and 100% of flies were rhythmic (93.8% of which were strongly rhythmic), with an average 0.44 ± 0.02 RI and 3.43 ± 0.17 RS. In LL conditions, 69.2% were arrhythmic and 30.8% were only weakly rhythmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Locomotor activity of CS females in LL was below standard rhythmicity thresholds, with a 0.083 ± 0.02 RI and 0.65 ± 0.19 RS. On the contrary, when kept under free-running DD conditions, 95.8% of flies were rhythmic (69.6% of which were strongly rhythmic), the average period length was 24.75 h, and a 0.32 ± 0.02 RI and 2.51 ± 0.18 RS. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Thus, <italic>jus</italic> females described above behave as control CS flies. Here, it is worth noting that fly lines used for activity monitoring were not isogenic lines, thus meaningful comparisons can only be made within genotypes between conditions.</p><p id="P18">Comparisons of rhythmicity values of <italic>jus</italic> females across lighting conditions revealed RI and RS values in LL significantly lower than in LD and DD (Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparison tests, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 for both). No significant differences were found between rhythmicity values in LD and DD (Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparison test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.85). Therefore, this pattern of circadian locomotor activity validates that, as expected, the behaviour of <italic>jus</italic> females in LD and DD conditions is rhythmic, with a period of around 24 h, whilst arrhythmic in LL. Thus, complementing the loss of seizure severity circadian rhythms when <italic>jus</italic> females were reared in LL prior to vortex testing.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>LL and DD Increase Seizure Severity and Involve Sleep Disturbances</title><p id="P19">To determine whether LL and DD conditions had varying effects on the seizure severity of <italic>jus</italic> females, comparisons between these two lighting conditions to LD conditions were performed.

Dunnett’s multiple comparison tests showed a significant increase in seizure severity in LL and DD at all timepoints tested (full descriptive statistics and <italic>p</italic> values are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Thus, both altered light regimes increase seizure severity of <italic>jus</italic> females, in addition to effects related to circadian rhythmicity.</p><p id="P20">Potentially, an increase in seizure severity could be related to sleep loss of <italic>jus</italic> females when kept in LL and DD conditions.

Sleep characteristics of <italic>jus</italic> females were monitored via the TriKinetics system during 5 days under LD, LL and DD lighting conditions. Here, it is worth noting that fly lines used for sleep monitoring were not isogenic. However, the following comparisons were performed within the same genotype, between different conditions. On average, the total amount of sleep <italic>jus</italic> females had per day in LL and DD was significantly lower than in LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparison test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, respectively, full descriptive statistics and <italic>p</italic> values are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).

Therefore, <italic>jus</italic> females in LL and DD exhibited more fragmented sleep, i.e., a higher number, but shorter duration, of sleep bouts, as well as sleep loss as indicated by the reduced total amount of sleep.

In humans, sex differences are evident in many epilepsies and seizure conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Hophing, Kyriakopoulos and Bui, 2022</xref>). Neurotransmission and synaptic function, which mediate neural activity, and thus seizure activity, are modulated in a circadian-dependent and sex-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Logan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022</xref>). Current evidence suggests that males exhibit greater overall susceptibility to excitability episodes and occurrence of seizures, whilst females exhibit greater fluctuations in seizure occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Reddy, Thompson and Calderara, 2021</xref>). The precise molecular mechanisms of this remain unknown, although most studies suggest the involvement of neuroendocrine factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Wang, Zhuo and Wang, 2023</xref>). The only sex differences reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> relating to epilepsy are at the transcriptomic level in pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure models, where females showed downregulation of genes related to the ribosomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Sharma, Mohammad and Singh, 2009</xref>). Thus, behavioural differences between males and females in seizure rhythmicity have not been previously reported. Given the sex differences observed in this study, future work on <italic>Drosophila</italic> male and female hormones could perhaps offer an opportunity to elucidate the mechanisms underlying sex differences in epilepsy.</p><p id="P22">Seizure severity of <italic>jus</italic> females followed a bimodal circadian rhythm, with two peaks and two troughs across the 24 h. In the context of <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the daily locomotor activity rhythm also follows a bimodal circadian rhythm, as shown by the circadian locomotor activity results of this study. Activity peaks at lights-on, ZT 0 termed "morning peak", and at lights-off, ZT 12 termed "evening peak" (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Miyasako et al., 2007</xref>; Chiu et al., 2010), precisely match the seizure severity peaks observed in <italic>jus</italic> female mutants at ZT 12, and close to ZT 24 (= ZT 0). Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF)-positive small ventrolateral neurons (s-LNvs) are the main pacemakers for <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian activity. Interestingly, these cells play a major role in driving morning peaks of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Miyasako, Umezaki and Tomioka, 2007</xref>), as well as in the regulation of the phase of other cells, such as pre-motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Liang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019</xref>). Peptides released by central pacemaker neurons (e.g., DH44 and Hugin) link the clock to motor outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">King <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>), thus modulating the locomotor activity rhythm. Increased synaptic excitation of motoneurons is associated with seizure activity in <italic>jus</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Marley and Baines, 2011</xref>). Hence, potentially, increased PDF-positive s-LNvs neural activity and excitability could underlie seizure peaks: thus, seizure burden following a bimodal circadian rhythm similar to locomotor activity. In addition, the vortex assay induces seizures by overstimulating <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory bristles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kuebler and Tanouye, 2000</xref>). Circadian regulation of sensory inputs, such as circadian rhythms in light sensitivity of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Vinayak <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>), could be involved in driving the seizure severity rhythm observed. To further substantiate the proposed bimodal circadian rhythm observed in BS females, a pharmacologically induced seizure model could be assessed. Wild type flies fed a proconvulsant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Stilwell <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006</xref>) could be tested at different times of the day, thus examining the reproducibility of the bimodal rhythm in alternative seizure models.</p><p id="P23">Having established a potential influence of time of day on seizure severity of <italic>jus</italic> females, this study sought to ablate the central clock to determine its role in seizure rhythmicity. Under constant illumination, <italic>Drosophila</italic> become arrhythmic due to constant degradation of dCRY upon photoactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Konopka, Pittendrigh and Orr, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Peschel <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009</xref>). Hence, the molecular clock becomes arrhythmic. BS females maintained in LL conditions showed no oscillation in seizure severity, indicative of an underlying contribution from circadian physiology.</p><p id="P24">Although constant light abolished seizure rhythmicity, photic masking could be involved in <italic>jus</italic> seizure activity. Circadian rhythms can be "masked" by other stimuli that are presented at predictable times of day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Gall and Shuboni-Mulligan, 2022</xref>), such as light, causing the direct enhancement or inhibition of locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lamont and Amir, 2009</xref>). To discriminate whether seizure rhythmicity of <italic>jus</italic> females is circadian-mediated or masked by light, flies were reared under free-running DD conditions. Results from this suggested an effect of circadian time on seizure severity despite the absence of light stimuli, implying an effect of circadian rhythms on seizure severity of <italic>jus</italic> females. Studies have shown that <italic>Drosophila</italic> free-running circadian rhythms in DD remain stable and persist with a period close to 24 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Plautz <italic>et al.,</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Johnstone <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022</xref>), similar to the circadian locomotor results in this study. Moreover, <italic>jus</italic> females maintained in free-running DD conditions exhibited a seizure severity rhythm with a longer period than in LD, thus seizure peaks were ~4 h later in the day. Regarding the locomotor activity of <italic>jus</italic> females monitored in DD, this also seemed to be shifted relative to the LD rhythm. However, under DD conditions, the ’siesta’ or inactivity period in the middle of the respective day is less pronounced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Mazzotta, Damulewicz and Cusumano, 2020</xref>). Hence, locomotor activity in DD did not show two peaks of activity like seizure severity, thus not being able to match locomotor activity to seizure severity profiles as in LD. Therefore, arguments for increased activity and nervous system excitability leading to increases in seizure severity cannot be extended to DD as in LD.</p><p id="P25">Interestingly, LL and DD conditions increased seizure severity independent of circadian time. As monitored by the TriKinetics system, such lighting regimes also led to sleep deprivation, measured by total sleep duration. Indeed, sleep deprivation is one of the most commonly reported factors associated with seizure occurrence in humans, increasing the risk of epileptic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Lawn <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Dell’Aquila and Soti, 2022</xref>). In addition, <italic>jus</italic> females in LL and DD also showed sleep fragmentation, as indicated by a reduced number of sleep episodes of shorter duration. Interrupted sleep in mice significantly increased severity of seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Grubač <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>). Sleep fragmentation is considered a contributing factor to brain hyperexcitability, increasing seizure susceptibility, and offering a potential explanation to the observed increase in seizure severity of <italic>jus</italic> females in LL and DD. Here, it is worth noting that females used were not selected to be virgins, and mating is shown to affect sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Geissmann, Beckwith and Gilestro, 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P26">In humans, nocturnal light is associated with sleep disturbances and sleep deprivation, which can increase the risk of epileptic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bonilla-Jaime <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Dell’Aquila and Soti, 2022</xref>). Constant light exposure also increases oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Rodrigues <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>), which is a critical factor involved in the initiation and progression of seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Shin <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011</xref>). Sleep deprivation causes an imbalance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and antioxidant responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hill <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>). Elevated ROS levels increase membrane excitability of <italic>Drosophila</italic> sleep neurones, dFB, by increasing the frequency of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kempf <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019</xref>). This is potentially via alterations of I<sub>A</sub> currents by <italic>Hyperkinetic,</italic> a β-subunit of <italic>Shaker</italic> (<italic>Sh</italic>) K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Ueda and Wu, 2008</xref>), leading to increased neuronal hyperexcitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Yao and Wu, 1999</xref>), and potentially increasing seizure severity. Of course, DD is an unnatural condition that may be regarded as a stressor. Mice under DD showed significant increases in stress hormones and HPA axis activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Singh <italic>et al.,</italic> 2023</xref>). Moreover, prolonged physical stressors such as social isolation and restraint of rodent models of epilepsy increase seizure frequency and reduce seizure threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Reddy, Thompson and Calderara, 2022</xref>). Therefore, a stressful environment such as DD could have increased the seizure severity of <italic>jus</italic> mutants.</p><p id="P27">In conclusion, this study provides evidence for an interplay between circadian rhythms and <italic>Drosophila</italic> seizure activity: a poorly understood phenomenon. Our findings suggest a potential bimodal circadian rhythm of seizure severity in female, but not male, <italic>jus</italic> files. Given that <italic>Drosophila</italic> is well-suited for investigating the relationship between circadian rhythms and seizure activity, future work should focus on the mechanism(s) modulating seizure rhythmicity downstream of clock genes. Excitingly, an enhanced understanding could lead to the targeting and prevention of seizure rhythmicity for the better treatment of epilepsy.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S14"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Sanjai Patel for his help with the TriKinetics system.
