PCO-catalysed dioxygenation of the N-terminal Cys of substrates, including Group VII Ethylene Response Factors (ERVIIs), targets them for degradation via the Cys/Arg N-degron pathway, however these substrates are stabilized in hypoxia due to reduced PCO activity. When plants are flooded, submergence-induced hypoxia results in ERFVII-mediated upregulation of hypoxia responsive genes that reconfigure plant metabolism and allow short-term resilience to the conditions. However, the increasing frequency and duration of flood events requires strategies to improve plant flood resilience, particularly amongst agronomic crops. One possibility is to prolong the stability of ERFVIIs by engineering the PCOs to catalyse their oxidation less efficiently. We report a structure-guided kinetic and biophysical investigation of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> PCO4 that reveals residues important for substrate-binding and catalysis. We subsequently selected <italic>At</italic>PCO4 variants Y183F and C173A, with severe and mild impacts on <italic>At</italic>PCO4 activity, respectively, to complement Arabidopsis <italic>pco1pco2pco4pco5</italic> plants and investigate their impact on submergence resilience. Both variants appeared to be beneficial for survival and recovery after 2.5 and 3.5 days of dark submergence when compared to control plants, indicating that engineering PCOs can be used as a strategy to improve flood tolerance in plants.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Floods are becoming more regular due to extreme weather events.

The lower iron occupancy of variant S107L may contribute to the lower activity of this variant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10B</xref>).

The increased <italic>ADH, PDC1</italic> and <italic>LBD41</italic> transcript levels observed for line Y183F, despite high <italic>AtPCO4 Y183F</italic> transcription, likely arise due to the significantly lower activity of <italic>At</italic>PCO4 Y183F compared to C173A <italic>in vitro</italic>.

To minimise the effect of different survival and recovery due to plant age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, plants with a 3-week Col-0 phenotype were chosen for the submergence experiment. The survival and recovery rates after submergence were evaluated during a 10-day recovery period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E – H</xref>). The results of the 2.5 days submergence experiment showed that more plants containing either <italic>At</italic>PCO4 C173A or Y183F survived and recovered than their Col-0 control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6, Figure S18</xref>, left panel).

Nevertheless, the occurrence of zero survival of wt-1 + Col-0 and C173A-1 + Col-0 in at least one of the two experimental repeats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S18</xref>, right panel), affected this statistic as well as the reduced survival rate for both lines, wt-1 and C173A-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). While the survival and recovery rates of wt-1 and C173A-1 were similar to their respective Col-0 plants, lines C173A-2 and Y183F appeared to survive and recover better after 3.5 days submergence than their Col-0 controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S18</xref>, right panel). Interestingly, a greater number of plants from line wt-2 survived (compared to its Col-0 control) after 3.5 days submergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>), however, the surviving plants did not seem to grow and gain as much biomass as plants with Y183F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S18</xref>, right panel).

While it is hard to dissect at which point during the submergence regime the decreased <italic>At</italic>PCO4 activity conferred the greatest advantage, the improved recovery implied that reduced <italic>At</italic>PCO4 activity was particularly beneficial during/after de-submergence. In this case, the reduced activity of <italic>At</italic>PCO4 C173A or Y183F could have provided plants with more time to adapt to the sudden increase in O<sub>2</sub> upon de-submergence. <italic>At</italic>PCO4 transcript levels also appeared to be important in controlling HRG transcript levels and submergence tolerance, indicating that both the absolute amount of enzyme as well as its intrinsic activity are important in determining ERFVII stability and HRG transcription. This is in accordance with previous data showing that <italic>At</italic>PCO4 is important for submergence tolerance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> Notably, reduced <italic>At</italic>PCO4 activity increased submergence tolerance to a greater degree when HRGs were not upregulated during normoxia, as was the case for C173A-2 compared to C173A-1, in accordance with previously published results that temporary but not constitutively stabilised ERFVIIs are able to increase submergence tolerance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> When ERFVIIs are stabilised during normoxia they promote fermentative metabolism, e.g., by inducing the transcription of <italic>ADH1</italic> and <italic>PDC1</italic>, which consumes carbohydrate resources, thus, fewer resources will be available for the plant during submergence leading to lower submergence tolerance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> This additional stress could potentially be observed in plants from line C173A-1 and resulted in reduced survival and recovery compared to line C173A-2. However, the submergence tolerance of C173A-1 was still improved after 2.5 days submergence compared to lines with <italic>At</italic>PCO4 WT.</p><p id="P25">Overall, our results demonstrate that engineered <italic>At</italic>PCO4 with lower activity has indeed the potential to upregulate HRG transcript levels and increase the submergence tolerance of plants. Although our experiments indicate that both absolute transcription levels and the catalytic ability of mutant PCOs are important in conferring improved submergence tolerance, ultimately editing genomic PCO sequences to introduce key mutations could negate the requirement to control for PCO transcript levels. Our study is a starting point to further engineer PCOs with more finely-tuned activities to balance stabilisation of ERFVIIs at the onset/offset of hypoxia and destabilisation during normoxia to avoid impacting yield. The high conservation of active site residues within the PCOs of flowering plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> means that the strategy can likely be applied to other PCOs in Arabidopsis but also agronomically relevant species; the occurrence of multiple PCO isoforms in many agronomically relevant species suggests the potential to fine-tune cultivars’ submergence tolerance and growth. In crops that are amenable to CRISPR-Cas gene editing methods, it may be feasible to introduce single amino acid substitutions to PCOs; a similar approach has been used to increase the resistance of tomatoes to late blight by altering an endogenous immune protease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> Additionally, tailoring the activity of PCOs could provide an advantage to other abiotic stresses like heat and salt stress as the Cys/Arg-N-degron pathway has been connected to both.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup> Ultimately, using an enzyme engineering approach to design, test and introduce targeted mutations into PCOs of agronomically relevant species could contribute to future food security amidst extreme weather caused by climate change.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="S10"><title>Site-directed mutagenesis and protein production</title><p id="P26">The thrombin cleavage site in pET28a(+)-His-thrombin-AtPCO4-1 from White <italic>et al</italic>. 2018 was exchanged to a TEV cleavage site by Genscript using the <italic>Ncol</italic> and <italic>Xhol</italic> restriction sites.
