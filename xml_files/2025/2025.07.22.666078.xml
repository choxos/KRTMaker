Despite their validation as important therapeutic targets, PLCβ isoforms are yet undruggable due to the difficulties to identify potent and selective modulators. Here, we addressed this question and used the autoinhibitory XY linker present in these enzymes as a source of peptide inhibitors of PLCβ activity. We report that peptides patterned after this motif inhibited PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis and the consequent calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum. In primary nociceptor cultures, active peptides notably attenuated bradykinin-induced electrogenesis and TRPV1 sensitization, thus reducing nociceptor hyperexcitability. Noteworthy, intraplantar administration of a lead peptide prevented inflammation and hypersensitivity in a mouse model of inflammatory pain. Collectively, our findings indicate that peptides patterned after the autoinhibitory XY linker act as selective PLCβ inhibitors with <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activity, providing pharmacological tools for this enzyme family.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PLCβ</kwd><kwd>XY linker</kwd><kwd>peptide inhibitors</kwd><kwd>TRPV1</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>nociception</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>pharmacological tool</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Phospholipases C (PLC) catalyze the hydrolysis of phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP<sub>3</sub> binding to its receptors promotes calcium release from intracellular stores, while DAG activates protein kinases C (PKC). These second messengers trigger a wide range of intracellular events, ranging from ion channel modulation to exocytosis or cell proliferation and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The family of mammalian PLC includes six subtypes of isozymes with different isoforms: β (1-4), γ (1,2), δ (1,3,4), ε, ζ and η (1,2), each one with tissue-specific expression patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">PLCβ isoforms are relevant in somatosensory perception of exogenous and endogenous stimuli, and in neurotransmission to the central nervous system. Several studies have proved PLCβ expression, especially the PLCβ3 isoform, in different neuronal subpopulations of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. In these cells, PLCβ isoforms modulate neuronal excitability through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), as they are differentially activated by Gα<sub>q</sub> and Gβγ subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the PLCβ pathway modulates Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channel activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. This type of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable non-selective cation channels work as molecular sensors of thermal, mechanical and chemical stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. By far, the best-characterized member is the vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1), gated by the vanilloid compound capsaicin, noxious heat (&gt; 43°C), acidic pH or depolarizing voltages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. TRPV1 is expressed in subpopulations of Aδ and C-fibers, where it is a key detector and transducer of painful stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Upon injury, peripheral tissues release pro-inflammatory mediators and sensitize nociceptors, leading to hypersensitivity and inflammatory pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. These agents activate multiple sensitizing mechanisms, which are orchestrated by GPCRs-PLCβ pathways. A prominent example is TRPV1 sensitization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Activation of PKCε downstream of PLCβ phosphorylates serine residues in TRPV1, lowering the activation threshold to its activating stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. This effect synergizes with the PLCβ-induced reduction in PIP<sub>2</sub> levels to promote TRPV1 sensitization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Furthermore, some pro-algesic agents increase the exocytosis of vesicles carrying TRPV1, rising its expression on the neuronal surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Given the pivotal role of PLCβ in this inflammatory sensitization, peripheral PLCβ modulation is a valuable approach for the development of anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive drugs.</p><p id="P5">Currently, the aminosteroid U73122 ((1-(6-((17β-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl)-1<italic>H</italic>-pyrrole-2,5-dione)) is widely used as a specific PLC inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. However, many studies have demonstrated the lack of specificity of this compound and off-target inhibitory effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, partly due to its ability to alkylate cysteine groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Additionally, U73122 modulates TRP channels through a PLC-independent mechanism, being a potent agonist of TRPA1 and TRPM4 and a blocker of TRPM3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Due to the off-target effects of U73122 and the involvement of PLCβ proteins in multiple signaling pathways, development of selective PLCβ inhibitors is crucial for understanding PLCβ-mediated cellular processes and for developing potential therapeutic agents.</p><p id="P6">The structure of PLCβ isoforms includes a N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain, four tandem EF hands, a catalytic triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel domain, a C2 domain and an exclusive C-terminal region with a proximal and a distal domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Traditionally, the search of enzyme inhibitors was focused on compounds targeting the active site. Unfortunately, this protein region is well preserved among PLC isozymes and this complicates the identification of selective modulators. For instance, high-throughput screening pipelines identified three hit compounds that inhibited the activity of purified PLCβ3, but also of PLCδ1 and PLCγ1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, nothing else is known about them. Another strategy for PLCβ inhibition was based on the necessary interaction with Gα<sub>q</sub> proteins for PLCβ activation. Long peptides based on the helix-turn-helix motif in the proximal domain of PLCβ3, which contacts with Gα<sub>q</sub>, disrupted this protein-protein interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. However, through this site, Gα<sub>q</sub> also interacts with other proteins such as p63RhoGEF, and these peptides also inhibited their activation. Altogether, these complications have prevented druggability of PLCβs.</p><p id="P7">In this scenario, two independent autoinhibitory mechanisms precisely regulate PLCβ isoforms to maintain a low basal activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The Hα2<sup>’</sup> helix located in the proximal CT domain interacts with a region close to the active site and inhibits its enzymatic activity, until this Hα2<sup>’</sup> helix is displaced by Gα<sub>q</sub> binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Additionally, the XY linker connecting X and Y regions of the TIM barrel catalytic domain blocks the active site when PLCβ is inactive. This autoinhibitory loop is composed of an unconserved N-terminal region, followed by a high number of negatively-charged residues and an ordered region. This includes a short 3<sub>10</sub> helix known as lid helix that occludes the active site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Upon PLCβ activation, protein recruitment to the cell membrane promotes removal of the lid helix from the active center, driven by electrostatic repulsions between the acidic part of the linker and the negative charge on the membrane surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Thus, these autoinhibitory regions are unexploited targets for development of selective PLCβ modulators.</p><p id="P8">Here, we describe the discovery of small peptide analogues patterned after the XY linker as modulators of PLCβ enzymatic activity. We report that peptides derived from this autoinhibitory region bind to PLCβ isoforms and significantly inhibit their activity, as evidenced from PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis and intracellular calcium transients. Additionally, inhibition of the PLCβ pathway in a neuronal model attenuates bradykinin-induced action potential firing and TRPV1 sensitization. Finally, the best peptide in terms of activity and solubility shows promising anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activity in a murine model of inflammatory pain. Collectively, our findings indicate that peptides patterned after the autoinhibitory XY linker act as selective PLCβ inhibitors, that can be tailored for other PLC isoforms to provide lead compounds for this family of undruggable targets.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>PLCβ peptides patterned after the autoinhibitory XY linker</title><p id="P9">Using computational techniques of molecular modelling, we designed peptide analogues of the XY linker to inhibit the activity of PLCβ isoforms. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, only a small region at the C-terminal end of the XY linker is crystallized in the PLCβ3 structural model (PDB code: 3OHM). This flexible region covers catalytic domain surface where the active center of PLCβ isoforms is located. In a first step, the XY linker was fragmented into smaller overlapping peptides sequentially moving from the N-terminus to the C-terminus with an offset of 1 amino acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Consequently, a set of shortened peptides containing 4 to 10 amino acids were selected from the XY linker using the structural context of PLCβ. This strategy allowed selected peptides to be bound to PLCβ3, while the remaining XY linker was removed. A total of 70 peptide-PLCβ3 complexes were modelled, and the interaction was graded by estimating the theoretical binding free energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>). Normalization by peptide length suggests that small peptides (6-mer) exhibited values similar to longer peptides. Therefore, we focused on 6-mer peptides as they may exhibit more favorable physicochemical properties such as solubility, stability, and membrane permeability than longer counterparts.</p><p id="P10">The 6-mer peptide with the most negative binding energy, and thereby the best interaction, was 585-NATEEM-590 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). This fragment comes from the C-terminus of the XY linker, distant from the active center. In this peptide, M590 is buried in the structure of PLCβ3, being a potential anchor point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). The other 6-mer peptides with the best binding energies are at the N-terminus of the XY linker (575-TDEGTA-580 and 576-DEGTAS-581). These fragments are derived from the XY region known as lid helix that physically blocks the active site of the protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. In this region stands out residue E583, which is inserted into the binding interface, and it could be critical for the interaction with PLCβ3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Additionally, we focused on peptides having strong binding energies containing E583 (581-SSEVNA-586 and 579-TASSEV-584), together with peptide 585-NATEEM-590.</p><p id="P11">Using this overlapping selection, the whole crystallized sequence of the XY linker was considered in the design strategy.</p><p id="P12">The binding of 6-mer peptides to the PLCβ3 catalytic center was evaluated in a sequence space search to obtain peptides with an improved theoretical binding free energy. Using a virtual mutagenesis approach, position-specific scoring matrices for each peptide were obtained with a prediction of the binding free energy of the 20 natural amino acids at each position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Heat maps depict restrictive positions colored in red, where only specific residues fit, and permissive positions colored in blue, where the 20 amino acids show an optimal interaction. An example of a restrictive position in peptide 585-NATEEM-590 is M590 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). This residue is buried in a binding pocket, that only can accommodate the methionine or a hydrophobic amino acid. In contrast, S581 and S582 in peptide 579-TASSEV-584 are clear examples of permissive positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). They are oriented towards the opposite direction of the PLCβ3 binding surface allowing almost any amino acid to be fitted. A selection of the best amino acids per position in terms of binding energy with different physicochemical properties were combined to obtain new sequences with an increased theoretical binding affinity, always keeping wild-type residues in permissive positions to save computational time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Designed peptides obtained with their predicted binding energies can be found in the supplementary file Source_data.zip. Most of them show an improved binding energy compared to their corresponding wild-type sequence. For each wild-type peptide selected, a designed peptide ranked into the top 10 of binding energies, with a balance of polar and hydrophobic amino acids or positive and negative charges, was evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Potential non-covalent interactions of wild-type and designed peptides to the PLCβ3 surface were predicted with the PLIP software. Peptide 579-TASSEV-584 (PL2002) interacts with PLCβ3 through residue E583, whose side chain forms a salt bridge with the amino group of the K468 side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), and creates a hydrogen bond with the N-group of the peptide bond between N414 and E413. Notably, the designed sequence 579-IYSSNV-584 (PL2005) improves its binding free energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). The substitution of the alanine at position 580 by a tyrosine introduces a π-π interaction with the aromatic Y648 side chain. Besides, Y580 forms a hydrogen bond through its hydroxyl group with the imidazole of H332. The interchange of the critical E583 by an asparagine does not seem to affect the binding, creating a new hydrogen bond with the E413 side chain, whose γ-carbon also interacts with the Y580 aromatic ring.</p><p id="P14">The main anchor site for peptide 581-SSEVNA-586 (PL1621) is the residue E583, similarly to 579-TASSEV-584 (PL2002) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). In the designed peptide 581-SSMTNY-586 (PL2003), a new hydrogen bond is created through the interaction of the hydroxyl group of Y586 with the amino group of the R470 side chain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3D</xref>). Moreover, the aromatic ring of Y586 contacts with the β-carbon of K468. The mutant threonine introduced at position 584 establishes another hydrogen bond with D417 side chain and with the carbonyl group of the peptide bond between D417 and V416.</p><p id="P15">Finally, peptide 585-NATEEM-590 (PL2001) binds to PLCβ3 through the buried M590 and other contact points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). A586 establishes hydrophobic contacts through its side chains with the γ-carbon of R470 and the β-carbon of K468. The hydroxyl group of T587 forms a hydrogen bond with the guanidinium group of R470, while the β-carbon of its side chain contacts with the γ-carbon of Q422. Although E588 is not oriented to the binding surface, the deprotonated carboxyl group of its side chain at physiological pH could interact with the protonated guanidinium group of R470 through a salt bridge. Beyond, β and γ carbons of E589 interact with the side chain of A426 and A423, respectively. Interestingly, in the designed peptide 585-NKMEMF-590 (PL2004), phenylalanine introduction in the buried position 590 allows a T-shaped π-stacking interaction with the F412 aromatic side chain, and hydrophobic contacts with V465 and L593 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>). Substitution of A586 by a lysine introduces a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of the peptide bond between K469 and R470.</p><p id="P16">In summary, six PLCβ peptides based on the autoinhibitory XY linker were computationally designed. These include three peptides with the wild-type XY sequence and their respective designed peptides with improved theoretical affinity by increasing the number of non-covalent interactions with the binding surface.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>PLCβ derived peptides inhibit PLCβ-mediated intracellular calcium transients</title><p id="P17">The inhibitory effect of PLCβ-modulating peptides was assessed recording the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients triggered after PLCβ activation by the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 3 (m3AChR), endogenously expressed in HEK293 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Stimulation with acetylcholine (ACh) elicited a robust calcium response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Given the potential effect of ACh on mAChR and nicotinic receptors (nAChRs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, ACh responses in HEK293 cells were characterized in Ca<sup>2+</sup> microfluorimetry assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). Blockade of m3AChR with atropine abolished Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase with thapsigargin (TG) also blocked ACh responses after depleting intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). Furthermore, removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the extracellular solution did not affect ACh responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>). These results reveal that ACh responses in HEK293 cells are mediated by m3AChR coupled to PLCβ, discarding the potential involvement of endogenous nAChRs. This cell line also expresses the protein PLCβ3, used as a reference for the design of PLCβ-modulating peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>).</p><p id="P18">PLCβ activity was evaluated after applying two pulses of 1 μM ACh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Peptides were tested in pairs to compare activity of wild type to mutated sequences. Peptides (100 μM) were pre-incubated for 1 h to facilitate cell permeability followed by target interaction. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B-2D</xref>, <bold>left panels</bold>, 6-mer peptides attenuated ACh-induced intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> raise, showing a slight loss of inhibitory activity after the second stimulation. These peptides produced an inhibitory effect, similar to that of the unspecific PLC inhibitor, U73122. However, U73122 showed a high inter-assay variability in its inhibition efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-2D</xref> <bold>left panels</bold>).</p><p id="P19">As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B-2D</xref>, <bold>left panels</bold>, there were not significant differences in the inhibitory potency of wild-type and designed peptides. PL1621 and PL2003 were the most potent peptides, inhibiting up to 45% of PLCβ activity in response to the first ACh pulse (44.9 ± 8.2% and 44.6 ± 7.2%, p&lt;0.01 vehicle vs. PL1621 and PL2003, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <bold>left panel</bold>). The pair PL2001-PL2004 showed the best theoretical binding energies, but they caused a lower and non-significant reduction of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels compared to PL1621 and PL2003 (32.0 ± 10.7% and 31.3 ± 8.9% in the presence of PL2001 and PL2004, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <bold>left panel</bold>). PL2002 also induced a significant reduction of ACh responses (39.5 ± 5.9%, p&lt;0.0001 vs. vehicle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <bold>left panel</bold>). Unfortunately, its designed counterpart PL2005 showed solubility problems in different solvents. Nevertheless, a modest inhibitory activity was observed (31.3 ± 7.1%, p&lt;0.05 vs. vehicle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <bold>left panel</bold>). In most assays, U73122 significantly reduced the number of cells responding to ACh without compromising ionomycin responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C and 2D</xref>, <bold>right panels</bold>). Unlike U73122, PLCβ-modulating peptides did not significantly alter the percentage of ACh responsive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B-2D</xref>, <bold>right panels</bold>). Together, these data suggest that peptides patterned after the XY linker induce a partial catalytic inhibition of PLCβ enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>PL2003 inhibits PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis in cells</title><p id="P20">To further investigate the mode of action of designed inhibitory PLCβ peptides, we selected PL2003 as representative for evaluating its effect on the hydrolysis of membrane PIP<sub>2</sub>.

In contrast, bradykinin (BK) stimulation of B<sub>2</sub>R activates PLCβ enzymatic activity, which hydrolyses PIP<sub>2</sub>, promoting the translocation of the reporter PLCδ-PH-GFP to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <bold>right panels</bold>) (videos in supplementary materials). Translocation of PLCδ-PH-GFP caused a remarkable increment of cytosolic fluorescence in HEK293 cells pre-incubated with vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Noteworthy, 100 μM peptide PL2003 pre-incubated for 1 h, attenuated by 40% the cytosolic fluorescence increase induced by BK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B and 3C</xref>), akin to 2 μM U73122 (0.127 ± 0.009 and 0.126 ± 0.009, p&lt;0.0001 vs. vehicle in the presence of PL2003 and U73122, respectively). In contrast, neither PL2003 nor U73122 modified the time to reach the maximum PLCβ activity, measured from the onset of PLCδ-PH-GFP translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).

We report that small peptides derived from the autoinhibitory XY linker of PLCβ3 reduced PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis by inhibiting PLCβ enzymatic activity, resulting in an attenuation of inflammation-induced neuronal electrogenesis and TRPV1 sensitization. These peptides are sequence- and isoform-specific, since a random sequence peptide was inactive and peptides after the PLCβ XY linker did not affect PLCγ activity. PL2204, an aqueous soluble 8-mer peptide incorporating two positively-charged residues at the N-terminus, exhibited <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activity in the CFA mouse model of inflammatory pain. These peptides represent a significant progress towards the development of novel pharmacological leads and enable druggability of these enzymes that have notably resisted pharmacological targeting.</p><p id="P35">We hypothesized that the autoinhibitory XY linker, a region that physically occludes the catalytic site of PLC enzymes, could be a source of peptide-based inhibitors and used a rational design approach to identify candidates within this motif. XY linkers with different amino acid sequence can be found in PLCβ, PLCδ and PLCε isoforms, while PLCγ isoforms have a more complex XY region with multiple domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. The sequence diversity of this protein region within different PLC isoforms may facilitate the development of isoform-selective inhibitors, a yet unmet goal for this enzyme family. Here, we focused on PLCβ taking advantage of the availability of the PLCβ3 structure. Analysis of the XY linker sequence reveals that most of the residues are conserved (62.5%) among PLCβ1-β2-β3 isoforms, and more divergent when compared to PLCβ4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7A</xref>). In contrast, PLCβ3 residues harboring the XY binding site are mostly conserved among the four PLCβ isoforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7B</xref>), suggesting potential cross-reactivity of peptides patterned after the XY linker. Hence, it is plausible that our small peptides primarily target PLCβ3 but may cross-interact to some extend with the other PLCβ isoforms. Nonetheless, sequence differences in the XY linker provide the basis to rationally evolve isoform-selective sequences for this enzyme family.</p><p id="P36">The activity of PLCβ-modulating peptides was assessed <italic>in vitro</italic> using m3AChR and B<sub>2</sub>R receptors coupled to PLCβ isoforms. PLCβ peptides patterned after the XY linker attenuated ER-Ca<sup>2+</sup> release triggered by m3AChR activation, while maintaining the number of responsive cells. Interestingly, the amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients elicited after a second ACh pulse was still partially reduced after the washout period. These findings are compatible with the mode of action of a moderate-affinity PLCβ inhibitor that hinders PIP<sub>2</sub> access to the catalytic site, partially inhibiting enzymatic activity. Unlike glue-type drugs, these molecules with moderate potency may have the therapeutic advantage of efficiently targeting pathological states while preserving the activity of physiologically working enzyme pools. Such a partial inhibition of PLCβ was corroborated with the most potent peptide PL2003 and PL2204 in a PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolyzing assay, revealing direct effect on the hydrolysis of the membrane phospholipid PIP<sub>2</sub>. In addition, these peptides did not slow the kinetics of PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis, consistent with a competitive inhibitory mechanism between PL2003 or PL2204 and PIP<sub>2</sub> for the active site of PLCβ. Furthermore, PL2003 and PL2204 did not affect store-operated calcium entry in HaCaT cells, a process dependent on PLCγ activity, which underscored their selectivity for PLCβ. This selectivity distinguishes our peptides from the unspecific PLC inhibitor U73122, thus allowing specific modulation of PLCβ-dependent mechanisms while preserving the activity of other relevant PLC isoforms such as PLCγ.</p><p id="P37">The moderate potency and efficacy of peptides may be influenced by several factors related to the cellular assay used. First, access to the enzyme is restricted by the cell membrane as the peptide-binding site is located intracellularly. Thus, peptide permeability appears pivotal for potent inhibition. Second, since PLCs are membrane proteins that hydrolyze lipids, their catalytic site may be hindered in the internal membrane leaflet, limiting access to our peptides. In addition, the accessibility of the catalytic site is limited in basal conditions as it is occupied by the XY linker and only accessible when the enzyme is activated. Thus, designed peptides must compete with the enzyme’s own XY linker for binding. Third, small peptides made of natural L-amino acids may be metabolized by cytosolic proteases, thus reducing their effective concentration for enzyme inhibition. These factors may account for the relatively high concentration of peptide (10-100 μM) required for PLCβ inhibition. Nevertheless, considering these limitations, it is remarkable that 6/8-mer peptides exhibited micromolar inhibitory activity.</p><p id="P38">Strategies such as the use of cell penetrating peptides or lipidation have been used to increase membrane permeability and anchorage of peptides. The most frequently used cell-penetrating peptide is the Tat sequence, which is rich in positively charged amino acids and takes advantage of the negative membrane potential to enhance membrane permeability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. This strategy is very efficient in translocating peptides, although due to its high positive charge tends to drive peptides to the cell nucleus which exhibits strong negative charge. We used this approach in a conservative manner to increase the solubility of PL2005 by incorporating two positively charged amino acids at the N-terminus, mimicking naturally occurring cell-penetrating peptides, and to minimize nuclear localization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. With this modification, our 8-mer peptide PL2204, with a net positive charge (+2), inhibited PLCβ enzymatic activity. Notably, a randomized version of PL2204 lost the inhibitory activity, underscoring the relevance of the specific order of amino acids for the interaction with the binding surface of PLCβ.</p><p id="P39">Peptide lipidation is a strategy that anchors peptide sequences into the lipid bilayer increasing their membrane concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. This modification has been used to modulate protein-protein interactions at the membrane surface such those involved in the SNARE complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, the interaction of GPCRs with the heterotrimeric proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> and the interaction of intracellular protein domains involved in channel gating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. This strategy appears less appropriate to favor the binding of peptides to a catalytic site that most likely requires flexibility of the inhibitor. However, its degrees of freedom are limited by the rigid anchorage to the internal lipid monolayer imposed by the lipid. To circumvent this limitation, the use of flexible linkers for proper mobility is required. Although we do not fully discard this strategy to enhance the potency of our peptides, we do not prioritize it because peptide lipidation often increase peptide toxicity most likely by affecting the membrane physicochemical properties that may affect signaling processes. An alternative strategy is represented by the encapsulation of peptides in liposomes that also favor membrane permeability.</p><p id="P40">Our peptides also significantly attenuated BK-induced electrogenicity in sensory neurons, consistent with a PLCβ-dependent mechanism of BK-induced excitability. Our findings agree with growing evidence suggesting that depolarizing effects of bradykinin in nociceptive neurons are mediated by inhibition of M-type K<sup>+</sup> channels and opening of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated chloride channels such as ANO1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. These events depend on the rise of intracellular calcium triggered by the PLCβ-IP<sub>3</sub> pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. PLCβ signaling is also involved in inflammatory sensitization of TRPV1 channels expressed in sensory neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Indeed, several algogens (ATP, BK, histamine, etc.) potentiate TRPV1 activity by increasing IP<sub>3</sub> and DAG through activation of neuronal PLCβ. Notably, our peptides reduced BK-elicited TRPV1 sensitization. Inhibition of PLCβ signaling with our peptides was less potent in preventing TRPV1 inflammatory potentiation than direct B<sub>2</sub>R blockade with the specific antagonist HOE140<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. This pharmacological approach likely causes stronger inhibition because B<sub>2</sub>R also activate Gα<sub>s</sub> proteins coupled to adenylate cyclase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Specifically, adenylate cyclase generates cAMP that activates protein kinase A, which also phosphorylates and sensitizes TRPV1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Since PLCβ isoforms are not involved in this pathway, a degree of TRPV1 potentiation is expected after the PLCβ-directed peptides.</p><p id="P41">While our main focus was the study of BK response, the inflammatory soup contains additional mediators that trigger PLCβ activation, including histamine, protease-activated receptor 2 or ATP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. The effect of these mediators should then be also sensitive to the PLCβ-modulating peptides, and a stronger overall effect on inflammation could be expected. Furthermore, the PLCβ pathway modulates other members of the TRP family under inflammatory conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. For instance, TRPA1, a sensor of environmental irritants and endogenous proalgesic agents involved in inflammatory pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, undergoes sensitization through PLCβ-dependent mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Thus, inhibition of PLCβ should attenuate the sensitization triggered by multiple pro-nociceptive mediators under inflammatory pain conditions. Future experiments will address this exciting question.</p><p id="P42">Local administration of PL2204 before induction of inflammation had a pronounced anti-inflammatory effect. This preventive effect is compatible with the observed inhibition of BK signaling mediated by the PLCβ-modulating peptide.

In terms of inflammation, PL2204 had a subtle effect when administered 8 days after the induction of inflammation, suggesting less participation of PLCβ at these later stages.

This antinociceptive activity could be due to reduced swelling, and it is in line with the decrease in TRPV1 sensitization observed in cellular studies.

Previous studies found similar results in neuropathic pain models, although the PLC inhibitor was U73122 systemically administered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Given the number of processes modulated by PLCβ, it is expected that unwanted effects could occur after such systemic administration. While generalized effects could be interesting for assessing the role of PLCβ in mechanistic studies, the most plausible route for potential clinical applications would be local or topical, always in the presence of pathophysiological alterations involving PLCβ recruitment.</p><p id="P44">In conclusion, peptides patterned after the autoinhibitory XY linker are effective and selective PLCβ inhibitors with <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activity.

Peptide-receptor complexes containing XY linker fragments ranging from 4 to 10 amino acids were generated with YASARA by removing the remaining portion of the XY loop. The binding free energy of shortened peptides was calculated with FoldX5. These values were normalized to peptide length to compare the binding of peptides of different sizes.

First, shortened peptide-receptor complexes were repaired with FoldX5. Then, the peptide sequence was mutated to a poly-alanine chain to later explore the fitting of the 20 natural amino acids at each position, regardless of residues in consecutive positions. After running the virtual mutagenesis, position-specific scoring matrices were generated with the binding energy of each amino acid normalized to that of the most favorable residue at each position. In these heat maps the binding energy of each residue was represented according to a color scale, with blue colors indicating a good fit, while red ones a bad fit.

The number of data points per group is shown in brackets, while the number of biological replicates (N) is indicated in the figure legends. For the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment, a two-way ANOVA or a mixed model (within-factor: “time”; between-factor: “treatment”, and their interaction) were used, followed by <italic>post hoc</italic> Tukey tests to compare groups and by Dunnett’s tests to compare vs. baseline. In the manuscript, data are expressed as mean + Standard Error of the Mean, while statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Statistical analyses were done with GraphPad Prism 9.4.1 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Source data and statistical analyses for each figure are provided in the supplementary file Source_Data.zip.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS207559-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d14aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S30"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Financial support of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [PID2021-126423OB-C21 to A.F.C. and A.F.M. and C22 to R.G.M.] and from Generalitat Valenciana [GVA-PROMETEO/2021/031] was granted to A.F.M.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Significance</title></caption><p>Phospholipases C (PLC) are intracellular signaling proteins, with PLCβ isoforms crucial in somatosensory neuron signaling. These enzymes interact with G-protein coupled receptors for pro-inflammatory and algesic agents, sensitizing nociceptors by increasing their excitability. Despite their importance, selective PLCβ modulators remain limited; U73122 is widely used, though it lacks specificity and has off-target effects. Here, we introduce peptide inhibitors based on the XY autoinhibitory motif that selectively block PLCβ activity, reduce bradykinin-induced neuronal responses and TRPV1 sensitization, and do not affect other PLC isoforms. In a murine inflammatory pain model, local administration of our lead peptide showed both anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects, highlighting its therapeutic potential. This approach expands the toolkit of PLC-isoform selective modulators for drug development.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>PLCβ peptides patterned after the autoinhibitory XY linker.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Catalytic domain of PLCβ3 isoform (blue surface) interacting with the crystallized region of autoinhibitory XY linker (pink cartoon).
