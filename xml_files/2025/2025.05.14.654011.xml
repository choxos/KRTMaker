Here, we report the generation of <italic>Gzmb</italic>-Cre knock-in mice, that when crossed with inducible Diphtheria toxin receptor mice, allows targeted and inducible ablation of IELs without perturbing peripheral immunity. Using this model (referred to as IEL<sup>iDTR</sup>), we demonstrate that IELs are dispensable for intestinal homeostasis, including epithelial architecture, barrier function and microbial composition. However, loss of IELs led to increased intestinal infection by <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium and <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic>, but did not affect responses to <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> infection or DSS colitis. Interestingly, IEL deficiency reduced fecundity of the intestinal nematode, <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic>, despite unaltered worm burden, suggesting a permissive role in helminth colonization. These findings position IELs as evolutionary-tuned sentinels against co-evolved pathogens that can cause lethal diarrheal diseases, and establish the IEL<sup>iDTR</sup> mouse as a vital genetic tool for dissecting IEL function in host-pathogen interactions <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Intraepithelial T lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>intestinal infection</kwd><kwd>Cryptosporidium</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Despite the description of multiple small round lymphocytes within the intestinal epithelium over 150 years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, little is known about the functions of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL). Most IEL (&gt;90%) are T lymphocytes and they are present within the small intestinal epithelium at a rate of 1 for every 10 epithelial cells, thus representing the largest population of T cells in the body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. They are found in all jawed vertebrates, including in cartilaginous fish, such as sharks and rays, that lack organized lymphoid structures, and are thought to have arisen to provide protective immunity in the context of increased injury and infection in jawed animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. IELs constantly monitor the epithelium for barrier disruption or cellular stress caused by pathogens and mount an appropriate protective response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. IELs may kill infected or dysregulated cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, enhance repair of damaged epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and develop memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> to maintain intestinal homeostasis. Yet precise definition of the functions of IEL remain unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Comprehensive analysis of IEL biology has been hindered by the absence of mouse models that enable specific targeting of intestinal IELs. This challenge stems from the developmental heterogeneity of IEL populations, which comprise both thymic-derived natural IELs that undergo selection on self-antigens during early development, and induced IELs that originate from conventional peripheral T cells responding to dietary and microbial antigens. Although typically classified into TCRγδ and TCRαβ IEL—together comprising ~95% of IELs—this framework masks considerable phenotypic diversity. IEL populations comprise natural T cells derived from thymic precursors that seed the gut early in development (TCRαβ<sup>+</sup>CD8αα<sup>+</sup> or TCRγδ<sup>+</sup>CD8αα<sup>+</sup> or TCRγδ<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> cells), as well as induced IELs (TCRαβ<sup>+</sup>CD8αβ<sup>+</sup>CD8αα<sup>+</sup> or TCRαβ<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8αα<sup>+</sup>) derived from conventional peripheral T cells. The induced IEL lineages include the tissue-resident memory (T<sub>RM</sub>) cells that are generated through viral infections and provide long-lived antigen-specific protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Natural αβIELs are thought to have a more immunoregulatory function, as adoptive transfer of these cells can prevent induction of T cell mediated colitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, and natural γδIELs can express epithelial growth factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Thus distinct IEL subsets may serve different functions within the intestinal epithelium. However, there are also multiple indications of functional redundancy in IEL populations. All IEL subsets express cytotoxic molecules including granzyme A and granzyme B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> and proinflammatory cytokines such as IFNγ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and both induced and natural IEL can produce antimicrobial peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Proteomic and single-cell RNA-seq data indicate a high level of similarity between αβIELs and γδIELs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Indeed, in both human and mouse scRNA-seq datasets, natural αβIELs and γδIELs are indistinguishable except for their TCR genes. αβIELs and γδIELs also display very similar functional responses to IL-15, and in their ability to induce responses in epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Yet previous studies have mainly assigned functions to IELs by analyzing TCRδ-deficient (<italic>Tcrd-/-)</italic> mice, which only lack γδIELs, or TCRβ-deficient mice, that lack αβIELs as well as all peripheral αβ T cell populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. As αβIELs still populate the guts of γδ-deficient mice and vice versa, these studies may have underrepresented the importance of IELs. For example, multiple studies have shown that IEL respond to intestinal infection with the bacterial pathogen <italic>Salmonella</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, yet <italic>Tcrd</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice show only transient loss of protection against infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Therefore, a key goal to better understand the function of IEL in vivo is to generate a mouse model that permits deletion of all IEL subsets, without affecting other T cell subsets.</p><p id="P6">Here, we developed a new mouse model that enables selective and inducible depletion of all intestinal IEL subsets while preserving systemic T cell populations. This model exploits our observation that Granzyme B (GzmB) is highly expressed in all IEL subsets and is only expressed in IELs <italic>in vivo</italic> under homeostatic conditions. We generated a mouse model expressing Cre recombinase knocked in (KI) to the endogenous <italic>Gzmb</italic> locus, <bold>GzmB</bold><sup><bold>CreKI</bold></sup>. By crossing the Gzmb<sup>CreKI</sup> mice to both the Cre-inducible tdTomato reporter and an inducible diphtheria toxin receptor (iDTR) mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, we generated a diphtheria toxin (DT)-inducible IEL depletion model, IEL<sup>iDTR</sup> mice. Studies in these mice reveal that IELs are dispensable for gut homeostasis but that they exhibit selective control of different intestinal pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>GzmB homogeneously marks IELs at steady state</title><p id="P7">A major obstacle in developing IEL-specific mouse models stems from the profound heterogeneity of IEL populations. No markers have yet been identified that specifically labels all IEL and no other immune compartments, other than anatomical location. However the integrin α<sub>E</sub>(CD103)β<sub>7</sub>, that binds to E-cadherin on intestinal epithelial cells, labels &gt;90% of IEL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Therefore we focussed our analyses on CD103+ immune cells isolated from the small intestinal epithelium. High-dimensional flow cytometry of from the mouse small intestinal epithelium delineates at least eight subsets among IEL (delineated as CD45+CD103+): among TCRγδ IELs, the predominant population is CD8αα<sup>+</sup>, with minor CD8αβ<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup> populations; TCRαβ IEL include natural CD8αα<sup>+</sup>, induced CD8αβ<sup>+</sup>, and rare subsets such as CD4+CD8α+ and CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup> IEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig 1A</xref>). Despite this apparent heterogeneity based on surface markers, analysis of proteomic data from three major IEL subsets (TCRαβ CD8αα, TCRγδ CD8αα, TCRαβ CD8αβ) revealed &gt;95% shared proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that IEL subsets might converge on a shared transcriptional identity that is driven by the intestinal microenvironment. To test this, we performed single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling (scATAC-seq) across mouse small intestinal CD8α+ IELs. Notably, we observed marked epigenetic convergence across all IEL populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig 1B</xref>), suggesting a unifying regulatory architecture. We further examined chromatin accessibility at <italic>Itgae</italic> (encoding CD103), a canonical IEL marker. Over 97% of IELs exhibited open chromatin at the <italic>Itgae</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1C</xref>). Similarly, ~70% showed accessible chromatin at <italic>Ifng</italic>, consistent with their known Type 1-skewed effector program (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1D</xref>). We also reanalyzed previously published bulk ATAC-seq datasets of TCRγδ and TCRαβ mouse IELs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In the bulk ATAC-seq data, IEL subsets shared 82% of accessible peaks (23,699/28,789), underscoring a high degree of epigenomic overlap, and emphasizing molecular convergence across both chromatin and protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1E</xref>). Together, these findings argue against lineage-centric views of IEL and support a model in which both αβ and γδ IEL subsets form a cohesive, functionally unified guardian of the intestinal epithelium.</p><p id="P8">Based on the high level of proteomic and epigenetic similarity between IEL populations, we hypothesized a high amount of functional redundancy. Therefore, we aimed to identify a molecule that would allow us to specifically target all IEL subsets while leaving other immune cells intact. We revisited previously published IEL proteomics datasets and compared them with other immune cell proteomics data from the Immpres database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.immpres.co.uk">www.immpres.co.uk</ext-link><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>), and also analyzed transcriptomic data of mouse immune cells on the Immgen database. Of all the proteins that were enriched in IEL compared to other immune cell subsets, only granzymes (Gzm) emerged as potential candidate molecules. Although there were other molecules found in IEL that were not found in peripheral T cells, most of these molecules were either epithelial molecules or highly expressed by a subset of immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. By contrast, granzyme B (GzmB) is expressed highly in &gt;80% of all IELs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) and is only expressed at low levels in NK cells and not in conventional T cells in the resting state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Further, unlike GzmA that is expressed during early T cell development (rendering it unsuitable for specific targeting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>), GzmB is not expressed during thymocyte development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). These data were corroborated by analysis of RNA-seq data on the Immgen database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1F</xref>). <italic>GzmB</italic> mRNA was only detected in NK cells and in IEL in uninfected steady state mice, although its expression was induced in activated NK cells and activated CD8 T cells post infection (marked as post-infection NK cells, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1F</xref>). However, previous research has shown that in NK cells, only the mRNA of <italic>GzmB</italic> and not the protein is expressed in the resting state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, consistent with our flow cytometry data. Moreover, NK/ILC1 cells are very few compared to IEL within the small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, contained within TCRβ-TCRγδ- cells). Indeed, immunostaining of GzmB and CD3 in mouse small intestinal tissue localized GzmB<sup>+</sup> cells to the epithelial layer, and GzmB+ cells were also CD3+, reinforcing the idea that GzmB is specifically expressed only in IEL in the small intestines of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Taken together, these findings establish GzmB as a definitive marker of mouse IEL at steady state.</p><p id="P9">Having established <italic>Gzmb</italic> as a potential specific marker for intestinal IELs, we investigated whether Gzmb-based Cre strains could be used to target IEL. However, when we crossed a previously established GzmB-Cre transgenic mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, which utilized a truncated human <italic>GZMB</italic> promoter, to a <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>LSL-EYFP</italic></sup> reporter, we did not detect labelling of IELs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1G</xref>). Interestingly, previous attempts at targeting NK cells with the same GzmB-Cre transgenic mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> showed that only activated NK cells were efficiently targeted. This transgenic Gzmb-Cre was also spuriously active in CD4 T cells and even in hematopoietic stem cells that did not express mouse GzmB, potentially due to the absence of mouse essential cis-regulatory elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. To overcome these limitations, we generated a <italic>Gzmb</italic>-Cre knock-in (KI) mouse by inserting Cre recombinase into the endogenous <italic>Gzmb</italic> locus, replacing the stop codon with a self-cleaving T2A peptide followed by Cre to preserve native GzmB expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Gzmb<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice developed normally and had normal numbers and distribution of intestinal IEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). However, despite the 2A peptide, we noticed a slight decrease in GzmB expression in IELs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1H</xref>). Therefore, to control for any effects that could be attributed to reduced GzmB expression, in all further experiments Gzmb<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice were used as controls. We next crossed the Gzmb<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice to Rosa26<sup>lsl-tdTomato</sup> (ref <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>) reporter mice, where we observed robust and specific tdTomato expression in <italic>Gzmb</italic>-expressing intestinal IEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>). Flow cytometry confirmed that Gzmb<sup>Cre/+</sup> efficiently activated tdTomato reporter expression in all IEL subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>). Importantly, the major IEL subsets (TCRγδ CD8αα (orange), TCRγδ CD8αβ (black), TCRαβ CD8αα (blue), TCRαβ CD8αβ (red)), that together account for &gt;90% of all IELs, are all &gt;90% tdTomato positive. Thus, the newly established Gzmb<sup>Cre/+</sup> effectively labels and targets all IEL subsets for genetic modulation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>A Gzmb<sup>Cre</sup> deleter strain enables specific and inducible depletion of IELs</title><p id="P10">To develop a model that would allow us to inducibly ablate IELs, we crossed Gzmb<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice to the inducible Diphtheria Toxin Receptor (iDTR), Rosa26<sup>LSL-iDTR</sup> (ref<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>) mice, enabling diphtheria toxin (DT)-induced ablation of GzmB-expressing cells. From this point onwards we refer to Gzmb<sup>Cre/+</sup> and Gzmb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>LSL-iDTR</sup> strains as IEL<sup>WT</sup> and IEL<sup>iDTR</sup>, respectively. Just a single intraperitoneal injection of DT led to a marked depletion of CD3<sup>+</sup> IELs identified within the epithelium in small intestinal tissue sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, in the lamina propria, CD3+ T cells were still visible. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed an 80-90% reduction of only CD45+ CD103+ cells in the small intestinal epithelial layer, i.e., IEL, but not CD45+ CD103- cells which includes non-tissue-resident cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). DT treatment had no effect on Gzmb<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice without iDTR expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig 2A</xref>). Further analysis confirmed that DT treatment ablated all IEL subsets by at least 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2B</xref>) with γδIELs reduced by 83% and αβIELs reduced by ~90%. Importantly, DT treatment largely spared immune populations in the small intestinal lamina propria, colon, secondary lymphoid tissues, and thymus, confirming both the specificity and spatial restriction of the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig 2C-2G</xref>). The absence of thymic alterations further indicates that <italic>Gzmb</italic>-driven Cre activity targets post-thymic IEL populations. Thus, this system enables selective and efficient ablation of IELs in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Rapid in situ proliferation drives IEL compartment reconstitution</title><p id="P11">Having established that our Gzmb<sup>Cre/+</sup> model enables efficient and specific intestinal IEL ablation, we next sought to determine whether the IEL compartment can regenerate post-deletion and, if so, how rapidly. We depleted IELs and harvested mice at day 1, 4, 7, 10, and 15 post-DT treatment. Surprisingly, the CD45+ CD103+ cells in the IEL compartment were ~50% replenished by day 7 and fully restored by day 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>), with total IEL numbers and subset frequencies indistinguishable from wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>-H and Suppl <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). This rapid recovery was unexpected, as the conventional view is that tissue-resident T cells are stable, long-lived populations that therefore do not require active replenishment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">This raised the broader question of whether such rapid turnover is an intrinsic feature of IEL biology at steady state. To test this, we used the previously reported Gzmb<sup>CreERT2</sup> model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> crossed to <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>lsl-tdTomato</italic></sup> reporter mice, allowing us to time-stamp label IELs at a defined zero-time point following tamoxifen treatment and monitor their subsequent loss over time. The labelling efficiency of IELs in Gzmb<sup>CreERT2</sup> x Rosa26<sup>LsL-tdTomato</sup> reporter mice treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen was around 65% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Fig. 3C-3D</xref>). These data show that the transgenic Gzmb<sup>CreERT2</sup> mouse line, which used a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene that included the whole <italic>Gzmb</italic> locus to control Cre-ERT2 expression, worked effectively to inducibly label IEL. We analyzed the Gzmb<sup>CreERT2</sup> x Rosa26<sup>LsL-tdTomato</sup> reporter mice 7, 30 or 60 days after 4-hydroxytamoxifen induction of tdTomato expression. Indeed, tdTomato+ IEL exhibited a half-life of &gt;60 days, consistent across TCRγδ+ and TCRαβ+ subsets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Fig. 3E</xref>), surpassing previous estimates of 10-36 days based on bromodeoxyuridine labeling experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. This suggested that IELs are indeed long-lived cells, contrasting with the rapid restoration of the IEL compartment in our Gzmb<sup>Cre/+</sup> model. Thus, the rapid reconstitution of the IEL compartment in IEL<sup>iDTR</sup> mice is most likely due to lymphopenia in the niche.</p><p id="P13">We considered two main mechanisms of IEL regeneration: (1) thymic-derived progenitors replenish the IEL pool, or (2) in situ proliferation of residual IELs drives compartment reconstitution. To distinguish between these scenarios, we treated mice with FTY720—an inhibitor of lymphocyte egress from the thymus—immediately following IEL ablation. IEL<sup>iDTR</sup> mice received FTY720 or vehicle for six consecutive days post-DT, and IELs were analyzed on day 7. If progenitors from the thymus were driving repopulation, FTY720 treatment should reduce IEL recovery. However, we found no significant difference in IEL reconstitution between vehicle- and FTY720-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>), even though the splenic compartment had reduced T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J</xref>), confirming that FTY720 had worked. Thus, thymic progenitors are not the primary source of replenishment.</p><p id="P14">To directly assess whether <italic>in situ</italic> proliferation contributed to IEL compartment restoration, we performed an assay for incorporation of EdU—a thymidine analog that labels actively proliferating cells. IELs isolated on day 4 post-deletion showed significantly increased EdU incorporation compared to controls, indicating active <italic>in situ</italic> proliferation as a mechanism of reconstitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K</xref>). To corroborate this, we assessed Ki67 expression by flow cytometry at multiple time points post-DT administration. Ki67<sup>+</sup> IEL frequencies peaked at day 4 and returned to baseline by day 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2L–M</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that the IEL compartment rapidly regenerates via <italic>in situ</italic> proliferation, rather than through recruitment of thymic progenitors. This temporal insight is critical for the design of functional studies, as it defines the window of IEL depletion and regeneration. Overall, our data indicate that IEL are normally stable, long-lived cells, but contain within them progenitors capable of self-renewal to rapidly repopulate the epithelium in case of lEL loss. This ability to rapidly proliferate may also be important to allow rapid IEL responses to intestinal stress or inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>IEL depletion does not disrupt intestinal homeostasis</title><p id="P15">To determine whether IEL contribute to basal intestinal homeostasis, we assessed a range of physiological and immune parameters following their depletion. IEL<sup>iDTR</sup> mice exhibited no changes in body weight or overt histological alterations in small intestinal architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A–B</xref>). Gene expression analysis of the jejunal region of the small intestine showed no significant changes in markers of epithelial differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) or in <italic>Reg3γ</italic>, an antimicrobial peptide that is produced by IEL and epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). We next evaluated whether the acute loss of IEL triggered inflammation, either due to apoptotic cell clearance or the absence of immunoregulatory cues. However, inflammatory cytokine expression remained unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Epithelial barrier integrity, measured by FITC-dextran permeability, was also unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Finally, 16S rRNA sequencing of small intestinal luminal contents revealed no significant shifts in microbiota composition or diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G–H</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that IELs are not essential for maintaining steady-state epithelial architecture, barrier function, or microbial homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>IELs confer context-specific protection during intestinal infection and inflammation</title><p id="P16">Given their dispensability at steady state, we next explored IEL function under diverse intestinal stress conditions. We first assessed the role of IELs in colonic inflammation using the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of colitis. Although previous studies suggested a protective role for IEL in this context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, they often relied on whole-body knockouts or pan-T cell depletion models, making it difficult to isolate IEL-specific effects. Moreover, DSS-induced injury primarily affects the colon, yet the majority of IEL are found in the small intestine. In DT-treated IEL<sup>iDTR</sup> mice, where only small intestinal IELs are ablated, IEL depletion had no effect on body weight, disease scores, or histological damage following DSS exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A–C</xref>). These data argue against distinct roles for small intestinal IELs in protecting against acute DSS-induced colonic inflammation.</p><p id="P17">We then explored IEL contributions to pathogen defense. Mice were infected one day post-DT injection to capture the immediate effects of IEL loss on early infection stages. Upon oral challenge with <italic>Salmonella</italic> typhimurium, IEL<sup>iDTR</sup> mice showed increased weight loss and significantly elevated bacterial loads in feces and systemic tissues 7 days after DT injection compared with IEL<sup>WT</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D–F</xref>). These data reveal a critical role for IEL in early mucosal containment of <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>. By contrast, IEL depletion had no impact on disease course or bacterial burden following oral infection with <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> EGD Lmo-InlA<sup>m</sup>—a murinized strain engineered to infect murine enterocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G–I</xref>)—highlighting that IEL-mediated protection is not universal across enteric pathogens.</p><p id="P18">To assess IEL roles in responses to protozoan infection, we employed a bioluminescent strain of <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic>, a pathogen that typically fails to infect immunocompetent mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Strikingly, DT-treated IEL<sup>iDTR</sup> mice became permissive to infection, with significantly higher and prolonged parasite burdens than IEL<sup>WT</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4J–K</xref>), uncovering an unexpected requirement for IELs in controlling protozoa that infect intestinal epithelial cells. Finally, we tested the importance of the IEL response to the intestinal helminth <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri</italic>. IEL ablation did not alter adult worm burden but led to significantly reduced egg shedding 14, 21, and even 28 days post IEL depletion and infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4L–M</xref>), even though IEL numbers should be compltey restored by this timepoint. Thus, our data suggest that IELs support helminth fecundity— possibly by shaping a tissue environment that is conducive to parasite reproduction.</p><p id="P19">Together, these findings reveal that IELs exert context-specific responses to a spectrum of intestinal challenges. While dispensable for steady-state homeostasis, colitis, and <italic>Listeria</italic> infection, IELs mediate early defense against infections by invasive bacteria (<italic>S. typhimurium</italic>) and protozoa and may even facilitate helminth reproductive success, revealing their tissue-specifc roles in intestinal immunity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">Despite their abundance and evolutionary conservation across vertebrates, the functional contribution of IELs to mucosal immunity has remained ambiguous, largely due to the absence of tools that enable precise genetic manipulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Previous models targeting IELs relied on either broad promoter activity such as CD4-cre or E8i-Cre, or systemic deletions, each confounded by peripheral effects. Here, we address this gap by developing a <italic>GzmB</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup> mouse that permits selective targeting of IEL, including natural and induced αβ and γδ IELs, sparing thymic development and other immune compartments.

The loss of IEL sensitizes mice to oral <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> and <italic>C. parvum</italic> infections – yet has no impact on <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>. In contrast, IEL appear the support the fecundity of the intestinal helminthic parasite, <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>, a parasite found in all wild mouse populations, where it establishes a persistent infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. This dichotomy suggests that IEL may have evolved under selective pressure to counter persistent, co-evolved enteric threats, rather than opportunistic or environmentally emergent pathogens.</p><p id="P22">From an evolutionary medicine perspective, our findings suggest that IEL have been selectively shaped to counter ancient, co-evolved intestinal pathogens rather than emergent or opportunistic microbes. IEL depletion sensitized mice to Salmonella spp. and Cryptosporidia, both of which are host-adapted pathogens with deep evolutionary roots in human and animal populations. Salmonella is a facultative intracellular bacterium with a long-standing enteric transmission route in mammals and birds, having co-diverged with vertebrate hosts over millions of years36. Likewise, Cryptosporidium species are obligate enteric parasites that have co-evolved with their hosts and rarely cause fatal disease in immunocompetent individuals, indicating an evolutionary balance favoring transmission over lethality37. In contrast, IEL were dispensable in oral infection with Listeria monocytogenes, a foodborne pathogen and environmental saprophyte whose zoonotic potential emerged relatively recently in human history, likely following agricultural practices and domestication38,39. This dichotomy suggests IEL may have evolved under selection pressure to recognize and contain pathogens with persistent mucosal niches, rather than sporadic, environmentally acquired invaders.</p><p id="P23">Intriguingly, IEL appear to support rather than restrict the fecundity of H. polygyrus, a helminth with a long co-evolutionary history in mammals40. While total worm burden remained unaffected, IEL-deficient mice exhibited a marked reduction in egg output, implying a permissive role for IEL in maintaining a tissue environment conducive to helminth reproduction. This supports the “old friends” hypothesis, which posits that helminths and microbes that we have co-evolved with over millions of years play regulatory roles in immune homeostasis rather than acting solely as pathogens41. Collectively, these data reposition IELs not as general-purpose defenders but as evolutionarily tuned mediators of intestinal resilience, providing pathogen- and context-specific immunity shaped by ancestral exposure patterns.</p><p id="P24">Importantly the use of the <italic>Gzmb</italic><sup><italic>Cre-KI</italic></sup> and the <italic>Gzmb</italic><sup><italic>CreERT2</italic></sup> mouse models, which we show can both be used to target all intestinal IEL, including αβ and γδ IELs, can be used to establish how IEL might recognize pathogenic infections, and also permit the investigation of other functions of IELs. Understanding how IEL respond to important human enteric pathogens, which cause diarrhoeal diseases (salmonellosis, cryptosporidiosis, listeriosis) that lead to substantial loss of life in young children and older and immunocompromised adults, could be beneficial to mucosal vaccine development and for drugs that can improve infection outcomes by boosting IEL responses.</p><p id="P25">Together, these findings reposition IEL not as generic sentinels of intestinal epithelium, but as evolutionarily attuned, mediators of mucosal immunity to selected enteric pathogens. The Gzmb-Cre knock-in model thus provides an important platform to explore IEL biology in both mechanistic and disease-relevant settings and offers a tool to systematically dissect how IEL contribute to host defense, tolerance, and tissue adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Ethics</title><p id="P26">Mice were bred and maintained with approval by the University of Dundee ethical review committee under a UK Home Office project license (PD4D8EFEF, PP2719506) in compliance with UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Mice</title><p id="P27">Rosa26<sup>lsl-tdTomato</sup> (B6.Cg-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor</italic><sup><italic>tm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze</italic></sup>/J), Rosa26<sup>lsl</sup>-<sup>iDTR</sup> (CBy.B6-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor</italic><sup><italic>tm1(HBEGF)Awai</italic></sup>/J) and transgenic Gzmb-Cre (B6;FVB-Tg(GZMB-cre)<sup>1Jcb/J</sup>) mice strains were purchased from Jackson Laboratories, USA.

Total microbial DNA was extracted from these contents using the DNeasy PowerSoil Pro Kit (Qiagen, Cat. No. 47014), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Concentrations were normalized to 1 ng/μL using sterile distilled water and snap frozen and sent to Novogene for further processing. The V3–V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was PCR-amplified using universal primers 341F (5′-CCTAYGGGRBGCASCAG-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACNNGGGTATCTAAT-3′). PCR reactions (15 μL) were prepared using Phusion® High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (NEB), primers (2 μM), and template DNA (~10 ng). The cycling conditions were: 98 °C for 1 min, 30 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Amplicons were confirmed on 2% agarose gels, pooled in equimolar amounts, and purified using the Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit. Libraries were constructed using the TruSeq® DNA PCR-Free Library Prep Kit and quality-checked using a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform with 250 bp paired-end reads.</p><p id="P43">Bioinformatics Analysis: Raw paired-end reads were demultiplexed using unique sample barcodes, and primers and barcodes were trimmed. Reads were merged using FLASH v1.2.11, and quality-filtered using fastp v0.23.1. Chimeras were removed using the UCHIME algorithm with reference to the SILVA and UNITE databases.</p><p id="P44">ASV Denoising and Taxonomy Assignment: Denoising and ASV generation were performed using the DADA2 plugin in QIIME2 (v2022.2). Taxonomic annotation was done using the SILVA database for 16S rRNA gene sequences. Where species-level assignments were missing, taxonomy was corrected using the NCBI database. Phylogenetic relationships among ASVs were inferred through multiple sequence alignment in QIIME2.</p><p id="P45">Normalization and Community Composition: Sequence counts were normalized to the sample with the lowest read depth. Relative abundance bar plots (top 10 taxa) and heatmaps (top 35 taxa) were generated using Perl (SVG) and R (pheatmap), respectively. Ternary plots were constructed using the vcd() function in R. Venn and flower diagrams were used to show shared and unique taxa using R (VennDiagram) and Perl (SVG). A phylogenetic tree was generated for the top 100 genera using alignment and Perl visualization. Alpha and Beta Diversity Analysis: Diversity metrics including Observed_otus, Chao1, Shannon, Simpson, Dominance, good’s coverage, and Pielou_e were calculated using QIIME2. Species accumulation boxplots were created in R (vegan package) to assess sample richness and adequacy. Beta Diversity and Ordination: Beta diversity was assessed using weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances via QIIME2. Heatmaps of UniFrac distances were generated in Perl. UPGMA clustering was performed based on these distances. Ordination analyses including PCA, PCoA, and NMDS were conducted in R (ade4, ggplot2) to visualize community differences. Differential Abundance and Functional Prediction Statistical Testing: Community composition differences were evaluated using ANOSIM, ADONIS, MRPP, and SIMPER, implemented in R (vegan, ggplot2). Differential abundance was also assessed using MetaStat and LEfSe for biomarker discovery. Association Analysis: Species co-occurrence and correlations with environmental variables were analyzed via Spearman correlation, CCA, RDA, and dbRDA in R. 2D and 3D network visualizations were also generated. Software EnvironmentBioinformatics analyses were performed using Python v3.6.13, R v4.0.3 and Perl v5.26.2.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Oral challenges with pathogens and chemicals</title><sec id="S26"><title><italic>Salmonella</italic> typhimurium</title><p id="P46"><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar typhimurium SL1344 were grown overnight in LB broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C, on a shaker, then subcultured in LB+ampicillin medium for at least 3 h before <italic>in vivo</italic> infection.
