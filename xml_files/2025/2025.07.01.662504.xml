Understanding how nutrition supports brood rearing is crucial for developing diets that could aid against environmental threats. Nutritional research on whole colony brood development has been historically challenging due to difficulties documenting the diet's impact on brood production over time. We describe a novel semi-field method to study the influence of nutrition on brood rearing using standardised small colonies formed <italic>de novo</italic> (<italic>ca</italic>. 1500 nurse-age bees and a queen) housed in adapted mating-nucs, placed inside an enclosure and limited to feeding on chemically defined diets. Complete assessments were conducted every fifteen days, assisted by a bespoke device to photograph every frame to measure cell contents. A novel metric describes the number of bees generated per gram of diet consumed, measuring the impact of nutrition on brood rearing and overall colony size.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The honeybee colony's capacity to produce brood and generate healthy young workers is a hallmark of robust colony health <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The reproduction of honeybees exhibits a haplodiploid eusocial structure where adult individuals (male, reproductive female and unreproductive female) play distinctive roles in colony survival <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Beyond the queen's polyandrous mating, the population's survival relies on the worker population's ability to maintain larvae, collect food, thermoregulate, and fight off pathogens and pests through their specific division of labour <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Foragers collect pollen and nectar from flowering plants, which are then processed by nest bees and stored as bee bread or honey, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Nurse bees with engorged hypopharyngeal glands, between 3-12 days old, metabolise food to feed jelly to larvae and the queen <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. And colony workers regulate the colony's temperature around 35°C for proper brood development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. These tasks require adequate nutrition and precise coordination between nestmates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. However, anthropogenic drivers have changed the diversity and abundance of flowering plants in agricultural and natural landscapes, affecting the honeybee colonies health <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Starvation conditions are becoming increasingly common, motivating beekeepers and scientists to develop feeds that mimic the composition of floral pollen to feed bees <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Providing sucrose syrup in the absence of nectar flow, along with protein patties to promote brood rearing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, has raised beekeepers' operational costs related to feeds from 1% in 1976 to 20% in 2018 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Research on whole colony nutrition has been ongoing since the 1930s <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, with literature covering a variety of methods in settings such as open fields <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, semi-fields <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, labs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, and complex indoor bee-flight rooms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Among the three primary macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins), proteins play a crucial role in promoting brood-rearing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, and pollen, the most studied protein source for honeybee colonies, has a substantial positive impact <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. However, certain pollen types, such as dandelion and maise <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, are insufficient to support colony growth, and a diverse pollen source is widely regarded as essential for maintaining healthy bee populations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. When protein sources like pollen are restricted, brood-rearing ceases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, and if carbohydrate stores, like honey, are absent, the colony enters a period of starvation, putting its survival at stake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Without pollen, colonies cannot raise brood.</p><p id="P4">The unreliable characteristics of pollen accessibility have led to the development of honey bee diets with protein and many other nutrients but absent from natural pollen – commonly referred to as pollen substitutes. However, these still do not appear to assert a clear benefit in colony health <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Pollen substitute diets are less effective than those containing at least 10% natural pollen in sustaining colony populations over the long term <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Furthermore, when feeding these diets under conditions of environmental pollen scarcity, honey bees deplete their internal reserves to support larval development, as these diets often lack essential nutrients such as sterols <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. It still remains unclear how long a pollen-free diet can support healthy colony populations throughout their seasonal cycle.</p><p id="P5">A review of 22 independent field studies on pollen substitutes revealed that only five of them confirmed increased brood production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. While valuable for understanding real-world conditions, field studies come with significant challenges that can impact the reliability of the research. They are prone to uncontrollable environmental, technical, or genetic variables that may affect brood-rearing more than feeding protein diets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. For example, access to flowering plants and their pollen, even in small quantities, creates a positive confounding factor in brood rearing, which can mask the actual nutritional effects of the tested pollen substitutes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Methods to restrict access to pollen, such as using pollen traps <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> can harm colony health by damaging workers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Their location may also expose them to plant protection chemicals influencing colony development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Likewise, using large colonies in such experiments can lead to the accumulation of other toxins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> used to control varroa mites, affecting capping rates, larval survival, and adult bee mortality <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. Large colonies are also more challenging in controlling for comb age, which influences the brood rate; new combs have larger brood areas and heavier worker bees than older ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>, and even the spatial distribution of bee bread within the comb impacts brood-rearing success<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">In semi-field studies, we can more effectively control pollen access, manage smaller colonies, and precisely measure population size. However, most of these studies use three or fewer colony replicates and only a few tracked brood rearing over time. Typically, colonies are confined in small outdoor cages (&lt; 70 m<sup>3</sup>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>, which can lead to higher mortality and lower brood rates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, with colony size varying from 10,000 bees <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup> to 2,000 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Also, the variety of methods of brood counting, such as visual area estimation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>, acetate sheets over a sample area <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>, or image analysis tools <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>, offer different levels of precision in estimating the diet's impact on brood rearing.</p><p id="P7">Most importantly, comparing the nutritional effects on brood rearing between whole colony studies is difficult without standardising methods and a standard measurable metric. In contrast, in the field of honey bee toxicology, standard guidelines and metrics are employed to evaluate brood rearing. Such as the Oomen bee brood feeding test <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and the OECD75 standard guideline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup> are widely used by industry and academic working groups that usually test diets laced with toxicants, assessing the impact of pesticides on bee brood. These use a key standard endpoint, the brood-termination rate (BTR), which measures the failure of eggs to transition into adult workers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>, thereby evaluating the lethality of the toxicant. Another outcome was the recommendation to use large polytunnels (&gt;100 m<sup>3</sup>) to mitigate the identifiable harmful ‘caging effect' on bee colonies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. While BTR focuses on the adverse effects of toxicity, comparable standards are needed, in this case, to measure the diet's positive impact in whole-colony nutritional studies.</p><p id="P8">Therefore, we developed a specific semi-field method to address the need for method standardisation in diet brood-rearing studies and introduced a key standard metric, 'bees per gram': which measures the number of bees produced per gram of diet consumed by the colony. This metric allows comparing the brood-rearing potential of different diets across studies, locations and time. Our approach assesses the effect of diets on brood rearing in free-flying colonies under completely pollen-restricted conditions. Our experimental set-up involved mini-colonies consisting of 1,500 mixed nurse bees, five mini-frames with combs built the same year (without bee bread), and a same-year mated queen. Each mini-colony was housed in repurposed polystyrene, with 0.002 m<sup>3</sup> of nest volume, a dedicated feeding chamber, and enclosed within a large flight arena – a polytunnel with 628 m<sup>3</sup> of flight space or within a 125 m<sup>3</sup> glasshouse. Sucrose solution feeders were dispersed throughout the enclosure to simulate natural nectar foraging behaviour. Experimental brood assessment cycles lasted fifteen days each, where a bespoke device photographed every frame to analyse comb cell contents—empty, honey, or brood. Our approach reduces confounding variables such as environmental pollen access, colony population size, queen age, comb age, foraging behaviour, and agrochemical exposure, enabling the precise determination of the influence of diet on brood-rearing.</p><p id="P9">In the present study, we developed a minimal colony system through systematic optimisation and showcased key techniques that marginally disturb the colony while providing precise data on brood development. Our practical and reproducible system streamlines the transition from laboratory nutritional studies to practical applications that can directly benefit beekeepers. We hope this method establishes a foundation for standardising future nutrition studies in whole colony populations.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Nutritional bioassay</title><p id="P10">Our nutritional bioassay is based on queen-right honey bee colonies exclusively consuming artificial diets, which are then metabolised by nurse bees to feed their worker larvae. The developmental cycle of workers, from egg until emergence, usually takes about 21 days. Our assessments track this cycle almost to its end, from egg until capped pupae - three days before emergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Our method comprises three parts: acclimation, feeding and brood assessment. An initial set-up phase, not represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, is required to first establish the mini-colonies inside the controlled flight enclosures. This initial set-up takes 5 days, where day 0 is the beginning of feeding. The feeding cycles repeat from days 0 to 15. Consumption and the bee population are monitored during the 15-day cycle, and a full brood assessment is conducted at the end. If, in between the 15-day feeding cycles, the mini-colony consumes the diet and has more than two frames of bees, the system progresses through the feeding cycle uninterrupted. However, if the bee population criterion is unmet, it triggers a nurse addition stage and colony acclimation. This is an additional 2-day process that involves adding nurse bees to low-populated mini-colonies, and the system resumes the standard 15-day cycle. This dynamic ensures that the system remains adaptive and maintains a colony baseline throughout its cycle. The method operates in a continuous loop with a repeating 15-day feeding cycle; however, we conducted only one cycle in this study.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>PART I - Laboratory diet design</title><p id="P12">Our chemically defined diets consisted of protein, carbohydrates, fats, sterols, micronutrients, and a maltodextrin filler (with no nutritional value for the bee). We used as a protein source a plant-based - Soy Protein Isolate (Myprotein, UK; 90% purity) product as described in Sereia et al. 2013<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. Here, we selected six diet treatments varying only in protein content (P): 6% (P6), 12% (P12), 15% (P15), 18% (P18), 25% (P25) and 30% w/w (P30). The percentage (w/w) of the diet total carbohydrate mixture ranged from 38% on P30 to 68% on P6, depending on the diet treatment. The carbohydrates consisted of about two-thirds of a mixture of 80% w/w sugar solution (in an equal mix of glucose and fructose) and one-third sucrose powder (Kent Foods, UK). As the fat source, we used soy lecithin (Optima Lecithin Health &amp; Nutrition, UK) at 6% w/w of the total diet on all treatments as in <italic>Stabler et al, 2021</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>. We used Cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%) at 0.1% w/w of the total diet as the sterol source, adapted from Herbert and Svoboda's 1980 diets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. We then mixed all ingredients into a dough and kneaded them into 50-60 g (5 mm thick) patties. To test the pliability and texture of the dough formulations (structure tests), we further tested them by placing samples on top of a plastic mesh (Ø 1 cm) inside an incubator at 34°C and 60% humidity (simulating in-hive conditions). After 24h, we discarded the diet formulations that absorbed excessive moisture and turned into sludge. We finally selected diets that successfully passed the structure test and that had been previously tested in our lab for palatability, consumption, and bee survival (&gt; over 90%) in ventilated acrylic boxes (unpublished data), monitored over a week as in de Sousa et al. (2022)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>PART II - Mini-colony preparation and set-up</title><p id="P13">We assembled 36 mini-nucleus styrofoam boxes with dimensions 24 x 15 x 16.5 cm (Apidea Vertriebs AG, Switzerland), fitted with three plastic mini-frames with an 11 x 11 cm new wax foundation and one internal liquid feeder with clay pebbles inside to prevent bees from drowning. Each mini-nuc (mini-nucleus box) was number tagged and painted in separate colours to facilitate homing behaviour <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. To measure enclosed temperature fluctuations, we added a temperature sensor data logger (Omega, OM-EL-USB-1) to the food chamber of a small subset of mini-colonies.</p><p id="P14">We began on day -5 by collecting a selection of mixed nurse bees from our apiary by gently shaking open-brood frames covered with nurse bees into our custom-made "wooden nurse collection box" (37.4 x 42.2 x 31.4 height cm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>). This box covered by insect metal mesh, had three internal frames, spaced at 6 cm one from the other, allowing bees to suspend in cluster formation to dissipate heat in the field. A detachable acrylic funnel sits on top, facilitating the brushing of nurse bees into it. Nurse bees were brushed while lightly sprinkling with a 33% sugar solution laced with a couple of drops of lemongrass oil (Neal's Yard, London) to prevent them from flying and to encourage nestmate formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>. To populate each mini-nuc, nurse bees must be brushed from 1.5 frames of open brood. Once complete, the box rests for one to three hours inside a dark room at 10 °C to promote cluster formation.</p><p id="P15">Next, we turned each mini-nuc bottom up, sliding open the floor panel and exposing the three plastic mini-frames with the foundation. Lining all Apideas in a row, we sequentially placed on each a caged mated queen with candy (Candito per Api, PIDA, Italy) between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> frames. We used a 500 mL glass beaker to shave the bees off the collection box frames, filled each mini-nuc with 450 mL of mixed nurse bees (approx. 1,018) inside, and then slid closed the floor panel. Once all mini-colonies were formed <italic>de novo</italic> with nurse bees and a mated queen, we fed 350 mL of 1:1 (water to sugar) syrup into the internal feeder. We placed all mini-colonies housed in Apideas inside a ventilated dark room at 10°C for 48h for further nestmate and colony formation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>PART III - Mini-colony acclimatisation to semi-field enclosures</title><p id="P16">We conducted two experiments, the first in a glasshouse with 30 colonies and the second in a polytunnel with 6 colonies. After the 48 hours of nestmate formation (day -3), at sunset, we released 30 mini-colonies inside the two-room glasshouse (l: 10 m x w: 5 m x h: 2.5 m) with 125 m<sup>3</sup> of total flight volume to acclimate to the semi-field setting and to test our five increasing stepwise protein diets (P6, P12, P18, P25, P30). The repurposed glasshouse consisted of glass panels with a galvanised steel frame structure. Each of the two rooms of the glasshouse had a long central table where we placed 15 mini-colonies in groups of three (triangle shape) with entrances pointing in different directions. Due to the inherent heating capacity of the glasshouse infrastructure and to promote air circulation, we installed a mesh shade covering the whole area of the glass ceiling, two commercial extraction fans on both ends of the glasshouse, three portable aircon units, and three oscillating pedestal fans.</p><p id="P17">The second experiment was conducted in a purpose-built polytunnel (NP Structures, UK) measuring 18.4 m x 8.23 m x 4.15 m, providing six times more flight volume (628.4 m<sup>3</sup>) than the existing glasshouse. The polytunnel was covered in white insect mesh, and we repeated the same method with the (P15) diet using 6 new mini-colonies, which were placed in different directions in two groups of three, each on two tables, as described above.</p><p id="P18">After 24h of releasing the mini-colonies inside the semi-field enclosures (day -2, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1.A</xref>), we expanded their nest volume by removing the internal liquid feeder, adding two frames with wax foundation, and a top solid food chamber. We then top-up with an extra 250 mL of mixed nurse bees (approximately 566 bees) from our "nurse collection box" (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>). The solid food chamber, used for top-up nurse bees and placing our protein diets, is made from an APIDEA super feeder (700 mL), into which we cut a central hole (10 x 8 cm) and covered it with a green plastic mesh (12.5 x 9.5 cm, Ø1 cm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>). Diet patties were placed over the mesh, 1 cm above the brood frames. Bees could access the food from below and move within the food chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>) to consume the diet.</p><p id="P19">Next, we suspended two artificial flowers per mini-colony throughout the enclosures, made from adapted 250 mL infant feeding bottles by piercing five Ø0.5 mm holes in its nipples and adding colourful velvet pipe cleaners for bee identification and grip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1 D</xref>). Each bottle was filled with 250 mL of 33% sucrose solution and hung upside down, functioning as a gravity feeder to promote nectar foraging. Our artificial flowers restricted bees' drinking access to only five at a time, preventing hoarding behaviour. The sucrose concentration in our feeders is in the mid-range of nectar of flowers typically visited by honey bees <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>, and extends foraging activity within the enclosures relative to using higher sucrose concentrations. Additionally, such syrup concentration maintains high internal humidity favourable to brood development in summer and engages nest bees in activities of nectar-to-honey conversion. Drawbacks of low syrup concentration were noted during periods of continuous rain and cold within the polytunnel, leading to an outbreak of chalkbrood, consistent with findings by Flores et al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup>. We washed and replenished feeding bottles per week and as needed.

The assignment criteria of diet to mini-colony aimed to maintain a balanced population size distribution and entrance direction among treatments and reduce bias on sun exposure, orientation, and colony population. Before feeding the mini-colonies with the protein diets, we recorded the initial weight of each mini-colony with a field scale (Ohaus Scout Pro Portable). We also recorded the number of bee seams (0 to 6 bee seams - clusters of bees occupying the spaces between two combs, or comb and hive wall) as per <italic>Chabert et al, 2021</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup> by photographing the colony from above to estimate the population size of each mini-colony. Each bee seam was estimated to represent approximately 300 bees to calculate the colony size.</p><p id="P22">For all treatments, we weighed each diet to 50-60 grams of dough, rolled them into 5 mm thick patties, and placed them inside the food chamber over the green mesh. This marks the start of our nutritional bioassay experiment (day 0). A week later (day 7), with minimal disturbance to the colony, we removed the patty and registered population size and diet consumption by tracking changes in the patty's weight for all mini-colonies and diet treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>), taking an observation note if bees were eating the patty. The treatments are discontinued if nurse-aged bees avoid the diet altogether, indicated by marginal changes in diet weight or 'negative consumption' – i.e. when patties are not eaten and instead gain weight due to moisture absorption. In both experiments, the feeding cycle proceeded since consumption was observed in all treatments. Therefore, in our study, a fresh patty was provided, and its weight was recorded before adding the new patty. The mini-colonies were weighed to estimate changes in sugar stores.</p><p id="P23">On day 15 of our bioassay experiment (one brood cycle), we performed a complete mini-colony assessment on all treatments. We assessed colony weight, population size, honey stores, diet consumption and brood stages on all frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). We measured the brood stages by photographing both sides of every frame using a bespoke photographic-acrylic device (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1 - supplementary</xref>). The device consisted of a custom-made acrylic box (internal dimensions: 22.3 x 14.5 x 13.2 cm, Ø 4 mm of thickness) that could be mounted on top of an open mini-colony rim, with a one-frame stand at its centre. On each end, it displayed two RPi cameras (64MP Autofocus Camera, Arducam) focused on the frame's centre, with both cameras connected to a Raspberry Pi 4 (designated as the imager). Another Raspberry Pi 3 (named "controller") was connected to a touchscreen display (Official Raspberry Pi 7" Touchscreen Display) and to the "imager" via an Ethernet cable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). The "controller" controlled the "imager" remotely via SSH using a shell script software "image-experiment.sh". Detailed set-up instructions and the code used are available at github.com/carandraug/beehive-imaging under the GNU All-Permissive License. The device recorded the time taken for the complete assessment (five frames, 10 pictures per mini-colony serially numbered); an experienced researcher spent, on average, 5 minutes and 41 seconds per mini-colony from setting the device to removing it. We then visually counted the number of capped brood cells in each image using available software (Adobe Creative Cloud 2019-2024, version 6.4.0.361, PS -Count Tool). At this stage of our experiment, we measured the influence of nutrition during the "one-capped bioassay cycle" (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>). We defined each bioassay cycle as the period when all capped brood was originated from eggs that were laid under the experimental procedure. At the start of the feeding period, all treatments started at the same brood stage (eggs) at day 0, with no capped cells present.</p><p id="P24">Not all of the eggs that the queen lays will develop into adults. Nutritional stress may lead to oophagy, the consumption of eggs by nurse bees, and up to cannibalistic consumption of the young larvae <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Developing brood that is sick may be identified by nurse bees, which will open capped cells and remove the sick bee <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref></sup>. However, a healthy brood that reaches the capped stage will likely emerge as an adult. In the subsequent 15-day bioassay cycles, the previously capped brood will emerge, the newly laid eggs will turn into pupae, and a new cycle begins, guaranteeing that we are not double counting the same capped cells or missing capped cycles. Hence, we can continue the experiment for additional bioassay cycles by sequentially repeating the procedures from Day 7 and Day 15, measuring each newly capped cell that is in the stage between the pre-pupae and the point before the pupae emerge. In this study, we terminated the experiment after the first bioassay cycle.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Data, Statistics and Power Analysis</title><p id="P25">Statistical analyses of diet consumption, capped-brood-cell counts, protein consumption, and “bees per gram” were conducted in Python 3.12.4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</ext-link>) within VS Code, with assistance from GitHub Copilot.

Protein ingestion was estimated by multiplying each diet's protein percentage by its total consumption. We then calculated our metric, 'bees per gram,' by dividing the number of capped brood cells by the total diet consumed. This metric represents the number of bees reared per gram of diet that is consumed, based on the assumption that each capped cell will develop into a viable adult bee. A Pearson correlation matrix was used to assess relationships between the independent variable (diet type) and dependent variables, including capped brood, total diet consumption, protein ingestion, population size, and 'bees per gram.'</p><p id="P27">Our main objective was to evaluate the effects of nutrition, specifically protein content, on brood development. We explored the relationship between protein percentage as a continuous variable with our response variables—consumption, capped brood cells, and 'bees per gram' by using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model from the Statsmodels 0.14.1 package. We estimated the intercept of the regression line to make it more accurate for our biological data. Key outputs include: the coefficient (coef), which indicates the strength and direction of the protein influence; the p-value and the R<sup>2</sup> value, which quantifies how much of the variation in the response is explained by protein. We also used the OLS to perform a power analysis to estimate: i) the probability of accurately detecting the protein effect on the brood - power (1 - β) and ii) considering that in future studies, we require an 80% degree of confidence – what is the sample size needed.

Population trends were analysed using Graphpad prism 10.4.1. To analyse population trends throughout the days and population differences between diets, we employed its mixed-effects model with Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimation at a significance level of 0.05, assuming that the variance between treatments was equal. Specifically, the mixed-effects model evaluated population differences between diet treatments inside the glasshouse (P6, P12, P18, P25, P30) on each assessment day and assessed population changes over time for each diet. This analysis covered the feeding period (days 0, 7, and 15) and the acclimation period (days -2 and -1). We then used Tukey's post-hoc multiple comparison test to determine population differences between days and treatments. Since population size in mini-colonies can be a confounding factor for rearing capped brood, and since we observed absconding events among mini-colonies inside the glasshouse, we set criteria to identify potential outliers. Specifically, if a mini-colony showed a significant difference in population size in our mixed-effects model between Day 0 and Day 15, and its capped brood measurement had a z-score exceeding the factor of 2, meaning a data point beyond two standard deviations from the mean, we have considered that measurement an outlier. The z-score (<italic>z</italic>) for each data point (<italic>x</italic>) was calculated using the formula: <italic>z</italic> = (<italic>x</italic> – <italic>μ</italic>)/<italic>σ</italic>.

We performed an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model to evaluate the influence of protein percentage on diet consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The OLS showed that protein-rich diets positively affected diet consumption (β = 1.33, p &lt; 0.005), indicating that for each protein percentage increase in our diets, our mini-colonies will eat 1.3 grams more. The model explained 35% of the variance in diet consumption (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.35, F(1,25) = 13.6, p = 0.001.) Additionally, the Pearson correlation demonstrated a positive correlation between protein-rich diets and diet consumption (<italic>r(25)</italic> = 0.59, <italic>p&lt;0.005</italic>). Although protein strongly influences diet consumption, it doesn't necessarily mean colonies will neglect diets that are entirely absent of protein. For example, other dietary components, such as carbohydrates, can also significantly influence food collection and consumption in honey bee colonies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref></sup> .</p><p id="P31">Since diet consumption and protein intake are inherently linked in our experiment, mini-colonies that consumed more of the protein-rich diets also ingested more protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>).

The regression coefficient indicated that for every gram of diet consumed, colonies ingested approximately 0.35 g of protein (β = 0.35, p &lt; 0.001).

One of our primary objectives was to assess how dietary protein content influences brood production and whether a stepwise increase in protein percentage drives greater protein intake and brood rearing. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, we observed a clear positive relationship between dietary protein percentage and the number of capped brood cells. The OLS demonstrated a strong fit, explaining 76% of the variance in capped brood production (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.76, F(1,25) = 78.61, p &lt; 0.001). For every 1% increase in dietary protein, colonies produced an average of 11 additional capped cells (β = 10.9, p &lt; 0.001). A power analysis based on our sample size of 27 mini-colonies indicated a 99% probability (power = 0.99) of detecting a protein effect within the tested range. If in future studies a power of 80% were acceptable, only five colonies (N = 5), one per diet level, would be needed to detect a similar effect.</p><p id="P33">A consistent trend was observed for the relationship between protein intake and brood production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).

For every gram of protein consumed, mini-colonies produced an average of 12 additional capped brood cells (β = 12, p &lt; 0.001). Protein-rich diets had a marked impact on brood production. Colonies fed the highest-protein diet (P30) produced more than twice as many capped brood cells as those on P18, and nearly ten times more than colonies on the lowest-protein diet (P6). These findings support our hypothesis that total protein intake—rather than overall diet consumption—is the primary driver of brood development. Diets with higher protein content significantly enhanced brood production, suggesting that increased protein availability improves colony productivity by increasing worker numbers, which may in turn benefit overall colony health.</p><p id="P34">The ability to precisely quantify both diet consumption and the number of capped brood cells enabled us to estimate diet efficiency, defined by our key metric: bees per gram—the number of bees produced per gram of food consumed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). The mini-colonies fed diets with low protein content like (P6) and (P12) generated less than one bee per gram, whereas protein-rich diets like (P25) and (P30) reared four times more bees per gram of diet, 4.39±2.78 and 4.43±1.21 bees/g, respectively. This relationship between protein and brood is consistent with previous studies, such as Ricigliano et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and others <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref></sup>, demonstrating a positive relationship between protein supplementation and brood development.

This method proved helpful in forming <italic>de novo</italic> colonies of specific sizes. All mini-colonies were established by measuring 700 millilitres of mixed-aged bees (approximately 200 grams); we estimated that there are approximately 787 bees per 100 grams and 226 bees per 100 millilitres. This estimation was based on calculating the average number of bees per 100 grams of weight and per 100 millilitres of volume from 28 research papers, including our lab measurements. At the start, we estimated a population of about 1,580 bees per mini-colony - an average of 5.2 bee seams, where each seam represents approximately 300 bees.</p><p id="P37">Since the release into the enclosure on day -5, we measured population sizes during the acclimation period on days -2, -1, and 0. We standardised colony populations prior to the feeding period, where colonies with fewer than 1,500 total bees were supplemented with orphan nurse bees until each colony contained 1,400–1,500 nurse bees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). On day -2, at least 24 colonies required substantial supplementation with a mean initial population size of 1,050 ± 146 bees (ranging from P6 to P25 treatments). One day after supplementation (day -1), the population of all colonies increased to an average of 1,530 ± 202 bees. However, a slight reduction in population was observed across all mini-colonies between day -1 and day 0, likely due to bee disorientation and subsequent bee losses within the enclosure. Despite this reduction, supplementation successfully increased the population size across all treatments, with a mean of 1,422 ± 195 bees recorded on day 0, closely approaching the target. Statistical analysis demonstrates significant differences in population sizes between days -2 and 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>; mixed-effects model, three-time points; P &lt; 0.0001). This supplementation technique effectively increased the number of nurse bees in underpopulated mini-colonies and standardised colony populations before the onset of the feeding period on day 0. Previously, we attempted to avoid this supplementation step by stocking all mini-colonies from the onset (day -5) with more than 1,500 bees by adding extra bees (&gt;1500) and starting with five frames in each mini-nuc instead of three. However, due to ventilation constraints in the Apideas and the need to use a large top feeder rather than a smaller internal feeder, the bees had great difficulty both ventilating the nuc and consuming syrup during the crucial 48-hour cold and dark nestmate/colony formation period. This variation resulted in high colony mortality; hence, we opted for the intermediate step of adding bees on day -2 according to our methods.</p><p id="P38">During the bioassay feeding period, between day 0 and day 15, we did not anticipate significant differences in population size over such a short time frame unless variations in adult mortality were present. No statistical differences were found when comparing population sizes between diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>; mixed-effects model, <italic>ns</italic> Diets P &gt; 0.05).

Additionally, when comparing population trends during the 15 days within each diet, most treatment diets (P6, P12, P25, P30) showed no significant population changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>; Tukey's HSD, Days 0, 7 and 15, P &gt; 0.05), as expected from the experiment's short duration.

The use of the 'nurse collection box' proved an effective tool for forming new colonies and replenishing mini-colony populations. Aggression toward non-nestmate nurses at hive entrances was observed in a handful of mini-colonies but subsided within two hours. Supplementing orphaned nurse bees and bee population variations due to absconding can influence colony nutritional physiology; therefore, it is important to time the supplementation across treatments and register any absconding events.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Enclosure systems strongly influence ambient temperature and significantly influence brood health</title><p id="P40">The method described was developed over five years, with initial trials of varying mating-nuc type, enclosures, colony size, and feeder configurations until it reached the refined stage presented here. Maintaining the daily average ambient temperature inside the enclosures below 37.5°C is crucial, as higher temperatures affect brood survival <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. For example, Xu <italic>et al</italic>., <italic>2023</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref></sup> have sown that pre-pupae in the developmental stages (days 6 to 9) and pupae exhibit high susceptibility to hive temperatures of 40°C, with increased mortality rates and bees emerging with shortened proboscises and forewings.</p><p id="P41">Trials tested inside the glasshouse proved significantly challenging in hampering down environmental temperatures. Throughout the optimisation of our methods, we have employed shading nets, misting systems, air conditioning units, pedestal fans, and two horizontal industrial extraction fans; however, these measures were insufficient to prevent some queen losses and absconding during heatwaves <italic>(n=3)</italic>. Additionally, the ground floor cover type can impact the temperature and air sanitation within the enclosed space. Ground covers made of concrete slabs have high thermal mass, which adds a challenge to cooling the environment. Other drawbacks are the accumulation of bee carcasses, which increased the researcher's susceptibility to heat stress and bee dust-related hay fever, necessitating regular cleaning.</p><p id="P42">In July 2019, the glasshouse ambient readings from the supporting tables (n=2) and in-hive temperatures (readings from the food chamber, n=2) were measured every 5 min during the hottest days with USB temperature data loggers (Omega Engineering) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4</xref>). Peak ambient temperatures reached 45°C inside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Adult workers demonstrated greater heat stress resilience than brood and queens. Three queens died during the July heat wave that coincided with our bioassay cycle. Despite the losses, the remaining mini-colonies were capable of regulating their internal temperature, maintaining a more stable and less variable environment, as demonstrated by the lower standard deviation (SD) between the inside (6.31°C) and the outside (10.32°C) temperature, as well as the smaller interquartile range (IQR); inside (11.5°C) compared to the outside (20.1°C). The misting system effectively mitigated some heat stress, activated from 12h30 until 16h00 in 30-minute bursts, reducing the ambient temperature from 43°C to 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4A</xref>). Once it stopped, the temperature rose to 40°C.</p><p id="P43">The type of enclosure inherently creates different environmental conditions, significantly influencing the mini colonies' capacity to rear their brood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). In our analysis, we excluded one replicate from the (P18) diet group because its capped brood had a z-score of 2.213, exceeding two standard deviations from the mean, and the mini-colony showed a significant population increase from Day 0 to Day 15. This met both of our criteria for identifying outliers. Still, the mini-colonies inside the polytunnel were able to rear twice as many capped brood cells compared to those inside the glasshouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>; unpaired t-test, <italic>P&lt;</italic>0.0001), despite similar consumption and population sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B and 5C</xref>; unpaired t-test, ns, <italic>P&gt;</italic>0.05). The main methodological differences between the two locations were the type of enclosure used to house the mini-colonies during the bioassay and the diet protein percentage. As previously discussed, protein contents influenced brood-rearing capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B and 2D</xref>). However, we tested a lower protein diet inside the polytunnel (P15) that, nonetheless, had greater brood rearing with a 59% increase in capped cells when compared to the glasshouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). This is most likely due to the consistently higher temperatures and poorer ventilation inside the glasshouse, which reached 40°C during the bioassay period. O'Connell <italic>et al</italic>.

Furthermore, other differences between the two enclosures might have additional impacts on the well-being of the mini-colonies. For example, flight volume was higher inside the polytunnel, which also had better ventilation due to its netted enclosure. The polytunnel ground had a natural composition of ryegrass, in contrast to the concrete slabs inside the glasshouse.

Feeders providing ample drinking space were emptied within hours, causing some mini-colonies to fill rapidly. When we supplied high-concentration syrup (&gt;50% carbohydrates), we noticed a reduction in the area available for queens to lay eggs – in these mini-colonies, sugar storage can rapidly occur in the middle frames limiting the number of empty cells available to egg laying and potential brood rearing. A syrup concentration of 33% carbohydrates, similar to the nectar found in wildflowers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref></sup>, was preferred. The current artificial flowers function as gravity feeders. Developing a mechanism for timed nectar release is expected to prolong foraging activity and potentially reduce the incidence of foragers becoming trapped against the enclosure walls and in "light traps" by keeping them engaged in the artificial flowers. Future studies should explore methods to mitigate these traps through improved light dispersion shading techniques, including mitigating heat shocks during the summer by applying better cooling systems.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Development and optimisation of a minimally disruptive image-capturing system for standardising honey bee nutritional studies</title><p id="P46">Image analysis is a powerful tool for evaluating colony development, and several machine learning models have been developed to measure comb cell contents accurately<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref></sup>, such as DeepBee<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup> or adapted ImageJ models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">102</xref></sup>. However, as crucial as developing these models is, an optimised image-capturing mechanism is essential. The need to shake colony frames to release adult bees for image capture, combined with sudden comb temperature fluctuations, can result in high stress levels for both adults and brood, negatively impacting colony health. The novel device explicitly constructed for this bioassay method sits on top of the mini-colony, allowing us to optimise image timing and minimise disruptions to our mini-colonies during the 15-day complete assessment cycle. Frames with adult bees are removed and shaken sequentially to the inside of the acrylic box, guaranteeing that all nurse bees are placed back in their hive with frames to support them. The acrylic used to construct the box was off-the-shelf anti-glare Perspex acrylic with UV protection, similar to what museums use to protect picture frames. This provides some UV protection to honey bee eggs and larvae, sensitive to UV irradiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">103</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P47">The image capture speed on both sides of the frame is approximately ≈1.19 min per frame. A single experienced researcher can complete a full assessment of each mini-colony in (≈ 6.35 min), less than 10 min per mini-colony. In contrast, previously, two were needed to speed up the process and reduce colony disruption. To the best of our knowledge, this is the quickest and least disruptive method to capture images across all honey bee colony frames. The image's size is ≈ 2.2Mb, and its quality is assessed by visually confirming it at the touchscreen display. We repeated image capture if images turned out of focus, stray bees covered the combs or environmental light impeded a clear image (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>.). We captured 800 frame images in one trial, and 39 were out of focus or poor quality. Counting cells with eggs and larvae remains challenging, as the device only captures the full depth of the comb located at the centre of the mini-colony frame, about 100 cells per frame side. This is due to the natural individual cell shape that has an hexagonal structure tilted upwards at 9-14° and with depth of aprox. ≈12mm. In contrast, capped brood and honey cells are easily quantifiable by visually counting each comb cell surface.</p><p id="P48">The double Raspberry Pi set-up was required because the Raspberry Pi 4 cannot reliably and simultaneously control the Arducam 64MP Hawkeye cameras and its touchscreen display. Therefore, the two cameras were connected to one RPi, the touchscreen display was connected to the second RPi, and an Ethernet cable connected both RPi together. The RPi with both cameras was designed as the "imager", and the RPi with the touchscreen was designed as the "controller". The controller Pi controls the imager Pi remotely and displays the acquired images for review. The capture speed and the acrylic box protect the combs from environmental temperature and UV exposure, which is especially relevant in frames containing brood. However, improvements are still possible in further iterations to increase capture speed and image quality. For example, installing additional cameras would allow us to capture comb edges more effectively, or a scanning method (with a single camera) would enable us to examine each frame from top to bottom. Also, making the system completely wireless for higher flexibility and manoeuvring in field-type of settings. It would also be possible to optimise the software code to enable the device to capture images on both frame sides, optimising speed simultaneously. Future enhancements could also incorporate artificial lighting on each side to better capture honey bee larvae and include small temperature sensors in the acrylic box to warn the researcher if local micro-temperatures that harm the brood are extremely low or high. We hope this method establishes a foundation for standardising future nutritional studies as a whole.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary</label><media xlink:href="EMS207091-supplement-Supplementary.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d134aAcDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S16"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Haim Kalev for his general beekeeping husbandry; John Hogg for crafting the nurse-collection and acrylic boxes; and Jennifer Chennels for laboratory support.

From top to bottom, the matrix summarises the main tasks to be performed at each time point. At day 0, the main tasks include assessing colony weight, population size and feeding each with a solid diet (patty). On day 7, we recorded the colony weights, population size and the weight change in the patty to estimate diet consumption. Finally, on day 15 (one brood cycle), we assessed the same metrics plus a full brood observation by photographing every frame across all treatments for capped brood count. It also describes the mini-colony's main activity: after acclimation inside the semi-field enclosure, it progressively consumes the diet to feed the larva, forages for nectar syrup, and ultimately takes care of its brood.
