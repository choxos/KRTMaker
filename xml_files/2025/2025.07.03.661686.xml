Despite its fundamental role in intestinal homeostasis, the mechanisms that trigger, compartmentalize, and execute intestinal cell extrusion remain largely unknown. Here, using intestinal organoids, we map the three-dimensional forces and cytoskeletal dynamics that drive intestinal cell extrusion. We show that, unlike in other epithelia, extrusion is initiated by the sudden dissolution of a contractile myosin 2A meshwork triggered by a calcium influx. Following meshwork dissolution, the extruding cell and its neighbors generate an upwards traction force that requires myosin contractility but is generated by lamellipodial protrusions in neighboring cells. Importantly, these lamellipodia not only act as force generators but also determine whether extrusion occurs apically or basally, serving as symmetry breakers of the process. Finally, we show that compartmentalization of cell extrusion to the outside of the intestinal crypt does not require curvature and instead depends on myosin 2A. Our findings reveal that the intestinal epithelium exhibits a distinctive mode of extrusion, in which tension differentials—rather than compressive stresses from crowding—trigger and compartmentalize cell removal.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The mammalian intestinal epithelium is a rapidly self-renewing tissue that acts as a multifunctional barrier between the body and the external environment. A central mechanism enabling this renewal is cell extrusion—the removal of single cells from the epithelium without compromising barrier function. In the intestine, cell extrusion takes place in the differentiated villus compartment of the tissue. If dysregulated, excessive extrusion destroys barrier integrity and drives villus atrophy in precancerous pathologies like the inflammatory bowel disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Although the impact of extrusion on intestinal health is clear, nearly 80 years after the first description of the extensive ‘cell shedding’ in the intestinal villus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, much remains to be explored about how this process occurs within this complex epithelial environment.</p><p id="P3">Cell extrusion is a mechanical process (rev. in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>) that has been extensively investigated within simple epithelia such as MDCK cell lines. These studies, which typically injure a cell or otherwise promote cell death, found that key mechanical events of extrusion are spatiotemporally coordinated between the extruding cell and its neighbors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. A common feature is the formation of contractile actomyosin rings that act like a purse string to squeeze the extruding cell out of the tissue. Such rings have been observed both in the extruding cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and in its immediate neighbors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In addition to actomyosin contractility, neighboring cells can contribute to extrusion by forming lamellipodial protrusions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, depending on cell viability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, the nature of the damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and tissue density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The state of mechanical stress in the monolayer is a key determinant for homeostatic cell extrusion, with a consensus view that extrusion is promoted by compressive stresses and deferred by tensile ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Despite this emerging consensus, even in simplified systems such as immortalized cell line monolayers, we still lack measurements of key mechanical variables that drive extrusion—particularly the 3D physical forces responsible for expelling cells from the tissue.</p><p id="P4">The inaccessibility of the <italic>in vivo</italic> intestinal tissue has hindered mechanistic studies on intestinal cell extrusion. Work using fixed human samples showed that intestinal cells accumulate non-muscle myosin 2A during extrusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, these snapshots lack temporal information of what is a highly dynamic process. This limitation is circumvented by intestinal organoid models, where actin was shown in live images to accumulate at the interface between the extruding cell and its immediate neighbors throughout extrusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Despite these advances, however, fundamental questions remain unanswered including the nature of the signals that trigger intestinal cell extrusion, the factors that restrict it to the villus region, and the mechanisms responsible for its execution. Here we address these questions by studying the 3D mechanics of cell extrusion in intestinal organoids. We show that extrusion is mainly compartmentalized to the villus by the activity of myosin 2A. Unlike previously studied systems, we demonstrate that intestinal cell extrusion is triggered by the collapse of a tensed actomyosin basal meshwork, triggered by a calcium influx. In addition, by mapping the 3D force patterns that drive cell extrusion, we show that neighboring lamellipodia are the main traction force generators in the system and act as symmetry breakers, determining whether cells extrude apically or basally. Together, our findings reveal a new mode of cell extrusion that, rather than being triggered by compression as traditionally recognized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, occurs under tension.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Tissue curvature is not required to localize cell extrusion to the villus compartment of the intestine</title><p id="P5">To gain experimental access to the intestinal epithelium, we cultured organoids as monolayers on top of soft synthetic substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). This tissue configuration preserves the crypt-villus compartments of the <italic>in vivo</italic> intestine but additionally enables live imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution. Unlike conventional 3D organoids, these open-lumen organoids present the apical lumen of the organoid as an open and accessible tissue surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), allowing us to image apical, lateral and basal cell surfaces (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 1</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In the <italic>in vivo</italic> intestinal epithelium, extrusion is restricted to the differentiated cells of the villus, predominantly at its tip<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. To examine if our flat intestinal tissue captures this physiological feature, we mapped the extrusion distribution throughout the monolayer. As observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, cells in organoids extruded almost exclusively in the villus-like region containing differentiated cells (hereafter referred to as “villus” for simplicity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). This indicates that the hallmark curvature <italic>in vivo</italic> is not required to localize cell extrusion to the intestinal villus. Moreover, we found that cells extruded uniformly throughout the villus region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), additionally implying that neither cell age nor distance from the crypt triggers extrusion.</p><p id="P7">We next tested the long-held assumption that cells in the small intestine die before they extrude from the villus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. We examined the viability of extruding intestinal cells by staining for the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3. Only around 50% of the cells extruded from the organoid villus-like region were positive for cleaved caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), indicating that intestinal cells can extrude alive. Because of reports that different tissue preparation protocols might affect results on intestinal cell viability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, we also imaged living organoids with the fluorescent caspase 3/7 substrate NucView. Cells became positive for NucView fluorescence only after being fully extruded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, in some cases several hours after extrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>), indicating that we were witnessing predominately live cell extrusion. Consistently, inhibiting apoptosis by a pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK did not reduce intestinal extrusion rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). By contrast, a reduction in extrusion rate was achieved by blocking mechanosensitive ion channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>), known to be key upstream triggers of homeostatic cell extrusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Despite resulting in variable percentages of viability, these different approaches indicate that most small intestine cells in organoid monolayers extrude from the tissue while they are still living. Together, this initial investigation shows that intestinal cells do not require tissue curvature, stromal tissue, or apoptosis to extrude specifically in the intestinal villus.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Upward and outward cell-substrate tractions characterize intestinal cell extrusion</title><p id="P8">The extrusion of cells from a tissue is a mechanical process that involves force generation in both the extruding cell and its neighbors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. To date, force measurements have been restricted to in-plane traction components, despite the fact that extrusion is fundamentally an out-of-plane process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. To fill this gap, we measured the time evolution of 3D cell-substrate traction fields generated during villus cell extrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2ab</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 2</xref>). The dominant force component was an upwards-pointing traction that peaked mid extrusion and decayed slowly over time, remaining significantly positive well after (&gt;1 h) extrusion was completed. We also observed weaker but systematic in-plane traction components both under the extruding cell and its neighbors. To analyze the full temporal evolution of these traction fields, we represented both vertical and radial traction components as kymographs.</p><p id="P9">Vertical traction kymographs showed that the upwards-pulling traction generated under the extruding cell was balanced by downwards-pushing traction under its nearest neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, N1), resulting in the generation of a mechanical torque. Radial traction kymographs showed that, under the extruding cell, in-plane tractions pointed away from the extrusion center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Further away, across at least two rows of neighboring cells, in-plane tractions showed a broad signature in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), suggesting a cooperative neighbor contraction towards the extrusion center.</p><p id="P10">Treatment with 25 µM paranitro-blebbistatin, used to inhibit non-muscle myosin 2A-generated cell contractility, did not stop extrusion events, but it reduced drastically both out-of-plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>) and in-plane tractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). This result indicates that non-muscle myosin 2A (from now on ‘myosin 2A’) generates 3D forces during villus cell extrusion and that, when tension is removed from the monolayer, the forces involved during extrusion are markedly lower. Strikingly, with loss of contractility achieved either through paranitro-blebbistatin treatment or NM2A knockout, crypt cells begun to extrude at the same rate as villus cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). This latter finding indicates that myosin 2A-driven contractility prevents intestinal crypt cells from extruding.</p><p id="P11">Overall, our traction measurements reveal a supracellular 3D mechanical pattern during cell extrusion, whereby the extruding cell and its neighbors generate a mechanical torque, akin to the torque produced when sand is shoveled from a pile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>). As extrusion was not abolished with contractility inhibition, our results also indicate that the intestinal extrusion force adapts to the mechanical state of the villus tissue. Furthermore, we show that contractility of the crypt compartmentalizes intestinal cell extrusion exclusively to the villus.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Intestinal cells extrude following the dissolution of a tensed basal myosin meshwork</title><p id="P12">Previous studies using cell lines have shown that extrusion is triggered by compressive stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. However, our prior work showed that the villus domain in open-lumen organoids is under tension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, raising the question of how extrusion is triggered in this system. To address this question, we first characterized the distribution of myosin 2A during extrusion by imaging live organoids with endogenously tagged (NM2A-eGFP). In these organoids, we observed striking differences in the organization of basal myosin 2A between the villus and the crypt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In the crypt, myosin 2A was localized throughout the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). By contrast, in villus cells, which contained overall higher levels of myosin 2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1f</xref>, and <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>), myosin 2A localized predominantly to a medial meshwork at the basal surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3bc</xref>), often forming a thick ring-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Super-resolution Airyscan images revealed that, in this basal villus cell meshwork, myosin 2A formed regularly spaced clusters along basal stress fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). Unlike F-actin, myosin 2A was absent from villus cell–cell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1c,d</xref>). A similar non-junctional myosin 2A structure has recently been imaged <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, confirming that our open-lumen organoids recapitulate physiologically relevant mechanical features of the intestinal epithelium.</p><p id="P13">Fast live imaging of the basal myosin 2A meshwork showed consistent myosin 2A retrograde flow from the periphery towards the cell center in villus cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 3</xref>), suggesting that this mechanism prevents myosin 2A from accumulating in the cortex of villus cells. In agreement with this interpretation, pharmacological inhibition of retrograde flow with a combination of paranitro-blebbistatin, CK-666 and jasplakinolide (BCJ cocktail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>) abolished the fine basal meshwork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 4</xref>) and myosin 2A accumulated in the cell cortex. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that villus cells maintain a non-junctional, basal myosin 2A structure whose function is unknown.</p><p id="P14">We next examined whether this meshwork contributes to the villus cell extrusion process. At the onset of extrusion, the meshwork in the extruding cell rapidly dissociated to form a diffuse basal pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). This dissolution lasted around 2.5 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 5</xref>). Simultaneously, the basal cell area expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>), indicating tension release. The presence of basal tension prior to extrusion was confirmed through laser ablation experiments on the meshwork, which showed rapid recoil away from the cut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 6</xref>). Within 30 minutes, 85% of cells with the meshwork damaged by laser ablation extruded from the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3j</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 7</xref>), indicating that tension release in the basal myosin 2A meshwork triggers extrusion. This stands in contrast to current knowledge of epithelial cell extrusion, where the first morphological change is apical constriction in the extruding cell (rev. in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>). Overall, these experiments identified a basal meshwork of non-junctional myosin 2A, which distinguishes villus cells from crypt cells. This meshwork sets the mechanical landscape of the villus and its dissolution initiates extrusion.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>A calcium influx precedes basal myosin meshwork disassembly</title><p id="P15">We next investigated the mechanism behind the observed rapid dissociation of the basal actomyosin meshwork. Given the known sensitivity of cytoskeletal dynamics to calcium, we hypothesized that a transient calcium influx may act as the proximal trigger of this dissociation in villus cells. To test this hypothesis, we carried out live imaging of organoids expressing a genetically encoded calcium sensor. Extrusion was preceded by a calcium pulse in the extruding cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3kl</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 8</xref>), indicating that intracellular calcium might indeed be a trigger of meshwork dissolution. To directly test this, we pharmacologically elevated cytosolic calcium using thapsigargin, which led to myosin 2A meshwork dissolution within minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3m</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 9</xref>). These results, together with our finding that mechanosensitive ion channels regulate extrusion rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>), suggest that villus cells extrude after an influx of calcium through mechanosensitive channels.</p><p id="P16">Because focal adhesions are necessary for basal fiber maintenance, we next examined cell-substrate adhesions in relation to basal meshwork morphology via phospho-paxillin immunostaining. In cells with a dissolved meshwork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3n</xref>, top) as well as in those at a later stage of extrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3n</xref>, bottom, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>), focal adhesions were indeed disassembled. In contrast, the leading edge of neighboring cells exhibited a pronounced enrichment of phospho-paxillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3n</xref>, bottom, arrowhead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>), indicating that initial meshwork dissolution and concurrent disassembly of cell-substrate adhesions enables the protrusion of neighboring lamellipodia into the space beneath the extruding cell. Together, these experiments suggest that elevation of calcium in villus cells triggers the dissolution of the basal myosin 2A meshwork, which is the initial step in villus cell extrusion.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The basal myosin meshwork sequesters the extrusion machinery</title><p id="P17">We next investigated how the reorganization of the myosin 2A pool following meshwork dissolution leads to extrusion. To distinguish myosin 2A dynamics in the extruding cell from that in its neighbors, we generated mosaic organoids combining membrane-tagged tdTomato (mTomato) and myosin-eGFP. Imaging the extrusion of a single myosin-eGFP cell fully surrounded by mTomato cells revealed that myosin dissolution was rapidly followed by the translocation of myosin 2A to cell-cell junctions, where it assembled into a ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Conversely, extrusion of a mTomato cell surrounded by myosin-eGFP cells showed the formation of a second myosin ring in the neighbors. Partial mosaics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 10</xref>) revealed that, simultaneously with this myosin 2A reorganization, neighbor cells extended lamellipodia under the extruding cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>, bottom). Altogether, these experiments reveal that in the intestine, cells simultaneously reorganize both their contractile and protrusive structures during extrusion.</p><p id="P18">To assess the crosstalk between the extruding cell and its neighbors we blocked E-cadherin cell-cell connections using the DECMA function-blocking antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). This junction inhibition abolished the basal fibrous meshwork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref> leftmost), indicating that intact intercellular adhesions are required to sustain meshwork tension. Instead of forming the basal meshwork, myosin 2A localized to the cell cortex. At the onset of extrusion, the extruding cell detached from its neighbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4ef</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 11</xref>). Interestingly, despite the absence of E-cadherin junctions, a ring still formed in the neighboring cells and extrusion was completed. Thus, once the cell enters the extrusion process, cell-cell adhesion is necessary to form the basal myosin 2A ring in the extruding cell, but not in the neighbors. Together, these results suggest that the basal actomyosin network acts as a reservoir that sequesters the extrusion machinery until it dissolves.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Intact lamellipodia ensure successful extrusion by driving the formation of the extrusion ring</title><p id="P19">We next asked how the dissolved myosin 2A pool translocated to cell-cell junctions to form a ring. Cryptic lamellipodial protrusions were concomitant with the formation of the myosin 2A ring in the extruding cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) and with the emergence of myosin flows towards the cell-cell junction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 12</xref>). These observations led us to hypothesize that cryptic lamellipodia are implicated, through E-cadherin, in the translocation of basal myosin 2A to cell-cell junctions during extrusion, thereby enabling the formation of the contractile ring in the extruding cell.</p><p id="P20">To test this hypothesis, we pharmacologically inhibited the actin-branching Arp2/3 complex with CK-666 and examined the process of ring formation. In tissues treated with CK-666 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>), the dissolution of the myosin 2A meshwork occurred similarly to that in control cells, indicating that lamellipodia are not required for meshwork dissolution. Instead of accumulating myosin 2A at the outer edges of the extruding cell, however, the extruding cell often detached from its neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>, arrowheads, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 13</xref>), similar to what we observed when we blocked E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 11</xref>). In cells in which the ring-like structure formed, it was often unstable or incomplete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>) and failed to fully contract around the extruding cell. Extrusion success in CK-666 treatment became dependent on cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>): while smaller cells were still extruded efficiently, bigger ones detached and created a gap in the tissue (60% of all cells). In 30% of these cases, the cell gap continued to expand without closing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 13</xref>), resulting in failed extrusion and compromised tissue integrity. These results support that the interaction between cryptic lamellipodia and the overlaying extruding cells enables the formation of the ring in the extruding cell through a contact mechanism mediated by E-cadherin. This ring is dispensable for extrusion of small cells, which can be readily expelled from the tissue through forces generated by neighbors, but not for larger ones.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Lamellipodia act as symmetry-breakers establishing apical extrusion polarity in the villus</title><p id="P21">We finally sought to link structural changes in the extruding cell and its neighbors with the generation of traction forces during extrusion. A striking feature of our spatiotemporal traction maps is that the upwards traction under the extruding cell peaks when the myosin network is dissolved and focal adhesions are disassembled. This finding led us to hypothesize that, counterintuitively, upwards tractions are generated by neighbor lamellipodia. Treatment with CK-666 abolished the peak of vertical tractions under the extruding cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), indicating that indeed lamellipodia are responsible for exerting the strong pulling-up force during extrusion. The drop in upwards traction was significant in both signed values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>) and magnitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>), suggesting that it results not only from an increased fraction of cells reversing the direction of vertical traction, but also from a reduction in overall traction magnitude.</p><p id="P22">To understand how the decrease of vertical force upon lamellipodia inhibition impacts the extrusion process, we turned to canonical 3D organoids embedded in Matrigel. In these organoids, villus regions are curved, unlike in 2D organoids, albeit in the opposite direction to that <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>, yellow dashed line). When comparing control organoids with those treated with CK-666, we observed a striking difference in the intensity and localization of the basal myosin 2A during extrusion. In the control condition, myosin 2A concentrated at the basal-most plane of the extruding cell just before the cell started exiting the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref> DMSO, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 14</xref>). This myosin 2A accumulation constricted while following the extruding cell from the basal to the apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref> DMSO, arrowhead, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 14</xref>). By contrast, in CK-666, myosin 2A did not concentrate basally under the extruding cell, and no myosin followed the cell as it exited the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref> CK-666, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 15</xref>). These results indicate that lamellipodia are responsible for reorganizing the villus myosin 2A meshwork into the basal ring in the extruding cell, both in 2D and 3D intestinal organoids, and independently of tissue curvature. Strikingly, in 3D organoids, lamellipodia perturbation caused cells to stop extruding exclusively into the organoid lumen. Instead, they extruded apically and basally with equal probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 16</xref>). This shows that the lamellipodia-dependent basal myosin 2A ring is essential to set villus cell extrusion polarity. Together, these results show that lamellipodia are not only force generators but also symmetry breakers of intestinal cell extrusion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">In this study, we identified physical forces and cytoskeletal mechanisms driving cell extrusion in the mammalian intestinal epithelium. Using intestinal organoid sheets, we showed that the key event that initiates extrusion of intestinal villus cells is the sudden disruption of an actomyosin basal network and focal adhesions. Disruption is triggered by a calcium pulse and is followed by stretching of the extruding cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref> panel 1). This initial phase of tension relaxation is followed by the formation of new cytoskeletal structures in both the extruding cell and its neighbors: myosin 2A organizes in two contractile rings, one in the immediate neighbors and another in the extruding cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref> panel 2), while neighbor cells protrude cryptic lamellipodia under the extruding cell. Our data support that the formation and maintenance of these distinct structures are mechanically coupled though E-cadherin and actin retrograde flows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Throughout the extrusion process, cells generate an upwards-pointing traction force that requires myosin but is exerted by neighbor lamellipodia. This upwards traction under extruding cells is balanced by a downwards traction in the neighbors, producing a mechanical torque that can be loosely interpreted as neighboring cells ‘shoveling out’ the extruding cell. Finally, we showed that lamellipodia are not only generators of upwards pulling tractions, but also symmetry breakers, that determine whether cells will be extruded apically or basally.</p><p id="P24">Previous studies established the role of compressive stresses in triggering extrusion, arising from tissue crowding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, topological defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> or hypercontraction of the extruding cell itself (rev. in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>). In contrast, here we showed that in the intestinal epithelium, the initial phase of extrusion involves the expansion of the extruding cell, indicating that the tissue is under tension—not compression—and that part of this tension is released at extrusion onset through the dissolution of the basal actomyosin network. We also showed that curvature is not required to localize extrusion in the villus. Instead, our data suggest that the spatial distribution of myosin 2A is the main determinant of intestinal extrusion compartmentalization. Factors like crowding and curvature may enhance extrusion localization <italic>in vivo</italic>, particularly at the villus tip, driving the observed higher extrusion rates in this region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P25">Our finding that lamellipodia are key to generating the out-of-plane extrusion force opens new fundamental questions in epithelial mechanics. Lamellipodia have not previously been considered as out-of-plane force generators in epithelia, despite evidence that they can generate subcellular torques in single cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Future studies should therefore consider their contribution to 3D epithelial mechanics, not only in extrusion but also in other functions involving out-of-plane force generation. More broadly, our study raises the question of whether the new mechanisms identified here are a distinctive feature of the intestinal epithelium or a more general strategy employed by other tissues. Besides extruding, cells in the villus must also migrate, and we previously showed that this occurs under tension gradients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. It is therefore appealing to consider that the intestinal epithelium has evolved a specialized extrusion mechanism that is compatible with the tensile state characteristic of actively migrating tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Tissue tension thus emerges as a potential coordinator of different cellular functions, like extrusion and migration, in complex tissues composed of multiple cell types.
