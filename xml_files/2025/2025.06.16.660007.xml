We evaluated ALD delivery of mosaic-8b [60-mer nanoparticles presenting 8 different SARS-like betacoronavirus (sarbecovirus) receptor-binding domains (RBDs)] that elicits broadly cross-reactive antibodies and protects against mismatched sarbecoviruses not represented by RBDs on mosaic-8b. Compared with conventional prime-boost immunizations, ALD-delivered mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles elicited antibodies in both naïve and pre-vaccinated mice with improved mismatched binding and neutralization. Results of RBD epitope mapping of serum antibodies from ALD-delivered mosaic-8b were consistent with broader coverage of RBD epitopes compared to conventional immunizations, and systems serology revealed distinct IgG subclass and FcγR-binding IgG distributions. These results suggest that ALD is a promising technology for use with mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticle vaccines to protect against future sarbecovirus spillovers and support applications for ALD vaccine delivery to elicit cross-reactive antibodies against rapidly mutating or diverse pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Atomic Layer Deposition</kwd><kwd>Cross-reactive antibodies</kwd><kwd>Mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticle</kwd><kwd>Pulsatile release of antigen</kwd><kwd>RBD</kwd><kwd>Sarbecovirus</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>Vaccination</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Vaccine technologies have recently advanced, as evidenced by the introductions of lipid-nanoparticles (LNP) as delivery vehicles for mRNA antigens and concurrent delivery of multiple antigens on single recombinant protein platforms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> Despite the promise of these innovations, such formulations have barriers to widespread availability with respect to their storage conditions and the need for separate boosting doses for many antigens. We recently described a new protein vaccine technology that permits multiple prime-boost dosing with a single administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> This technology utilizes a highly scalable molecular deposition process (atomic layer deposition; ALD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>) to coat the surface of thermostable microparticles containing vaccine immunogens with precise numbers of molecular layers of alumina that not only serve as adjuvant, but can be modulated to release the antigen at pre-determined time points after immunization. This technology enables temporally separated primer and booster vaccine doses from a single administration when immunogens coated with different numbers of alumina layers (and therefore released at different time points) are mixed into a single formulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The sequential release of the vaccine immunogen from a single injection is hypothesized to guide the developing B cell response toward progressive development of high-affinity specific memory B cells rather than by boosting with subsequent injections. In addition, higher neutralizing antibody (Ab) titers with the coated preparations have been observed than can be achieved with multiple immunization regimens of conventional formulations, a result which we hypothesize is the result of Ab maturation reflecting a higher affinity for the antigen at later times.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (hereafter SARS-2) prompted the development of many new vaccines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> some or all of which potentially could be improved using ALD technology to broaden protection. We previously described a vaccine designed to protect against new SARS-2 variants and zoonotic SARS-like betacoronaviruses (sarbecoviruses) with spillover potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> that could be delivered as a single-dose ALD immunization. The vaccine candidate, mosaic-8b, involves simultaneous display of eight different sarbecovirus receptor-binding domains (RBDs) arranged randomly on 60-mer nanoparticles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B,C</xref>).</p><p id="P6">We hypothesized that mosaic RBD-nanoparticles would preferentially elicit cross-reactive Abs if B cell receptors (BCRs) on cross-reactive Ab-producing B cells are able to crosslink using both of their antigen-binding Fab arms between adjacent non-identical RBDs to recognize conserved epitopes, as compared with B cells presenting BCRs that bind to variable epitopes, which should only rarely crosslink between adjacent non-identical RBDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>; avidity hypothesis schematic). In contrast, homotypic RBD-nanoparticles presenting identical RBDs should predominantly bind BCRs that recognize immunodominant strain-specific epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). We obtained evidence for this hypothesis using deep mutational scanning (DMS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> to map epitopes recognized by IgGs in polyclonal antisera elicited by mosaic-8b versus homotypic SARS-2 RBD-nanoparticles: Abs from mosaic-8b antisera primarily targeted more conserved RBD epitopes, whereas Abs from homotypic antisera primarily targeted variable, and more accessible, epitopes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). When we evaluated responses against matched and mismatched viruses (i.e., represented or not represented by an RBD on the nanoparticle), we showed in animal models that mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles showed enhanced heterologous binding, neutralization, and protection from sarbecovirus challenges compared with homotypic (SARS-2 RBD only) nanoparticles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> Broader Ab responses elicited by mosaic-8b compared with homotypic RBD-nanoparticles were found in both naïve animals and in animals that had been pre-vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup></p><p id="P7">Here, we investigated whether improvements in vaccine-induced Ab responses using ALD pulsatile technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> also could be applied to delivery of mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles. When compared to conventional mosaic-8b immunization (i.e., separate prime and boost injections), we found that a single administration of ALD vaccine mosaic-8b preparations with different intervals of antigen release (ALD mix3 or ALD mix4) elicited significantly higher neutralization titers than conventional mosaic-8b immunization against difficult-to-neutralize mismatched viral strains in both originally naïve and in pre-vaccinated mice. In addition, ALD-elicited Abs showed differences in epitope recognition and in their relative proportions of IgG subclasses compared with non-ALD conventional prime and boost injections. Together, our results demonstrate the ability of ALD coating of mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles, and likely other broad-based vaccines, to improve the quality of elicited Abs by inducing broader neutralizing responses.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Production of ALD and non-ALD formulated versions of mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles</title><p id="P8">To generate mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles, we used the SpyCatcher-SpyTag system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> to covalently attach RBDs (SARS-2 Beta RBD and seven other sarbecovirus RBDs) with C-terminal SpyTag sequences to a SpyCatcher-mi3 60-mer protein nanoparticle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B,C</xref>).

Serum samples at 12- and 31-weeks post-prime were analyzed by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) and pseudovirus neutralization assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) to determine serum Ab binding and neutralization titers, respectively. The Ab ELISA binding data and neutralization results are presented in the form of line plots (ELISA) or box and whisker plots (neutralization) with determinations of statistically significant differences between cohorts evaluated using pairwise comparisons for each viral strain.</p><p id="P11">Mean ELISA binding titers (ED<sub>50</sub> values) for serum Ab binding to sarbecovirus RBDs were significantly higher for ALD mix3 and ALD mix4 when compared to titers for conventional mosaic-8b immunization at week 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, left). However, at week 31, titers for both ALD mix3 and ALD mix4 were significantly reduced compared with the conventional mosaic-8b mean ED<sub>50</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, right), suggesting lower durability of ALD-coated mosaic-8b nanoparticle immunizations compared with conventional mosaic-8b vaccination.</p><p id="P12">In vitro neutralization assays were performed for four mismatched pseudovirus strains: SARS-2 XBB.1.5, SARS-CoV (referred to here as SARS-1), BtKY72, and Khosta-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). These strains include (i) a hard-to-neutralize SARS-2 variant (XBB.1.5; RBD related to the WA1 RBD by 89% amino acid sequence identity), (ii) a clade 1a sarbecovirus that spilled over into humans (SARS-1; related by 74% sequence identity to the WA1 RBD), and (iii, iv) clade 3 animal sarbecoviruses (BtKY72 and Khosta-2; related by 73% and 68% sequence identities to WA1 RBD, respectively) with human spillover potential whose RBDs are more distantly related to the clade 1a, 1b, and 2 RBDs present on mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). At week 12, ALD mix3 samples showed significantly higher heterologous neutralization titers when compared to conventional mosaic-8b vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel) against XBB.1.5, SARS-1, and ALD mix4 immunization further showed significantly higher neutralization titers than conventional mosaic-8b vaccination for BtKy72 and Khosta-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel). Indeed, the mix3 and mix4 samples exhibited mean neutralization titers between 10<sup>2</sup> and 10<sup>4</sup> against all four viruses, whereas conventionally delivered mosaic-8b either showed weak (Khosta-2), undetectable (XBB.1.5), or 5-10–fold reduced mean neutralization titers (SARS-1 and BtKY72) compared with the ALD samples. Although ALD-delivered mosaic-8b continued to elicit significantly higher neutralization titers than conventional mosaic-8b immunization against matched (SARS-2 Beta, WIV1) and mismatched (both ALD mixes for SARS-2 XBB.1.5; ALD mix4 for SARS-2 KP.3 and Khosta-2) viral strains at week 16 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A,B</xref>), these differences were not significant at week 31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel), likely due to Ab contraction as observed for the ELISA ED<sub>50</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, right). The lower durability of the Ab responses to ALD-delivered mosaic-8b compared with conventional mosaic 8b immunizations could be a result of adjuvant differences (aluminum for ALD; Addavax for conventional). Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that pulsatile release of mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles through ALD coating resulted in improved breadth and potency of Ab responses, including the gain of neutralizing responses to heterologous strains, and an enhanced ability to generate broadly neutralizing serum Abs compared with the analogous vaccine delivered conventionally.</p><p id="P13">Immune imprinting, originally described for influenza virus infections, refers to preferential boosting of Ab responses against epitopes shared with the first strain of a variable immunogen to which an individual was originally exposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> To explore potential effects of imprinting on mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticle immunizations, we previously compared immune responses to mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles in animals with no previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 antigens (originally naïve animals) to responses in animals that had been pre-vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines presenting WA1 SARS-CoV-2 spike. This study showed that, in common with the originally naïve animals, pre-vaccinated cohorts also exhibited cross-reactive Ab binding and neutralizing properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> Here, we addressed whether prior exposure to a COVID-19 vaccine would affect the ability of ALD-coated mosaic-8b to elicit broader Ab responses by comparing ALD mix3 and ALD mix4 to conventional mosaic-8b immunizations in mice pre-vaccinated with two doses of an mRNA-LNP equivalent to Pfizer-BioNTech’s WA1 spike-encoding BNT162b2 vaccine. Twelve weeks after the second mRNA-LNP vaccine dose, pre-vaccinated mice were immunized with either a single dose of ALD mix3, ALD mix4, or SD antigens, or with two doses of mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In these pre-vaccinated mice, ALD mix3 and ALD mix4 immunizations elicited significantly higher mean Ab binding titers than either the conventional mosaic-8b or SD immunizations at both weeks 8 and 17 after immunization (23 and 32 weeks, respectively, after the first vaccine dose), with minimal Ab contraction between the two time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). At week 8 post-immunization, neutralization titers were higher for ALD mix4 when compared to SD against mismatched XBB.1.5 and SARS-1 viruses. At week 12 post-immunization, neutralization titers against SARS-2 D614G (RBD matched to the pre-vaccination strain) and SARS-2 Beta (matched to the SARS-2 Beta RBD on mosaic-8b) were roughly equivalent (mean ID<sub>50</sub> titers across the four immunization groups of ~10<sup>4</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C,D</xref>). However, significant improvements for ALD-delivered immunizations compared with conventional immunization were found for neutralization of mismatched (XBB.1.5, KP.3, and Khosta-2 strains) and for strains matched to mosaic-8b (WIV1 and SHC014) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>). By week 17, ALD mix3 and ALD mix4 showed significantly higher neutralizing titers than mosaic-8b immunization against mismatched strains (both ALD mixes for XBB.1.5 and SARS-1; ALD mix4 for BtKY72, and Khosta-2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, pulsatile release of mosaic-8b via ALD coating improved neutralizing Ab responses under conditions of immunological imprinting to the WA1 SARS-2 variant.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Epitope mapping using DMS revealed a polyclass Ab signature with ALD-delivered mosaic-8b immunization</title><p id="P14">We next investigated which RBD epitopes were targeted by Abs elicited by ALD delivery of mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles.

We used a SARS-2 Beta library for serum from the naïve and then mosaic-8b immunized animals, and a SARS-2 WA1 library for serum from animals vaccinated with an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine and then immunized with mosaic-8b to enable mapping of Ab responses against an RBD matched to the first exposure (SARS-2 Beta is a matched RBD for the originally naïve mice immunized with mosaic-8b; WA1 is a matched RBD for mice pre-vaccinated with WA1 spike-encoding mRNA-LNP). We also used SARS-2 XBB.1.5, SARS-1, and PRD-0038 RBD libraries to map Ab responses to mismatched strains, thereby accounting for DMS results potentially depending on which RBD library was used (e.g., any class 1 and class 2 anti-RBD Abs elicited by mosaic-8b would be unlikely to bind to XBB.1.5, SARS-1, or PRD00-38 RBDs and would therefore not be detected).</p><p id="P16">For immunizations of the originally naïve cohort, we found that conventional mosaic-8b elicited Abs that recognized class 4 and class 5 RBD epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), as indicated by escape profiles at residues within these epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A, S3</xref>).

To mimic potential use of mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles in humans, most of whom have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 through vaccination, infection, or both, we compared results from mice that were originally naïve to SARS-2 antigens prior to mosaic-8b immunization and from mice that had been pre-vaccinated with a prime-boost mRNA-based vaccine series prior to mosaic-8b immunization.</p><p id="P25">We found that two versions of ALD-formulated mosaic-8b (ALD mix3 and ALD mix4) both induced the broad Ab binding and neutralization properties observed for conventional mosaic-8b immunizations in mice and other animal models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> We found significantly higher mean binding titers from the ALD cohorts across a panel of eight sarbecovirus RBDs (seven of which were mismatched with respect to mosaic-8b) at week 12 after initial mosaic-8b immunizations compared with conventional mosaic-8b titers in mice that were originally naïve to sarbecovirus antigens. By week 31, however, mean binding titers for conventionally delivered mosaic-8b were significantly higher than titers induced by ALD delivery. The apparently decreased durability of the ALD-induced versus conventional delivery-induced responses to mosaic-8b might be improved by including an adjuvant. In fact, earlier studies of vaccines using human papilloma virus capsomere antigens formulated together with the aluminum hydroxide adjuvant Alhydrogel® inside ALD-coated microparticles showed no decreases in binding titers at the end of an 11-week study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> In addition, in contrast to the current study, IgG1 titers for an ALD-coated ovalbumin immunization and for a conventional immunization adjuvanted with the alumina-based Alhydrogel® showed similar rates of loss over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> In our studies, we note that mice that had been pre-vaccinated with a prime-boost series of an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, ALD mix3- and ALD mix4-induced binding responses remained higher than responses induced by conventional mosaic-8b delivery at both weeks 8 and 17 after initial mosaic-8b immunizations.</p><p id="P26">Demonstrating promise for using ALD to deliver mosaic-8b and potentially also vaccines against mutating pathogens in general, we found that ALD mix3 and ALD mix4 induced Abs that showed increased abilities to neutralize mismatched viruses. For example, week 12 serum from the originally naïve ALD cohorts neutralized the SARS-2 variant XBB.1.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> (15 of 16 mice in ALD mix3 and ALD mix4 cohorts with neutralization titers well above background), whereas week 12 serum from all mice in the conventionally immunized cohort (a time point after both prime and boost bolus immunizations) showed no detectable neutralization of XBB.1.5, whose RBD is related by 90% to the SARS-2 Beta RBD on mosaic-8b). ALD mix4 also showed improved neutralization of SARS-2 KP.3 at week 16 (the KP.3 RBD is related by 86% sequence identity to the SARS-2 Beta RBD on mosaic-8b). By week 31, neutralization titers from the ALD cohort sera had contracted such that only four of eight mice in the ALD mix3 cohort showed ID<sub>50</sub> values above 10<sup>2</sup> against XBB.1.5. At this time point, however, only one serum sample from the conventionally immunized cohort had an XBB.1.5 titer above 10<sup>2</sup>. Thus, ALD delivery of mosaic-8b improved elicited Ab neutralization of representative SARS-2 variants of concern. Neutralization titers against other mismatched sarbecoviruses (SARS-1, BtKY72, Khosta-2) also showed improvements for serum samples from the ALD cohorts. In these experiments, SARS-1 (a clade 1a sarbecovirus) represents an as-yet-unidentified virus that could spill over into humans, and BtKY72 and Khosta-2 are distantly-related clade 3 sarbecoviruses with RBDs sharing 62-75% (BtKY72) and 58-72% (Khosta-2) sequence identities with the clade 1a, clade 1b, and clade 2 RBDs present on mosaic-8b, again supporting the use of ALD delivery for mosaic-8b immunizations to elicit more broadly neutralizing Abs. Of relevance to humans with pre-existing immunity to SARS-2 antigens, conventionally delivered mosaic-8b in pre-vaccinated mice elicited higher neutralization titers than the counterpart immunizations in the originally naïve mice against the four mismatched sarbecoviruses, whereas ALD-delivered mosaic-8b elicited superior neutralization titers in nearly all mice. Taken together, the serum Ab binding and neutralization results suggest that ALD delivery of mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles would increase its already broadly cross-reactive Ab-eliciting properties, and as such, ALD technology could increase crossreactive responses elicited by vaccines against other mutating viruses, e.g., influenza and HIV-1.</p><p id="P27">Using DMS, we mapped the Ab epitopes targeted on four different RBDs in samples from the naïve cohort, one matched (SARS-2 Beta) and three mismatched (XBB.1.5, SARS-1, and PRD-0038), allowing identification of which epitope(s) are associated with better neutralization. ALD-delivered mosaic-8b, particularly ALD mix4, elicited a more polyclass profile (i.e., no clear features in DMS the DMS escape profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>) against three of the four strains (all except XBB.1.5) compared to conventionally delivered mosaic-8b. When escape was seen for ALD mix4 antisera, it was mostly represented by class 4 RBD responses (three of four mice for XBB.1.5 and one of four for SARS-1) with less class 5 (one of four for XBB.1.5), whereas conventionally delivered mosaic-8b elicited a mix of class 4 (three of four for XBB.1.5, three of four for SARS-1, one of four for PRD-0038) and class 5 (one of four for Beta, three of four for XBB.1.1.5, one of four for SARS-1, and one of four for PRD-0038). Altogether, the diminished escape elicited by ALD formulations of mosaic-8b suggested that they induced a more evenly distributed and/or less escapable anti-RBD response than conventionally delivered bolus injections of mosaic-8b. This more evenly distributed, or polyclass DMS response, could result from elicitation of Abs that recognize different RBD epitopes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> i.e., in this case, an equal mix of class 4 and class 5 anti-RBD Abs. Alternatively, or in combination with inducing polyclass Abs, ALD-coated mosaic-8b immunizations could induce higher affinity Abs that are more resistant to single RBD substitutions represented in the DMS libraries. The differences in neutralization potency elicited by ALD mix3 and ALD mix4 versus conventionally delivered mosaic-8b does not appear to be because of differential epitope targeting (all groups targeted polyclass or a mix of conserved class 4 and class 5 epitopes) but could rather depend on induction of either higher overall titers of Abs or higher affinity Abs targeting the same epitopes.</p><p id="P28">In the pre-vaccinated cohort, ALD-delivered mosaic-8b also elicited weaker escape or a more polyclass response compared to conventionally delivered mosaic-8b, again suggesting that the characteristics of the Abs are different between the groups. For conventionally delivered mosaic-8b the escape profile against XBB.1.5, SARS-1, and PRD-0038 showed stronger class 4 and class 5 escape than for mosaic-8b in the naïve cohort, likely due to the recall of mRNA LNP-elicited Abs in mosaic-8b boosted animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup></p><p id="P29">We also found intriguing differences in subclass and FcγR-binding properties for IgGs elicited by mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles delivered as conventional prime-boost bolus injections versus as pulsatile release from a single ALD immunization.

However, ALD mix3, ALD mix4, and conventional mosaic-8b immunizations exhibited similar levels of IgG2b, IgG3, and FcγR4-binding IgGs. This suggests that ALD-delivered mosaic-8b elicits Abs that can mediate stronger Fc effector functions (a correlate of protection against SARS-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>) against a wide panel of sarbecovirus strains. Similar to the naïve cohort results, ALD mix3 and ALD mix4 in pre-vaccinated animals showed significantly higher antigen-specific IgG1, and FcγR2b- and FcγR3-binding IgGs. By contrast, in the pre-vaccinated mice, the ALD mixes showed equivalent or sometimes lower IgG2a and IgG2b titers than conventional mosaic-8b, with ALD-mix4 exhibiting significantly higher FcγR4-binding IgG titers. Interestingly, ALD mix3 and ALD mix4 immunization in pre-vaccinated mice induced significantly higher IgG3 levels. Mouse IgG3, in common with human IgG4 that increases in humans who received multiple COVID-19 vaccinations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> is a non-inflammatory IgG that does not bind detectably to FcγRs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. This could be related to the multiple pulses of antigen release for the ALD mix3 and ALD mix4 groups. Altogether, these results show that ALD mix3 and ALD mix4 exhibited high FcγR-binding IgG responses, especially in the pre-vaccinated cohort. These responses could likely be further improved by additional use of a Th1-inducing adjuvant that would boost IgG2a responses (e.g., adding a TLR4 agonist such as MPLA or a TLR7/8 agonist such as imiquimod<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>), and therefore higher FcγR4-binding responses, and perhaps improve durability of ALD-formulated vaccine responses.</p><p id="P30">In summary, ALD delivery of a vaccine candidate, mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles, improved elicitation of the broadly cross-reactive responses observed for this immunogen from conventional prime-boost bolus immunizations.
