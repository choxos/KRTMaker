Although most mechanisms controlling CDK activity are well understood, one class of proteins - the CDK regulatory subunit (CKS) proteins - remain highly enigmatic. There is no generally accepted consistent molecular or functional characterisation of CKS <italic>in vivo</italic>, despite being essential across eukaryotes and implicated in a range of cell cycle processes and cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Here, we provide a unifying framework for CKS function. We show in a single, genetically tractable system, the fission yeast, that CKS regulates the onset and progression of both S-phase and mitosis. We find that CKS modulates the phosphorylation of more than 200 CDK phosphosites <italic>in vivo</italic>, located on 133 substrate proteins. These are involved in diverse processes across the entire cell cycle, including DNA replication, chromosome condensation, the spindle assembly checkpoint, and the metaphase-anaphase transition. We demonstrate that CKS enhances CDK activity to drive phosphorylation of sites with low affinity for CDK. This acts both on specific substrates, likely by stabilizing CDK-substrate interactions, and through control of overall CDK activity, by regulating its interaction with Wee1 and Cdc25. Our findings establish CKS proteins as major multifaceted regulators of the cell cycle, operating through the global and local control of CDK activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs) phosphorylate hundreds of proteins to bring about the events of the eukaryotic cell cycle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.

However, the impacts of CKS proteins on global CDK substrate phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic>, on CDK regulation and on cell cycle control remain unknown.

Therefore, the essential functions of Suc1 are conserved between fission yeast, budding yeast and human CKS proteins.</p><p id="P5">To conditionally inactivate Suc1, we placed <italic>suc1</italic> under the control of a thiamine-repressible promoter. De-repressed expression resulted in two-fold overexpression relative to endogenous levels and delayed cell cycle progression as determined by increased length at cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). Promoter repression resulted in a decrease in Suc1 concentration over time, and this under-expression initially advanced cells into mitosis, consistent with dose-dependent modulation of cell cycle control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. However, cells continued cycling for a further 4 generations (12 h) before defects in cell cycle progression and viability became apparent, despite Suc1 levels falling to 10% of endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1c,d</xref>). We conclude that only a low level of Suc1 is required for cell viability, and that residual CKS levels from experimental approaches such as repressible promoters and siRNA knockdowns may still be sufficient for CKS function that is biologically significant.</p><p id="P6">To rapidly inactivate Suc1, we performed a targeted mutagenic screen based on an <italic>S. cerevisiae CKS1-ts38</italic> allele<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>) and isolated a temperature-sensitive mutant which was inviable at 36 °C, <italic>suc1(A32T, E35Y, M42T, N57D, L74H)</italic>, hereafter <italic>suc1<sup>ts</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Three mutated residues in <italic>suc1<sup>ts</sup></italic> lie close to the CDK-Suc1 binding interface, so we tested if Suc1 binding to CDK was compromised at the restrictive temperature. lmmunoprecipitation of Cdc2 (<italic>S. pombe</italic> CDK1) followed by mass spectrometry revealed a &gt;20-fold reduction in associated Suc1 in the <italic>suc1<sup>ts</sup></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, Supplementary Table 1). There were no changes in the association of Cdc2 with the cyclins, Cig1, Cig2 and Cdc13.

We detected 11,841 and 30,169 phosphosites in the G1/S and G2/M phosphoproteomic experiments respectively. This identified 45 phosphosites at G1/S and 351 at G2/M that we had previously determined to be CDK substrates (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, and unpublished data), and which increased in phosphorylation by at least 2-fold at these transitions in the <italic>suc1<sup>+</sup></italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>).

At G2/M, 18 % (63 sites) were strongly inhibited and another 41 % (143 sites) were partially inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b,d,f</xref>, Supplementary Table 3). In total, 221 CDK phosphosites (out of 390 non-redundant sites, 57 %) were Suc1-dependent, with 70 (18 %) being strongly Suc1-dependent. A further 12 sites at G1/S (27 %) were phosphorylated to greater than 1.5x wildtype levels, suggesting that the presence of Suc1 inhibits phosphorylation of these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,c,e</xref>). We conclude that around half of the CDK phosphosites detected <italic>in vivo</italic> are Suc1-dependent for full phosphorylation with about one fifth being highly dependent on Suc1.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Suc1-dependent substrates are involved in diverse cell cycle processes</title><p id="P9">The 221 Suc1-dependent phosphosites were found on 133 proteins, 53 of which contained highly Suc1-dependent phosphosites.

In combination these amount to 51 Suc1-dependent substrates that are directly implicated in progress through the cell cycle. Suc1-dependent substrates were associated with specific cell cycle GO annotations, including centromere localisation, spindle attachment and elongation, checkpoint signalling, the G2/M transition and DNA replication initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2i</xref>). We also identified individual Suc1-dependent substrates with well-defined cell cycle roles, including the DNA replication origin firing factor Drc1<sup>Sld2</sup>, the mitotic CDK activating phosphatase Cdc25, the condensin subunit Cut3<sup>Smc4</sup> and Cut2<sup>Securin</sup> required for chromosome condensation and sister chromatid separation respectively, and proteins involved in centrosome and kinetochore attachment and dynamics, including Bqt4, Plo1<sup>Polo</sup> and Pic1<sup>INCENP</sup>, Nsk1, Clp1<sup>Cdc14</sup> and Alp7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e,f</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Many of the diverse roles reported for CKS proteins can therefore be explained by their wide-ranging effects on the phosphorylation of CDK substrates involved in control and progression through the cell cycle.</p><p id="P11">CDK activates downstream mitotic kinases to drive the events of mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, so we also analysed the phosphorylation of putative substrates of the NlMA-related (Fin1), Polo-like (Plo1) and Aurora B (Ark1) kinases. We observed impaired phosphorylation of substrates conforming to the consensus motifs of these kinases, with the strongest effect on Polo kinase substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). This indicates that Suc1 enhances both direct CDK substrate phosphorylation, and the phosphorylation of downstream substrates by other mitotic kinases.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Suc1 is required for proper execution of S-phase and mitosis</title><p id="P12">Given the wide influence Suc1 has on CDK substrate phosphorylation we investigated the effects of Suc1 loss of function on progression through the cell cycle. Temperature-shift of asynchronous <italic>suc1<sup>ts</sup></italic> cells resulted in a range of cell cycle defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>), so we assessed the impact of <italic>suc1<sup>ts</sup></italic> on the G1/S and G2/M transitions individually. The G1/S transition and S-phase progression was monitored by DNA content analysis following release from G1 arrest via nitrogen starvation. In the <italic>suc1<sup>ts</sup></italic> mutant, there was a 55-60 min delay in the time taken to complete S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>), resulting from a 25 min delay in the time taken for cells to enter S-phase, and a 30 min increase in the average duration of S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>). These defects could result from inefficient origin firing given that Drc1<sup>Sld2</sup> phosphorylation is dependent on Suc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), and Drc1<sup>Sld2</sup> phosphorylation is required for initiation of DNA replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. We conclude that Suc1 affects both onset and progression through S-phase.</p><p id="P13">The G2/M transition was monitored using time-lapse microscopy of the CDK activity sensor synCut3-mCh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>). Wildtype cells exhibit a switch-like increase in CDK activity as a result of mitotic CDK activation at the G2/M transition, triggering synCut3 nuclear import (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). In the <italic>suc1<sup>ts</sup></italic> mutant ~15 % of cells never underwent this CDK activation and continued growing without importing synCut3 or initiating mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3d,e</xref>). The remaining cells displayed impaired CDK activation, with a 40 % reduction in peak sensor activity, and less switch-like CDK activation kinetics, taking three times longer than the wildtype to reach peak CDK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e-g</xref>). These cells also frequently became arrested in mitosis and exhibited defective nuclear segregation and subsequent bisection by the formation of one or multiple division septa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3a,d,e,f</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Suc1-dependent substrates at G2/M included proteins involved in centromere localisation, kinetochore attachment and spindle elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2i</xref>), so we investigated if the mitotic arrest phenotype of <italic>suc1<sup>ts</sup></italic> was due to Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. SAC signalling is inactivated in <italic>mad2</italic>Δ cells<sub>50</sub>, which reduced the accumulation of mitotically arrested cells after Suc1 inactivation by 50 % (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>). This indicates that loss of Suc1 function promotes SAC-mediated mitotic arrest in a significant fraction of cells. We conclude that Suc1 function is required both for mitotic onset and for multiple steps in mitosis, including involvement in the SAC.</p><p id="P15">To ensure the effects observed at G2/M were not confounded by defects earlier in the cell cycle, we synchronised cells in G2 with an ATP analogue-sensitive <italic>cdc2<sup>as</sup></italic> allele before inactivation of Suc1. In the absence of Suc1 function, progression through mitosis was either delayed or blocked, and a substantial fraction cells displayed chromosome segregation and septation defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3g</xref>). Overall these experiments demonstrate a direct role for Suc1 at G2/M and in mitosis.</p><p id="P16">We conclude that Suc1 has roles at the G1/S transition, in S-phase progression, in the activation of CDK at G2/M, and for mitotic progression. Therefore, the diversity of cell cycle phenotypes reported previously upon CKS inhibition has been recapitulated, but importantly, in a single model system. We propose that the changes in CDK substrate phosphorylation we have observed are responsible for these diverse cell cycle phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Suc1 drives phosphorylation of low affinity phosphosites by enhancing CDK activity</title><p id="P17">We next investigated the molecular basis of Suc1-dependent phosphorylation. No differences based on substrate sub-cellular localisation were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>), indicating that Suc1 targets substrates in all sub-cellular compartments. We also found no difference in the pairwise comparison of phosphorylation of sites on the same protein or sites on different proteins, demonstrating that Suc1-dependence is not determined at the level of the protein substrate, but rather individual phosphosites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We compared the amino acid sequence surrounding each phosphosite and found enrichment for alanine residues in the +1 position of Suc1-dependent sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). Although a +1 proline residue has been considered the minimal consensus sequence for CDK phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, CDK has been reported to phosphorylate non-proline directed sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, and several such non-canonical phosphosites have biological functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>.

To quantify this, we employed a metric based on the <italic>in vitro</italic> substrate specificity of human CDK1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, which used the relative phosphorylation of peptide arrays by purified kinases to determine amino acid “preference scores” for each position around a phosphosite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4e</xref>).

Our data also indicate that for a given phosphosite, different Cyclin-CDK complexes differ in their requirement for CKS, likely due to differences in CDK activity, since M-CDK is not dependent on Suc1 to drive a normal S-phase, but S-CDK is. Therefore, we propose that a conserved, general role of CKS proteins is to enhance CDK phosphorylation of intrinsically weak phosphosites.</p><p id="P29">Why should regulatory proteins such as CKS be required to drive phosphorylation of poor CDK substrates? One proposal has been that low affinity substrates may broaden the range of phosphorylation timings during the cell cycle, only becoming phosphorylated at very high CDK activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. However, we found no correlation between intrinsic phosphosite sensitivity and the timing of phosphorylation during the cell cycle. As an alternative, we propose that the requirement for CKS proteins is the result of CDK having hundreds of protein substrates which have disparate biochemical functions. Individual phosphosites may be evolutionarily constrained to maintain both affinity for the CDK active site and for binding other molecules necessary to perform their functions. CKS proteins could relax these constraints, allowing phosphorylation of sub-optimal sites, thus extending the number of proteins subject to CDK control. Docking to the hydrophobic patch or the phosphate-binding pocket of cyclins, perhaps in conjunction with CKS interactions, may also alleviate this constraint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. This principle would be particularly important for cell cycle control, given the number of events that require co-ordination and the complexity of their function.</p><p id="P30">How does CKS enhance the activity of the Cyclin-CDK complex to drive phosphorylation of weak phosphosites? Our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies demonstrated that Suc1 regulates the association of Cdc25 and Wee1 with CDK and the phosphorylation of Cdc25 and Polo kinase, promoting Cdc2-Y15 dephosphorylation and thus increasing global CDK activity. <italic>In vitro</italic> structural studies suggest that the binding of human CKS1 and CDC25A to CDK2 are mutually exclusive based on overlapping CDK interaction interfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>, indicating CKS may regulate CDC25C and CDK1 association in an analogous competitive manner.

The association and dissociation of CKS therefore would provide a window for substrate phosphorylation, in which CDK is not subject to Cdc2-pY15 turnover by Cdc25 and Wee1, separating CDK catalysis and Y15 phospho-regulation in a CKS-dependent manner.</p><p id="P33">However, downregulation of CDK activity by Y15 phosphorylation does not explain all the effects of Suc1 inactivation on CDK substrate phosphorylation. Firstly, CKS-dependent CDK substrate phosphorylation also occurred at G1/S, where loss of Suc1 function does not impact Cdc2-Y15 phosphorylation. Secondly, the correlation between CKS dependence and intrinsic substrate sensitivity persists in our analysis of <italic>in vitro</italic> data which is not subject to regulation by Y15 phosphorylation.

We propose a variation on this, that CKS proteins enhance Cyclin-CDK activity towards specific substrates by stabilising their association with the CDK complex. This could involve binding to nearby phosphorylated residues given the essentiality of the CKS phosphate-binding pocket, and our finding of the enrichment of CKS-dependent and intrinsically weak phosphosites on multiply phosphorylated proteins.
