immune ejection. The intestinal nematode <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri</italic> (Hpb) secretes multiple families of immunomodulatory proteins, many of which are composed of consecutive Complement Control Protein (CCP) domains. We hypothesized that further CCP domain proteins are secreted by the parasite to interact with the host. We identified an unusually large number of CCP domain-containing proteins in the genome of Hpb, and cloned a range of these for screening in an Avidity-based Extracellular Interaction Screening (AVEXIS) assay, focussing on interactions with host immune proteins. This screen confirmed the binding of known immunomodulators (HpBARI, TGM1) for their targets (ST2, TGFBR2) and identified a new interaction between a 2 CCP domain Hpb protein and mouse resistin-like molecule beta (RELMβ), a host protein demonstrated to have anti-helminth properties. This protein was named Binder of RELMβ (HpBoRB). This interaction was confirmed in ELISA, competition assays, size exclusion chromatography and surface plasmon resonance experiments, identifying a subnanomolar affinity interaction between HpBoRB and RELMβ. These data may indicate that Hpb interferes with the potent anti-helminth host protein RELMβ and adds to our knowledge of the host-parasite interactions mediated by Hpb secreted proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Index Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri</italic></kwd><kwd>Complement Control Protein</kwd><kwd>immunomodulation</kwd><kwd>AVEXIS</kwd><kwd>protein-protein interaction</kwd><kwd>RELMβ</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Parasitic helminths are in an evolutionary arms race with their hosts. The host immune system has developed pathways for parasite ejection, while the parasite has co-evolved with its host to produce sophisticated modulators of the anti-parasite response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Fumagalli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Maizels et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Ryan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Colomb and McSorley, 2025</xref>). This interaction allows many parasites to form chronic infections in their hosts, inhibiting type 2 immune responses against them. As the immune system evolved in the context of constant parasite infection and consequent immunosuppression, the immune system is prone to hyperactive type 2 immune responses in the absence of regular parasite infections, resulting in an epidemic of allergic disease in the developed world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Lambrecht and Hammad, 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P3">In recent years, some of the molecular basis of this interaction has become clear, as multiple parasite-derived immunomodulatory proteins have been identified which modulate the host immune response to the parasite’s advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Everts et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Navarro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Johnston et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Osbourn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">de Los Reyes Jimenez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Vacca et al., 2020</xref>). These proteins are of interest due to their potential as treatments for allergic diseases such as asthma, and as vaccine candidates to prevent parasitic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Nisbet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bancroft et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Berkachy et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Smyth et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p id="P4">One of the parasitic nematodes that has received the most interest as a modulator of host immunity is <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri</italic> (Hpb). The secretions of Hpb contain multiple families of immunoregulatory proteins including the HpARIs, which bind to IL-33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Osbourn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Colomb et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Colomb et al., 2024b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Jamwal et al., 2024</xref>), the HpBARIs, which bind to the IL-33 receptor ST2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Vacca et al., 2020</xref>), and the TGMs, which bind to the TGFβ receptor and cell-specific coreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Johnston et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Smyth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">White et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">van Dinther et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Maizels et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Singh et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">White et al., 2025</xref>). These 3 families of proteins each contain 3-10 family members (3 HpARIs, 3 HpBARIs and 10 TGMs), and are structurally related to each other: each contain an N-terminal signal peptide followed by a string of consecutive atypical and nonidentical complement control protein (CCP) domains. CCP domains are present in many host and parasite proteins and are characterized by conserved sequence and structural elements, including 4 conserved cysteines per CCP domain. These conserved cysteines form disulphide bonds to stabilise the globular structure of the domain, consisting of 3 to 4 (β-sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Jamwal et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P5">We hypothesized that further host-parasite interactions could be mediated by Hpb CCP domain-containing proteins, therefore we assembled a complete list of proteins containing these domains in Hpb and other parasitic and free-living helminths, and confirmed that Hpb has dramatically expanded a family of CCP domain-containing proteins. We expressed a range of these Hpb CCP domain proteins and used an avidity-based extracellular interaction screening (AVEXIS) assay to identify Binder of RELMβ (HpBoRB), a secreted protein consisting of 2 CCP domains, which binds to host RELMβ. RELMβ is an effector molecule involved in the ejection of helminth parasites, and mice deficient in RELMβ are more susceptible to several intestinal nematodes, including Hpb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Herbert et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, HpBoRB may represent part of the immunomodulatory armoury of Hpb.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Helminth genome analysis for secretory CCP domain superfamily proteins</title><p id="P6">All helminth genomic data were retrieved from WormBase ParaSite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Howe et al., 2017</xref>).

Hpb contains 69 proteins with these characteristics, by far the largest number of any helminth species assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

All further data from the AVEXIS assay can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>.</p><p id="P22">As Hp_I17476_IG09420_L907 weakly bound to two unrelated surface cytokine receptors (the IL-1 family receptor IL1RAcP and the type I cytokine receptor IL-7Rα), both of which bind to multiple ligands, we decided to focus on the interaction between HPOL_0001072601 and RELMβ. HPOL_0001072601 was renamed as Binder of RELM (HpBoRB).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><label>3.3</label><title>HpBoRB sequence, structure and expression</title><p id="P23">The HpBoRB sequence contains 2 CCP domains (each with 4 cysteine residues and a tryptophan between C<sub>III</sub> and C<sub>IV</sub>), which is consistent with an Alphafold 3 model showing the CCP domains containing characteristic β-sheets and globular structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). A recently-published transcriptomic dataset from Hpb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Pollo et al., 2023</xref>) was used to show that HpBoRB transcription peaks in the first week of infection, while HpBoRB protein can be detected in L4, but not adult excretory/secretory products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Hewitson et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). These data indicate that HpBoRB is a 2 CCP domain protein which is expressed in tissue-dwelling L4 Hpb larvae, and not later in infection.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><label>3.4</label><title>Confirmation and validation of HpBoRB as a binder of RELMβ</title><p id="P24">To confirm binding, HpBoRB and RELMβ were subcloned into new expression vectors and purified by NTA chromatography. HpBoRB was cloned into a pSecTAG2A expression vector, while RELMβ was subcloned into the AVEXIS bait vector. When RELMβ bait was coated onto an ELISA plate, it could be bound by HpBoRB, but not a control protein (HpApyMut2, an Hpb apyrase enzyme which was mutated to ablate enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Berkachy et al., 2021</xref>)) expressed in the same vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). As the RELMβ AVEXIS bait construct includes a TEV cleavage site between the rat CD4d3+4 tag and the RELMβ sequence, TEV cleavage could be used to cleave off the rat CD4d3+4 tag, which could then be purified as a control protein. Unfortunately, without the N-terminal rat CD4d3+4 solubilisation tag, tag-free RELMβ protein precipitated and could not be used for further assays. When purified HpBoRB was coated onto an ELISA plate, it interacted with RELMβ bait protein, but not the cleaved CD4 tag control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Finally, the interaction between streptavidin-coated plate-bound biotinylated HpBoRB bait and RELMβ prey could be inhibited by competition with non-biotinylated HpBoRB protein, but not a control of non-biotinylated HpBARI protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). These experiments confirmed the specificity of binding between HpBoRB and RELMβ, with interactions which reach saturation and indicated a subnanomolar affinity.</p><p id="P25">To further validate the interaction between HpBoRB and RELMβ in solution, HpBoRB, RELMβ, or a mixture of the two proteins were applied to a size exclusion chromatography column. A peak shift could be seen when proteins were allowed to interact, which indicated that a larger molecular mass HpBoRB-RELMβ complex was forming in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Finally, surface plasmon resonance was used to measure the affinity of HpBoRB-RELMβ binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Purified HpBoRB was passed over a chip coated with monobiotinylated RELMβ. HpBoRB-RELMβ binding showed a rapid on-rate and a slow off-rate, indicating a high affinity interaction with a K<sub>D</sub> of &lt;0.1 nM, and fit a 1:1 binding model. Therefore, this data confirms that HpBoRB interacts with RELMβ with high affinity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="discussion"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">Parasitic helminths have an armoury of secreted proteins which they use to modulate the host immune system. Apparently uniquely, Hpb has expanded the CCP domain-containing family of proteins to act on a range of immune pathways: we show that the CCP domain-containing family is expanded in Hpb, but not in any other parasitic or free-living helminth yet characterised. This CCP domain-containing family contains the HpARI, HpBARI and TGM protein families (each with their own immunomodulatory activities), and we now show that it also contains a novel CCP domain-containing protein, HpBoRB, which binds to host RELMβ with high affinity.</p><p id="P28">Although this study did not assess the functional consequences of HpBoRB-RELMβ interactions, it is reasonable to hypothesise that HpBoRB may inhibit the activity of RELMβ. RELMβ is a member of the resistin-like molecule family of proteins (which contains resistin, RELMα, RELMβ and RELMγ), which have varied effects against bacterial and helminth infections, in metabolism, and on immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Pine et al., 2018</xref>). RELMα and RELMβ are particularly strongly upregulated in type 2 immune responses, in helminth infections and asthma, however their mode of action is not well understood as no host receptor has yet been identified for either protein. However, RELMβ-deficient mice show defective clearance of several helminth infections (including Hpb), while treating adult Hpb parasites in vitro with recombinant RELMβ resulted in these worms being more rapidly ejected when transplanted to a new host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Herbert et al., 2009</xref>). Recently, RELMβ-deficient mice were found to be protected from anaphylactic reactions in food allergy models, via interactions with the intestinal microbiota and consequent reduced regulatory T cell expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Stephen-Victor et al., 2025</xref>). Critically, RELMβ expression was shown to reduce levels of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Alistipes</italic> commensal bacteria, both of which produce indole metabolites and consequently induce regulatory T cell expansion. Thus, in RELMβ-deficient mice, or with anti-RELMβ antibody administration, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Alistipes</italic> levels increase, regulatory T cells expand, and allergic immune responses are suppressed. Consistent with these observations, and our hypothesis that HpBoRB inhibits RELMβ, Hpb infection increases the abundance of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> during infection, which is associated with increased regulatory T cell expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Reynolds et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, through blocking both direct and indirect effects on the parasite of RELMβ, HpBoRB could aid in Hpb survival.</p><p id="P29">HpBoRB is expressed at highest levels in the tissue-dwelling larvae stage of infection (prior to day 10 of infection), similarly to the peak expression and activity of HpARI and HpBARI family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Pollo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Smyth et al., 2025</xref>). Thus, this phase of infection may represent a peak of immunomodulatory activity of the parasite, inhibiting the later development of anti-parasitic responses. Recently, we showed that using a vaccination approach to block immunomodulation by HpARI and HpBARI in the early phase of infection resulted in much increased type 2 responses and effective immunity to the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Smyth et al., 2025</xref>). It will be interesting to investigate the effects of blocking HpBoRB in this context.</p><p id="P30">The AVEXIS protein-protein interaction screen was limited to those immune proteins selected for cloning and expression. There may be many further interactions between these parasite secreted proteins and host partner proteins which were not included in this version of the screen. Furthermore, while the CCP domain-containing family contains a number of important immunomodulators, immunomodulation is not exclusive to this family. Recently, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in Hpb secretions was shown to control type 2 immune responses through the induction of PGE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">de Los Reyes Jimenez et al., 2020</xref>). In mammals, GDH is a metabolic enzyme, involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, however in Hpb (and other helminths) this enzyme has been coopted as an immunoregulatory factor. Similarly, apyrases (extracellular ATPases) are secreted by many parasites, including Hpb, and are thought to degrade ATP, a potent extracellular damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Berkachy et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, several intestinal nematodes, including <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic> and Hpb, secrete type II DNAses to degrade neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bouchery et al., 2020</xref>). As GDH, apyrases and secreted DNAses are not CCP domain proteins, but are instead enzymes which have been co-opted for immune modulation and evasion, these seem to be a separate class of host-pathogen interaction proteins, which would not have been detected by our approach.</p><p id="P31">In summary, Hpb secretes an extraordinarily large family of CCP domain-containing proteins, which have already been shown to contain two independent sets of immunomodulators. Testing the hypothesis that additional immunological functions have evolved among other members of this family, and by using a sophisticated protein-protein interaction screen, we identified HpBoRB, a novel Hpb protein which binds to RELMβ, a known player in the anti-parasite type 2 immune response which is required to eliminate helminth infection. Our future studies will investigate the role of HpBoRB in vivo, and extend our search within the CCP gene family of helminth species to fully understand their scope in modulation of the immune system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS206116-supplement-Supplementary_figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d38aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary table</label><media xlink:href="EMS206116-supplement-Supplementary_table.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d38aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by a grant from LONGFONDS | Accelerate as part of the AWWA project, and a Wellcome Investigator award (221914/Z/20/Z) to H.J.M.
