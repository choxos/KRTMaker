Whether the causes for this performance unreliability are due to fundamental constraints on the predictability of protein yields, or whether they stem from differences in theoretical approaches, is unknown. Here, we performed a comparative analysis to address this question. We assessed the performance of twelve different optimization approaches at enhancing expression of a sequence encoding a cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase. Six approaches stemmed from commercial providers and six from freely available sources. Through analysis of their elongation time profiles and multidimensional scaling we assessed which algorithms follow a unique optimization approach. We found that codon-optimized sequences are, on average, capable to raise protein expression levels with respect to the nonoptimised source sequence. However, variation in the protein expression levels was large. Simple, non-proprietary optimization techniques were capable of achieving protein expression levels that fall within the top expression range amongst candidate sequences. Lastly, we found that negative epistasis influences a sequence’s protein expression level. Since therefore the protein expression landscape arising from synonymous sequence space must exhibit a non-negligible degree of ruggedness, standard approaches will be limited in their capacity to predict protein expression levels of sequences.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The increasing demand for high-yield proteins in therapeutic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], industrial, and research settings drives the need to harness their expression at significant scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. A prominent strategy in this domain is heterologous expression, where a protein native to a particular ‘origin’ organism is produced in a ‘target’ organism that can more easily be scaled for mass production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Heterologous expression approaches face significant challenges. Genomic sequences from one organism have evolved over large time spans, and have been tailored by evolution to match the unique genomic environment of their host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Such sequences are replete with modifications that reflect the past environmental pressures faced by the source organism. Given the great energetic costs imposed on the organism by translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], sequences are expected to reflect, in particular, selection for cost efficient translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Translocating these sequences into a different host organism introduces them to a foreign genomic landscape, characterized by new and different translational features. Thus, selectively beneficial changes acquired in the source context might turn maladaptive in the new target environment, jeopardizing yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p><p id="P4">A common approach to mitigate these risks is <italic>codon optimization,</italic> a method that alters the source sequence composition via synonymous substitutions, thereby preserving the order of amino acids that it encodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Different codon optimization approaches and algorithms are currently made available –especially for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>– by a variety of commercial providers of transgenic DNA products as well as open-source software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. However, the reliability if these algorithms is generally poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and the source codes of many of the algorithms in use remain undisclosed, complicating a comprehensive assessment of current-level capacities to predict protein expression yield for a sequence.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we investigated the performance of six current codon optimization techniques by commercial providers as well as six non-proprietary optimization algorithms for the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> gene CAD5 (AtCAD5), which we heterologously expressed in two strains of <italic>E. coli,</italic> BL21(DE3) and K12(DE3). Our study is divided in three parts. First, a characterization of the sequences themselves and their inter-relationships according to the optimization approach employed. Second, the description of the protein expression features of these sequences. And third, we combine the information of these two assessments to test for the presence of epistasic effects in protein expression.</p><p id="P6">We conclude that the observed variability in the expression levels attained may partly be explained by the inherent ruggedness present in the protein expression profile of the synonymous sequence of the AtCAD5 sequence.

AtCAD5 encodes a catalytically active cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, a protein class which is expected to express well in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In plants, it is involved in and acts upstream of the lignin biosynthetic process (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table II</xref> for references and details), which has received increasing attention for its potential to sequester carbon and thus mitigate the effects of global warming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Two splice variants are known, of which we chose AT4G34230.1, the longer variant, whose coding sequence contains 357 codons.</p><p id="P8">These 22 synonomous sequences were optimized by either proprietary software, open-source algorithms or by algorithms developed at the Institute of Computational Life Sciences (ICLS) in Wädenswil. In the proprietary subset, we used optimization algorithms from <italic>Twist Bioscience,</italic> the <italic>GENEius</italic> algorithm by <italic>Eurofins Scientific SE, Genscript Biotech, NovoPro Bioscience, GeneWiz</italic> from <italic>Azenta Life Sciences</italic> and <italic>Integrated DNA Technologies</italic> (IDT) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Materials and Methods</xref> for overview and Supporting Information for detailed sequence description). Three sequences were produced by opensource algorithms: One sequence was optimized using the package <italic>GeneGA</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] within the Bioconductor package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], one with JCat (Java Codon Adaptation Tool) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], and one with the use of the AnaCoda package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>].</p><p id="P9">Another three sequences were optimized by algorithms developed at the Institute of Computational Life Sciences at ZHAW. The rationale behind the development of our own optimization strategy was based on the notion that indiscriminately pruning sequences from translationally inefficient codons can jeopardize the stability of the translational and folding processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Where these codons are preserved by purifying selection, they are likely supporting a key function for the organism, and should therefore be retained. To implement this idea, three approaches were developed: A <italic>mirrored</italic> approach, where codon efficiencies in the host sequence are matched to the codon efficiencies of the source sequence. In a second approach, termed <italic>mirrored and restricted</italic> the sequence is additionally pruned of a predefined set of restriction sites. In a third approachwe replaced the most inefficient codons from the <italic>mirrored and restricted</italic> sequences with the second-most inefficient codons, giving rise to the <italic>mirrored and capped</italic> sequence candidate. A summary of the set of sequences used and the references to their design algorithms is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table III</xref>.</p><p id="P10">All sequences were designed with a C-terminal tag that consists of 30 codons that encode for a linker and GFP11 (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information</xref>). The tag is used for a Split-GFP assay where it complements to an intact GFP upon addition of the detector fragment GFP1-10, resulting in fluorescence that is proportional to the amount of the expressed protein, thereby allowing quantification of the expressed protein.</p><p id="P11">The optimized sequences display variation in the number of synonymous changes made. Relative to the wildtype, the sequences from Twist Bioscience show the largest number of point substitutions, with about 35% of the original sequence altered. These substitutions translate to about 92-94% of codons changed. The rest of the optimization algorithms result in smaller modifications. About 22-26% of the sequence is altered by point substitutions by the rest of the optimizers, corresponding to 60-67% of codons changed. Thus, sequences optimized by Twist Bioscience are unique in the amount of modification they undergo.</p><p id="P12">Prior to analyzing the expression features of these sequences, we first investigated how they differ in their efficiency profile, and second, how they are distributed in sequence space.</p><p id="P13"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the local elongation time profiles of all optimized sequences for three different sets of codon-specific elongation time estimates, all inferred via distinct theoretical approaches. The first set of elongation time estimates was inferred from genome and protein expression rate data with the AnaCoda package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). A second set of estimates was inferred from ribosome occupancy data by Rudorf et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The third set was inferred from tRNA abundance data by Shah and Gilchrist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Materials and Methods</xref> for detailed descriptions). For all three sets of elongation time estimates, the vast majority of approaches for codon optimization decrease the average time of translation relative to the original wildtype sequence, or equivalently, raise the average translational rate per codon.</p><p id="P14">The efficiency profiles of the optimized sequences reflect the different strategies used by the algorithms. All open-source based strategies follow an all-optimal codons approach, but with differences in the identity of the optimal codons. The exception are the ICLS-based sequences, which duefully replicate local elongation time patterns of the wild-type. In contrast to the open-source algorithms, proprietary algorithms do not solely follow an all-optimal codons strategy, as evidenced by their deviation from the AnaCoda and JCat sequences, which in fact do follow such a strategy. Instead, maximum efficiency codons are frequently traded off for codons that optimize other, undisclosed features - most likely features linked to the probability of obtaining viable protein. The wildtype sequence has among the highest average elongation times of all sequences –in line with expectation– together with some instances of the ICLS-based sequences.</p><p id="P15">We proceeded to utilize these efficiency profiles to characterize the inter-sequence relationships among the optimized sequences via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P16"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows the MDS of all the optimized sequences computed with the elongation time (for AnaCoda-based data, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) and elongation rate (for Shah and Rudorf data, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B and C</xref>) profiles of these sequences as derived from all three codon-specific elongation time data sets. Additionally, panel D shows the MDS derived from the Hamming distance as a similarity metric. The different codon-specific elongation time data sets give rise to qualitatively similar graphs. Sequences produced by the same algorithm tend to cluster together for all three data sets. The ICLS-based sequences, the Twist sequences and the wildtype produce isolated clusters, indicating idiosyncratic underlying design principles. The non-proprietary sequences are found at the periphery of the graphs, nearby a larger cluster of the rest of the sequences in which boundaries between algorithms are more fluid.</p><p id="P17">The distinctions discernible among algorithms are much more pronounced when Hamming distances are taken as the similarity metric. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, most sequences are spread out along a line stretching from position (0,-100) to about (0,40). Single sequence clusters by the same algorithm remain discernible, but the clusters increasingly overlap for sequences close to position (0,-100). This suggests that the sequences’ positions relative to the wildtype in sequence space may be approximated as being spread out along a particular axis. Across all MDS outputs, no clear trend for increasing protein expression is identifiable along any direction.</p><p id="P18">These results suggest that the commercial providers do deploy optimization algorithms that give rise to distinct sequence types, but that these differences diminish in importance if elongation time or rate similarity metrics are adopted.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Protein expression levels of codon-optimized <italic>AtCAD5</italic> sequences</title><p id="P19">Next, we assessed by how much the optimized sequences were able to raise protein expression levels relative to wildtype. To this end, all optimized sequence variants were expressed in BL21(DE3), a standard <italic>E. coli</italic> strain for biotechnological protein expression. To investigate the transferability of the findings to other strains, a subset of sequences was also expressed in K12(DE3), another standard research strain (from here on we term the strains BL21 and K12, respectively). To assess expression levels, a Split-GFP assay was performed, and relative protein amounts were determined by fluorescence signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. For each optimized sequence, a total of eight replicates (two quadruplicates) were generated to measure fluorescence. Additionally, activity was determined in enzymatic assays using cinnamyl aldehyde as substrate.</p><p id="P20">The optimization methods reliably generate high-expression products (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). For the BL21 strain, 95.5% of the optimized sequence replicates exceed the mean wildtype expression level. Only the <italic>mirrored and capped</italic>-strategy designed by the ICLS attains overall inferior expression levels than the wildtype. In the K12 strain, 91.3% of the replicates exceed the mean of the K12-wildtype. Here, it is one of the <italic>Twist</italic> sequences that yields lower average expression values than the wildtype. For the BL21(DE3) strain, the average fold increase over all optimized sequences was 1.61, whereas for K12 it is 1.96.</p><p id="P21"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> shows that the maximum mean fold increase of 1.95 for the BL21 is attained by the optimized sequence <italic>NovoPro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>],</italic> designed by the Novo-Pro Bioscience. For K12, the maximum expression is attained by the <italic>JCat</italic> sequence, with 1.85 mean fold increase. The <italic>mirrored and capped</italic> strategy for the BL21 strain displays exceptionally low protein expression levels.</p><p id="P22"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> reveals that for the BL21 strain, the intra-algorithm variation –that is, the variation in yield among sequences generated by the same algorithm– is generally small compared to the overall range of protein expression levels, as seen in the cases of NovoPro, IDT and Genscript, with the exception of the Twist-based sequences. For BL21, intra-algorithm variation is also larger in magnitude to intra-sequence variation –the variation in yield of eight replicates of the same sequence. Notably, all open-source algorithms reliably expressed very high protein levels, all close to the 33’000 AU from Novo-Pro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], the most highly expressed sequence on average. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> also reveals significant stochasticity among the eight replicates assessed per sequence, especially for the K12 strain, mostly arising from interquadruplicate variation.</p><p id="P23">To test for the presence of strain-specific effects on expression, we computed the correlation of BL21 and K12 expression levels, finding a correlation of 0.83. Linear regression between expression levels across the two strains yields an estimated slope of 0.7, where the null that the slope equals zero is rejected with p-value &lt; 0.001. This indicates that qualitatively as well as quantitatively, the expression characteristics of the sequences are very similar among the two strains.</p><p id="P24">The readouts from Split-GFP must be interpreted with care regarding functionality. Especially proteins at high expression levels are prone to improper folding and formation of inclusion bodies. To assess whether the expressed proteins are functional, we determined the enzymatic activity of the proteins generated by all sequences for BL21 and K12. To quantify the active enzyme, depletion of NADPH was monitored at A<sub>340nm</sub> (absorbtion at 340 nm) upon consumption of the substrate cinnamal aldehyde. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) shows that protein activity and expression levels are highly correlated across both strains BL21 and K12, with 0.8 overall correlation. Linear regression between expression and activity levels confirms the presence of a significant association with p-value &lt; 0.001. However, closer visual inspection suggests the presence of an activity plateau after about 20’000 AU. This indicates that above a specific expression level, protein folding might become impaired, resulting in a partially non-functional protein pool.</p><p id="P25">In conclusion, we find that proprietary as well as open-source algorithms are able to consistently raise protein expression levels relative to the wildtype, with the exception of the ICLS-based <italic>mirrored and capped</italic> sequence in the BL21 strain and the <italic>Twist</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] sequence in the K12 strain. We find that the Split-GFP assay is well-suited to capture the protein ex-pression landscape of the optimized sequences examined, with some limitations regarding assessment of protein functionality, and that this expression landscape retains its basic properties when expressed in a different <italic>E. coli</italic> strain. Our results however are also in line with previous observations that too high expression rates eventually result in non-functional protein presumably due to impaired protein folding, as shown in the enzymatic assays.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Evidence for negative epistatic effects among synonymous codons on protein expression levels</title><p id="P26">Next, we addressed the question of whether the contributions from individual loci to overall protein expression combine in an additive, noninteractive manner, or whether alternatively, codons contribute non-additively, that is, whether they interact epistatically. To this end, we combined relational information on sequences with information on their measured expression. The methods for testing epistasis in these combined data is taken from theory devised to study epistasis in the context of population genetics.</p><p id="P27">For the purposes of protein expression maximization, one relevant insight from epistasis research is that the presence of epistatic effects in protein expression impedes the prediction of the protein expression level of a sequence – whereas if epistasis is low or absent, only relatively small numbers of sequences have to be measured to provide accurate predictions for unobserved sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. This is due to epistasis giving rise to a rugged sequence-to-expression landscape, while the lack of epistasis gives rise to a gradually rising landscape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>].</p><p id="P28">Several methods have been proposed to assess the presence of epistasis in population genetics contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. One method, in particular, can be adapted to the data set of this study to address the question of whether codons in a sequence interact to affect the resulting protein expression level. The method is based on first determining a reference sequence, which is set to have zero log-fitness. This sequence is assumed to occupy a state of high fitness relative to its genomic surroundings. Log-fitness is then measured for sequences with deleterious mutations via regression, <disp-formula id="FD1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>·</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>·</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P29">where <italic>w</italic> is the organism fitness, <italic>n</italic> is the Hamming distance to the reference strain and <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> are regression coefficients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. A negative b coefficient is indicative of negative epistasis, while a positive value of <italic>b</italic> is interpreted as the presence of positive epistasis. Similar studies have been carried for relative short genomes in terms of log-fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].</p><p id="P30">Since selection operates on the phenotype of an organism, the fitness of an organism is typically thought to receive contributions from a variety of traits of the organism. If such trait –such as protein expression level– is closely linked to fitness, it may be interpreted as an intermediate feature from which fitness is derived –in particular if all other traits are held constant in an experimental setting. Therefore, the methods and logic utilized to investigate epistatic effects on fitness are also applicable to the trait itself.</p><p id="P31">Thus, to test for epistatic interactions in the generation of the trait of protein expression, we adapted this method to the specifics of our data set.

The JCat sequence stands out as the one sequence which produces very high expression levels in both BL21(DE3) and K12 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). As the JCat sequence is best performing sequence, the mutations that separate other sequences from it are assumed to exert a deleterious effect upon protein expression.</p><p id="P34">We utilized the Hamming distances computed for the multidimensional scaling computations between JCat and all other sequences to fit the regression formula (2) to the data. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> shows that the regression curve adopts a convex shape in both strains, BL21 an K12.</p><p id="P35">Fitting (2) on the combined data from BL21 and K12 yields a very strong statistical signal for a negative <italic>b</italic> value (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table I</xref>, generated with the <italic>stargazer</italic>-package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>] in R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]).

To address this issue, it is currently standard procedure to rely upon codon optimization, the synonymous modification of the original sequence to match the genomic and environmental features of the host organism.</p><p id="P39">Codon optimization is typically offered, free of charge, by most commercial sequence providers. The providers commonly claim that their optimization will –with high probability– result in functional protein at a high yield. However, comparative studies to examine these claims are scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p><p id="P40">The expectation that a model may be able to prediet which synonymous sequences will yield high expression levels with accuracy is hard to justify on the grounds of the current body of theory on the mechanisms of translation. How codon usage bias in particular influences expression is determined by how synonymous changes affect translation, which remains subject to intense research efforts.</p><p id="P41">In fact, a plethora of factors related to synonymous sequence structure have been found to exert significant influences on protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Examples include the presence of codon ramps at the 5’-end of the sequence, mRNA secondary structure, tRNA abundances, microorganismal growth rates, GC-content, codon usage bias and so forth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. These developments cast further doubts on the promise of accurate protein yield prediction from sequence information alone.</p><p id="P42">The predictive capability of any model aiming to derive protein expression levels from sequence structure relies on its capacity to capture the inherent features of a part of the genotype-phenotype map for that sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. The features of such a genotype-phenotype map are open to empirical study. These studies allow to ascertain whether the map displays features –for instance a pronounced inherent ruggedness– that preclude accurate prediction by means of standard approaches or not.</p><p id="P43">This study contributes to addressing this issue on three fronts. First, we validate that a main property of currently employed optimization algorithms is the reduction of total elongation time, or conversely, the increase of translational speed. We further represent our set of optimized sequences in via multidimensional scaling (MDS), and find that sequences of the same algorithm tend to cluster, confirming their common origin and high similarity. When using Hamming distances, MDS yields more pronounced algorithm-oriented clustering, indicating the presence of unique design principles. Second, we use a recently developed protein expression quantification technology, Split-GFP, for the purposes of genotype-phenotype map characterization on a protein that is not GFP itself. The technology yields measurements of high validity and reliability, as confirmed by further tests on the association of protein expression exhibited by two different <italic>E. coli</italic> strains. Third, we find that the synonymous genotype-to-phenotype landscape for protein expression is influenced by negative epistasis, and thus is very likely exhibiting ruggedness. This implies that fundamental limitations are imposed on the accuracy of protein expression prediction via naïve approaches by the nature of intra-sequence codon interactions. Thus, our results suggest that the study of the origin of epistatic effects on protein expression may help improve the predictive accuracy of protein expression models.</p><p id="P44">Our results come with a series of caveats. For instance, we have explored the expression landscape of a fraction of the possible synonymous sequences of a single heterologously expressed gene, AtCAD5. Whether the specific biochemical features of At-CAD5 or its protein product preclude the generalization of our results to other is hard to predict. However, most larger expression landscape studies of synonymous sequences focus on green fluorescent protein (GFP) only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Our study contributes to the investigation of the robustness of the GFP-derived conclusions by the exploration of another protein that is not GFP.</p><p id="P45">We also lack a firm explanation for the failure of a subset of sequences to attain similar expression levels as the rest of the sequences, notably the <italic>mirrored and capped</italic> sequence in BL2l(DE3), and the <italic>Twist</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] sequence for K12. One possible reason is the formation of dense aggregates of inclusion bodies upon high expression, which do not only affect protein activity, but also mask the GFP tag. The formation of fluorescent GFP entities would be hindered in such cases, rendering the Split-GFP assay incapable to detect such aggregates. Furthermore, such unexpected declines of protein expression below the original sequence’s level, are consistent with a rugged synonymous genotype-phenotype map. Ruggedness implies the presence of ”expression valleys”, that is, sequences or localized sequence clusters where expression suddenly falls off. The presence and location of such valleys is hard to pinpoint by means of codon usage bias theory alone.</p><p id="P46">Furthermore, the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> suggest a saturation of the activity of the expressed proteins with increased fluorescence. This suggests that increased production of the desired target protein does not necessarily lead to a corresponding amount of functional protein. This highlights an indirect problem that is encountered in biotechnological applications for optimal protein expression: apart from the DNA sequence itself, an optimization of the entire expression system and conditions is required.</p><p id="P47">A possible explanation for this plateauing behavior is that two of codons’ translationally relevant properties could be inversely correlated: more trans-lationally fast codons could be less accurate. Here, accuracy refers to several translational errors: amino acid misincorporation (missense errors) or more severe processivity errors, such as ribosomal drop-off [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. In such a scenario, the artificial increase of the efficacy of a sequence by means of codon optimization –that is, the enrichment of sequences with fast codons– would, as a side effect, imply the artificial accrual of inaccurate codons in the same sequence. This would ensure high numbers of protein, but the fraction of functional products would be diminished.</p><p id="P48">One strategy to counteract this problem has previously been introduced by the usage of a dual reporter system, that in addition to protein expression also reports the presence of falsely folded inclusion bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. This framework could by deployed to address these questions in a more precise manner.</p><p id="P49">A further concern relates to the sample of the sequences analyzed for the test for epistasis. The set of optimized sequences used was not randomly sampled around a well-known fitness optimum. Therefore, the tests performed for the detection of epistasis may be biased towards above-average expression, if the optimization algorithms were to possess the property that they are capable to raise protein expression with a minimum amount of synonymous changes. However, this does not appear to be a target of the optimization function, since often, the number of synonymous changes proposed by the algorithms range from a minimum of 200 synonymous changes to almost 350 changes - that is, given a sequence with a codon length of 360, almost every codon is exchanged in some instances. Furthermore, the test for epistasis does not explicitly state that the sampled sequences around the optimum must be sampled randomly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>].</p><p id="P50">A last caveat concerns the identity of the optimal sequence for protein expression in the investigation of epistasis. The test for epistasis assumes that the reference strain occupies a local or global optimum, such that all other sequences are separated from the reference sequence by mutations that add a deleterious effect to protein expression. Thus, the misidentification of the best expressing sequence could lead to biases that may affect the test, because if the true best performer sequences are close to the reference strain, a regression curve will have to curve downwards to capture this feature, leading to negative <italic>b</italic> coefficients. To address this issue, we ran several regressions on a subset of possible candidates for best performing sequences, always retrieving our original results. This indicates that the signal for the result stems from the expression characteristics of sequences that are at large Hamming distances from the reference sequences of in the candidate subset, and not the aforementioned possible statistical artefact.</p><p id="P51">Our results should be interpreted in the context of the broad body of evidence linking codon usage to protein expression and its use for codon optimization.

A possible mechanism for such epistasis was identified by Cannarozzi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>], which found that clusters of similar codons appear to enhance translation efficiency by facilitating the reusage of the same tRNA.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Similarly to the mirroring technique adopted here, the rationale behind codon harmonization is the conjecture that clusters of non-optimal codons serve the purpose of aiding the nascent protein to fold correctly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. To optimize the source sequence, they first established a set of codon usage frequencies for each amino acid residue in the source organism’s genome.

These levels were then normalized in such manner that the average expression level is one.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Codon-specific elongation rate data for E. coli</title><p id="P71">In this study, we used three different sets of codonspecific elongation rate data for E. <italic>coli.</italic> The first set was estimated by Shah and Gilchrist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] mostly on the basis of tRNA abundancies. They estimated cognate elongation rates of codons by combining gene copy numbers of cognate tRNA (as proxies for cognate tRNA abundances) and probabilities of elongation of near- and pseudo cognates. The table with the codon-specific elongation rate values (column <italic>R<sub>c</sub></italic>) was retrieved from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref> of the Supporting Information of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p><p id="P72">The second set of codon-specific elongation rates was derived from elongation time estimates. Proxies of elongation times were estimated via de AnaCoda package’s ribosomal overhead cost (ROC) model, which assumes that the selection coefficient of a synonymous sequence variant is directly proportional to the overall elongation time of the sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. To obtain a table of relative codon-specific elongation times, we ran AnaCoda’s ROC model on the full <italic>E. coli</italic> genome with normalized protein expression level data. The values in the table of estimates corresponds to codon-specific overhead costs, which are assumed to be proportional to the elongation time estimates for each codon. All the overhead costs within a synonymous codon family are given relative to the least costly codon within the family, which by default has a cost of zero.</p><p id="P73">A third data set by Rudorf and Lipowsky was estimated on the basis of ribosome occupancy data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. The authors employed a Markov model to infer codon-specific elongation rates under different sets specific bacterial growth rates, assuming a 2-1-2 pathway of tRNA release at the E site. Their estimates are found in the S2 Table of the Supporting Information of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].

This regression yielded estimates for both, codon-specific mutational biases as well as codon-specific biases in the cost of translation as would by inferred if these were the main targets of selection for synonymous codon change.</p><p id="P76">Under the ROC model, the cost of translation corresponds exactly to the sum of the elongation times of all codons of the sequence times a factor to convert these into selection coefficients. Thus, the codon-specific cost estimates from AnaCoda are directly proportional those codons’ elongation times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. As a caveat, the translational costs can only be computed relative to the least costly (that is, most time-effective or translationally fast) codon within a codon family for the same amino acid.</p><p id="P77">With these preparations, we proceeded to replace each codon of the AtCAD5 wildtype sequence with the optimal codon of its family as estimated under the ROC model. That is, each codon at every position was replaced by a codon that under the ROC model has a translational cost of zero, and thus the smallest elongation time within its codon family. Notably, the optimized sequence differs from other sequences optimized by other, more classical codon optimization algorithms. This is because for the amino acid threonine (T), AnaCoda identifies the codon ACT as optimal, while JCat identified the codon ACC as optimal.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Proprietary sequences of CAD5</title><p id="P78">To obtain codon optimized sequences from the commercial providers, we utilized the optimization algorithms freely available on the providers’ official websites. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table III</xref> gives a summary of the urls where these proprietary algorithms can be accessed.
